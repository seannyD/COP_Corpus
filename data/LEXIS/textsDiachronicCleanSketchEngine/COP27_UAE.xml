CAIRO, 9th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Vietnam reiterates its strong commitment to climate change response at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), which is taking place in Egypt. In an interview with the Vietnam News Agency (VNA), Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Tran Hong Ha, who leads the Vietnamese delegation to the event, said Vietnam and other countries at the conference will work to perfect mechanisms and policies to mobilise resources from developed nations for the implementation of the commitments. The resources should be allocated transparently and equally to developing and underdeveloped nations that are making efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change, the minister noted. He highlighted energy transition as a solution to climate change, on which Vietnam has set out a specific roadmap. "The Vietnamese government has issued a strategy on climate change and assigned specific tasks to ministries, agencies and localities," Ha added. Vietnam is working hard to materialise the commitments using its internal resources as well as the support from the international community, especially through mechanisms of the COP26 agreement reached in the UK last year. He said the Vietnamese delegation came to COP27 with three major tasks, one of which is to join other UNFCCC members to seek ways to realise the reached commitments and mechanisms, and raise new initiatives, mechanisms and policies to conduct energy transition firmly. The second task is upholding Vietnam's pioneering role in energy transition, green transition and digital transformation, and the third one is to mobilise resources and learn from developed partners' experience, and join more initiatives, especially those on financial mobilisation and energy transition. The delegation is scheduled to carry out many bilateral activities with international organisations and businesses relating to energy transition, and hold meetings with big financial institutions like the World Bank. COP27 as an opportunity for Vietnam to meet leading international organisations and financial institutions to discuss financial mechanisms and policies, and how to mobilise resources for Vietnam. Within the framework of COP27 , Vietnam will continue to hold discussions with partners from G7 and enlarged G7 over just energy transition for Vietnam and help for the country to utilise opportunities in preferential financing and technology transfer to fulfil its net-zero commitments. \</doc>

In his opening remarks that was attended by many dignitaries, HE Saeed Al Tayer recognised the success of the 'Tatawwar' programme, implemented by HSBC and Potential.com, which improved the lives of many young people in the MENA region. He praised the initiative for its capacity to provide young adults with access to knowledge, tools, and a path that will enable them to shift focus away from job seeking to job creation and build a more resilient future. "Tatawwar (the imperative form of the verb 'to develop'), accurately describes what the program has accomplished. Thanks to this initiative, youth have access to information, resources, and a pathway that will help them create a more resilient future by changing their perspective from one of job seekers to job creators, " said Al Tayer. "We are living at crossroads where the transition from education to work has become more prolonged and unpredictable. In fact, due to different and successive crises, many young people find themselves neither in employment nor in education and training. Therefore, it is our responsibility to equip our younger generation with entrepreneurship skills that will not only enable them to fulfil their ambitions but also foster a green way of development. Entrepreneurs and businesses will play an important role in striking a balance between economic growth and environmental protection, ensuring that everyone can access the opportunities of the green economy and build resilient communities. And platforms like "Tatawwar program" not only allow youngsters to acquire such entrepreneurial abilities but also create an optimism, they need to establish a future in a way that resonates with their ambitions and purpose. This is significant as it is our younger generations that will be the decision makers and drivers of economies in the future," Al Tayer added. "We feel that the MENA region has strong potential to provide significant solutions that will help many countries mitigate and adapt to climate change without compromising on their pace of development in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030. But for this, the young generation from the region will have to play a significant role not just as the future policy makers but entrepreneurs, who can generate solutions to the energy challenges and spur innovation. We at WGEO, are dedicated to facilitating the transition to a green economy on a global scale, but this will require cooperation and partnerships from all of us, particularly our younger generation," Al Tayer said. "As we look forward to creating a better future for us and our next generations, I would like to welcome global leaders and young people to be a part of this journey and promote successful green economic solutions that address today's economic and environmental needs, including achieving net-zero targets," Al Tayer concluded Source: Dubai Electricity & Water Authority [Category: Power, Events, ESG] \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 7th November, 2022 (WAM) - The 2022 edition of the WTO's World Trade Report presents new analysis and recommendations on how international trade and greater cooperation can amplify global efforts to address climate change and put the planet on a sustainable trajectory. The WTO's flagship publication, released on 7th November at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, also examines the consequences of climate change on trading patterns and future prosperity. "This report is being launched at the same time as COP27 . What I hope to see emerge there and elsewhere is a trade and investment facilitation pathway in support of a just transition to a low-carbon economy," Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who is participating in the climate summit, said in her foreword to the report. "The report argues that trade is a force for good for climate and part of the solution for achieving a low-carbon, resilient and just transition," she said. The Director-General will present the report at a high-level event for world leaders at COP27 on 8th November titled "Time to Act: Implementing Trade-Related Contributions to the Global Response to Climate Change." The report conveys four main messages: first, climate change is a major threat to future growth and prosperity due to potential productivity losses, production shortages, damaged transport infrastructure and supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, without significant reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, many countries are likely to find their comparative advantages changing, with agriculture, tourism and some manufacturing sectors particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. Second, trade is a force multiplier for countries' adaptation efforts in the face of climate disruptions, reducing costs of technologies and critical goods and services. In the longer-run, open international markets would help countries achieve necessary economic adjustment and resource reallocation. This is particularly relevant for the most vulnerable economies - least-developed countries, small-island developing states and landlocked developing countries. Third, trade can reduce the cost of mitigating climate change - by supporting the reduction or prevention of GHG emissions - and speed up the transition to a low-carbon economy and the creation of green jobs. WTO simulations presented in the report suggest that eliminating tariffs and reducing non-tariff measures on a subset of energy-related environmental goods could boost exports by 5 per cent by 2030, while the resulting increases in energy efficiency and renewable uptake would reduce global emissions by 0.6 per cent. Finally, the report emphasises that international cooperation on trade-related aspects of climate policy is vital for making climate actions more effective, and the low-carbon transition more just, minimizing trade frictions and investor uncertainty. The report shows that, without global cooperation on ambitious climate policies, the world will not achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. \</doc>

SHARJAH, 14th November, 2022 (WAM) -- BEEAH has announced the signing of the ZEV Declaration at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. Around 200 signatories to the declaration, initiated by the UK Presidency, are now setting a roadmap so that by 2040, all new van and car sales will be zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV). By signing the ZEV Declaration, BEEAH Group is taking definitive steps within its operations and is joining the call to action for governments, businesses, and organisations to rapidly accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles and achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Following the signing, Khaled Al Huraimel, Group CEO of BEEAH Group, said, "As a pioneer for sustainability in the Middle East, we have been committed to setting the pace for sustainable action. Through our businesses and innovations, we have demonstrated several models to advance net-zero emissions and zero-waste to landfill strategies. Now, as the first organisation in the UAE to sign the ZEV declaration, we hope to lead by example and showcase tangible business benefits to using emissions-free fleets for operations, combining electric and hydrogen fuel solutions." In line with the UAE's sustainability roadmap and the Net-Zero by 2050 strategic initiative, BEEAH Group has already made advancements to lower emissions across its businesses and projects. Within its holding group structure, one of BEEAH Group's major businesses is its waste collection and city cleaning business, BEEAH Tandeef. Its fleet of thousands of vehicles comprises electric models, which enable operations across the UAE, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, including in the city of Sharm El Sheikh where COP27 is being held. BEEAH Tandeef's services in Sharm El Sheikh began a few days prior to COP27 . A digitally enabled fleet, hundreds of innovative bins, as well as a large skilled workforce have been deployed to tourist hotspots, public spaces and residential areas in Sharm El Sheikh. Cleaning personnel and bins are also serving the Sharm El Sheikh International Convention Centre. Following the conference, BEEAH Tandeef will continue to deliver its services as part of a 10-year contract in the city. BEEAH Group has also placed the Middle East's largest order for fully electric Tesla Semis, which once developed, will be one of the fastest and safest freight trucks in the world. Through its green and autonomous mobility business, BEEAH Transport, the Group has been exploring next-generation innovation in sustainable mobility and testing models for smarter, emissions-free transport. "Zero-emissions vehicles will be essential to creating accessible, hyperconnected transport networks in the smart, sustainable cities of the future. Through BEEAH Transport, our dedicated business driven towards the green mobility transition, we will continue to drive the adoption of zero-emissions vehicles across industries, as well as solutions that support the need for green mobility infrastructure in the region," Al Huraimel added. The UK Presidency initiated the ZEV Declaration at COP26 in Glasgow last year and has since had many governments, companies, automobile manufacturers and fleet operators sign on to the pledge. Speaking on the development, Nigel Topping, UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP26, said: "BEEAH Group is our first Race to Zero signatory in the UAE to sign on to the ZEV Declaration, which is a critical development as countries in the Middle East region have high vehicle densities. By making the switch to zero-emission vehicles, BEEAH Group is taking a decisive step towards achieving the net-zero ambition and contributing to the local, regional, and global sustainability agenda. During COP27 , we expect that more governments and non-state actors in the Middle East will be inspired to act towards an emission-free mobility sector in the region." \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 16th November, 2022 (WAM) - The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) today. Through the partnership, the two parties agreed to exchange knowledge and collaborate on initiatives to accelerate widespread renewable energy adoption to mitigate climate change. Mr. Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA, and Mr. Abdalah Mokssit, IPCC Secretary, met at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh to sign the MoU. "We have all the tools we need to address the growing climate challenge," said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera. "The reliability and resilience of renewables in the face of mounting global crises should serve as clear motivating factors for governments to double down on the energy transition and accelerate renewable energy deployment. Clean energy is abundant, but time is not. IRENA's knowledge strongly builds on the valuable scientific work by the IPCC. I look forward to our continued close cooperation." "With current commitments, we are not on track to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C. But, with rapid and deeper emissions cuts through 2030, we can keep this goal within reach", said Abdalah Mokssit, the Secretary of IPCC. "Costs for some forms of renewable energy have fallen, use of renewables continues to rise and, in some countries and regions, electricity systems are already predominantly powered by renewables. We're confident this partnership will strategically contribute to the much-needed transformational change and to a faster and sweeping transition to renewables." According to IRENA's World Energy Transitions Outlook, avoiding the catastrophic consequences of 1.5\'b0C global warming requires a fundamental change in how energy is generated and consumed. Renewables are the most readily-available and cost-effective way to provide 90 per cent of all decarbonisation by 2050, but this requires tripling of currently installed renewable power capacity by 2030. Progress will depend on political will, well-targeted investments, and a mix of technologies, accompanied by policy packages to put them in place and optimise their economic and social impact. The signed MoU provides a framework for IRENA and IPCC to enhance understanding of the scientific basis of the risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. The two organisations will also work together to promote the widespread and increased adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy through dialogues, expert meetings and workshops in coordination with the relevant IPCC Working Groups/Task Force Bureau. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt, 17th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD & CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, and Chairman of the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO) highlighted in a keynote today how the organisation is driving effective measures and dialogues on climate action at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ). Al Tayer furthermore emphasised key and expected outcomes of the COPs, how the summit accelerates climate action and private sector engagement with emission reductions, and how capacity-building and knowledge-sharing can scale up corporate commitments to science-based emissions reduction targets aligned with the 1.5 pathway through the UN Global Compact Climate Ambition Accelerator Programme. The WGEO strives to better educate stakeholders on the effective measures required to achieve the collective net-zero goals. Ayman Ismail, Chairman of the GCN Egypt, delivered the session's opening remarks. Other prominent attendees included Ahmed Buti Al Muhairbi, Secretary-General of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy; Waleed Salman, Vice Chairman for WGEO and Chairman for the GCN UAE; Abdulrahim Sultan, Director-General of WGEO, along with CEOs of leading firms engaged in climate action. Al Tayer said in his speech, " COP27 is a key platform that allows global stakeholders to have their voices heard. It also provides a forum for global cooperation and joint action to devise game-changing and emissions-cutting measures that the climate crisis so desperately demands by creating practical opportunities for sustainable economic growth and promoting holistic multilateral cooperation. The participation of the policymakers, corporate sector, and experts in COPs plays an important role in shaping the global climate agenda and accelerating progress on the delivery of the Paris agreement through negotiations, capacity-building, knowledge-sharing and partnerships. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region plays a pivotal role in the effective implementation of climate action. Holding COP27 in Egypt, and COP28 in the UAE next year would provide the impetus to accelerate action against Climate change." "To further spearhead the transition towards a green economy, the UAE Cabinet, chaired by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, approved the UAE to join the Global Alliance for Green Economy, announced by the WGEO during the World Green Economy Summit in Dubai 2022 to play a pivotal role in promoting climate action, food security and resilient climate development. The organisation called for supporting this global alliance to accelerate the transition towards a green economy, achieve the goals of sustainable development and the implementation of the Paris Agreement by harnessing financing, technology, capacity building, and other factors that contribute to enabling the green economy. In support of the UAE's leadership in addressing climate change and the global climate agenda, the WGEO has established many strategic partnerships and initiatives to holistically address unprecedented climate change challenges, including hosting the UNFCCC-WGEO Regional Collaboration Centre for MENA and South Asia. Moreover, the WGEO received the Observer Member accreditation from the UNFCCC at COP26," Al Tayer added. "The UAE supports the global efforts aimed at addressing climate change by offering effective solutions to support low-carbon local sectors, implementing pioneering projects that support its future strategies and aspirations and building a successful model for a new green economy that can attain economic sustainability while preserving the environment for current and future generations. In line with the vision and directives of our wise leadership, the UAE has launched the UAE Net Zero strategic initiative 2050, the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, and the Dubai Net Zero Carbon Emissions Strategy 2050. These strategies aim to achieve net-zero emissions and provide 100 percent of the total power production capacity from clean energy sources by 2050. Furthermore, in 2022, the first-ever MENA Week was hosted by the UAE Government, represented by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE), the WGEO, and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), in collaboration with the UNFCCC, and accelerated the momentum towards COP 27 ," Al Tayer stated. "These feats are not possible without the active participation of all stakeholders. The latest climate policy landscape and the UAE's nomination to host key climate dialogues provide the private sector with significant opportunities to reshape how they operate and transform our business. As we look forward to creating a better future for us and the next generations, I would like to welcome global leaders and the corporate sector to be a part of this journey and promote successful green economic solutions that meet current and future economic and environmental needs, including achieving net-zero goals. On behalf of the WGEO, I would like to assert that we will continue to support the efforts to foster this net-zero transition and facilitate the collaboration between governments, the private sector, and the international community through our various initiatives," Al Tayer said in conclusion. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 17th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) shared key progress highlights of Abu Dhabi's Single-Use Plastic Policy during a panel discussion organised today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), being held in Egypt. The session showcased best practices regionally and internationally and helped foster cooperation possibilities for the UAE, which is taking several proactive measures to both reduce the reliance of single-use plastic and nurture a culture of sustainability. The Agency's "Single-Use Plastic" session was attended by stakeholders from EAD, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA), and 99Bridges. The speakers discussed how Abu Dhabi is leading the Single-Use Plastic Policy through EAD, as well as the international experience of GAIA, and the use of technology and innovation by 99Bridges. The delegations also expressed concern over the linkage between climate change and single-use plastics. The Agency was able to showcase its achievements to date since launching the policy in 2020, as well as key learnings from other significant players, while highlighting innovative solutions and the potential to develop further opportunities for collaboration. Abdulla Al Remeithi, Director of Integrated Environment Policy and Planning at EAD, said, "We might not think that there is a link between climate change, the focus of COP27 , and single-use plastic but there is. That is why we decided to host a session dedicated to single-use plastic at this prominent event. Single-use packaging is associated with material flow, production, distribution, consumption, and the end-of-life management such as waste treatment - and throughout this whole cycle emissions are released. Therefore, any change in the consumption of packaging material will undoubtedly have an adverse effect on the levels of emissions, which in turn can be a contributor towards mitigating climate change." "Global as well as local action is required to yield environmental benefits, economic circularity and the reduction of emissions. Throughout the process of implementing the Single-Use Plastic Policy in Abu Dhabi we have worked closely with partner organisations from all over the world to gain insight, share best practices, learn about new technologies, and innovative ideas to ensure we achieve our larger goal of reducing single-use plastic dependency and shifting towards more reusable alternative," he added. Al Remeithi explained, "On 1st June, 2022, we banned the sale of single-use plastic bags across major retailer outlets in Abu Dhabi, and we have seen tremendous success in the amount of bags saved, which will have a huge impact on our environment. In terms of figures the number of single-use plastic shopping bags has decreased dramatically by more than 90 percent, resulting in a daily reduction of half a million bags. This amounts to more than 85 million bags to date." For the future, EAD plans to follow up on the single-use plastic bags ban with a ban on Styrofoam in 2024. The Agency also plans to enhance product recovery, ensuring the Abu Dhabi government is free from single-use products and that innovative technologies are deployed to support the transition to greener alternatives. \</doc>

Accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy will require a change in incentives, new regulations and laws, shifts in behaviour, innovation, and unwavering leadership Ask two different climate experts at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt ( COP27 ) to characterize their feelings about the future, and you may get quite different answers. "We are seeing more progress than we ever imagined,&rdquo; says one, while the other laments that we are heading full-tilt like lemmings over the cliff. They can't both be right, can they? In fact, both have ample evidence on their side, and only by balancing the two perspectives will we muster the sense of urgency that the climate crisis requires. To inspire hope, the first expert might point out that the cost of solar energy has fallen by 99% since President Jimmy Carter put panels on the White House roof in 1979, and that 2022 is shaping up to be a record year for renewables. Sales of electric vehicles are growing so fast that the internal combustion engine is already in permanent decline. In Indonesia, the rate of primary forest loss has fallen for five years in a row, owing to an innovative partnership between the government, business, civil society, and technology experts. Moreover, nearly 100 countries &ndash; representing over 75% of global emissions &ndash; have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century. And the United States just made a massive down payment on its green future with the Inflation Reduction Act, which could mobilize an estimated $800 billion or more in climate-related investments. But lest we come to think that we are almost out of the woods, our gloomy expert would point out that with just 1.1&deg; Celsius of warming, climate change is already generating unprecedented costs. Disastrous flooding across Pakistan this summer left one-third of the country underwater, and southwestern North America is suffering its worst drought in 1,200 years. In China, drought has crippled hydroelectric power production and forced factories to shut down. The Great Barrier Reef has now suffered six mass bleaching events since 1998. And in East Antarctica, where temperatures one day this year were a whopping 38.5&deg;C above normal, a massive ice shelf has just collapsed &ndash; the first such event in at least half a century. Making matters worse, Russia's war in Ukraine has triggered a scramble for fossil fuels, and corporations, banks, and governments are finding it harder than expected to deliver on their climate promises. We are heading toward temperature increases well above the Paris climate agreement's 2&deg;C threshold. A planet that hot would be scarcely recognizable to us today. An important new report from the Systems Change Lab &ndash; an initiative organized by the World Resources Institute, the Bezos Earth Fund, and its partners &ndash; sheds light on both these realities, and points toward a new way of thinking about change. On the side of pessimism, the report shows that none of the 40 sectoral transformations required for addressing the climate crisis this decade is yet on track. For example, the phase-out of coal needs to be accelerated sixfold &ndash; the equivalent of retiring 925 average-size coal plants each year. Similarly, annual deforestation rates need to be falling 2.5 times faster, and recent growth in crop yields needs to accelerate by nearly sevenfold this decade to feed a growing population without encroaching into forested areas. All these transformations depend on global climate finance, which itself must increase eightfold from its current levels. But the report also explains that change is rarely linear, and that exponential progress &ndash; a sudden "hockey stick&rdquo; acceleration &ndash; is possible when nurtured by bold leadership and supportive policies. In the space of just two years, from 2019 to 2021, solar generation grew by 47% globally, and wind power grew by 31%, dramatically outpacing analysts' predictions. And between 2013 and 2021, the global share of carbon-free bus sales increased from 2% to 44% &ndash; a 20-fold increase in under a decade. Accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy will require a change in incentives, new regulations and laws, shifts in behavior, innovation, and unwavering leadership. We are about to begin the fourth year of the decisive decade for averting catastrophic climate change. We must move mountains, whatever the upfront costs. Global leaders gathering at COP27 this month should neither wring their hands in despair nor cheerfully declare that victory is around the corner. Rather, they should thoughtfully examine what needs to be transformed and what it will take to cross the essential tipping points. This is the moment when we need to create the conditions that will make more positive changes both irresistible and unstoppable. That would make all those carbon-emitting flights to Sharm El-Sheikh well worth it. &ndash; Andrew Steer is President and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund; Kelly Levin is Chief of Science, Data, and Systems Change at the Bezos Earth Fund. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 8th November, 2022 (WAM) &ndash; Led by a 13-member steering committee of African leaders, CEOs, and carbon credit experts, the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) was launched at COP27 to support the growth of carbon credits production, create jobs and protect biodiversity in Africa. ACMI announced a bold ambition for the continent to reach 300 million credits offered annually by 2030. This level of supplies would unlock US$6 billion in income and support 30 million jobs. By 2050, ACMI is targeting over 1.5 billion credits annually in Africa, leveraging over US$120 billion and supporting over 110 million jobs. A number of African nations including Kenya, Malawi, Gabon, Nigeria and Togo shared their commitments to collaborating with ACMI to scale up carbon credit production via voluntary carbon market activation plans. COP 27 in collaboration with The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, with the support of the UN Climate Change High Level Champions -- Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping. ACMI released Africa Carbon Markets Initiative, Roadmap report: Harnessing carbon markets for Africa at the initiative's COP 27 launch event. The report identifies 13 action programs to support the growth of voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) on the continent. Although voluntary carbon markets are already growing quickly, retirements of African credits have grown by an average of 36 per cent annually over the past five years, aggressive action will be required to maintain this level of growth over the coming decades. \</doc>

DUBAI,13th November, 2022 (WAM) - Highlighting the importance of integrating education and climate to achieve global education transformation, Dubai Cares, a civil society organisation formally associated with the United Nations Department of Global Communications, recently participated at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). COP27 began on 6th and concludes on 18th November, 2022, at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt, to ensure the full implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted by 196 parties at COP21 in 2015, to limit global warming to well below 2\'b0 Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. Dubai Cares' participation in the event centred on its ongoing efforts to highlight the powerful connection between climate action and education that reflects the interconnectedness of all Sustainable Development Goals. COP27 was built on the recommendations of its Framework for Global Education Transformation and the Rewiring Education for People and Planet report that call for a whole-of-society ecosystem approach built on cross-sectoral collaboration as crucial to leveraging education for the achievement of all SDGs. One of the report's six win-win solutions, in particular, addresses climate change by asking stakeholders to adapt education systems to build climate resilience and develop green skills. Dubai Cares participated in several sessions and meetings at the event, engaging with high-level officials on ways to encourage governments around the world to integrate climate education in their national agendas, while equipping youth with green skills and involving them in decision-making by creating green job opportunities that allow them to contribute to greener economies. Dr. Tariq Al Gurg, Chief Executive Officer and Vice-Chairman of Dubai Cares, participated in the Inaugural Meeting on Greening Education Partnership in Sharm El Sheikh, initially launched at the Transforming Education Summit in September 2022 at the 77th UN General Assembly. During the meeting, Dr. Al Gurg, along with other senior officials, including Stefania Giannini, Assistant Director-General for Education at UNESCO, Baroness Barran MBE, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State Minister for the School and College System in the United Kingdom, as well as other key donors and UN entities discussed how stakeholders can support the partnership based on the ongoing programmes and initiatives on climate change education, and what additional action needs to be planned. "We must prioritise integrating climate change in our education systems globally because we cannot tackle health, food insecurity, poverty, gender inequality and other critical issues without climate. We also cannot address climate issues without involving education. Our current education systems cannot prepare our children and youth for climate action as it largely operates in isolation from other sectors. A whole-of-society ecosystem approach powered by cross-sectoral collaboration is the answer to transforming and rewiring our education systems in a way that integrates climate in curricula and leverages the potential of our children and youth for real climate action," Dr. Al Gurg said during the session. He also delivered a keynote speech at a COP27 side event hosted by the Future Economy Forum and Climate Governance Commission, in partnership with Dubai Cares, Global Partnership for Education, UNESCO, Schools 2030, Generation Unlimited, Aga Khan Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation and the LEGO Foundation. At the session titled "Unleashing the Power of Education for the Future of the Planet: What's Our Investment Case Moving Forward?", Dr. Al Gurg spoke about the importance of building a community between climate and education for COP28. He noted that we could not expect our future humans to be committed to climate solutions unless they feel a sense of personal connection and empowerment with the issue and how their daily actions and behaviour impact their only home. He added that this is only possible through an education ecosystem that places climate-related values, skills, knowledge and experiences at the centre of teaching and learning. Dr. Al Gurg also joined a panel discussion on "Creating a Sustainable Future through Education: Setting the Road Map for Action and Impact", hosted by the UK Department for Education together with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). As part of his intervention, Dr. Al Gurg noted that coordination at the highest levels is required to ensure that climate education is among the top priorities at global events. There is a need to involve all stakeholders and take into account the perspectives of different voices to amplify the urgency of the climate crisis. According to 2021 UNESCO data from 100 countries, 47 percent of national curriculum frameworks did not refer to climate change, with less than 40 percent of teachers feeling confident in teaching it and only one-third being capable of explaining well the effects of climate change on their region or locality to their students. \</doc>

UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he will attend the COP27 talks in Egypt next week, reversing his previous decision not to attend. "There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change," Sunak wrote in a Tweet on Wednesday that confirmed his attendance at the Nov. 6-18 summit, known as COP 27 . That provoked criticism from Alok Sharma, the minister in Sunak's own government who served as president of the previous COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland. He told the Sunday Times he was "disappointed" that Rishi Sunak was not going to COP27 in Egypt, and argued it would promote engagement with other world leaders on climate issues. Former premier Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday that he would attend the summit, ratcheting up the pressure on Sunak to change his mind. Johnson made climate change a focal point of his tenure, but his replacement in Downing Street, Liz Truss, was less committed to the cause and became embroiled in a row with King Charles III after her administration advised the famously environmentalist monarch not to go to the summit. King Charles III told to not attend COP27 That advice to the King remains, Sunak's office has said. Questions have been asked in the past about Sunak's commitment to combating global warming, not least when he cut taxes on fuel and flying just days before COP26. While it is not unusual for a head of government to miss the UN summit, there's additional impetus for the British premier to go because the UK is handing over the presidency of the talks to Egypt.

'Earth Day' organiser EARTHDAY.ORG (EDO) has announced the Climate Education Coalition at their first Climate Education Hub at COP27 . The nonprofit said the coalition comprises over 100 organisations and individuals around the globe working to promote climate education for Earth Day 2023, and demand it as a negotiating topic for COP28. According to the organisation, the coalition's mission is to work collaboratively in preparing future and current generations to face the consequences of the climate crisis, while bringing together responsible solutions to reverse climate change. By instilling responsibility amongst people of all ages, the coalition will help our planet heal by moving forward consciously to ensure the mistakes of past generations will not be repeated, EDO noted in its statement at COP27 . In July 2022, WSP Middle East's Sophia Kee told Middle East Construction News (MECN) that, "We have 93% certainty within the next five years of hitting new temperature highs." In September 2022, Copernicus data revealed that summer 2022 was the hottest on record for Europe. "Climate education is one of the most important solutions towards solving climate change. Education is where every action starts, it is a begging of innovation. It's the moment when you hear about something, and you get inspired to act," said Johnny Dabrowski, Climate Education Coalition Member and EARTHDAY.ORG Consultant. Along with preparing current and future generations to adequately combat and reverse the climate crisis, the Climate Education Coalition aims to establish compulsory climate education in schools across the globe, by promoting the importance of climate education, green jobs, technologies and policies, civic engagement, youth empowerment, and climate justice and equity to members of civil society, politicians, UN officials, entrepreneurs, and global press, the statement added. The Climate Education Coalition will use 22 April 2023 as Earth Day for Climate Education, in order to meet with policymakers, spread educational resources, organise workshops, practice lawful demonstrations, and collaborate with stakeholders to standardise access to climate education in school curricula, educational institutions and organisations, and communities around the world, the statement from EDO concluded. In October 2022, the UNEP cautioned that the lack of progress leaves the world hurtling towards a temperature rise far above the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2C, and preferably 1.5C.

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 12th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) introduced the second edition of the UAE Green Business Toolkit in partnership with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), as part of its participation in the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), held in the Egyptian city of Sharm El Sheikh. The move aligns with the UAE's pathway to net-zero and supports sustainable economic development. The launch took place during a session, headlined by Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, and moderated by Helena McLeod, Deputy Director-General of GGGI. Almheiri said, "Our ability to tackle the challenge of climate change and deliver tangible results in its mitigation and adaptation depends on the active participation of all sectors in our net-zero efforts. Therefore, the UAE prioritises private sector engagement in all its future plans. The Toolkit is part of MOCCAE's efforts to enhance the contribution of private sector companies to the fight against climate change by adopting green and sustainable practices in line with the objectives of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative." The UAE Green Business Toolkit 2.0 seeks to benefit from the business sector's increasing awareness about the importance of achieving net-zero and building a low-carbon economy. The document offers a comprehensive definition of the net-zero concept, explains its role in creating new business opportunities and reducing operating costs in the long term, and highlights the gains that come with the pursuit of a net-zero strategy. These include strengthening investor confidence and customer loyalty as well as boosting global competitiveness and the ability to attract talent. The second edition also draws a roadmap for developing an integrated company net-zero strategy. It outlines a four-step approach that involves measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, setting emission reduction targets, implementing measures to reach the targets, and linking the targets with the country's economy-wide decarbonisation efforts. In order to provide the private sector with a clear understanding of the benefits of the green business ecosystem, MOCCAE launched the National Dialogue for Climate Ambition (NDCA) in May 2022. The series of stakeholder assemblies, dedicated to a different industry every month, explores sectoral requirements, priorities, and future directions related to climate neutrality. The UAE Green Business Toolkit 2.0 outlines 92 measures businesses can take to become greener, such as switching to clean sources of energy, electrifying the company vehicle fleet, and replacing conventional raw materials with low-carbon alternatives. MOCCAE launched the first edition of the UAE Green Business Toolkit in 2018 with the intent to inspire all types of companies nationwide to take the first step to becoming more eco-friendly and socially responsible by creating awareness. It provided businesses, whether established or emerging, with all the information necessary to green their operations with a focus on three main areas - green offices, green procurement, and green products - and defined optimal implementation mechanisms. In the four years since, public awareness of the critical need for sustainability has seen tremendous growth. Notwithstanding mounting adverse climate-related impacts, the need to prioritise sustainable practices has only become more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the UAE economy pursues its green recovery plans, increased attention is required to manage environmental, social, and climate-related risks to prevent future disruptions. The second edition of the Toolkit supports the country's ambition to reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by 2050, as well as the Principles of the 50, the UAE Green Agenda 2015-2030, and the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017-2050. Going green offers businesses multiple benefits and creates new growth opportunities. In addition to protecting the environment and conserving natural resources, it cuts down on operational costs, reduces waste, and boosts product competitiveness, with environmental friendliness becoming an important global quality standard.

CAIRO, 11th October, 2022 (WAM) -- Yasmine Fouad, Minister of Environment of Egypt and Ministerial Coordinator and Envoy for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), said that COP27 and the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) will embody the pioneering roles of Egypt and UAE in driving the process of sustainable development and climate action. She described COP27 , which will be held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in November, as a comprehensive edition of the event while highlighting her appreciation for the overall relations between Egypt and the UAE. In an exclusive interview with the Emirates News Agency (WAM), Fouad said that the two countries must now support the international climate action efforts, noting the significance of the hosting of COP27 in Egypt and COP28 in the UAE. Below is the following interview: Q: How did Egypt prepared for hosting COP27 ? A: Egypt's hosting of COP27 is being prioritised by the country and its political leadership. Following the announcement of Egypt's hosting of the major international event in November 2021, a higher committee was established, headed by Mostafa Madbouly, Prime Minister of Egypt, with a membership of government ministers. Three sub-committees were also formed to oversee technical and political matters related to the event, and a timeline was set in coordination with the United Nations. A total of 15 ministries are participating in the country's preparations for the event, including the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Ministry of Social Solidarity, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, South Sinai Governorate, Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, the Ministry of International Cooperation and the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The preparations for COP27 include transforming Sharm El Sheikh into Egypt's first green city by updating relevant systems and establishing new renewable energy plants to power conference halls, hotels and transportation with clean energy, as well as increasing the capacity of Sharm El Sheikh Airport by constructing a new solar energy plant. The arrangements also include the launch of a green tourism system and promoting sustainable practices, which include re-using water for agriculture and parks, among other uses, increasing the renewable energy capacity of all hotels and boosting their internet capacity, as well as applying integrated waste management solutions through the alliance between BEEAH Group and Green Planet, Egypt's emerging environmental services company, to deliver a landmark ten-year contract in Sharm El Sheikh. BEEAH Group and Green Planet will implement future-ready waste management strategies that align with Egypt's sustainability agenda, such as deploying world-class waste management infrastructure, streamlined waste collection solutions and recycling services. They aim to set a new standard for operational efficiency while meeting waste management demand. Q: How important is COP27 , especially amid current geopolitical developments and worsening climate change? A: In 2022, we are facing many challenges, including the economic crisis and energy and food shortages, which require further action to ensure that all parties meet their obligation pledges at COP26, most notably those related to ways of adapting to climate change. The Egyptian government announced the theme of COP27 as "Implementation Conference," but implementation does not only mean financial pledges; but also the actual implementation of policies for the planet's interest. Q: What is the concept of 'Implementation Conference'? A: When we say "Implementation Conference," we mean that we can offer solutions. For example, the world is currently addressing the issue of energy security. The conference is about the gradual transformation to clean and renewable energy, which requires new technologies that will enable developing countries to transit to new and renewable energy, as well as draft plans that will enable them to achieve this transition. These challenges could create new opportunities for the international community to unite again in facing common challenges. The Egyptian government will make all humanitarian needs and related implementation procedures available at COP27 . The conference's activities will involve several international initiatives that will include the "Agriculture and Food Systems Initiative," a global early warning system, biodiversity and marine life project, and how to protect maritime species, the "Waste Segregation in Africa Initiative," and the goal to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050. The third part of the conference will be dedicated to inclusion and is not only limited to governments, as the world is witnessing environmental disasters that do not differentiate between developed and developing countries. The green zone will witness activities similar to the official events. Q: What is the vision of the Egyptian state about the global role of the youth? A: Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, President of Egypt, has launched several relevant initiatives, most notably the World Youth Forum, as the youth are key to achieving the development process. This Forum dedicated a session for the youth and their climate action vision. During COP27 , a youth conference will be held prior to the official launch of the event, which will present their ideas related to implementation. A working group was also established to discuss the conference's activities, which has been holding workshops since January. The last part of the conference will be dedicated to youth experiences on "Solutions Day" on 17th November. There are many national initiatives to help young people engage in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) working in the area of environmental protection, including transforming agricultural waste to biogas targeting 60 million Egyptians and riding bikes instead of vehicles to reduce emissions. Q: What do you think about the partnership between the UAE and Egypt in hosting COP27 and COP28? A: We are proud of the partnership between Egypt and the UAE, which extends further to just organising climate conferences. We believe that COP28 is the continuation of COP27 , and the hosting of both events by Arab countries sends a strong message to the world. We hope that COP27 will generate recommendations that will help implement stricter resolutions related to adapting and financing climate action. Q: What are your expectations for the climate action stature of Egypt and the UAE after COP27 and COP28? A: I believe that hosting COP27 in Egypt and COP28 in the UAE will enable the two countries as part of the Arab Group, and I am proud to head the Arab Group at the Arab League in charge of climate events at a ministerial level, which will support the strategic role played by the Arab Group in the climate change activities, not only in terms of negotiations or whatever concerns Arab and developing countries but also in terms of creating new investment partnerships with the private sector.

WASHINGTON, 8th December, 2022 (WAM) -- John Kerry, the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, on Wednesday hailed the decision to hold next year's 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28) in the UAE, stating that fossil fuel economies should be encouraged to lead the transition to clean energy. "I think it's very exciting that the UAE, an OPEC member, is going to host COP28, and it's so important that you have an oil and gas producing nation step up and say we understand the challenge of the climate crisis," Kerry told Reuters in an interview. "The UAE Leadership has taken very smart steps because they know that what's coming out of the ground is not forever, either physically or politically, and they're looking at what the new world is going to look like. If there are going to be new forms of energy, they want to be among the providers of it, just as they are today." Kerry said this year's COP27 conference, held last month in Egypt, moved the world a bit closer to the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial times. He also praised the announcement of 30 upgraded national climate plans along with the summit's headline agreement on "loss and damage" to help vulnerable countries reeling from climate-driven extreme weather and rising seas. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 8th November, 2022 (WAM) &ndash; In response to the devastating impacts of climate change affecting vulnerable people all over the world, the COP27 Presidency today launched the Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda in partnership with the High-Level Champions. The Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda outlines 30 Adaptation Outcomes to enhance resilience for 4 billion people living in the most climate vulnerable communities by 2030. Each outcome presents global solutions that can be adopted at a local level to respond to local climate contexts, needs and risks and deliver the systems transformation required to protect vulnerable communities to the rising climate hazards, such as extreme heat, drought, flooding, or extreme weather. It comes as research warns that nearly half the world's population will be at severe risk of climate change impacts by 2030, even in a 1.5-degree world according to analysis published by IPCC AR6 WG II Report. Collectively, these outcomes represent the first comprehensive global plan to rally both State and non-State actors behind a shared set of adaptation actions that are required by the end of this decade across five impact systems: food and agriculture, water and nature, coastal and oceans, human settlements, and infrastructure, and including enabling solutions for planning and finance. The 30 Adaptation Outcomes include urgent global 2030 targets related to: Transitioning to climate resilient, sustainable agriculture that can increase yields by 17% and reduce farm level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 21%, without expanding agricultural frontiers, and while improving livelihoods including of smallholder farmers Protecting and restoring an estimated 400 million hectares in critical areas (land and freshwater ecosystems) supporting indigenous and local communities with use of nature-based solutions to improve water security and livelihoods and to transform 2 billion hectares of land into sustainable management. Protecting 3 billion people by installing smart and early warning systems Investing USD 4 billion to secure the future of 15 million hectares of mangroves through collective action to halt loss, restore, double protection and ensure sustainable finance for all existing mangroves. Expanding access to clean cooking for 2.4 billion people through at least USD 10 billion/year in innovative finance. Mobilising USD 140 to USD 300 billion needed across both public and private sources for adaptation and resilience and spur 2,000 of the world's largest companies to integrate physical climate risk and develop actionable adaptation plans In a sign of recognition of this major milestone for the global adaptation process, the Adaptation Agenda is being driven by the COP27 Presidency, the High-Level Champions and Marrakech Partnership, with the support of UNFCCC and underpinned by the 2,000+ organisations spanning 131 countries in the Race to Resilience campaign. At the launch, COP27 President Sameh Shoukry, High-Level Champions Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping, called on all State and non-State actors to get behind this critical Agenda. COP27 President and Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry:"It is our aspiration that the Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda represents a significant contribution to enhancing global action on adaptation and resilience as an utmost priority. The COP 27 Presidency is keen to develop an arrangement to secure continuity in scope, priorities and reporting. It will lead the work building on: a) the adaptation focused initiatives launched by COP27 Presidency at COP27 that shall accelerate action across system interventions, b) the adaptation and resilience outcome targets identified by the High-Level Champions. The Marrakech Partnership, the High-Level Champions and a number of specialised UN agencies will work together- as partners- to accelerate an agenda of global adaptation action through following up on the implementation of Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda. The COP 27 Presidency will receive - before COP 28 - from the High-Level Champions, the Marrakech Partnership and a number of specialised UN agencies a report on the progress achieved in implementing the Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda. Overall progress on implementation will be reported back to COP 28." Mr. Simon Stiell the Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, said: "The Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda firmly puts key human needs at its core, along with concrete, specific action on the ground to build resilience to climate change. As the growing number of climate emergencies throughout the world clearly shows, focusing on adaptation is a crucial, pressing necessity. The Adaptation Agenda outlines multiple actions and combines the commitments of governments and non-Party stakeholders into a joint vision and a joint plan. We need all stakeholders on board to deal with current and future impacts of climate change, and this is a prime example of how that can happen." Dr.Mahmoud Mohieldin UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP27 , said: "The Outcomes were identified jointly with a broad range of active stakeholders, reflecting existing and new global targets based on science along with local knowledge and initiatives. The Outcome targets will continue to be refined and expanded by the High-Level Champions with inputs from State and non-State actors to support their operationalization. At the core of the Outcomes is the recognition that adaptation is often locally-driven and globally relevant, while simultaneously needing to address equity, diversity and justice. This agenda will accelerate the Race to Resilience's global goal of making 4 billion vulnerable people more resilient by 2030.Of particular importance is the role of key enablers like finance and planning to accelerate adaptation in the near-term. USD140 to USD300 billion needs to be mobilised across both public and private sources annually with a minimum target of 50% for adaptation, as called by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Of particular concern and focus is Africa, where the private finance share in the total financing of climate adaptation efforts is not more than 3% ($11.4 billion). Seven times that amount will be needed annually until 2030. " The Agenda emphasises the urgency for counting with evidence-based, actionable adaptation plans for all actors, making climate risks visible and accessible, and to deploy the locally-led adaptation principles. \</doc>

In the heat of Sharm El Sheikh, discussions started on 6 November that will determine how, over the next years, we address the defining challenge of our time: climate change. The latest United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) brings together political and business leaders, activists, civil society groups, international organizations and others, to set commitments that can quicken the action and adaptation needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The context for COP27 could not be more urgent, as the latest IPCC report sets out in stark terms. Human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption, to the environment and countless people around the world. Increased heatwaves, droughts and floods are already a reality. These extremes are causing cascading affects that have exposed millions of people to health risks, and acute food and water insecurity, especially in developing and emerging economies. These crises are inter-connected and those affected most are often the least to blame. For example, World Resources Institute analysis shows that, while many parts of Africa are at the forefront of climate change impacts, the continent accounts for only 3% of global CO2 emissions. Prioritising adaptation that protects the most vulnerable How we address these challenges require holistic thinking, long-term strategies and clear accountability, to prevent and alleviate negative impacts. We cannot achieve that without widespread and comprehensive reporting by organisations on their climate impacts. As UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has set out, greater leadership is needed from governments and businesses, warning that efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures to 1.5-degrees above pre-industrial levels is 'on life support'. And so, with good reason, the focus of reporting has been mostly on emissions, with widespread commitments by companies to reach 'Net Zero' targets. Yet, focus on emissions reductions alone is not enough. If we are to avoid further escalation and consolidation of crises, we urgently need transparency and accountability on how a low-carbon transition, which supports the needs of workers and communities, is being prioritised. Beyond this, organisations need to explain how their strategies and business practices alleviate the impacts of climate change on those around them. To this end, there are growing demands on companies to help the communities directly affected by their activities to become more resilient against the impacts of climate change. Clarity on the climate data that matters most At GRI, we urge all organisations to disclose their impacts on the planet, because transparency \- through quality, comparable information \- is an essential stage in identifying where responsibilities lie and contributing to global solutions to the climate crisis. Sustainability reporting can be a driver for better environmental performance. However, companies are not always reporting the data that matters most. That is why, as the most widely adopted standard-setter for sustainability impacts, we convene stakeholders across the board in our standards development, to determine best practice. This is the approach we will again follow as we get ready for a major update of GRI climate-related standards. A review will launch in 2023 and cover not only commitments and actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), but also how to ensure a holistic view on adaptation and resilience to climate change. This will account for the physical impacts of climate change as well as the low-carbon transition on workers and communities. A key consideration here will be to connect the climate standards review to our current revision program for labor-related reporting. Demands for more clarity and consistency on the most relevant climate-related impacts of organisations, from the local to the global levels, has been a key learning from our Sector Program \- particularly in the Sector Standards for oil and gas (GRI 11) and coal (GRI 12). Alongside steps to mitigate emissions, these standards have extensive focus on achieving a just transition. The new Agriculture, Aquaculture & Fishing Standard (GRI 13), meanwhile, gives attention to how organisations enable adaptation and protect critical sources of food. Our revision of the Biodiversity Standard (GRI 304) has shone a light on the inter-relations between the climate and biodiversity crises. This process is at an advanced stage \- and the exposure draft for the revised Biodiversity Standard is expected to be released for public comment early December (during the UN Biodiversity COP 15). This updated standard will closely intersect with our work on climate standards. 'Double materiality' in climate disclosure As demonstrated by our multi-stakeholder engagement, we believe standard-setting should not happen in isolation. To that end, our review of climate standards will not only build on our wider program to develop the GRI Standards, it will also see collaboration and alignment with the climate standards under development by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the recommendations of the TCFD, as well as new EU standards under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. GRI reporting is focused on impact materiality \- in terms of how the organisation impacts on people and planet. We will ensure our updated climate standard(s) complement the financial materiality disclosures in the proposed ISSB standards, reflecting our commitment to a global comprehensive reporting regime in which impact and financial disclosure are on an equal footing. When it comes to climate reporting, the interrelationship between impact on the organisation and impact on the outside world is clear to see. Taken together, this 'double materiality' perspective \- with both the inside-out and outside-in viewpoints taken into account \- will be crucial in driving accountability for climate impacts.

The winning application, created by Farmin, supports the efforts to fight climate change, and enhances the monitoring of GHG emissions in the Arabian Peninsula by utilizing AI and global, updated, and commonly available remote sensing data. Salem Butti Salem Al Qubaisi, Director-General of the UAE Space Agency, added: "During our participation in COP27 , the UAESA will launch several projects and initiatives, aiming to realize our vision to support the global space industry and scientific activities. This goal is perfectly aligned with the aspirations of the UAE\' s wise leadership to become a leading hub for relevant projects and initiatives, including the Space Data Center, the first digital platform to provide scientists, scholars, public and private entities, start-ups, and members of the community with access to space data, as well as Farmin\' s winning climate change application. Our priority is to support start-ups, entrepreneurs, and scholars, which is perfectly aligned with our vision to develop space solutions and applications to promote the UAE as a regional hub for space innovation." The UAE took several steps to fight climate change, reduce GHG emissions and burning of natural gas, while increasing the efficiency and investments in clean energy. These efforts are supported by mapping, and sustainably managing GHG emissions through an integrated system, with the help of remote sensing technologies. \</doc>

Minister for Climate Change and Environment shares insights into the implementation of the strategic initiative, which the UAE introduced last year - the first in the Mena region File photo The 27th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP-27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, has closed its doors. In addition to climate change mitigation and adaptation and the hot topic of climate finance, the event focused on addressing loss and damage due to climate change, keeping up the momentum created at last year's COP-26 in Glasgow, Scotland. For the first time, it also featured an official Food and Agriculture Pavilion, signifying the increased importance of the link between climate change and food security. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister for Climate Change and Environment, was part of the UAE delegation to the world's largest annual gathering dedicated to climate action, led by the UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and comprising more than 1,000 representatives of 105 leading government and private sector entities. Khaleej Times spoke about the outcomes of the conference, which will be held in Abu Dhabi next year. What were the main objectives of the UAE's participation in COP27 ? This year, we went to COP with the largest-ever delegation with the aim of demonstrating the UAE's global climate leadership. Among the diverse participants, government organisations took the lion's share, followed by the private sector, including waste management, consultancy, energy and power, manufacturing and real estate. Meanwhile, academia represented nine per cent of the delegation, and civil society accounted for five per cent. Our second objective related to being the host of next year's COP-28 - we were in listening mode to gain insights and understand the priorities of all countries and stakeholders. We will leverage this knowledge to prepare a relevant programme for COP-28 that builds on the great work done at COP-27 , addresses the most pressing concerns and highlights the most promising opportunities. We also explored new prospects for partnerships in the run-up to COP-28. What was the highlight of the event from the UAE's perspective? Our proudest moment at COP-27 was the launch of the National Net Zero by 2050 Pathway that will drive the implementation of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, which we introduced last year as the first country in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region. The Pathway is based on four principles - compliance with the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13: Climate Action; strengthening environmental and socio-economic benefits; the UAE's vision for climate leadership in mitigation and adaptation; and implementable, real-world solutions. In our integrated approach, we will prioritise six climate change mitigation measures. These include accelerating a transition to clean energy sources, utilising climate-friendly raw material substitutes in hard-to-abate sectors, reducing waste generation and expanding waste treatment, focusing on green mobility-orientated development, increasing energy efficiency across all sectors, and fostering R&D in direct air capture (DAC), carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and small-to-medium nuclear reactor industry. The National Net Zero by 2050 Pathway will deliver significant benefits. It is projected to result in annual cumulative GDP growth of three per cent. It will create 200,000 jobs across the economy, and we expect to future-proof existing jobs by greening our industries. The reduction and capture of emissions will notably improve air quality in our cities, thereby enhancing public health and quality of life. And finally, it will give us the opportunity to boost the competitiveness of our future low-carbon exports with a focus on green metals and minerals as well as clean hydrogen. The UAE has teamed up with Indonesia to launch the Mangrove Alliance for Climate (MAC). Why Indonesia, and what does the initiative aspire to achieve? The MAC brings together governments, organisations, businesses, academia and civil society from around the world that recognise the importance of mangroves as an effective nature-based climate change solution to strengthen the conservation and restoration of mangrove ecosystems worldwide. It aims to scale up cross-boundary cooperation, knowledge exchange, research, and use, conservation, restoration and planting while ensuring that the most vulnerable communities can benefit from its efforts. It also seeks to reduce loss and damage due to climate change, and enable least developed countries to obtain sustainable carbon credits eligible to finance nature projects. Indonesia was a natural choice of a founding partner for us, as we are already collaborating in mangrove conservation and development. Together, we plan to establish the Mohamed bin Zayed International Mangrove Research Centre on the Bangka-Belitung Islands in Indonesia. The facility will specialise in studying, assessing, managing, protecting and restoring mangrove ecosystems, including conducting studies on mangrove ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and ecotourism and their economic valuation. At COP-27 In the UAE, we intend to plant three million mangroves over the next two months to support MAC. This also aligns with our target of planting 100 million mangroves across the country by 2030. Last year at COP-26 in Glasgow, the UAE joined forces with the US to launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate). At that time, the initiative garnered $4 (Dh14.69) billion of investment commitments from its partners to be expended on agricultural innovation and R&D between 2021 and 2025. And in February this year, during the Food, Agriculture and Livelihoods Week at Expo 2020 Dubai, AIM for Climate pledged to double the amount by COP27 . We have not only achieved it, but we have also exceeded it. We now have commitments worth $7 (Dh25.71) billion from 23 government partners and another $1 (Dh3.67) billion from our innovation sprint partners. We also more than tripled our membership base. At COP-26, we had 79 partners, and now we have over 275 - 42 government and 235 non-government partners, respectively. In addition, we have significantly increased the number of innovation sprints  investments in specific, impactful, expedited efforts. At COP-26, we had eight, and since then, we have added 22 new ones, bringing the total number to 30. This is a very important development because innovation sprints help us achieve faster, and we need as many solutions as possible at the intersection of global hunger and the climate crisis. The country used COP27 to launch the UAE Green Business Toolkit 2.0. What is the purpose of this updated edition? In the four years that have passed since we issued the first edition of the Toolkit, public awareness of the critical need for sustainability has seen tremendous growth, and options for businesses to participate in climate action have evolved as well. Another important development was last year's launch of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative. If we are to deliver on our climate ambitions, companies across all industries will need to do their part by modifying their operational practices, but at the outset, making such a commitment may seem daunting. And that's why we developed the second edition of the Toolkit specifically to address the topic of net zero as it pertains to the business sector. In line with the latest climate science, it seeks to demystify the concept of net zero, and equip companies with tools and the know-how that will help them along the journey to climate neutrality. The document outlines 92 measures businesses can take to become greener, such as switching to clean sources of energy, electrifying the company vehicle fleet and replacing conventional raw materials with low-carbon alternatives. At COP-27 Having emerged as an increasingly popular asset class in recent years, green bonds and sukuk are among the most promising financial instruments for sustainable projects. Aimed at setting the fundamental rules for the sustainable management of this industry and helping bridge any information gaps, the report outlines the current conditions in the UAE and offers recommendations for further development of the domestic green bond and sukuk market. In preparing the document, we have gathered insights from leading financial institutions and relevant public sector stakeholders to gauge their market readiness for issuing and investing in green bonds, as well as the needs and priorities for the development of the green fixed-income market in the country. Has the UAE taken any new steps to enhance the participation of domestic entities from the public, non-profit, and private sector in implementing the Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative? Emirates Nature-WWF, in collaboration with Alliances for Climate Action (ACA), launched the UAE Alliance for Climate Action (UACA) that has called on non-governmental stakeholders to join as members and ramp up their decarbonisation efforts in line with the Paris Agreement. The Coalition will support signatories of the UAE Climate-Responsible Companies Pledge by building capacities and providing them with the tools and expertise to adopt and achieve net-zero targets. We signed an agreement with the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) and Emirates Nature-WWF to strengthen collaboration in scaling up nature-based climate change solutions, such as blue carbon ecosystems, in the region. We entered a partnership with EAD and Majid Al Futtaim Retail to help conserve natural resources and protect the environment by promoting multi-use products and alternatives with a low carbon footprint to address the challenge of excessive plastic waste. Together, we will conduct studies of user incentives when it comes to purchasing multi-use products and raise awareness about the environmental impact of plastic pollution, most importantly single-use bags. We will also work closely to measure the impact of the initiative by monitoring the decrease in plastic bag use and the reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from this important shift in behaviour. The UAE is committed to building synergies with other countries to achieve common climate and environmental goals. Has the country initiated any new partnerships at COP-27 ? In line with the UAE's efforts to support a just and inclusive clean energy transition worldwide, Masdar, our flagship renewable energy company, along with its joint venture with Infinity, Egypt's main renewable energy developer, and Hassan Allam Utilities, signed an agreement to develop a 10 gigawatt (GW) onshore wind project in Egypt. This will be one of the largest wind farms in the world and Masdar's largest project to date. In addition, Masdar will build a 2 GW green hydrogen facility in the Suez Canal Economic Zone. We also signed a memorandum of cooperation (MoC) with Japan, covering multiple areas of environmental protection and climate action, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, air quality management, waste management, and biodiversity conservation and sustainable use. Last year at COP-26, the UAE, Jordan, and Israel signed a declaration of intent to initiate the Prosperity Project. Can you tell us more about this venture and its latest developments? The landmark collaborative effort aims to address the threats posed by climate change on water and energy security in the region by building renewable energy and water desalination capacity. Phase One, Prosperity Green, involves building solar photovoltaic plants in Jordan with a combined capacity of 600 megawatt (MW) that will export clean energy to Israel. The Government of Jordan has chosen Masdar to execute this programme. Phase Two, Prosperity Blue, is a sustainable water desalination programme in Israel that will supply Jordan with up to 200 million cubic metres of desalinated water per year. We spent the past year conducting feasibility studies, and at COP-27 , we took an important next step by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to implement the project that will go a long way in promoting stability in the region. \</doc>

By Abdullah Abdulkarim CAIRO, 23rd OCTOBER, 2022 (WAM) -- Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry has articulated the central importance of the ' COP27 ' his country will host next month in the winter resort of Sharm El Sheikh, calling for pulling the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC out of the ongoing context of "strong political and economic polarisation and the dynamics of politicisation and contestation." " COP27 "This has been a message we've been sending out over the past period to all parties concerned, whether through the informal ministerial meetings that were held throughout the year or during the preparatory meeting for COP27 , which was held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo earlier this month. All these parties should honour their shared responsibilities and focus on this existential issue facing humanity at large, which is climate change. We must make sure that the ongoing international conflicts and crises and the current global polarisation won't in any way spill over to this field." Shoukry in this regard cited international reports regarding the need to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. "If we go beyond 1.5 degree of global warming, negative consequences will become unavoidable, and it will be impossible for the world to go back to where we used to be," he warned. "The parties participating in the climate summit should realise that the core and crux of this conference is to address the climate change challenges, and that it is not a forum to address any other issues that is not relevant to climate action. Therefore, our common interest is to continue pushing forward towards concerted international efforts from all parties concerned to address this burning issue that's taking a toll on all of us. All possible efforts must be made to pull the conference out of the ongoing context of strong political and economic polarisation and the dynamics of politicisation and contestation." Burning Issues Asked on the approaches adopted by Egypt toward the global efforts made to address climate change, Shoukry said, " COP27 focuses on a set of key climate-related issues, primarily emissions reduction; adaptation to the negative effects of climate change; financing; and the issue of losses and damages. "There is a consensus that tackling these key issues hinges on the ability of the international community to deal with the challenges of climate change and to work on building confidence among all parties - developed and developing countries - to provide the necessary resources so that the concerned countries can assume their responsibility toward a fair, sustainable transition from dependence on fossil fuels to the new and renewable energy and embark on a path of negotiation and consultation on the issue of losses and damages." The Egyptian presidency, he continued, is working to provide a favourable ecosystem to encourage all parties concerned to reach a consensus, and to make concessions that ultimately serve the collective interest to realise the aspired goal. "Throughout 2022, we have been working to encourage the world countries to increase their voluntary national commitments in the context of reducing emissions, as well as to emphasise the importance of adaptation. We all have seen the devastating consequences of the recent floods and torrents in Pakistan and the need for the Pakistani government to take measures to protect their people. And to do that, there must be resources for such countries to remedy these effects and to work to contain them. Therefore, we hope there will be consensus and clear political will that leads to the achievement of this common goal." Strategic Messages On the strategic messages that Egypt intends to convey through the climate summit, Shoukry said that they are all concerns shared by the international community: "They are messages from the international community. During the first two days of the conference, a high-level debate will be held. We have made a call for the largest possible participation from world leaders in this discussion to express the political will needed to address the issue of climate change. A large number of presidents and heads of government have confirmed their attendance, and we hope that they will all support reaching a consensus to take the measures necessary to build confidence among the Parties of the UNFCCC. Also, there are Egyptian initiatives that will be launched during the conference on food security, agriculture, green hydrogen, new and renewable energy, in addition to a call for ensuring decent life in Africa. We hope these initiatives will be supported, not only by the governments, but also by the business community and civil society organisations, whose roles are indispensable to ensure concerted efforts by all governmental and non-governmental parties to address climate change issues. "Also, during COP27 , presidential round-table meetings will be held to address key elements and initiatives within the framework of the Climate Summit and the challenges facing us all, in addition to summit meetings to highlight some initiatives launched by sisterly countries and partners to enhance the way the world addresses climate challenges." UAE-Egypt Partnership Asked on how he sees the Egyptian-Emirati partnership in COP27 , Shoukry said that the Egyptian-Emirati partnership goes beyond the climate conference. "It is a deeply rooted relationship of brotherhood, partnership and love that connects the two leaderships and peoples at all levels. There is certainly coordination between Egypt and the UAE through the Egyptian team in COP27 and the Emirati team that is working on preparing for the COP28. This coordination aims to ensure the usual exchange of views. The progress to be made within COP27 will be echoed and built upon during the next edition of the event in order to forge ahead with confronting clime challenges in the best possible manner." He added that there remains close coordination between the Egyptian and Emirati teams, before and after COP27 , given that "Egypt will assume the presidency of the COP27 for a year after the conference and will then hand it over to the UAE to lead the path during COP28." The Egyptian top diplomat highlighted in this regard the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations between the two countries that will be held in Cairo under the slogan 'One Heart'. Ministers, officials and Emirati and Egyptian personalities including businessmen, intellectuals, media professionals and public figures will attend the three-day event that will begin on October 26. "It's an occasion to evoke the present and the past. The two brotherly peoples will remain indebted to and proud of late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and his impactful role in strengthening the ties of friendship and love between the two fraternal countries and their peoples," Shoukry affirmed. Shared Concerns & Aspirations On the concerns and aspirations shared by Egypt and the UAE in the field of environment, Shoukry said, "Certainly, there is shared interest on the part of the two countries in the protection of the environment. We both are fully aware of the climate change danger and of the necessity of ensuring cooperation at the bilateral, regional, and international levels. "We share the same interest in developing the capabilities of the two countries in the field of new and renewable energy, by accelerating investments in our two countries, promoting modern technologies on the challenges of climate change, and working to enhance the national capabilities of both countries through collaboration and investment. We both share the same interest, and this manifests itself in hosting two successive editions of the climate summit, COP27 and COP28. This is the first time that two Arab countries are entrusted with this responsibility, and God willing, we will be able to fulfil our commitments in the best possible way." Shoukry expressed hope the Arab Summit 2022, to be hosted by Algeria next month, will consolidate pan-Arab solidarity in facing the international challenges besetting the Arab world. "We hope that the Arab summit will strengthen deliberations on the besetting challenges and develop an appropriate framework for dealing with these threats by strengthening solidarity and integration between Arab countries. The Arab world abounds in massive resources and capabilities at the human or material levels that should place us in a strong position where we can have considerable influence in international affairs to enhance our ability to contain and address challenges, and help our peoples realise their ambitions, while sparing them the negative impact of the current geopolitical conditions." In this regard, the Egyptian top diplomat emphasised the central importance of the Palestinian cause, being "a pivotal issue for the entire Arab world", underscoring the necessity of continuing to support the Palestinian people in their strife for achieving their aspirations and establishing their own state. "In the meantime," the minister stressed, "the essential issue remains to be the indivisibility of the Arab national security. The Arab security is an indivisible whole and all Arab countries are working together to protect our national security and protect our supreme interests within the framework of international relations that are based on mutual respect and promotion of common interests between us and with our international partners." \</doc>

Dubai schools host Scope 2022 to challenge young people to find solutions linked to the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Students participate in a sustainable fashion show held as part of Scope 2022. - Supplied photo Coinciding with the recently concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference ( Cop27 GEMS Legacy School and GEMS World Academy hosted the first-of-its-kind forum for student voice and action against climate change. Scope was launched in 2020 and this year it was held both virtually as well as in person for around 380 students from 22 schools spread across the UAE and overseas. Providing a collaborative space for students of all ages to learn from each other as they exchange ideas and opinions, Scope was aimed at challenging young people to find solutions linked to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. This year's event engaged students in wide-ranging inclusive, collaborative activities, from sustainable diet and fashion, design and innovation, to climate change research, speech writing and delivery, storytelling and more. Hana Mohamed Suneer, GEMS global student ambassador and a Grade 6 student at GEMS Legacy School, said about the programme: "It's an opportunity, an impact, a tribute, a journey, a goal. A forum to exchange problems and solutions. A platform for climate change mitigation. A chance to leave a positive impact on people and nature. To me, Scope 2022 was not just an exposition, it was a revolution." Andre Cherian, a Year 11 student at GEMS Winchester School - Dubai, said: "Scope 2022 was an eye-opening and astonishing event to say the least. A multitude of schools are taking part in the conference, tackling some of the biggest crises facing today's world. I participated in Markup, a competition in which students pitched their innovative business idea to a team of eager investors. Climate change and sustainability were the main focal points - the core issues that must be addressed in the modern era to cope and ultimately sustain life for future generations. Scope is an opportunity for young minds to showcase their creativity, innovation and passion for sustainable development. I gained a lot of knowledge, skills and the drive for learning, thanks to my incredible experience at Scope." Sahila Yaqoob, a Grade 8 student who attended the event remotely from her school, DPS Budgam in India, said: "Change your deeds, or else nature will force you to change. Small acts when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world. Scope 2022 was a wonderful platform to showcase our talent and spread awareness of how to save Mother Earth. We were delighted to be a part of Scope 2022 and share ideas on what nations must do to move toward a sustainable future." Asha Alexander, executive leader - climate change for GEMS Education and Principal of GEMS Legacy School, which was the first school in the world to have its entire faculty become UN-certified Climate Change Teachers, said: "As Cop27 draws to a close, GEMS Education raises the curtains on how education and youth can help change the narrative for effective climate action. Scope and the GEMS Global Ambassadors programme serve to bring school students together to discuss and debate climate action. They are springboards for young people to act in response to the urgent and dramatic challenges that the planet faces. Initiatives such as Scope, as well as efforts to embed climate literacy in schools, aim to bring about the personal and societal transformation that is necessary to change the course of climate adversity." \</doc>

Climate change is a serious crisis facing the world, according to 8 out of 10 UAE residents surveyed by management consultancy firm Kearney. The study, published ahead of the UN Cop27 conference held in Egypt this month, also tevealed that 70% of people think urgent action is needed in the next five years to minimise the impact and secure a sustainable future. Most people in the UAE said that addressing climate change issues would have a positive impact on social issues, with 81% believing that climate change has a deep impact on the livelihoods of people in different countries. Mauricio Zuazua, Partner at Kearney Middle East, said: "In the past decade, countries in the Middle East region have made sustainability and energy transition a national priority. "We've seen commitments such as the UAE Net Zero 2050 and the KSA Net Zero 2060 come into place to combat climate change at a national level, and a number of clean energy initiatives." The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) says that temperatures in Europe are increasing at twice the global average and the scientific community has raised concerns about the environmental impact of industry. 50% of residents believe the country is on the right track to achieving this target, with 73% highlighting that corporates have a significant role to play in driving this. More than half (56%) believe corporations need to do more to slow down climate change, and 72% state that new technologies should be implemented to mitigate the climate crisis. "With COP 27 "It will also international investor attention into the region, and there's an opportunity to capture this momentum to accelerate sustainable development by design in the Middle East," said Mauricio Zuazua. While businesses have a big task on their hands, 70% highlight that individual contributions are also key role in supporting national sustainability goals. 77% are willing to make notable changes in their lifestyle in efforts to slow down climate change. Climate change concern drives consumers 68% claim to gravitate towards products and services of companies, which have substantial ESG practices and protocols in place such as sustainable products, green certifications, as well as transparent reporting on emissions. 59% are willing to pay a small premium more for sustainably produced products - a sentiment consistent amongst all income groups surveyed. "Consumers, investors and regulators are pushing businesses to adopt the triple bottom line. It is no longer an option not to consider people and planet, in addition to profit. Integrating the principles of People and Planet into products and services will be impossible without technological investments and integration across value chains," added Zuazua.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk embarked on an immediate shake-up of the networking service within days of his Twitter acquisition in November 2022. Musk sacked three top-tier Twitter executives and laid off thousands of employees, rumor had it that he gave out hefty severance payments and the company moved on. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey had timidly spoken in support of the sacking, implying it had to happen but it was too swift and too soon, he also apologized and carried some of the blame for expanding the company too soon when he was on board. Dorsey however, did not shy away from the Musk takeover, admitting the company was on the right path. Elon Musk explained that Twitter was losing four million dollars a day and his move to cut jobs was to stem financial losses. In efforts to keep the platform afloat, Musk allowed registration for a fee. While he saw his action as encouraging free speech by nodding in serious identifiable clients who paid, critics countered that he was inviting the haters.

DUBAI, 30th November, 2022 (WAM) -- AMEA Power, one of the fastest growing renewable energy companies in the Middle East, announced today that it has achieved a financial close to deliver 1 GigaWatts (GW) of Wind and Solar Energy projects in Egypt. The landmark 500 MegaWatts (MW) wind and 500MW solar projects, represent US$1.1 billion of investment into the Egyptian economy and takes the Company's clean energy portfolio to 2GW in the country. AMEA Power will build, own and operate the 500MW solar PV plant, which will be located in the Aswan governorate of Egypt. The Project is being financed by International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank Group, Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank (FMO) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The 500MW wind farm, located in the Red Sea Governorate, is being developed in partnership with Sumitomo Corporation, who will own 40 percent equity in the Project. Financing is being provided by a consortium of banks, including Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and IFC, together with Standard Chartered Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank participating as co-lenders under Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) cover. Both projects have already secured Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) and Usufruct Agreements, with the New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) having already completed its feasibility studies. Hussain Al Nowais, Chairman of AMEA Power, said, "These landmark projects reflect the long-term commitment, ambition and growth of AMEA Power. The Company is leading the development of renewable energy across Africa, which through its global and regional partnerships, will deliver clean energy to millions of people around the continent. "We are proud to reach this significant milestone and to be supporting Egypt in its energy transition journey and drive to accelerate sustainable development. Today's achievement would not have been possible without the hard work of AMEA power's world-class team, the support of our project partners, lenders, advisors and the cooperation of the Egyptian government." The projects will underpin the renewable energy ambitions of Egypt, along with supporting economic and social development within the region. The Egyptian government is working towards increasing the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources to 42 percent by 2035. AMEA Power has also recently signed a Framework Agreement with the Egyptian Government, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, to develop a large-scale green hydrogen project, which will serve as a feedstock for the production of green ammonia. Once completed, the 1GW plant will be able to produce 800,000 tons of green ammonia per year for export. AMEA Power is rapidly expanding its investments in wind, solar, energy storage and green hydrogen, demonstrating its long term commitment to the global energy transition. The Company has clean energy pipeline of nearly 6GW across 15 countries. \</doc>

This year I attended my first COP event as part of the JLL and UAE delegations, and I had first-time excitement and apprehension. With 200 representative countries participating at COP27 , I really wanted to see tangible actions that aligned with the 2016 Paris Agreement. Going into the global event, the goals were clear for everyone \- to avoid the worst consequences of climate crisis, we must hold total temperature rise within the agreed upon 1.5-degrees Celsius temperate limit. This means cutting emissions by 45% this decade and reaching a Net Zero, pollution neutral world by 2050. On arrival on day 1, it was clear that regardless of political influence, status or job title, everyone on the ground wanted to align with the goals of COP27 and were passionate about decarbonisation. My thoughts were on how can we all work together, and how does decision making and impact flow from policy makers, NGOs, financial institutes, utility providers, corporations and building owners? The scene was set on Day 1 by John Kerry who said, "It is true that 20 countries \- including the United States  are now responsible for 80% of all emissions. It is also true that 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are responsible for only 0.55% of total emissions" and yet "17 of the world's 20 most climate vulnerable countries are on this continent." This statement was far from any parity I'd ever known, and I wanted to see what actions these 20 countries were taking and what their commitments would be at this year's COP, both for themselves and supporting the most vulnerable developing nations. The resonating roadblocks and challenges from discussions were finance, legislation and innovation. The vast majority appeared to be waiting for their government to implement sustainability legislation before taking any action against the biggest climate disaster ever seen. There were further questions about receiving tax credits, green finance or grants and a mindset of 'when green concrete is affordable and available, we will transition' \- which will be too late. Even though we are 50% behind on our climate commitment, the vast majority are unfortunately still kicking the can down the road. Show me the money! The opening day at COP was finance day and all eyes were on the biggest perceived roadblocks in the world of decarbonisation. How is green finance not significantly cheaper than brown finance? Where can we get the investment to upgrade our building portfolio to transition to Net Zero? Where are all these grants and investments we keep hearing about and how do we unlock it? The main focus was on supporting countries directly affected by climate change and enabling infrastructure transitions. The climate investments coalition shared assessments of their US $130bn clean energy and climate investment for emerging and developing countries. NGOs play a huge role in financing climate change grants \- Mark Suzman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation spoke about the ability of NGOs to provide grants that financial institutes don't have the ability to fund at the beginning of a non-profits journey due to risk profiles, and when proved successful, will unlock more formal financing. The World Bank also spoke about the lack of private investment in developing countries being a huge roadblock for banking investment \- they also committed $8.5bn to the most vulnerable regions. My perception of the ongoing issue with finance is that insurers don't recognise the investment as a way to de-risk potential claims, and investors don't understand the value of carbon \- its a chicken and egg scenario unfortunately. If we don't invest in resilience however, we will have to pay for the catastrophic outcomes and if we don't invest in buildings' decarbonisation, then we will have obsolete assets in a few years (this is an over-simplified statement but fairly true). Buildings, buildings, buildings My real focus at COP27 was buildings and I was delighted that this year, the built environment was one of the key themes of COP27 (and for a good reason). With the whole life cycle carbon at an all-time high of 10 GTCO2 in 2021 (up 5% from 2019) and operational demand at an all-time high of 135EJ (a 4% increase from 2019), it appears we aren't moving forward. The escalation problem is due to a lack of action with existing building stock and that we are building nearly 50m square metres of real estate every week across the world. The COP27 The Race to Zero announced that partners from the finance sector totaled 550 financial institutions with $150tn in assets at COP27 , with significant growth since COP26 (450 members, $130tn). Furthermore, over 300 interim Net Zero targets were published by COP27 by Race to Zero Partners from the finance sector. The Banking Alliance represents 40% of global banking assets from 41 countries including from developing countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean. This is a significant and tangible commitment from just one industry's assets, gaining real traction. We need other building sectors to follow. Changes from COP27 In years past, corporates were not invited to the top table at COP but it is clear that this is changing and that corporates and the private sector have a huge role to play in the transition implementation. There was huge representation from the first ever Youth Envoy in Egypt \- their energy, voices and issues resonated across every platform and discussion. They brought a new perspective to old problems, although at times they seemed oversimplified, I did conclude on many issues we had in fact over-complicated the issues overtime, and this fresh perspective should be leveraged. Aside from the goodwill shown at COP27 , there were a few tangible takeaways that impressed me: Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Slovenia, Switzerland and Belgium pledged $105mn to fund adaption in developing countries Mexico pledged to cut gases by 35% by 2030 \- if one of the top 20 emitters and a developing nation can commit to such a huge task, why can't others? Indonesia launched their just energy partnership with $20bn to accelerate their energy transition. Their focus is on hydro and geothermal power 250 businesses signed the 'We Mean Business Coalition' from a buildings perspective. Those who signed up will half their whole lifecycle carbon by 2030 \- these are clear and tangible commitments, which are my favourite! Singapore has committed to raise their carbon tax by 16 fold by 2030 \- this for me is a way of unlocking finance fast to re-invest in decarbonisation, and I hope see more of it in our region And the best by far was on closing day with a breakthrough agreement to provide 'loss and damage' funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. An array of states, regional governments and development agencies pledged $230mn to the Adaptation Fund to help vulnerable communities around the world adapt to climate change. What these initiatives demonstrate is that actions can be taken and that everyone is approaching the problem in a different way, but there are lots of lessons that can be taken away from the successes of these and others that have come before. The UAE's journey to Net Zero As expected, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE had a huge presence at COP27 with notable pavilions and commitments. Earlier this year, the UAE released more ambitious targets of a 31% reduction in GHGs by 2030, and at COP, they officially launched the National Net Zero by 2050 Pathway that will drive the implementation of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative. The UAE and Egypt also signed a joint agreement on a wind energy production facility worth $20bn. The good news is that the next COP event is less than a year away, and with all eyes on the UAE as the host of COP28, you can bet that there will be a huge push on additional commitments made in the last few weeks, with the rest of the Middle East on its coat tails. Closing thoughts The COP events are not a magical formula for saving the world, but they do bring us to a point of alignment and measurement every year. Thus, these events enable us to push this important agenda, highlight gaps or failings of commitment and, crucially, open a forum for greater impact. I'm looking forward to keeping the focus on sustainability in the region, and enforcing the fact that nothing is impossible to a willing mind.

DUBAI, 13th July, 2022 (WAM) -- Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, met with Gerd M&uuml;ller, Director-General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), to discuss ways to strengthen collaboration to optimise UNIDO's Competitive Industrial Performance (CIP) Index. The discussions support both parties' objectives and are in line with the goals of the Global Manufacturing and Industrial Summit (GMIS), a joint initiative between the Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology (MoIAT) and UNIDO. The virtual meeting was attended by Hamad Ali Al Kaabi, UAE Ambassador to Austria, and Omar Ahmed Suwaina Al Suwaidi, Undersecretary of MoIAT. Attendees underlined the importance of forming a joint team between MoIAT and UNIDO to help achieve the ninth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), which is to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation. The meeting is part of the Ministry's plans to enhance the capabilities and competitiveness of the industrial sector, as well as to consolidate relations with relevant regional and international institutions in support of the national industrial and advanced technology strategy. The meeting covered enhancing competitiveness, exchanging industrial information to serve the global value chain, incentivizing investment in research and development, and supporting diversification of industries using advanced technology. The meeting also touched on the UAE's contribution and support to the Hydrogen in Industry Day event planned at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. Delegates also discussed forming a taskforce to create a roadmap to enhance cooperation in the build up to COP28, which will be held next year at Expo Dubai. The choice to host the conference in the UAE represents the international community's appreciation for the country's efforts and active role in climate action. This includes environmental protection and capacity building in the field of clean and renewable energy, reducing emissions and limiting global warming. UNIDO's CIP Index benchmarks the ability of countries to produce and export manufactured goods competitively. It provides a graphical summary capturing the competitive performance of countries. The UAE is currently ranked first in the region. \</doc>

DUBAI, 18th August, 2022 (WAM) -- The Arab Youth Council for Climate Change of the Arab Youth Centre, in collaboration with HSBC bank, issued the Arab Youth Toolkits: 'Action Steps for a Sustainable Lifestyle - Conscious Consumerism,' which highlights the best practices for achieving sustainability to young talents in the Arab region. The announcement coincided with a training course held by the council's "The Arab Youth Council for Climate Change (AYCCC)," to prepare for 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt and COP28 in the UAE. The training course was attended by the network's members and several experts and specialists, under the theme, "On the Road to COP," in cooperation with the United Nations (UN) Coordination Office in the UAE. The guide, the first of its kind issued by the council, focuses on six areas and aims to enable Arab individuals and communities to improve their water and food consumption, shopping patterns, waste management, travel and housing. The guide and training course aims to improve the work of the council, established in 2021 by the Arab Youth Centre in Abu Dhabi, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment and the Office of the UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, under the umbrella of the Arab League. On the occasion, Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and the UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, lauded the council's initiative to draft a comprehensive climate change manual, which aims to introduce the youth to the best sustainability and resource rationalisation practices. He also highlighted the importance of involving young leaders in climate action based on the best practices. "Due to the directives and unlimited support of the country's leadership, the UAE has established a successful model of empowering the youth to lead local climate action and participate in global climate action. We are looking forward to the participation of the youth in COP28 hosted by the UAE in 2023 at the Expo Dubai City," he said. Effective and positive change are started by individuals, and every individual is capable of being an ambassador for sustainability issues and can raise awareness about them, he added. Shamma bint Suhail Faris Al Mazrui, Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Vice President of the Arab Youth Centre, stressed that youth play a key role in achieving sustainable development goals and addressing the effects of climate change, as well as in the region's efforts to host COP27 and COP28. The UAE leadership is keen to enable the youth to play their role and contribute to various areas of sustainability. She then pointed out that the council and the Arab Climate Action Network have set a comprehensive agenda of activities, initiatives, events and programmes, supported by the Arab Youth Centre, headed by Sheikh Theyab bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the Centre. She also stressed that the Arab Youth Council for Climate Change has adopted several strategic objectives. These include empowering the Arab youth and teaching them the required skills to address the challenges posed by climate change, being vocal at related Arab and international events, presenting strategic recommendations to decision-makers in the Arab region, and suggesting effective solutions in partnership with the public and private sectors. \</doc>

MANILA, 30th October, 2022 (WAM) - As the global community will gather in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the COP27 climate conference, on 6th November, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) announced that it will launch several flagship initiatives at the key decision-making forum of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change and its impacts. The ADB says COP27 ADB will launch several flagship initiatives at COP27 , including the Asia Pacific Water Resilience Initiative, which will promote resilient water management in the region, as well as the Blue Pacific Finance Hub, which aims to restore ocean health, build coastal resilience, and develop sustainable blue economies. ADB will launch the Just Transition Support Platform to help strengthen ADB&rsquo;s work in the just transition space, which seeks to ensure that the benefits of the shift to low-carbon, resilient economies are shared equally and no individual, community, or region is left behind. ADB is also piloting an Innovative Finance Facility for Climate in Asia and Pacific (IFCAP), which will use guarantees and grant contributions from donor countries and philanthropies to leverage $4 for every $1. IFCAP will be launched next year to help provide much-needed investment for both climate change adaptation and mitigation. Climate change is the critical issue of lifetime and the past 12 months has provided a stark reminder of the human impacts on climate especially in Asia and the Pacific. Historically devastating flooding in Pakistan, extreme drought in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, tropical cyclones in the Pacific Islands and typhoons in the Philippines have impacted hundreds of millions of poor, vulnerable people. The reality is that these kinds of weather events caused by climate change will increase in intensity and frequency. Therefore, COP outcomes are particularly important for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC to keep global warming below 1.5&ordm;C. &ldquo;We cannot avoid all the impacts of climate change, they are already happening, so we have to focus on building resilience of the most vulnerable communities,&rdquo; said ADB Climate Envoy Warren Evans. COP27 COP27 is taking place at a time of unprecedented challenges worldwide. The global community must come together for a renewed global commitment in Egypt to decarbonize at scale and to greatly expand concessional and grant resources to developing countries which are suffering the most. &ldquo;It is time to step up and mobilize the kind of resources, with the kind of conditions, that allow countries to really use those resources to adapt to and become more resilient to climate change,&rdquo; said Mr. Evans. \</doc>

Dr Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber As the United Arab Emirates' energy transition gathers pace before it hosts the United Nations climate conference next year, it is looking to climate partners such as China to help it sustain the momentum, its climate change special envoy says. Dr Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE's Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, said the UAE is seeing "record growth in renewables", representing more than 80 per cent of all new power-generating capacity last year. However, he said, a transformative and pragmatic global energy transition is needed to deliver climate action; and while wind and solar accounted for the vast majority of all new power-generating capacity last year, this still only accounts for 4 per cent of today's energy mix. A successful energy transition mu st make progress with economic and climate action in tandem, he said. "I see many more opportunities for collaboration with China as we continue to build and adapt to clean-energy solutions." Dr Al Jaber praised China's focus on excellence in all aspects of the renewable energy supply chain, from research and development to materials, manufacturing and installation, which he said "sets the standard for other countries to follow". "Solar, in particular, is an example of where the government has encouraged growth with Supporting policies, resulting in China's leadership in both solar power generation and manufacturing. There is much to learn from this example." China's leadership in technology "is also helping the world take advantage of the commercial opportunities of the energy transition", Dr Al Jaber said, citing a consortium of Chinese companies that is partnering with the UAE to develop and build Al Dhafra Solar Park, 35 kilometres south of Abu Dhabi. It will become one of the world's largest solar plants, delivering more than 2 gigawatts of clean energy, Al Jaber said. China "is leading the world with respect to solar, in both manufacturing and supply chains", he said. The UAE, he said, has three of the world's largest single-site solar plants. The Noor Abu Dhabi Solar plant has 3.2 million solar panels and has been developed with expertise and investment from the Chinese clean technology company Jinko Power. "As we prepare for COP 28 UAE, there are many lessons we can draw on from China's experience in practical, commercially viable clean tech development," Dr Al Jaber said. COP 28 next year is the 28th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties. COP 27 will be held in Egypt in November. \</doc>

The two giant green domes standing out against the desert landscape house a dazzling display of high-tech gadgets and world-changing technologies interspersed with lush vegetation and light wood furnishings. They're a stunning testament to the bright future that awaits those who join the fight against climate change at COP27 and they were built by Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest exporter of oil. Producers of the fossil fuels responsible for warming the planet are shifting gears, veterans of the annual gathering say. In the space of a few months, they've gone from slowing down and blocking climate action in high-level talks behind closed doors, to setting up giant pavilions next to the COP venue in Egypt and deploying an army of lobbyists with a new message, one that seeks to embrace a clean future without giving up on the dirty fuels of the past. Oil giants make their case at COP27 "We can do both," Adel Al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia's climate envoy and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said on the sidelines of COP27 . Pump oil "and at the same time reduce emissions." Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which is hosting next year's climate summit, have committed to eliminating their net emissions of planet-warming gases by 2060 and 2050 respectively, and are investing billions of dollars in renewable energy. Once seen as the outsiders of climate meetings, their fortunes have changed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked a global energy crisis. The very countries that made them feel unwelcome at last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow, are now pressing them to pump more oil and gas to fill the gap left by plunging Russian supplies. That's driven up prices and filled their coffers just as consuming nations struggle with rising inflation and slowing economies. "Oil producers felt unwanted in COP26, felt like we were in a corner," UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al-Mazrouei said in April. "Now, we're like superheroes." Middle Eastern oil and gas exporters have their eye on long-term dynamics too. At COP26, almost 200 countries pledged to phase down unabated coal power. India, with backing from the EU, UK and small island states, is pushing for that pledge to be extended to all fossil fuels in the final agreement for COP27 . Saudi Arabia is opposed to that approach, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the energy minister, said in an interview last week. The kingdom plans to keep producing hydrocarbons until the end of the 21st century because the world needs "all sorts of energy." "They are moving from a defensive policy to an offensive one," said Laurence Tubiana, Chief Executive Officer at the European Climate Foundation and architect of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement that saw world leaders commit to keeping global warming below 2C by the end of the century. "It signals that they are anxious." Inside Saudi Arabia's green domes, giant screens show slick videos of plans to restore forests and reintroduce turtles and baby ibex to their natural habitats. Visitors sink into bean bags and sip fruit juice as they learn about the country's different initiatives. Those accredited are treated to a buffet that included salads, pasta, meat and multiple types of bread. It's a stark contrast to the Egyptian-run COP27 area where, for the first few days, bottled water was scarce and food consisted of pricy smoked chicken and salmon sandwiches.

"This meeting has turned into a fossil fuel festival, a trade show and a place to make deals." At least 14 gas announcements have been made in the run up to and during COP27 , while the number of lobbyists from fossil fuel industries has soared. A total of 636 lobbyists attended COP27 , 100 more than last year's meeting, according to environmental non-profit Global Witness. Among them was BP Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney, who got accredited through the Mauritania delegation. Taken as a group, fossil fuel lobbyists are larger than any single national delegation besides the UAE, host of COP28. The UAE delegation has grown from 176 delegates in 2021, to 1,070 this year. "Egypt as a fossil fuel producer has been hosting a number of events featuring some of these folks and talking about the need for natural gas to be a transition fuel," Meyer said. "It's concerning that the current and the incoming presidency are saying we don't rapidly need to shift away from fossil fuels." Lobbyists won't divert the EU from its goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, the European Commission climate chief Frans Timmermans told reporters in Sharm el-Sheikh on Tuesday, shortly after announcing that the EU would tighten its emissions target. "As long as you see them with clarity and you make sure you're not steered by them, I don't see a problem," Timmermans said. "Excluding them might mean they'll go somewhere else and try to exert their influence there." COP27 statement that calls for the phase down of fossil fuels. The Like Minded Developing Countries, a coalition including Saudi Arabia, China, Iraq and Iran, also wants the statement to "take note" of rather "welcome" the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which says limiting global warming will require a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use.

UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan will attend the COP27 UN climate change conference in Egypt, reports WAM. The UAE President will be joined by world leaders including US President Joe Biden, Brazil's recent election winner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and UK PM Rishi Sunak at the gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh. The aim of the conference is for countries to engage in focussed constructive dialogue aimed at addressing the global climate change emergency. UAE will highlight progress at Cop27 President Sheikh Mohamed will lead the delegation from the UAE at Cop27 as the country looks to highlight its sustainable development partnerships. Ahead of the visit to Cop27 President Sheikh Mohamed and US President Joe Biden discussed a recently signed $100bn energy deal between the two nations. The UAE-US Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) will see $100bn in funding and investment to deploy 100 new gigawatts of clean energy in the US, UAE, and emerging economies around the world by 2035. The 2015 agreement, signed at COP21, 194 countries agreed to work towards agreed targets to reduce emission targets. The agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations: Substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 degrees Celsius while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees; Review countries' commitments every five years; and Provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change, strengthen resilience and enhance abilities to adapt to climate impacts. President Sheikh Mohamed will highlight the significant progress made by the UAE since it became the first country in the Middle East to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement and commit to lowering its carbon emissions. Following Cop27 Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and Chairman of the Higher Committee overseeing the COP28 preparations, said the country would also work closely with Egypt, which will host the upcoming COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh in November, to support momentum for greater climate progress. The minister's announcements came after the fourth meeting of the COP28 UAE Higher Committee, which discussed all strategic, technical and administrative elements related to the summit. Climate change is a serious crisis facing the world, according to 8 out of 10 UAE residents surveyed by management consultancy firm Kearney. The study, published ahead of the UN Cop27 conference held in Egypt this month, also revealed that 70% of people think urgent action is needed in the next five years to minimise the impact and secure a sustainable future. Most people in the UAE said that addressing climate change issues would have a positive impact on social issues, with 81% believing that climate change has a deep impact on the livelihoods of people in different countries. Mauricio Zuazua, Partner at Kearney Middle East, said: "In the past decade, countries in the Middle East region have made sustainability and energy transition a national priority. "We've seen commitments such as the UAE Net Zero 2050 and the KSA Net Zero 2060 come into place to combat climate change at a national level, and a number of clean energy initiatives." The UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative is a national drive to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, making the country the first in the Middle East and North Africa to do so. 50% of residents believe the country is on the right track to achieving this target, with 73% highlighting that corporates have a significant role to play in driving this. More than half (56%) believe corporations need to do more to slow down climate change, and 72% state that new technologies should be implemented to mitigate the climate crisis.

ABU DHABI, 17th November, 2022 (WAM) \- Masdar, one of the world\' s leading renewable energy companies, announced today that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Jordan\' s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to explore collaboration in renewable energy projects with a total capacity of up to 2 gigawatts (GW). The MoU was signed by Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Special Envoy for Climate Change and Chairman of Masdar, and Dr Saleh Al-Kharabsheh, the Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, at an event on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). Al-Kharabsheh said,  Jordan is already a pioneer in renewable energy development in the region, where it currently produces around 29 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, and aims to increase this share to 50 percent by 2030. The country is also looking to become a regional hub for green energy production benefiting from the abundance of renewable energy energies, in addition to its central location in the Middle East and Africa.  In Jordan, we believe in the collaborative work; whether on the regional or national level, and the partnership with our brothers in the UAE and Masdar under this agreement will help our country to reach our sustainability ambitions. As per the MoU, the two sides will explore the development and investment in renewable energy projects in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan with a production capacity of up to 2 GW. The memorandum also includes exchange of expertise and knowledge in the areas of renewable energy and infrastructure development, including electricity transformation, distribution, and exportation. Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer, Masdar, said,  Masdar has been a proud partner of Jordan for nearly 10 years, helping to deliver pioneering renewable energy projects that contribute to the country\' s sustainable development. With this latest MoU, we hope to increase the impact and depth of our collaboration with Jordan in the area of renewable energy. Through the MoU, Masdar may significantly increase its renewable energy footprint in Jordan, which currently includes two major renewable energy plants. In 2015, Masdar delivered the Tafila Wind Farm in Jordan, the first commercial utility-scale wind power project in the Middle East. The 117-megawatt (MW) wind farm increased the country\' s total power capacity by 3 percent. Masdar was also the developer and lead partner on the 200 MW Baynouna project, located east of Amman, which is the largest single solar energy project in Jordan. Since 2020, the project has been meeting the annual power needs of approximately 160,000 homes, displacing an estimated 360,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. It generates 563 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity each year, equivalent to 4 percent of the annual energy consumption of Jordan. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 13th October, 2022 (WAM) -- ADIPEC, the world's biggest and most influential gathering of the energy industry, hosted by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), has unveiled a line-up of more than 40 international ministers to speak at this year's strategic conference, including eight from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. With the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) starting in Egypt the week after ADIPEC, and COP28 coming to the UAE in 2023, policymakers are expected to gather in Abu Dhabi to discuss solutions to the energy security and sustainability challenges, including how to respond to current global energy-market challenges while delivering on climate action and sustainability commitments. The UAE has taken a leading role in ensuring basic energy needs of today are met, and economies do not slow down, because that will put the brakes on much-needed investment in climate action. The eight ministers from the MENA region, representing some of the largest energy producers in the world, confirmed to speak in the daily Ministerial Panels are Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Managing Director and Group CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC); Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure; Mohammad Al Faris, Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Oil, Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs; Mohammed bin Mubarak bin Daina, Bahraini Minister of Oil; Minister of Environment, Special Envoy for Climate Affairs; Tarek El Molla, Egyptian Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources; Dr. Saleh Al Kharabsheh, Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources; Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismail, Iraqi Minister of Oil; and Zafer Melhem, Chairman of the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority. Ministerial panel discussions at ADIPEC 2022 will encompass the most pertinent geopolitical, sustainability and economic issues around the future of energy supply, security, and affordability, including sessions on "Geopolitics of today: how the energy industry is navigating through change", and " COP27 : key policy considerations to deliver net-zero ambitions in an uncertain time". Tayba Al Hashemi, Chair of ADIPEC 2022 and CEO of ADNOC Sour Gas, said, "Abu Dhabi and the UAE are increasingly seen at the heart of the global dialogue on the future of energy, evidenced by the record number of global government ministers attending. It is an event that convenes the global energy industry and is accelerating a pragmatic and progressive energy transition by ensuring we maintain investment in the energy we need today, while investing in the energies of the future. "This year, ADIPEC takes place against a backdrop of changing global energy and geopolitical landscapes, with the energy trilemma of balancing cost, sustainability, and security in sharp focus for populations and energy producers around the world. Taking place just one week before COP27 in Egypt and one year before COP28 in the UAE, ADIPEC will provide an important platform for industry, innovators and policymakers to demonstrate the strategies, climate action and investment required to help accelerate the transition and deliver decarbonisation," he added. The strategic conference at this year's ADIPEC will enable the anticipated 12,000 conference delegates to gain early insight into how governments around the world are navigating this narrow path. The panels are part of this year's expanded conference, with more than 350 sessions scheduled across a comprehensive strategic and technical programme. Attending delegates will have in-person access to hear influential, expert voices and a broad range of up-to-the-minute content from over 1,200 industry and ministerial speakers. Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, organisers of ADIPEC 2022, commented, "ADIPEC attendees will once again hear from a stellar line-up of speakers, drawn from the very pinnacle of the global energy industry and government. "This is testament to both the convening power of ADIPEC, bringing together policymakers, industry leaders and energy professionals from around the world, as well as its role as a forum to address the key current issues faced by the energy industry and develop the ideas and solutions that will shape the future of energy. I am looking forward eagerly to this year's high-level strategic dialogue, which will undoubtedly be both an influence upon, and preview of, discussions at COP27 ," he further explained. As well as government ministers, the strategic programme at ADIPEC 2022 will be a platform for high-level industry leaders to give insights into strategy, policy and the future of energy. Participating leadership from key regional companies includes ADNOC Group CEO Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, and Mubadala Energy CEO Mansoor Mohamed Al Hamed. ADIPEC 2022 will also feature a new Decarbonisation Zone, providing a focus on methane, hydrogen, Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and new energies, which will spotlight the industry's path towards net-zero through deployment of cleaner forms of energy and innovative technologies. \</doc>

Developing world is increasingly frustrated with rich countries' refusal to pay their fair share for a crisis for which they bear overwhelming responsibility File photo Some fear that this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference - to be held in Egypt from November 6 to 18 - will be an unintended casualty of the geopolitical tensions and economic challenges the world is facing. I believe the opposite: COP27 represents a unique and timely opportunity for the world to come together, recognize our common interests, and restore multilateral cooperation. The human cost of climate change is making headlines almost daily. No society has been left unscathed by more frequent and intense droughts, wildfires, storms, and floods. Millions of people are already battling for survival. And that is with temperatures having risen by just 1.1\'b0 Celsius. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made clear, every additional tenth of a degree makes matters worse. Yet the changes needed to avert catastrophe are not being made, at least not fast enough, and the developing world is increasingly frustrated with rich countries' refusal to pay their fair share for a crisis for which they bear overwhelming responsibility. But there is reason for hope. In my discussions with delegations around the world, I see their determination to make COP27 a success. Already, societies are starting to act. Climate adaptation and new forms of collaboration are gaining traction, and investment in climate tech is booming. This includes new carbon-removal technologies, electric transport solutions, and renewable energies. As a result, clean-energy prices continue to fall: almost two-thirds of renewable power added in G20 countries in 2021 cost less than the cheapest coal-fired options. My country, Egypt, is on track to produce 42% of its energy from renewable resources by 2035. At the same time, civil society is devising mechanisms for holding companies and governments to account. More ambition, scale, and speed are needed, and the rules remain unclear or contested. But a process is underway, and there is no going back. Even in countries that might seem to be wavering in their commitments - say, by investing in fossil-fuel infrastructure - officials insist that stopgap measures necessitated by immediate challenges should not be mistaken for long-term strategies. No one doubts the greener road ahead. The question for those of us who will participate in COP27 is straightforward: How can we seize the opportunity the conference offers to create a sense of common endeavour, prevent backsliding, and inspire an approach based on science, trust, justice, and equity? At its heart, climate action is a bargain. Developing countries have agreed in good faith to help tackle a crisis they did not cause, on the understanding that support - particularly financial support - would be provided to complement their own efforts, which are often limited due to their scarce resources and competing development needs. Developed countries must uphold their end of that bargain, by supporting both mitigation and adaptation, thus fulfilling their envisaged responsibilities in the Paris agreement. On the mitigation front, we must move from rhetoric to action in cutting our greenhouse-gas emissions and removing carbon from our atmosphere. All countries must embrace more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions, and then translate those pledges into programmes. We must act now to ensure appropriate resources are available to developing countries to unlock their potential. At the same time, we must craft a transformative adaptation agenda, so that communities - especially in climate-vulnerable regions - can protect themselves from the effects that are already unavoidable. The bill for this agenda must be divided fairly. To date, a disproportionate share of climate finance has been directed toward mitigation, leaving developing countries largely to fend for themselves in financing adaptation investment. But even the finance provided for mitigation is far from sufficient and has not been delivered with the appropriate instruments. In 2009, developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion annually for climate action in the developing world by 2020. This is only a small portion of the more than $5.8 trillion that is needed (up until 2030), according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's Standing Committee on Finance. And yet this amount has not been delivered. We need an increase in the scale of finance pledges - especially for adaptation - at COP27 , compared to those made at COP26 in Glasgow. Developed countries must also honor the pledge they made last year to double adaptation finance by 2025, and they should provide the assurances needed for the Green Climate Fund's new replenishment. And the time has come to address the loss and damage suffered by countries that did not cause the climate crisis. This remains contentious, but I believe that we can approach it constructively, guided by the priorities of developing countries, for the benefit of all. A just transition must account for the needs of various regions. For example, African countries are committed in principle to adopting renewable energy and refraining from exploiting their fossil-fuel resources. But 600 million people in Africa - 43% of the continent's population - currently lack electricity, and around 900 million don't have access to clean cooking fuels. The climate-action bargain demands that this be addressed, and the continent's broader development needs be met, in sustainable ways. All of these imperatives must be pursued together, with a carefully designed package of actions, rather than through piecemeal measures. They are the pillars of a just transition. If one is missing, the entire edifice collapses. Ahead of the 2015 COP in Paris, few believed that an agreement would be reached. Yet delegates from all over the world came together, and through skill and perseverance, reached a groundbreaking deal. In 2022, we face even higher hurdles, so we must work even harder to clear them. If we do, we will usher in a new age of clean energy, innovation exchange, food and water security, and greater climate justice. As daunting as this challenge is, we have no choice but to confront it. We must negotiate with one another, because there can be no negotiating with the climate. - Sameh Shoukry is COP27 President-Designate and Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 9th November, 2022 (WAM) -- As part of its participation in the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El Sheikh, the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE) co-hosted a fireside chat on the UAE Green Bond and Sukuk Programme with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). During the session, MoCCAE announced the issue of a new situation analysis report of the green bond and sukuk market in the UAE as part of its efforts to support the growth of sustainable finance in the country. Al Hashmi said, "Innovative financing solutions are key enablers of our efforts to promote the adoption of sustainable practices across all sectors with the aim of achieving national climate goals and accelerating our transition to a low-carbon economy. Therefore, MOCCAE works with its strategic partners to raise awareness among key finance and investment players about the importance of green bonds and sukuk as effective financial instruments to boost sustainability." "We are making great strides in developing the sustainable finance sector through the Dubai Declaration on Sustainable Finance and the Abu Dhabi Sustainable Finance Declaration, as well as the UAE Sustainable Finance Framework. The UAE is one of the most active countries in the region in the issuance of green bonds and sukuk, and the UAE Green Bond and Sukuk Programme Development: Situation Analysis Report aspires to contribute to strengthening the enabling environment for sustainable finance activities," he added. The report indicates that despite the increased uptake of green financial instruments, they may still not be adequately understood by the wider financial services community. Therefore, the document seeks to help bridge any information gaps by laying out the fundamentals of green bonds and sukuk and the current market conditions in the UAE. It also offers recommendations for further development of the domestic sustainable finance market. The report builds on the UAE Sustainable Finance Framework, launched in January 2021, and supports investments in low-carbon, environmentally sustainable, and climate-resilient projects. In preparing the document, MOCCAE has gathered insights from leading financial institutions and relevant public sector stakeholders to gauge their market readiness for issuing and investing in green bonds and sukuk, as well as the needs and priorities for the development of the green fixed-income market in the country. In line with the vision of its wise leadership, the UAE seeks to consolidate its status as a global sustainability hub by identifying innovative solutions that support national efforts to protect the environment and drive sustainable economic development to build a better future for the current and next generations. Over the past years, the total value of the domestic market for green sukuk, bonds, and loans has reached nearly US$17 billion. While in 2020, the size of the global market for green sukuk was estimated at US$1 trillion. The report addresses current methodology of issuing green bonds and sukuk while elaborating on their ability to provide comprehensive and cost-effective financing. It also connects parties that have tangible bankable projects with mega financing institutions, such as pension funds. The document will be used as tool and an enabler to bridge the gap between stakeholders and encourage more sustainable financing practices. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 16th November, 2022 (WAM) - Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), highlighted how the organization is promoting effective discussions on nature-based solutions and its impact on climate action during an engagement with stakeholders, at COP27 , held from November 6 to 18, 2022, at Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Co-hosted by UNFCCC - WGEO and HSBC Middle East, the session titled 'The Role of Green Economy in Nature-based Solutions,' featured a series of multistakeholder dialogues exploring the role biodiversity plays in the protection of humankind and the financing required to protect both the preservation of Nature and people. Al Tayer emphasized how nature-based solutions or processes could significantly minimise climate change and its effects while also addressing the regional challenges, such as air, water, and soil pollution, as well as stressed on the value of social inclusion, the role of international collaboration, social innovation, and the private sector in advancing the development of nature-based solutions. Al Tayer delivered the opening remarks for the session. The session was moderated by David Ramos - Senior Sustainability Manager, HSBC Bank Middle East; along with other prominent members including Hussein Makhlouf, local Administration and Environment Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic, Ahmed Buti Al Muhairbi, Secretary-General of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Dr. Mostafa Foda - National Focal Point for Convention of Biodiversity in Egypt, Waleed Salman, Vice Chairman of WGEO and Abdulrahim Sultan, Director-General of WGEO. Al Tayer, in his speech said: "The world is witnessing major crises across all sectors due to climate change, which has caused natural disasters in various regions worldwide. Europe experienced its worst drought in at least 500 years, shrinking water levels in key rivers. One third of Pakistan was completely and deeply flooded with rainwater bringing widespread destruction and misery. The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that climate change will impact water quality and availability. Globally, 800 million to 3 billion people are projected to experience chronic water scarcity due to droughts at 2\'b0C warming. This calls for climate action at all levels, to protect economies, livelihoods, and ecosystems." Al Tayer further stated, "What is needed today is solutions that address several challenges at once. Transitioning to a green economy as well as resorting to nature-based solutions will contribute to enhancing food and water security, address climate change and biodiversity loss, and strengthen the response to disasters. Climate-smart agriculture, forestation, and natural ecosystems restoration are multi-faceted, serving the economy, people and the climate response. Platforms like COP 27 not only allow global stakeholders to have their voices heard, but also provide a forum to address climate change, share best practices and build commitments. Most significantly, such platforms make sure that all stakeholders are fully committed to and involved in all measures intended to curtail climate change. This will help the society and wildlife in successfully adapting and ensure preservation of the ecosystem on planet Earth." "The UAE attaches great importance to adopting the principles and practices of green economy to achieve sustainable development and combat the repercussions of climate change. The UAE is leading this effort by setting a framework for achieving net-zero emissions, launching green initiatives, and ambitious national strategies and policies that will help reduce carbon emissions and adapt to climate change, as well as find a smooth path towards achieving economic prosperity that goes in parallel with environmental sustainability. To support the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 and the Dubai Net Zero Carbon Emissions Strategy 2050 to provide 100% of the total power production capacity from clean energy sources by 2050, Dubai launched major strategic initiatives and development projects. These projects, built through Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), include the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the world's largest single-site solar park using the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model with a production capacity of 5,000 megawatts by 2030; the pumped-storage hydroelectric power plant in Hatta using clean energy, which is the first of its kind in the GCC region; and the Green Hydrogen project that DEWA implemented at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. It is the first pilot project of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa for green hydrogen production", Al Tayer said. Al Tayer also emphasised the importance of nature-based solutions to enhance food and water security, address climate change and biodiversity loss, and strengthen the response to disasters, as well as how the UAE places strong focus on transitioning to a green economy. "Bridging these elements is also a priority, to make the implementation process as efficient, and effective as possible. Advancing the green economy requires international cooperation, guaranteeing a new approach and a stable partnership among all stakeholders globally. In this respect, the UAE government, along with WGEO, have launched the Global Alliance on Green Economy in September 2022, aiming to advance policymaking and implementation towards a green economy, at the global, regional, and national levels. Solutions under the Alliance will address the transition, climate change and sustainable development. Today's session at COP 27 , among others, will bring us closer to making such solutions available and accessible and lead us towards achieving our shared ambitions to combat the harmful effects of climate change, and support cooperation initiatives to help the world achieve future sustainability through the transition to a green economy", Al Tayer concluded. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 16th November, 2022 (WAM) - Masdar, the UAE's flagship clean energy company, and its consortium partners, Infinity Power Holding and Hassan Allam Utilities, announced that they have signed a framework agreement with leading Egyptian state-backed organizations on the development of a 2 gigawatt (GW) green hydrogen project in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE). The Masdar-led consortium signed two Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in April with Egyptian entities, related to the development of two green hydrogen production plants in the country, one in the SCZONE and the other on the Mediterranean. The consortium is targeting an electrolyzer capacity of 4 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, and an output of up to 480,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. Yesterday's agreement was signed on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in the presence of Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Special Envoy for Climate, and Chairman of Masdar, Dr Mohamed Shaker El-Markabi, Egypt's Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy and Hala Al-Said, Egypt's Minister of Planning and Economic Development. Dr Thani Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade, and Mariam Al Kaabi, UAE Ambassador to Egypt were also present. The signatories were Mohammad Abdelqader El-Ramahi, Director for Asset Management, Technology and Green Hydrogen, at Masdar, Amr Allam, Chief Executive Officer of Hassan Allam Utilities, and Mohamed Ismail Mansour, Chairman of Infinity Power Holding. CEOs from the state-backed organizations also attended the event. Dr Sultan Al Jaber said, "Today's announcement serves to strengthen the ties between the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Egypt and highlights our two nations' commitment to delivering zero-carbon energy solutions. This 4 GW green hydrogen program follows Masdar's announcement last week of a 10-gigawatt wind project in Egypt, also with our partners Hassan Allam Utilities and Infinity Power Holding - both will support Egypt's decarbonization objectives. Through Egypt's hosting of COP27 , our two countries have also been able to exchange expertise and share insights that we will take forward and build on in the UAE when we host COP28 next year." Mohamed Ismail Mansour, Chairman, Infinity Power, said, "We are honored to be working on our first ever Green Hydrogen project, as a part of the consortium with Masdar and Hassan Allam Utilities. The project is expected to facilitate economic growth for the country as well as help position Egypt as a Green Fuel Hub, propelling the country forward on its journey in becoming a green economy. We look forward to being a part of many such projects in the future." Amr Allam said, "Such strategic partnerships between Hassan Allam Utilities, Masdar, and Infinity Power provide more opportunities that support Egypt's transition towards a green economy and promote sustainable development across the country. We are proud to contribute to the development of green hydrogen production facilities in Egypt while leveraging the country's abundant natural resources." Nayer Fouad, CEO, Infinity Power, said, "We are always working towards expanding our portfolio of services across all technologies of sustainable energy production. This is a milestone event for us at Infinity Power, and we look forward to continuing to build upon our efforts with more Green Hydrogen projects as we move forward towards making the vision of a sustainable Africa a reality." Mohammed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO, Masdar, said: "Today's announcement takes us a vital step closer to advancing this massive collaborative project, which stands to bolster Egypt's energy independence and enable the production of high-value green hydrogen derivatives for export, like green ammonia. With the first green hydrogen molecule set to be produced by 2026, it is imperative we continue to maintain momentum to ensure timely completion of this groundbreaking undertaking." As per the agreement, the consortium will enter into a binding framework agreement with the SCZONE, the Egyptian New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA), Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC), and The Sovereign Fund of Egypt (TSFE). The agreement sets out the key terms and conditions for the green hydrogen development program with a focus on the first phase of the program. In the first phase of the project, the consortium will establish a green hydrogen manufacturing facility in the SCZONE, scheduled to begin operations by 2026. The electrolyzer facilities in the SCZONE and on the Mediterranean could be extended to up to 4 GW by 2030 to produce 2.3 million tonnes of green ammonia for export as well as supply green hydrogen for local industries. Egypt enjoys abundant solar and wind resources that can allow for the generation of renewable power at a highly competitive cost, a key enabler for green hydrogen production and is located within proximity to markets where demand for green hydrogen is expected to grow the most, providing a robust opportunity for export. Masdar, Infinity Power and Hassan Allan Utilities last week announced they had signed an agreement to develop a 10 GW onshore wind project in Egypt - one of the largest wind farms in the world. Once completed, the wind farm will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 23.8 million tonnes a year - equivalent to 9 percent of Egypt's current output Egypt is targeting renewables to make up 42 percent of its energy mix by 2035, while Egyptian authorities are reportedly working to revise the country's renewable energy strategy to include green hydrogen. Africa could capture as much as 10 percent of the global green hydrogen market, helping to create up to 3.7 million jobs and adding as much as US$120 billion to the continent's gross domestic product (GDP), according to a report issued jointly by Masdar and its Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) platform at COP27 last week. \</doc>

The COP27 climate talks in Egypt, which came close to collapse in the closing stretches, ended with an early-hours deal to create a fund to pay poorer countries for the harm caused by climate change. The agreement on loss and damage is a landmark moment in global climate politics - an acknowledgment that richer nations are responsible to the developing world for the harm caused by rising temperatures. But the fractious summit, which took place against the background of a global energy crisis sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, exposed fault lines on how the world should navigate the transition away from fossil fuels. And it did little to advance the ambitions of last year's COP in Glasgow to rein in harmful greenhouse gas emissions. "While progress on loss and damage was encouraging, it is disappointing that the decision mostly copy and pasted language from Glasgow about curbing emissions, rather than taking any significant new steps," said Ani Dasgupta, chief executive officer at the World Resources Institute. "It is mind-boggling that countries did not muster the courage to call for phasing down fossil fuels, which are the biggest driver of climate change." Final agreement came after 9 a.m. local time following a marathon final session that went through the night. The closing day of COP27 started with a threat from the European Union to walk out if the text didn't strengthen ambition to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and in the end there was no blanket pledge to phase down all fossil fuels and no target to see global emissions fall by 2025. Still, the agreement on loss and damage is a breakthrough, even if it's not clear how a fund will be financed or structured. It came after a flurry of last-minute negotiations at COP27 over how to address the increasing toll climate change is exacting from developing nations that have contributed little of the greenhouse gas emissions driving the phenomenon. The issue took on new urgency following monsoon flooding this summer in Pakistan that left more than 1,700 dead and caused at least $30bn in losses. Historic COP27 agreement Just getting the issue on the formal negotiating agenda was seen as a milestone. Even then, it appeared unlikely that COP27 talks would result in a new loss and damage fund. "A mission thirty years in the making has been accomplished," said Antigua and Barbuda Minister and chair of the AOSIS group of small island nations Molwyn Joseph. "Our Ministers and negotiators have endured sleepless nights and endless days in an intense series of negotiations, but after the pain comes the progress."

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, 18th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Masdar, one of the world\' s fastest-growing clean energy companies, and its global Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy (WiSER) initiative, this week held a series of high-level discussions to raise global awareness and support for women as powerful catalysts of sustainable change on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan said,  It was an honour to collaborate with WiSER this week to amplify the voices of women and girls at COP27 . As the UAE looks forward to hosting COP28 next year, I am encouraged by WiSER\' s efforts to raise global awareness and support for women and girls at the forefront of the net-zero transition. The UAE and UICCA are committed to continuing this important work with WiSER and our partners in Africa and around the world to help secure an inclusive and sustainable future for all. Throughout COP27 Global policymakers and industry leaders have taken the #IAmWiSER pledge, including Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Special Envoy for Climate Change, and Chairman of Masdar; Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment; Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, Permanent UAE Representative to the UN; and Co-Chair of UN-Energy, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), and Special UN Secretary-General SEforALL Representative, Damilola Ogunbiyi of Nigeria. Dr. Sultan Al Jaber said,  The UAE has long recognised that women represent an equal share of the global population and is committed to ensuring that they have an equal voice in the dialogue on climate action. This is especially important in areas such as Africa and the global south, where women are bearing the brunt of climate change. Through our global clean energy powerhouse Masdar and its WiSER initiative, we are working constantly to empower women to generate more equitable and effective climate solutions, and COP27 has provided the ideal platform to amplify their voices to the world. I look forward to building on this success at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week next year, and to seeing this positive momentum carry through to COP28 in the UAE. Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) is a global initiative, established by Masdar in 2008, to accelerate sustainable development and advance economic, social, and environmental progress, in line with the UAE\' s long-term vision and commitments. Taking place 14\- 21 January, ADSW 2023 will be next year\' s first major sustainability gathering, bridging the gap between COP27 and COP28 by convening global stakeholders to take stock of progress on commitments and continue to engage on bold climate action and practical innovation. Elsewhere, on the sidelines of COP27 this week, a WiSER Wisdom Series panel,  Gender Challenges to Climate Change, featured The Gambia\' s Honourable Minister of Gender, Children and Social Welfare, Fatou Kinteh; Director of Decarbonisation and Sustainable Energy at the UN\' s Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), Tareq Emtairah; Head of Institutional, Strategic, Private & Gulf Partnerships at Plan International, Mohamed Kamal; CEO of Siraj Power, a UAE-based provider of solar power solutions across the Middle East and Africa, Laurent Longuet. Honourable Minister Fatou Kinteh said,  The WiSER Wisdom Series COP27 panel was an important opportunity to engage in collaborative, frank conversation about challenges to building an equitable, sustainable future in communities across The Gambia, specifically, and Africa more broadly. It is critical that we continue to work together with organisations like WiSER to facilitate a global dialogue that meaningfully considers the unique challenges and opportunities facing women in diverse communities across Africa. Another WiSER Wisdom Series panel,  Design and Implementation of Inclusive, Community Energy Systems, featured young women who shared insights from their experience participating in WiSER\' s first field-based course in Rwanda, completed in August as part of the platform\' s new WiSER Cares initiative to equip young women in rural off-grid communities with the knowledge and skills to harness the potential of practical clean energy technologies. Masdar Executive Director of Brand and Strategic Initiatives, and WiSER Programme Director, Dr. Lamya Fawwaz, said,  Across the world, women are starting new companies and innovating new technologies that are catalysing meaningful sustainable change for their families, communities, and countries. At COP27 , it was my privilege to shine a spotlight on these women while also working with our partners in Africa to inspire more to join them in advancing positive climate action. From now, through to ADSW, COP28, and beyond, WiSER will continue to sow these seeds of empowerment so more women can unleash their full potential. In line with the UN\' s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 5 and 7) concerning gender equality and clean energy access, respectively, WiSER also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in September with Plan International Spain (SPNO), an independent development and humanitarian organisation working in more than 75 countries, including in Africa, to advance children's rights and equality for girls. In the MoU, WiSER and SPNO agreed to pilot programmes worldwide to accelerate sustainable development by empowering women and girls through educational, skills-training, mentorship, and internship opportunities, with a special focus on the global south. SPNO Chief Executive Officer, Concha Lopez, said,  We urge all states to raise responsible and active citizens through ambitious transformative education that enables children, especially child girls and adolescents, to be prepared, to adapt and to mitigate the impacts of this crisis, as well as to participate in climate action and in the green economy. We share this vision with WiSER, an internationally reputed platform which also works towards a world wherein all girls are empowered to maximise their potential as innovators and leaders of sustainable change. Across Africa, Masdar and its partners are also helping to accelerate sustainable socioeconomic development with over 1 gigawatt (GW) of clean energy projects capable of delivering electricity to over 845,000 homes in Egypt, Morocco, Mauritania, and the Seychelles. Globally, Masdar\' s clean energy projects displace close to 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. \</doc>

Developing a better food system requires political, private sector, and philanthropic leadership to help smallholder farmers adopt more climate-resilient agricultural practices A man checks list of beneficiaries of food aid outside an aid distribution centre in Sanaa, Yemen. - Reuters file Decades of progress on reducing food insecurity are being reversed. & The number of undernourished people is rising again, and in Africa alone, 310 million people are projected to be chronically hungry by 2030 if urgent action is not taken. Worse, a host of factors threatens to push the world's food systems toward collapse. Dangerous climate tipping points are approaching faster than predicted, and tens of millions of people are suffering from a cost-of-living crisis, ongoing global conflicts, biodiversity loss, and the continuing effects of COVID-19. There is still time to put the global food system on a fairer, more sustainable, and more resilient path, but the window is closing quickly. Fortunately, the Egyptian government has placed food and nutrition center stage at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, which means the issue will get more attention than it has received at any previous COP. The World Leaders Summit at the outset of the conference focused on the food security crisis, and the Food Systems Pavilion (another COP first) has ensured that food and agriculture remain high on the agenda throughout the two-week event. Agriculture alone is responsible for about one-third of global greenhouse-gas emissions and is the primary driver of biodiversity loss. It is also linked to 92% of the global water footprint, because the sector is the largest user and polluter of freshwater. Perversely, even as the number of people facing acute food insecurity rises, one-third of all food produced globally is either lost or wasted. Discussions about the nexus of food systems and climate at COP27 should focus on four priority areas. The first is political leadership. On November 7-8, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi convened heads of state and government to discuss the global food security crisis and the world's response to it. Political, business, and philanthropic leaders thus had a rare opportunity to come forward with major commitments and clear roadmaps for reforming food systems, emphasizing not only financing but also support for smallholder farmers and adoption of digital technologies in agriculture. The second priority is to close the significant and unjust global climate financing gap, which reflects a failure by many countries in the Global North to meet their past commitments. African countries have rightly called for a major increase in financing for climate adaptation. The international community must meet this request head-on and at the scale required. Only 3% of current global climate finance is targeted at agriculture and land use. Far more is needed to ensure sustainable food production, which in turn would bring benefits to billions of people, as well as to the climate and other species. Smallholder farmers are especially in need of support. Under 2% of climate finance makes it to this cohort, even though it produces almost one-third of the world's food and works one-quarter of the world's agricultural land. Developing a better food system requires political, private sector, and philanthropic leadership at scale to help smallholder farmers adopt more climate-resilient agricultural practices. A third area of focus should be national commitments and their implementation. A year ago, the Glasgow Climate Pact called on all countries to revisit their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and strengthen their emissions-reduction targets for this critical decade. With only a few having done so, however, there is a risk of further drift and delay. Moreover, while many NDCs do refer to food and land use, only a few countries - such as Colombia and the United Arab Emirates - have actively committed to sectoral targets and concrete action. The fourth priority area is private-sector and civil-society activity, which is no less important than policymaking and investments by national governments. Businesses should be adopting science-based targets to deliver on their climate commitments and to protect their own economic future. This is especially true of the world's commodity and trading companies, lest they end up backpedaling from their sustainability commitments, including to reduce deforestation. Regions and cities also can adopt ambitious food-system plans, and local communities can do remarkable work from the ground up to make their food systems more just and resilient - whether by reducing food loss and waste, pursuing landscape restoration, or securing alternatives to charcoal. And, of course, the world's major philanthropies can and must dramatically increase their funding for food systems. - Naoko Ishii is a professor at the University of Tokyo.

SHARJAH, 10th November, 2022 (WAM) -- BEEAH Tandeef, BEEAH Group's waste collection and city cleaning business, has begun delivering a landmark ten-year contract with the coastal city of Sharm El Sheikh in partnership with Green Planet, Egypt's emerging environmental services company. The contract commenced a few days prior to COP27 in Egypt. BEEAH Group signed the contract with the Governorate of South Sinai in Sharm El Sheikh last month, following which BEEAH Tandeef deployed waste management infrastructure and streamlined waste collection solutions in the city. In particular, BEEAH Tandeef has taken care to ensure world-class delivery of waste management services in the Sharm El Sheikh Convention Centre, where COP27 is being held. The convention centre will have several bins and personnel to maintain cleanliness and ensure proper disposal of waste. Beyond the COP27 venue, BEEAH Tandeef is also addressing the municipal solid waste needs of the entire city. Innovative solar-powered, hi-tech bins have been deployed at various locations in Sharm El Sheikh. Recycling stations have been placed strategically to collect different types of waste, with separate streams for recyclables, e-waste, as well as organic waste and mixed waste. Waste and recycling points also serve as educational centres for local communities, informing people on proper waste disposal techniques and encouraging waste segregation at the source. BEEAH Tandeef is also carrying out waste management and public cleansing services in the numerous tourist hotspots in the desert and beach areas. On-ground teams are washing and inspecting bins periodically, while conducting preventative maintenance. When bins are found to be defective or damaged, they are repaired or replaced. In collaboration with Green Planet, BEEAH Tandeef has also deployed mechanical sweepers and vacuum vehicles, street washing vehicles and beach cleaning vehicles. Further, Ducati electric mobile waste collection units are streamlining the operations on main and internal roads, streets, and sidewalks, offering workers shade from direct sunlight, in line with occupational health standards. The portfolio of vehicles caters to the unique environmental and infrastructural demands of the city's high-density areas as well as public and community spaces. Skilled crewmembers are positioned in desert areas to pick up litter, empty and clear bins, as well as sweep streets, roads, sidewalks, parking areas, public transport points, roundabouts and paved pathways. Depending on the area, crewmembers use advanced waterjet-enabled vehicles, manual street washing services and specialised safari vehicles. To drive utility of the sustainable waste management services going forward, BEEAH Group and Green Planet will also conduct on-ground awareness activities to foster a culture of recycling and proper waste disposal, including through educational programs for schools, corporates, and communities. Speaking about delivery on the contract, Rafael Lopez, CEO of BEEAH Tandeef, said, "Egypt has a clearly outlined sustainability agenda and roadmap. We are proud to support this through our work in Sharm El Sheikh during COP27 and the decade thereafter. We are thankful to Egypt's visionary leadership for their bold determination, their ability to adapt to the changing environment, and for their trust in our delivery of world-class waste management solutions. "Our goal is to help Sharm El Sheikh become a sustainable, smart city of the future. Looking ahead, we will build on our existing portfolio of services, support net-zero emissions and zero-waste to landfill strategies while working towards key targets set by the Egyptian government." Aligning with Egypt's sustainability agenda, BEEAH Tandeef plans to launch several specialised services, community engagement and recycling incentivisation programs. One of the services will be a specialised used cooking oil collection program, which will help reduce disposal through drains and minimise clogging of public plumbing systems. To further encourage recycling practices, Reverse Vending Machines (RVM) will be deployed across the city, offering a seamless and digitally enabled experience for users to deposit recyclables such as plastic bottles. Personnel will also be working around the clock to collect waste and keep public areas clean. The ecosystem of solutions from BEEAH Tandeef will include GPS enabled trucks with on-board weighing systems to monitor collected waste and a fleet route optimisation platform that notifies fleet operators when bins are full using RFID tagging systems. BEEAH Group first expanded to Egypt in 2020 by signing the region's largest waste management contract with the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD) for Egypt's New Administrative Capital, one of the largest urban development projects in the world. BEEAH Tandeef is also in charge of executing the ACUD contract. The signing of the Sharm El Sheikh waste management contract in September is BEEAH Group's second contract in Egypt. The contract was signed in the presence Dr. Mostafa Madbouly, Prime Minister of Egypt, and formalised by Dr. Mohamed Maait, Egypt's Minister of Finance, Dr. Yasmine Fouad, Egypt's Minister of Environment, Major General Hisham Amna, Egypt's Minister of Local Development, and Major General Khaled Fouda, Governor of South Sinai in Egypt. In addition to BEEAH Tandeef's operations in Sharm El Sheikh, BEEAH Group is part of the UAE delegation to COP27 . As part of the nation's pavilion, the Group is showcasing solutions from across its businesses, including integrated recycling at its world-class waste management complex, clean energy innovations in the region's first commercial scale waste-to-energy plant, and smart built architecture at the BEEAH Group Headquarters, one of the most sustainable and smartest buildings in the world, integrated with AI and designed by the renowned Zaha Hadid Architects. Through its participation in COP27 , BEEAH Group is looking to support large-scale climate action, share insights on solutions for sustainable, smart cities, and accelerate towards sustainability targets set by the UAE and the world. \</doc>

The first order of business is for governments to help guide trillions in private investments toward the Global South If there is one issue that has taken center stage at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), it is money. Delegates, climate activists, and the rapidly increasing number of private-sector attendees are discussing who should pay for climate change, and how. The focus on money is past due. While the annual climate talks are ultimately about cutting greenhouse-gas pollution, the transition to a net-zero economy requires massive financing, as will adapting to a world of rising average temperatures and sea levels, increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather, and all the other costly effects of burning fossil fuels. Ever since COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, a key figure in this debate has been "$100 billion." That is how much the world's advanced economies promised to provide to developing countries every year by 2020. But it was never clear whether this target referred only to public money, or whether it could include a mix of public and private flows. While most of the Global South interpreted it as a commitment of public funds, most of the Global North preferred the broader definition. If one takes the latter view, the rich world was already on track to providing $97 billion in annual climate finance flows back in 2011, according to a widely cited study from the Climate Policy Initiative. And yet, 13 years on from the 2009 pledge, few would make the mistake of mixing public and private funding, while everyone recognizes that the global energy transition will require not billions but trillions of dollars per year. Massive amounts of private spending will need to be directed away from fossil-fuel investments and toward low-carbon infrastructure, energy, and transportation. But that doesn't let governments off the hook. Public funds are the lever for rechanneling private money at the necessary pace and scale. The Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS and Science Act that the United States has recently enacted are good examples of this lever in action. The idea is that some $500 billion in government investments will encourage many hundreds of billions more in private flows. The global picture fits a similar pattern. Since annual foreign direct investment dwarfs development aid, much of the money to cut carbon-dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse-gas pollution will come from private sources, regardless of what governments agree to do. Unlocking these funds will require what climate negotiators call "creative" solutions, which means, "We know that much more money is needed, but we can't be the ones who provide it." Thus, John Kerry, the US climate envoy, came to COP27 with a proposal to use carbon credits to fill at least some of the financing gap. Under this approach, rich countries and companies would get some credit not just for cutting their own pollution, but for paying others to do so. The idea is not new. The US proposed a similar system ahead of COP3 in Kyoto in 1997. At the time, much of the rest of the world, including the European Union, opposed the plan. Yet, ironically, the EU now has the world's largest carbon market, while the US, aside from California and a dozen northeastern states, does not. The US and other rich, large polluters still have a responsibility to pony up direct aid on a much larger scale than they are currently doing. That goes both for unconditional aid to help the poor weather climate change, and for funding to help them cut their own pollution. Germany and Austria deserve credit for leading the charge with promises of EUR170 million ($175 million) and EUR50 million, respectively, in aid for the most vulnerable countries. And a new commitment from the US, the EU, and Germany to invest $500 million in renewables in Egypt is a good step. But given that these sums all fall in the millions, they still miss the mark by orders of magnitude. The first order of business is for governments to help guide trillions in private investments toward the Global South. "Creative" solutions should focus on making loans and investments less risky for private investors, with rich governments and multilateral funds providing loan guarantees and other assurances to help reduce sovereign credit and other risks. Carbon credits could similarly play a role in helping scale up sorely needed investments, provided that voluntary carbon credits are seen only as a stepping stone to making polluters pay to cut their own pollution. Ultimately, building more momentum behind the global clean-energy revolution is what really matters. If allowing rich companies to boast of their green credentials means that they will fund more clean energy in the Global South, that is not a bad thing. Often, the best way to ensure that necessary work is done is not to care too much about who takes the credit. - Gernot Wagner is a climate economist at Columbia Business School \</doc>

The country will host the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties next year Image used for illustrative purposes only The UAE has a major role in securing oil supplies around the world, Haitham Al Ghais, Secretary-General of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says. In his statement to the Emirates News Agency (Wam) coinciding with his taking of office as the OPEC Secretary-General, Al Ghais said, "Today, we open a new page of cooperation, driving OPEC's rise to higher levels in the face of future roadblocks, in order to meet the various challenges in the energy arena in general, and the oil markets in particular, where many challenges, whether geopolitical, or Covid-19-related, are still affecting some regions of the world," noting that an action plan will be developed in consultation with the OPEC member states and technical committees, in line with OPEC's long-term strategy. He explained that December 2022 will mark six years since the conclusion of the OPEC+ agreement. He added that the UAE plays a leading role in backing the agreement by laying sound foundations and expanding its cooperation, which supports the interests of the market, consumers and oil-producing countries. The new OPEC Secretary-General said that the UAE will host the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28) next year, a platform that will enable OPEC member states to voice their opinions of oil-producing countries on energy transition, to ensure a balanced and fair transition inclusive of all stakeholders around the world, as well as avoid disrupting global economic activity and developmental efforts, and support optimal energy utilisation. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 18th November, 2022 (WAM) -- A local newspaper has said that for the past two weeks, the popular tourism destination of Sharm El Sheikh has been notably less relaxed than usual, particularly in the past 24 hours. The site was abuzz as delegates scrambled to get a deal at the Cop27 UN climate summit. Getting such agreements to protect the planet could hardly be more important. Speaking at the event on Friday, US President Joe Biden said,"The climate crisis is about human security, economic security, environmental security, national security and the very life of the planet." In an editorial on Friday, The National said, "Despite today's sobering outlook for the environment, there have been many positive moments, developments and stories from this year's meeting, and Egypt can be proud of hosting a productive summit." New ideas are being explored. Activists called for a "Paris Agreement for nature" to prevent land degradation and biodiversity loss. On Tuesday, The National wrote about the compelling testimony of Revan Ahmed, 12, who spoke about the role of children in calling for action to deal with climate change. She was the youngest member of a UNICEF delegation, representing an age group whose voice is little heard, even though it stands to lose the most. "My favourite season is spring," Revan told The National. "I love seeing green everywhere. Recently, spring has changed, it's yellow. Everything is becoming yellow and the weather is becoming drier and drier. This made me ask myself, why?" And there have been interesting discussions. A particularly timely one focused on who should pay for damage caused by climate change, in light of terrible flooding that hit Pakistan recently. It killed more than 1,700 people and displaced 2 million. Repairing the damage is estimated to cost $30 billion. "Some activists argue that the few rich countries most responsible for historic carbon emissions should pay reparations to states such as Pakistan, which are responsible for far fewer emissions," the paper added. The daily continued, "It has often hard to drum up sufficient attention and consensus on the climate issue. After all, it is still considered a long-term one, and short-term crises pose a constant distraction. This year's meeting comes at a particularly crowded time. At present, world leaders are at the G20 meeting, as they try to use diplomacy to manage existing conflicts, prevent new ones and help a struggling global economy." They must remember that solving the climate issue goes hand in hand with protecting global security and prosperity. Climate diplomacy of all kinds might get less of the limelight in testing times, but missing the opportunities it creates is a mistake. As with all Cop meetings, tangible progress at Cop27 has been a mixed bag and it remains to be seen how much will change. The Abu Dhabi-based daily concluded by saying, "But in terms of raising important topics and awareness, it has been a major success for Egypt and the Middle East. That momentum is here to stay, as the UAE prepares to host Cop28 next year." \</doc>

The UAE will soon start its first carbon-credit exchange and is taking a tougher stance on ESG disclosure, as it looks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and prepares to host next year's COP28 climate summit. Abu Dhabi Global Market, based in the capital, is set to begin a voluntary carbon-offset exchange "in a matter of weeks," Mercedes Vela Monserrate, the head of sustainable finance at ADGM, said at the COP27 talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. It will be operated by AirCarbon, a Singapore-based digital exchange. Saudi Arabia launched the region's first carbon-offset auction last month. Companies can buy credits on exchanges to offset some of the emissions they produce. The global voluntary carbon market has grown rapidly in recent years, but so has scepticism that the credits avoid carbon emissions or remove them from the atmosphere. The UAE has pledged to be net-zero within its own borders by 2050. The government is planning about $165bn of investments in clean energy to reach the target. ADGM is also working with other UAE authorities on clearer requirements for environmental, social and governance funding tools, Vela Monserrate said in an interview. "We have seen a proliferation of different standards in the market," she said. "That's leading to a lot of confusion as to what we actually mean by a green bond. That is leading to the concerns around greenwashing. There's a huge appetite for this type of product, but there's very little knowledge about it." UAE announcements at COP27 The new rules could encourage the issuance of green bonds on the ADGM from next year, she said. Dubai is set to host next year's COP summit. Addressing world leaders at COP27 UAE President, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, called on nations to come together to tackle the climate crisis for the sake of future generations.

By Thomas Pinn International conferences and agreements are not like football matches. As COP27 came to end following an all-night session that lapsed over until the morning on Sunday, November 20, there was no scoreboard declaring the talks and agreements a success or not. Instead, the merits of commitments that were agreed to by countries across the globe, and importantly what was missing from these, are now being hotly debated. The significance of what was agreed to at the conference may only become clear in a matter of years, or even decades. With a specific focus on the Arab world, we thought we'd look into the top takeaways from the landmark climate conference. The big headline of COP27 is the loss and damage fund for developing countries that has been repeatedly described as 'historic'. The prime minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, set the tone and laid down the arguments for a loss and damage fund early on in the conference by speaking about the tragic climate change-induced floods that recently ravaged his country. He told the conference hall that "We became a victim of something with which we had nothing to do, and of course it was a manmade disaster". He went on to state that "Imagine on one hand we have to cater for food security for the common man by spending billions of dollars and on the other we have to spend billions of dollars to protect flood-affected people from further miseries and difficulties. How on earth can one expect from us that we will undertake this gigantic task on our own?". The agreement that was finalised in the plenary session of the conference laid out the establishment of a fund for developing countries to deal with the immediate effects of climate change, accepting that the brunt of climate change is not felt equally and that richer nations have a duty to support poorer nations. This presents a historic break and reveals an antagonism between high-income and low-income nations that some climate activists see as a significant roadblock in the way of meaningful global action on the climate. While some headlines, particularly in the West, have concentrated on the conference's failure to further decarbonisation timelines and commitments, some environmental groups and nations from the Global South have emphasised how the damage and loss fund presents a historic and very important step in the fight against climate change. Mohamed Adow of the thinktank Power Shift Africa was quoted by the Guardian as stating " COP27 has done what no other COP has achieved and created a loss and damage fund to support the most impacted communities of climate change. This has been something which vulnerable countries have been calling for since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit". How this new approach will relate to some of the Arab world's richest nations is unclear, as many fall under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 as being developing, while the EU and others are arguing to update this 30 year-old set of classifications. However, for countries like Iraq that is under assault from multiple climate change-induced threats, from rising sea levels taking over the city of Basrah in the near future and drought decimating crops in the north, the damage and loss fund could be incredibly important. Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Jordan, and other Arab countries may similarly find cause to seek out the damage and loss fund as climate predictions and recent rare weather events paint a daunting future according to climate scientists. Many environmentalists argue that at the heart of reducing climate change is a simple equation of reducing global emissions to reduce rising temperatures. However, while one of the main aims of COP27 was to build on pledges made in COP26 the year prior to reduce emissions, the conference in Sharm al-Sheikh came to an end with no concrete commitments to reduce emissions. Without the nations of the world recommitting to targets that had been agreed to a year before, some climate experts have expressed their concern that this lack of renewed focus to lead to countries further missing their decarbonisation targets. Many countries in the Arab region that have large oil revenues or are completely dependent on the export of fossil fuels were expected to come under immense pressure to leave much of their oil reserves under the ground. However, this expected pressure never fully materialised and the global economy's reliance on fossil fuels seems set to continue for some time to come. Read More: Rewriting History: More Than 100 Mummies & A Special Pyramid Found Meetings of nations from across the world at UN conferences and G20 meetings have for the last years seemed to solely revolve around disputes between the US and its allies with either Russia or China. However, COP27 gladly did not revolve around who US President Biden did or did not shake hands with, but instead revolved more concretely around the climate. With the geopolitical contestation between the US and Russia and China mostly put aside, a new and arguably more important geopolitical division came to the fore. After months of lobbying by various developing countries, Egypt an important and vocal voice among them, COP27 was mostly defined by the relationship between high-income and lower-income nations. Reflecting this antagonism and frustration, the president of Palau Surangel Whipps, which is an island nation at risk of being totally submerged, told the conference that "You might as well bomb us, that might well have been an easier fate". Mia Motley, the prime minister of Barbados, similarly commented on this unfair relationship between developed and developing nations by arguing defiantly that "We were the ones whose blood, sweat and tears financed the industrial revolution  Are we now to face double jeopardy by having to pay the cost as a result of those greenhouse gases from the industrial revolution? That is fundamentally unfair." In contrast to expectations of a US\- China showdown that would consume the attention of the conference following rising tensions, the two countries actually held discussion that the Chinese special envoy for climate change, Xie Zhenhua, described as "very constructive". It was reported that the two recommitted to previous agreements made at COP26 the previous year, and has set out a timeline for future meetings where the two countries, which the constitute the two most polluting countries, would collaborate to reduce their emissions. This new framework positioning high-income and low-income states in opposite positions to understand the climate crisis and to develop solutions has the potential to give a greater voice to several Arab nations. With the incredible cost involved in any nation's green transition and many countries in the region being chronically cash-short or in high levels of debt, we may see some Arab nations giving a greater helping hand to take on the financial burdens of such a transition. Following COP26 in Glasgow, exactly a year ago, Saudi Arabia was met with criticism by its commitment to reach a target of zero net emissions by only 2060. With the world's second largest proven oil reserves and its position as being one of of the world's largest producers of oil, many environmental groups and a growing number of countries argue that for temperature rises above 1.5 degrees to be avoided, oil reserves have to be left in the ground. However, this year criticism by environmental groups has shifted towards the Gulf nation's new approach dubbed as the "circular carbon economy". This new approach relies on the continued production of oil whose emissions are to be offset by the controversial technology of carbon capture and storage, which essentially filters out pollutants from the air using large industrial fans. However, these technologies mostly remain unproven in terms of their scalability and the Guardian quoted the executive director of Greenpeace MENA, Ghiwa Nakat, criticising the solution as "illusions and false solutions that are a waste of time and money". Taking a more encouraging note, however, Nakat went on to state that "It's surprising that an innovator like Saudi Arabia should stick with oil when it would do better to make peace with the end of an era". These are the words that UN General Secretary Ant\'f3nio Guterres started the conference with. Painting the image of a world currently on a "highway to climate hell", he urged for all nations and delegates not to postpone or delay the important decisions that need to be made. Making clear the stark choice in front of us and how we have at most a decade to make the needed changes, he argued that "We are in the fight of our lives and we are losing  And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible". While Guterres began the conference stating that we "We can sign a climate solidarity pact, or a collective suicide pact". Now following the end of the conference and the announcement of the agreements made, politicians and environmentalists are split as to what the lasting impact of the conference will be. While the loss and damage fund has been celebrated as potentially being a building block for an approach to solving climate change that in the future will be able to build an actual solution based on solidarity and climate justice, the lack of new climate commitments have been presented by some critics as a failure for nations to get serious about serious reducing emissions and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.

The Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate focuses on increasing investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems The President, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, delivers a speech during COP27 climate conference at the Sharm El Sheikh International Convention Center. - Wam At the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, a joint initiative led by the UAE and the US announced doubling of investments by partners in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation to $8 billion. The Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) is an initiative led by the US and UAE governments, supported by 42 countries and 235 partners, with the focus on increasing investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation to accelerate climate action. The initiative was announced at COP26 in Glasgow by US President Joe Biden with an initial investment of $4 billion. The increased investment is comprised of more than $7 billion from government partners with contributions from Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, the European Commission, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Lithuania, New Zealand, South Korea, Romania, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, the US, the UAE, the UK, Uruguay, Vietnam, and over $1 billion investment from 'innovation sprints' - self-financed investment from non-government partners. The number of 'innovation sprints' has increased from 22 to 30, which are generally aligned with one or more focal areas: smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries, emerging technologies, agro-ecological research and methane reduction. The investments are enabled and supported by a tripling of AIM for Climate coalition of partners to this growing initiative, which now stands at more than 275 partners, comprising governments, businesses, academia, non-profits, think tanks and more. The number of partners at COP26 was 79. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 7th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The climate summit in Egypt, Cop27 , will be the focus of much of the world's attention in the coming fortnight, commented a UAE daily. "Global leaders and delegates will gather at the resort town of Sharm El Sheikh to address an extensive agenda that is urgent and complex, affecting countries and people in all four hemispheres," said The National in an editorial on Monday. Just last week UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres once again urged wealthy and poor nations "to close the ambition gap, the credibility gap and the solidarity gap" when they convened at the event in Egypt. President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan will lead a large delegation from both the public and private sectors in the UAE. It will be an opportunity for countries in the region and wider world to recognise the UAE's progress on a number of previous climate commitments. Several accomplishments have added to earlier successes on the Emirates' goals, whether with regard to the UAE's 2050 Energy Strategy, or balancing investments in the energy systems of today and of the future or last week's US-UAE partnership of $100 billion on clean energy. Building on last year's summit in Glasgow, Cop27 - an acronym for the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - is also being referred to as Cop for Africa or African Cop, which draws attention to a troubling issue: the extreme climate the continent is facing. This reality is viewed as unfair by many environment stakeholders, as Africa emits a tiny fraction of the quantity of carbon that countries in the developed West do, often at the cost of that development. As part of a larger solution, earlier this year, the UAE launched Etihad 7, a programme to secure funding for renewable energy projects in Africa, with the goal of supplying clean electricity to 100 million people by 2035. This is just one among several necessary steps that will have to be formulated by regional stakeholders in the near future. Over the next 12 days at the summit, heads of countries will discuss decarbonisation, water security, food security, energy mix, biodiversity, youth and future generations, finance and related themes. These affect rising global temperatures, leaving no countries immune. The enormously damaging consequences can range from wild fires to land slides or torrential floods. Even apart from the enormous destruction, affecting lives and livelihoods, such climate-related catastrophes push nations back many years in their development trajectories. Even since the climate summit in Scotland last year, multiple hazardous weather events related to climate change have occurred in disparate parts of the world. Solutions are ever sought to try and curb and control factors that add to climate change. And the UAE is committed to its goals. Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, Special Envoy for Climate Change and Chairman of Masdar, told The National, "Today, the UAE is one of the world's largest investors in global renewable energy projects and has invested $50 billion in renewable energy projects in over 70 countries, including 31 island developing states that are most vulnerable to climate change." When the baton is passed from Egypt to the UAE to host next year's Cop28, the UAE will have added to its roster of climate commitments, boosting sectors such as hydrogen, solar, renewables and an innovative energy ecosystem. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 16th November, 2022 (WAM) - At COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, today, the EU and Egypt have taken a further step to boost their long-term cooperation on the clean energy transition by establishing a strategic partnership on renewable hydrogen and preparing the ground for a just energy transition in Egypt. The European Commission, represented by Executive Vice-President Timmermans and Commissioner Simson, signed a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on a strategic partnership on renewable hydrogen with Egypt's Minister for Petroleum Tarek El Molla and Minister for Electricity and Renewable Energy Mohammed Shaker El-Markabi. They also signed a Joint Statement with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Egyptian Minister of International Cooperation, Rania El Mashat, announcing the Commission's contribution of up to \€ 35 million in support of Egypt's Energy Wealth Initiative. The MoU signature today follows the Joint Statement issued by President von der Leyen and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi last week at COP27 . It is a key energy partnership for the EU and it will serve as a central block in building an EU-Mediterranean Renewable Hydrogen Partnership. Both parties view renewable hydrogen as a key contributor to reducing emissions and ensuring energy security, while representing an opportunity for industrial cooperation, sustainable economic growth and job creation. The MoU will serve as a framework to support long-term conditions for the development of a renewable hydrogen industry and trade across the EU and Egypt, including infrastructure and financing. It will support the EU's ambition of reaching 20 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen consumption in 2030, as outlined in the REPowerEU plan, and therefore help reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuels. The MoU will also facilitate investment in renewables and boost the decarbonisation process in Egypt. More broadly, it will contribute to the establishment of a framework for a global rules-based market for hydrogen-based solutions, including harmonised safety and environmental standards. Its implementation will be led by an EU-Egypt Hydrogen Coordination Group and involve a Business Forum with representatives from industry, regulators, financial institutions and experts. \</doc>

Country to highlight its climate actions, solutions and achievements, and preparations to host COP28 at summit Wam More than 120 world leaders will come together to discuss ways to tackle climate change at the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from Sunday. The annual summit sees climate change negotiations and decisions made to limit global warming and accelerate the green energy transition. At the summit, coming a year after COP26 in Glasgow, the UAE will highlight its climate actions, solutions and achievements as well as its preparations to host COP28 next year, the state news agency WAM said. The priorities of the UAE delegation will include addressing the impacts of climate change, ensuring a practical and realistic transition in the energy sector, support to economic growth, and enhancing access to technology. The UAE's vast record of achievements in climate action is an opportunity to help find practical solutions to this global issue that affects everyone. Recently, the UAE and the US inked a comprehensive strategic partnership to invest $100 billion into clean energy. Proving its capabilities to the world, Infinity Power Holding - Abu Dhabi-based Masdar's joint venture with Egypt's Infinity, will be powering COP27 with zero-carbon energy. The summit comes at a time when the world is witnessing an increase in climate-related disasters. Through deliberations among the top minds of the world, the summit is expected to come up with concrete options to climate change, rising temperature, adherence to the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees among others. The Sharm El-Sheikh International Convention Centre (SHICC) will form the COP27 's Blue Zone - where all crucial negotiations among delegates are set to take place. Exuding hope, Ambassador Wael Aboulmagd, Special Representative to the COP27 President, said that the Egyptian Presidency team has worked tirelessly to create an "enabling environment that is conducive to successful negotiations". "As the hosts of the COP, we are keen on bringing representatives of nations and stakeholders from across the world and to provide the required momentum to address the required actions for urgent and at-scale implementation of climate commitments and pledges." Earlier, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and Chairman of the Higher Committee responsible for overseeing preparations for COP28, noted that the UAE delegation would focus on "supporting the Egyptian Presidency of COP27 ". COP27 and COP28 to support climate action and raise awareness of its visions and efforts to achieve sustainability. With more than 40,000 estimated attendees, the summit is expected to host one of the largest number of participants in the conference, which runs till November 18. The UAE delegation includes representatives of government and private sector institutions, business leaders, civil society organisations, women, and youth. A 22,500sqm 'Green Zone' is where the business community, youngsters, artists and climate actors will have an opportunity for dialogue and engagement through events, exhibitions, workshops, cultural performances, and talks. UAE's climate actions During the event, the UAE will emphasise its commitment to address climate impacts, which has been raised as a critical concern for countries in the Southern Hemisphere. The UAE has embarked on the ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, making the country the first Mena nation to do so. The country, a global leader in the energy transition, has invested more than $50 billion over the past 10 years in clean energy technologies and solutions around the world, building three of the largest and lowest-cost solar projects in the world. The UAE's Peaceful Nuclear Energy Programme further emphasises the UAE's energy diversification strategy. The UAE is among the world's largest humanitarian aid donors and provides direct aid during times of climate-related disasters and conflicts, whose repercussions are exacerbated by climate change. The country was the first in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement in 2015. The UAE announced a plan to increase the number of mangrove trees to 100 million by 2030, to promote natural solutions to limit the repercussions of climate change, protect biodiversity and help create a natural carbon store. In September 2022, the UAE launched the updated version of the second edition of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), with the aim of reducing carbon emissions by 31 per cent by 2030. The UAE is a leading global investor in renewable energy projects allocating $100 billion by 2030 for projects in more than 70 countries. It is empowering communities around the world and delivering sustainable solutions, through initiatives such as the Zayed Sustainability Prize. The UAE is strengthening the capacities of the youth, through hosting establishments such as the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence. The UAE has three of the largest solar power plants in the world and is the first country in the region to utilise carbon capture and storage technology on a large-scale, while diversifying its sources of emission-free energy, including peaceful nuclear energy and hydrogen. \</doc>

The world faces threats from war, an energy crisis, and the risk of a global recession, but climate change is by no means a sleeper issue this year. Deadly extreme weather events have struck almost every corner of the planet in recent months, reminding leaders and citizens of the need to act fast. Few nations have more at stake at the COP27 than Pakistan, the country exemplifying the deep inequality lying within the climate change conundrum. Pakistan contributes less than 1% of planet-warming fossil fuel emissions today, but this summer it suffered devastating rains made worse by climate change that flooded a third of its territory and caused an estimated $30bn in damages. "The global North must realize that this is a global issue which is impacting developing countries at the moment in a disproportionate way, but its impacts are climbing and they are spreading," said Munir Akram, the Pakistani diplomat chairing the G77 group of developing nations. "It's the ultimate test of human rationality to be able to work together despite all the differences that we have politically." Disagreements over who should pay for the harm done by climate-driven extreme weather events will be at the heart of discussions at COP27 , the first to be held in Africa since 2016. While developing nations want to see compensation for the impacts of a warming they didn't cause, rich countries remain wary of opening a door that could lead to unlimited financial claims. Some past COP meetings have resulted in landmark agreements that shaped humanity's fight against climate change. In 1997, signatories of the Kyoto Protocol acknowledged that the planet was warming because of manmade greenhouse gas emissions and committed to reducing them. In 2015, global leaders agreed under the Paris Agreement to make the necessary emissions cuts to keep global temperatures below a 2C increase by the end of the century, and ideally close to 1.5C. COP27 is unlikely to land a historic deal in that fashion. Labeled as the "implementation" COP by the Egyptian presidency, it instead aims to turn past commitments into reality. Here are 10 things to watch out for in this year's climate gathering: Who's going to Cop27 and who isn't? More than 100 heads of states and governments will descend into Sharm el-Sheikh for the conference. Among the most relevant names are US President Joe Biden, Brazil's presidential election winner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and UK premier Rishi Sunak, who made a U-turn on an initial decision not to turn up after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced he was attending. Also there will be European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, along with European leaders like France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz. UAE president will be among those present, reports state news agency WAM. African presidents including Kenya's William Ruto and Senegal's Macky Sall will be prominent voices among developing nation leaders, while Pakistan's Climate Minister Sherry Rehman will likely lead the debate on climate justice. Possibly the most relevant absence at COP27 will be that of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, although activist Greta Thunberg's decision not to go made headlines too. And there'll be fewer big beasts of finance and business than a year ago: Larry Fink, the boss of Blackrock., will stay away, as will the CEOs of Citigroup Inc. and Standard Chartered Plc. All three turned up in Glasgow. Loss and Damage debated at COP27 There's little time for frivolities as the first day is expected to be dominated by an agenda fight over a key bit of climate jargon: loss and damage. That's the term used to describe the economic and cultural devastation caused by centuries of unchecked fossil-fuel use by industrialised nations. While it is looking increasingly likely that there will be such an agenda item, the key question is what it will cover. Developing countries and small island states want a clear reference to new funding facilities that will help cover the loss and damage caused by increasingly extreme weather events, but the US and the EU are loath to be on the line for what they see as potentially unlimited compensation claims. The outcome of the fight has the potential to make or break the summit right from the start. "We shouldn't discount the importance of just having this on the agenda," said Ani Dasgupta, president and chief executive officer of the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit research organization. And if it doesn't happen, "there's a big risk of vulnerable countries walking away from this." Climate finance discussions at COP27 Should they walk away, it's because they've been burned before. Rich countries have repeatedly failed to live up to a pledge to provide $100b of climate finance annually - a goal that is already seen as woefully insufficient to cover poorer countries' needs. One of the key barometers for success will be realising that goal, but also working on a post-2025 climate finance target that could be in the trillions of dollars. In addition, last year's outcome called for a doubling of adaptation finance to help the global south future-proof themselves for worsening climate impacts. Mobilising trillions of dollars will not be possible without the support of the private sector, but there are still major doubts over its commitment to the climate. Multilateral development banks - like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Investment Bank - will also be in the spotlight to stump up more cash. Coal and Just Energy Transition Partnerships UN climate summits have tended to focus on the responsibilities the richest owe to the poorest, often leaving out one key demographic that will be crucial to transition: coal-reliant middle-income countries. An $8.5bn package for South Africa was announced last year in a bid to redress that, and there are plans afoot for more. Indonesia could announce its own Just Energy Transition Partnership alongside donors like the US and the EU at the Group of 20 meeting in Bali, which runs during the second week of COP27 . Similar deals with Vietnam and Senegal are in the pipeline before the end of the year, while one with India is slated for 2023. Also watch to see if rich donor countries and South Africa finally agree on how the funds are spent. Methane pledge updates at COP27 Since its unveiling last year, the Global Methane Pledge, a commitment to cut emissions of one of the most potent greenhouse gases by 30% by the end of the decade, has garnered more than 120 signatures. China and India are the main absentees, but there is hope that the former may still announce its own methane-cutting plan during COP27 . The main thing now is to show that countries are making efforts to actually live up to that commitment, especially as emissions are still rising. Watch out for a methane ministerial meeting that includes all the signatories, as well as a joint declaration by fossil-fuel importers and producers on how they plan to clean up. Countries will also present their status reports, which will likely show that cutting emissions is still an uphill struggle. The EU, for example, is making major progress on cutting discharges in the energy and waste sectors, but doing the same for agriculture remains near impossible. Carbon markets One COP after delegations agreed on rules or a global carbon market under the Paris Agreement, negotiators at COP27 will need to establish strict guidelines to ensure the credits used in the global carbon market represent real emissions reductions. The current agreement allows for the trading old carbon credits that don't necessarily reduce emissions. Climate ambition surprises at COP27 Countries can update their climate commitments any time under the Paris Agreement, and many committed to do so at COP26 in Glasgow. Very few of these commitments have been honoured, but watch out for surprise announcements at the meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh. Last year, India unexpectedly set a net-zero emissions target for 2070. The science reality check Negotiations at COP27 will be highly technical, with delegates likely to spend hours fighting over commas and wording. But diplomats will need to keep in mind that, despite recent progress, the world is still on track to warm above the 2C target set by the Paris Agreement. The latest research forecasts warming between 2.1C and 2.9C by the end of the century and scientists warn the window to act is closing fast. The celebrity factor at COP27 The more than 45,000 people accredited for COP27 include climate diplomats, but also some of the world's most famous people. Last year, actor and water activist Leonardo DiCaprio turned up, along with actress Emma Watson and former US President Barack Obama. Expect actors and singers to liven up the mood, and to gather crowds of enthusiasts. And the serious side Traditionally, mass protests by climate activists have brought the voice of global citizens to an otherwise dull and secluded gathering. This time might be different, with activists reporting unprecedented difficulties and unaffordable costs to arrive to Sharm el-Sheikh. Still, on everyone's minds will be prominent Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who is currently in jail and started a hunger strike last April. Abd El-Fattah has vowed to stop drinking water on the first day of COP27 . \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 14th November, 2022 (WAM) - On \' Women and Water' Day at COP27 , the power of women as key drivers of climate solutions, and the crucial impact that the climate crisis is having on our water supply took centre stage in Sharm el-Sheikh. Meanwhile, the negotiations on the conference outcome continued, with UN officials calling for \' building bridges' to deliver on the important issue of loss and damage. UN Women has said that evidence suggests that their representation in national parliaments can lead countries to adopt more stringent climate change policies. "Women and girls are essential, effective and powerful leaders to address the climate crisis. But they remain largely undervalued and underestimated with limited access to training extension services and the technology necessary for effective adaptation to the impacts of climate change," UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told an event focused on women in Africa. "There's a very simple and effective solution - put women and girls in the lead," she urged. Mary Robinson - the first woman President of Ireland, a former UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, and founding member of \' The Elders' a group of eminent leaders working to tackle some of the world's toughest problems - also underlined that COP27 should recognise the leadership of women and girls. Meanwhile, Lucy Ntongal, Kenyan climate and gender expert from the NGO Actionaid, told journalists that while she has been always mesmerized by the ability of communities to cope in the home country, they cannot subsist anymore. \' 'Leaders need to keep the voices of girls and women from the Global South, living through the realities of climate crisis, at the heart of COP27 negotiations, as they are the best people to provide the solutions," she underscored. Human-induced climate change is not only leading to significant changes in the global water cycle making the precious liquid scarcer due to droughts and rapid evaporation, but it is also increasing the frequency of heavy rainfall events, as well as accelerating the melting of glaciers. These effects are especially felt in developing countries. For example, in 2021 alone, there were a total of more than 100 natural hazard events in Asia, of which 80 per cent were flood and storm events, a new report published by the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) describes. The agency has also painted a worrying scenario of what the future might hold for the continent, with the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau glaciers - the main sources of freshwater for over a billion people - retreating rapidly. "For water, it is now or never. Water is the theme we find in energy, food security, health, economics and international collaboration We really must change our behaviours, our attitudes, our actions, our governance and the way we organize around water," said Henk Ovink, Water Envoy from the Netherlands, one the countries leading the upcoming UN Water Conference, set for March 2023. To be part of the solution, the COP27 Presidency launched on Monday the Action on Water Adaptation and Resilience Initiative (AWARe) to put push for water and adaptation investments for the most vulnerable communities and ecosystems in Africa. The programme will work on decreasing water loss, propose and implement policy methods for adaptation and promote cooperation. Some 40 per cent of the world's people is affected by water scarcity; 80 per cent of wastewater is discharged untreated into the environment, and more than 90 per cent of disasters are water-related, as the UN Secretary-General noted earlier this year. As the second and final week of COP27 began, Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, reminded negotiators that people and the planet are relying on the process to deliver. "Let's use our remaining time in Egypt to build the bridges needed to make progress on 1.5 [degrees Celsius], adaptation, finance and loss and damage," he said. During an informal update, COP27 President Sameh Shoukry, said that while negotiators have concluded work on some issues "there is still a lot of work ahead". "If we are to achieve meaningful and tangible outcomes of which we can be proud of, we must now shift gears and complement the technical discussions with more political high-level engagement", he told the plenary. Mr. Shoukry added that parties currently "need more time" to discuss issues regarding mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, gender and agriculture and he has asked cofacilitators to aid them. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt - Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, speaking to the international community about flood-ravaged Pakistan, said the country needed additional funding, not debts, to rebuild a resilient and adaptive infrastructure as the financing gap widened by the day, calling for climate finance for developing and vulnerable countries. "We must fight to rebuild a resilient and adaptable infrastructure, which can only be done with additional funding rather than loans and debt... But the chasm is growing wider by the day. "It is the global north's responsibility to understand our plight," the prime minister said in his National Statement at the COP27 summit. He told the international gathering that climate change-related catastrophic flooding in Pakistan had affected 33 million people - the population of three European countries - with more than half of those affected being women and children. The floods, he said, had destroyed over 8,000 kilometers of highway, damaged over 3,000 kilometers of railway tracks, and washed away crops covering four million acres. According to the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment, the total loss and damage are estimated to be more than $30 billion. He claimed that Pakistan suffered the man-made disaster despite contributing less than 1% of its carbon footprint. He claimed that Pakistan was spending billions of dollars of its own money to provide millions of people with shelter, homes, medical assistance, and food packages. "How can anyone expect us to carry out this massive task on our own?" he asked, thanking the international community for extending assistance to Pakistan for flood relief. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 6th November,2022 (WAM) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is participating in the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), being held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, with a delegation consisting of a diverse range of delegates, representing over 70 public and private entities, policymakers, negotiators, business leaders, a number of female and youth entrepreneurs as well as civil society organisations. The delegation will focus on strengthening the UAE's close partnership with Egypt, supporting the Egyptian COP27 Presidency in their endeavour to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as bridging outcomes from COP27 to COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference in 2023. The main objective of the UAE's participation in COP27 is to highlight the nation's commitment to a low-carbon path, which creates opportunities for sustainable socio-economic development in all countries, including developing countries, which are the most climate-vulnerable. Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, said, "In line with the directives of the UAE leadership, the nation's delegation at COP27 aims to contribute practical solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate impacts, accelerate low-carbon economic growth and create sustainable economic and social development opportunities across all nations, including the Global South and developing countries. We aim to highlight the UAE's decades-long track-record of climate diplomacy and creating practical climate solutions that meet the aspirations of developing and vulnerable nations." "The UAE is keen to reinforce efforts to cut emissions, meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and adopt a sustainable economic pathway aligned to Net Zero by 2050. The UAE aims to accelerate progress on all fronts: mitigation, adaptation, finance and loss and damage, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable countries. We will cooperate with the international community to push for a realistic energy transition that leaves nobody behind, as well as for immediate support for those already suffering the worst impacts of climate change," he added. Dr. Sultan, who is also the Chairman of Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), a global renewable energy leader, said the UAE believes that climate action will unlock economic growth and opportunity for future generations. He said the UAE takes its responsibility to lead the UN climate process forward as the host of COP28 very seriously. "COP28 will be a milestone COP - set to deliver the first ever comprehensive assessment of the world's efforts to tackle climate change through the Global Stocktake. This is a key opportunity to raise global ambition. To make COP28 a success, it must be truly inclusive. The UAE will ensure we include everyone in the dialogue - from business and industry to academia, youth and civil society." Highlighting the focus of the country on identifying implementable and pragmatic solutions to climate change, Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, said, "As the world convenes at COP27 to find implementable solutions to address climate change, the UAE's experience and track-record will serve as a guiding force in helping shape a realistic climate action agenda. The UAE will be the first country in the MENA region to develop a national pathway to net zero. This represents a pragmatic and vital step forward to mobilise whole-of-country efforts and build on the Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative. We look forward to showcasing our approach and expertise for a net-zero world in Sharm El Sheikh." The UAE will also reaffirm the role of young people and women in building global consensus for climate action. Shamma bint Suhail Faris Al Mazrui, Minister of State for Youth Affairs, said, "The UAE has established a model for empowering young people as sustainability leaders and champions and encourages them to actively take a role in shaping pathways towards Net Zero. At Sharm El Sheikh, we are joined by a delegation of youth taking part in both the Conference of Youth (COY) as well as COP27 where we will highlight the UAE's model of youth empowerment by asking youth to lead our participation. Youth play a critical role in carrying out the UAE's climate agenda. We reaffirm our commitment to youth regionally and globally and will work hand in hand with them to find realistic solutions to climate change." A proven track record in climate action The UAE began its journey towards realising a sustainable future under the leadership of the nation's Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. Under the late Sheikh Zayed's Presidency, the UAE became an official UNFCCC party in March 1996 and was the first country in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, the first to commit to an economy wide reduction in emissions with the Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative. Home to three of the world's largest single-site and lowest-cost solar plants, the UAE has invested over $50 billion in clean energy investments across 70 countries, of which 31 are climate vulnerable states. The nation has committed to additional $50 billion in the next 10 years. The UAE recently signed the UAE-US Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) to decarbonise the energy the world relies on today, while scaling up investment in zero carbon energies in both the countries and in emerging economies around the world. PACE will source and catalyze $100 billion in investments to produce 100 GW of clean energy in the UAE, the US and emerging economies by 2035. The UAE has been the first in MENA to invest in industrial-scale carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS), the first to deploy peaceful nuclear power, and achieved the most cost-competitive wind power generation globally. The nation has pioneered the exploration of clean alternatives such as green hydrogen. The UAE has also taken proactive and global-first initiatives to cut methane intensity and emissions, achieving the lowest methane intensity rate in the global energy sector two decades before the global pledge was made calling for gradual reduction. The UAE updated its second Nationally Determined Contributions in September 2022, with the aim of reducing carbon emissions by 31 percent by 2030. Collaborations to accelerate clean energy transition and develop inclusive solutions The UAE is also promoting holistic solutions to address climate change, such as accelerating investment in climate-smart Agri-Tech through the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate). The UAE pledged US$1 billion of increased investment to accelerate innovation in climate-smart agriculture and food systems. The UAE launched Etihad 7, a UAE-led innovation program, dedicated to securing funding for renewable energy projects in Africa, with the goal of supplying clean electricity to 100 million people by 2035. The UAE hosts the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The UAE and IRENA joined efforts to launch the Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) Platform, a global climate finance facility targeting the deployment of 1.5 gigawatts of new renewable power in developing countries by 2030. The UAE committed US$400 million in funding provided by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) towards the platform, which was formalised through agreements signed by IRENA with ADFD and Masdar, the UAE-based global renewable energy leader. Masdar currently invests more than $20 billion in renewable energy projects in more than 40 countries, which generate over 15GW of clean power and displace nearly 19.5 million tonnes of emissions annually. The UAE's climate action relies on innovation and technology, including taking measures to enhance food security through Bustanica, the world's largest vertical farm operated by the Emirates Group, which produces over 1,000 tonnes of leafy greens every year, and farms in Al Ain that are now producing UAE-grown blueberries and strawberries. The UAE also supports grassroots community empowerment through programmes such as the Zayed Sustainability Prize, which recognises impactful, innovative and inspiring sustainability initiatives. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 30th October, 2022 (WAM) -- Mariam Khalifa Al Kaabi, UAE Ambassador to Egypt, said that the bilateral relations between the UAE and Egypt are a model in close relations, noting that the UAE's hosting of the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Egypt's hosting of COP27 will promote joint climate action and support the sustainable development plans of the two countries. In an interview with the Emirates News Agency (WAM), Al Kaabi stressed that the ties between the two countries are based on the foundations of mutual respect and appreciation, affirming that they share historical deep-rooted relations, and referred to a quote by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, where he emphasised that the renaissance of Egypt is the renaissance of the Arab region. Egypt was among the first countries to recognise the formation of the UAE, she added, highlighting the significant advancement in their bilateral ties in recent years in several major sectors, most notably the economic and trade sectors, leading to a rise in their trade exchange to record levels. Al Kaabi said that the upcoming period will witness further cooperation between the two countries, especially with Egypt hosting COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh and the UAE hosting COP28 in 2023. She then highlighted the keenness of the two countries to share their climate change expertise related to the risks and challenges facing various development sectors. The UAE is the largest investor in Egypt, with over 1,250 Emirati companies operating in the country. The two countries are manufacturing vehicles through the establishment of a joint Emirati-Egyptian company that produces natural gas and gasoline-powered vehicles made by Egyptian labour, upon the directives of their leaderships to localise modern industrial technologies and train professional technical personnel, she added. Emirati business leaders are investing in projects in the new administrative capital and New Alamein in Egypt, in light of the investment potential of Egypt's real estate sector, as well as infrastructure, energy and manufacturing projects in the country. Al Kaabi highlighted the keenness of the two countries to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of their relations, by organising a major celebration in Egypt, under the theme, "Egypt and UAE - One Heart." \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 20th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Negotiators at a global climate conference in Egypt on Sunday agreed to create a long-sought fund to compensate climate-vulnerable countries, Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa) reported. The payment of reparations to poorer countries for damage caused by climate change was one of the thorniest issues at the two-week conference. According to dpa, the agreement is seen as a big win for low-income countries that often bear the impacts of climate change though they have contributed the least to causing it. The approval of the funding came at a final plenary session and drew applause from delegates. The conference, known as COP27 , also saw delegates ratify a final declaration during a session that ran into the early hours of Sunday in Egypt's coastal resort of Sharm El Sheikh. The decision to create the climate damage fund drew instant praise. Ant\'f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), said it was an important step towards justice. "I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period," he said in a video recording posted on his Twitter account. "Clearly this will not be enough, but it is a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust," he added. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called the COP27 outcome "historic." Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, the conference's president, told delegates the outcome was a testament to the fact that "multilateral diplomacy still works." Pakistan's Climate Minister, Sherry Rehman, said the fund was "a down payment in the investment in our joint future." Pakistan experienced devastating and deadly floods this year. "What we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and the planet," he told the final session. He added that the outcome does not address the "yawning gap between climate science and our climate policies." Referring to cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, Timmermans said, "The EU came here to get a strong language agreed and we are disappointed we didn't achieve this." The creation of the fund was an "important" step for rebuilding trust with vulnerable countries, the president of environmental think tank World Resources Institute, Ani Dasgupta, said. "In a historic breakthrough, wealthy nations have finally agreed to create a fund to aid vulnerable countries that are reeling from devastating climate damages," Dasgupta said. \</doc>

By Belal Nawar In Nov. 2022, the Conference of the Parties (COP) in its 27th edition will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Such a decision was made at last year's COP26 summit hosted by the United Kingdom in Glasgow, Scotland. Now the city of Glasgow in Scotland will be the starting point for the longest, non-stop, baton relay ever attempted as the city passes hosting duties to Egypt for COP27 . Before reaching Egypt, the baton&mdash;which was created by Glasgow-based 4c Design&mdash;will travel by land and water through 17 nations, including Scotland, Wales, England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and Cyprus. The Baton is set to arrive at Sharm el-Sheikh on Nov. 5, just in time for COP27 as STV News claimed. Read More: Abu Dhabi Set To Host World's &lsquo;First-of-its-Kind' Parenthood:&hellip; Along the way, the baton will &ldquo;inspire and advocate&rdquo; local climate action by stopping at hundreds of schools, at-risk areas, and climate change programs, including 27 in the UK alone. But what is the fundamental purpose of this initiative? The statement on the baton, which says, &ldquo;We are Running Out of Time,&rdquo; is a message to world leaders attending the conference. This campaign highlights the significance of sending a strong message to COP27 decision-makers with enough backing to make it unavoidable if we are to have any chance of securing a transition to a secure climate future. The COP is critical for global climate action and raising awareness about what nations need to do to play their part in the solution. The major goal is to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and global emissions must be lowered in half by 2030, with a goal of reaching &ldquo;net zero&rdquo; by 2050. The previous success of COP26 Glasgow was due to the submission of many new &lsquo;Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),' which are climate action plans set to reduce emissions and adapt to climate effects. When implemented together, these plans are efficient enough to put the world on track for a temperature below 2 degrees Celsius. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 13th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The General Secretariat of the Khalifa International Award for Date Palm and Agricultural Innovation, launched two initiatives during its participation within the official delegation of the UAE in the 27th Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh. The first initiative was titled "Regional Renewable Ecosystems" and the second was titled 'Regional Futures. Regenerative Systems" and "The International Initiative to Adapt Date Palm Oases under Climate Change Challenges", where the launching ceremonies took place at the UAE pavilion, under the supervision of Dr. Abdelouahhab Zaid, the Award's Secretary-General; Dr. Helal Humaid Saed Al Kaabi, member of the Award's Board of Trustees; Dr. Ibrahim Hafidi, Director of the National Agency for the Development of Oasis and Argan Tree Areas in the Kingdom of Morocco; Abdelaziz Al-Haraiqi, Director of the Hassan II Institute of Agriculture and Veterinary in the Kingdom of Morocco, and Dr. Sandra Piesik, as well as several experts, and respected guests. Dr. Hafidi and Dr. Al-Haraiqi praised the efforts of the award in the development of the date palm cultivation sector at the national, regional and international levels, where these initiatives translated the vision of the UAE's wise leadership in preserving biodiversity and reducing carbon emissions to reach zero neutrality by 2050. They praised the importance of these initiatives as they aligned with the objectives of COP27 , and represented a clear demonstration of the award's commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to mitigate climate change impacts. COP27 and supported the Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs) reports. The goal of renewable regional ecosystems is also to enhance cooperation and build partnerships with national, regional and international organisations, to achieve the SDGs, and to ensure that the world remains a more resilient and sustainable economic place where people are at the heart of climate talks. Dr. Al Kaabi also pointed out in his statement on the second initiative (The International Initiative to Adapt Date Palm Oases under Climate Change Challenges) that due to the social, economic and climatic changes facing the world today, the initiative has focused on the development of the date palm oases and the valorisation of the agricultural, cultural and social wealth of these oases, in the Middle East and North Africa, and to protect and develop the agricultural heritage. On the terms of reference of The International Initiative to Adapt Date Palm Oases under Climate Change Challenges, Dr. Zaid, added that this initiative is based on the "Sustainable Oases" initiative presented by the Kingdom of Morocco at the 22nd Climate Change Conference in Marrakech, Kingdom of Morocco (COP22) in 2016, and the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 16th November, 2022 (WAM) - As part of its forward-looking vision and youth empowering agenda, the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) hosted a youth debate during COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt that is being held from November 6th to 18th. The debate took place on the 10th of November at the UAE Pavilion, and it was organised in collaboration with the Federal Youth Authority of the UAE and covered the challenging topic of climate change and securing energy. Other stakeholders include Arab Youth Council for Climate Change, Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). The 45-minute debate saw a dynamic battle between the team that supported the existence of opportunities in securing energy while limiting the repercussions of the climate change crisis, and the opposition team that opposed the idea. Both teams presented their point of view in the presence of the jury and the audience that later voted for the winning team. The debate was won by the supporting team, who shared their point of view on the importance of energy security and mentioned some facts about greenhouse gas emissions and how energy resources can be changed and converted into resources that help reduce emissions. They also focused on the need to diversify clean energy sources such as renewable energy and supported their argument with examples from different countries of the world, including China and the UAE. The jury included a group of high-level experts and specialists, including Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, Executive Director of the UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators (UICCA), Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, EAD's Secretary General, Eng.

ABU DHABI, 11th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Africa could capture as much as 10 percent of the global green hydrogen market, helping to create up to 3.7 million jobs and adding as much as US$120 billion to the continent's gross domestic product (GDP), according to a landmark report issued jointly by Masdar and its Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) platform on the sidelines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). An African hydrogen industry with that production capacity would likely create 1.9 to 3.7 million jobs and boost GDP by as much as US$60 to 120 billion by 2050, the report finds. Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Masdar Chief Executive Officer, said, "This report provides a blueprint for African nations to deliver sustainable, low-carbon growth while extending energy access across the continent. Green hydrogen has the potential to reduce emissions, unlock economic opportunities, and create new and valuable jobs for countries across the Middle East and North Africa region. Masdar has long recognized green hydrogen's potential, with investments as far back as 2008. With several green hydrogen projects underway today around the world &ndash; including a number in Africa &ndash; we look forward to continuing to work closely with our African partners to maximize the many achievable benefits of green hydrogen highlighted in this report." Africa could be among the most competitive sources for green hydrogen in the world, the report shows, with a cost of US$1.8 to 2.6 per kilogram (kg) in 2030, further decreasing to about US$1.2 to 1.6 per kg by 2050 as hydrogen production technology matures and renewable energy costs continue to decline. Proximity to demand centers in Europe and Asia also optimally positions the continent to build an export-oriented hydrogen sector, the report suggests, noting African energy exports via green hydrogen and derivatives would reach 20 to 40 mtpa by 2050. The remaining 10-20 mtpa would serve domestic hydrogen demand, helping to boost electrification of African communities and delivering other socioeconomic benefits, including a more sustainable energy grid, expanded clean energy access, and reduced reliance on fossil fuel imports. Masdar Director of Asset Management and Technical Services, Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi, said: "Scaling up green hydrogen is an opportunity to not only build a robust global-export sector on the African continent, but also to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy overall. The grid-connected renewables used for green hydrogen production can feed energy into the grid to provide affordable clean energy to under-resourced areas &ndash; notably, in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has an average electrification rate of only 48 percent." Enabling production on the scale of 30-60 mtpa would require between 1,500 and 3,000 terawatt hours (TWh) of renewable energy &ndash; equivalent to more than 50 times Africa's current total production from solar and wind, the report states. The largest share of the investments (US$320- 610 billion) would go to the renewables needed to produce the hydrogen, followed by electrolysis plants (US$115-220 billion). For export projects, most of the needed capital is expected to come from foreign investors, according to the report. Beyond investments, the report recommends six broad areas for action: development of an integrated master plan; governance, international coordination, and mobilization; establishment of regulatory frameworks for hydrogen exports; investments in infrastructure; sourcing and building a highly skilled workforce; and deployment of project de-risking mechanisms. Masdar, one of the world's leading clean energy companies, is actively involved in a number of projects related to green hydrogen production. In April, Masdar and Egypt's Hassan Allam Utilities signed agreements with leading Egyptian state-backed organizations to cooperate on the development of green hydrogen production plants in the country, targeting an electrolyzer capacity of 4 gigawatts by 2030, and output of up to 480,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 10th November, 2022 (WAM) -- A UAE newspaper has said that it was to be expected that the UN Climate Change Conference, also known as Conference of Parties 27 ( COP27 ), which opened at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on 6th November has got off to a serious and realistic dialogue of what the challenges are and what needs to be done. "It is interesting that since the conference is being held in Egypt, we get to hear the assessments and solutions being offered by the Arab and African leaders more than if the conference had been held in some European city. A conference at a Western venue drowned out the voices of the developing countries," said Gulf Today in an editorial on Thursday. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres delivered a message about the dangers awaiting humanity, while other leaders have offered assessments of the situation on climate change and the dangers it poses. President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan said, "The UAE is known as a responsible supplier of energy and will continue to play this role for as long as the world needs oil and gas. We will focus on lowering carbon emissions emanating from this sector." Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said, "Climate change will not stop without our intervention." Libyan President Mohamed El-Manfi said, "Climate change undermined the opportunities of development and investment and curbs economic growth, particularly in the developing countries that are agriculture-based, that is due to the difficulty to make up for the loss of natural resources." Meanwhile a UN-backed report commissioned by Egypt and Britain, co-hosts of the climate conferences in Glasgow and in Sharm El-Sheikh said that the Global South would need $2 trillion annually by 2030 to cope with the challenges of climate change, and of this $1 trillion should come from the developed world, and the rest has to be generated by the developing countries themselves. As of now, developing countries excluding China are generating $500 billion to meet the demands of climate change. The 100-page report, called Finance for Climate Action, says, "The world needs a breakthrough and a new road map on climate finance that can mobilise the $1 trillion from external finance that will be needed by 2030." \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 7th October, 2022 (WAM) - For only the second time since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the UN Climate Change Conference, popularly known as "Cop", will return to the Global South, said an English-language daily. "The start of Cop27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, next month will also mark the return of the conference to the MENA region, one of the areas of the planet most vulnerable to an unrelenting rise in global temperatures. The momentum built there will be capitalised on when Cop28 is held in the UAE the following year," The National said in an editorial on Friday. The paper added, "It is often the vulnerable, poorer countries that have done the least to damage the world's climate but will nonetheless suffer the greatest consequences. The Egyptian government has promised to prioritise discussions about fairness and equitability in the world's response to climate change during Cop27 ." "Catastrophic floods in Pakistan this year present just one example of what "loss and damage" looks like. But for developed nations, many of whom are squeezed by a web of economic strains spun out of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, such a discussion cannot be had easily," it noted. "We need to find a practical solution that accommodates the various concerns, and it's up to us as the incoming Cop presidency to sort of navigate and finesse this process," Wael Aboulmagd, Egypt's Cop27 special representative, said last month. There are more creative ways of burden-sharing that could help propel the conversation forward. Debt swaps, a mechanism whereby financial creditor nations could forgive loans to indebted countries in exchange for commitments from the latter to invest in climate projects, are one. When it comes to reducing emissions, these financially indebted countries can often be said to be "in credit". The "swap" method has already been tested in nearly 40 countries in recent decades, though the sums of debt forgiven or swapped have been small - rarely amounting to more than $30 million. Cop27 , however, could provide new impetus for such agreements, if negotiations over other forms of compensation become fraught. Another path is boosting foreign direct investment into renewable energy and other climate-related projects. Countries with advanced economies already have a wealth of experience investing in such projects - with safe, stable societies and a highly educated workforce, they have become the market leaders in developing wind, solar and nuclear projects. Some have entered the fray through their capital-rich sovereign wealth funds. Five years ago, Masdar, the clean energy subsidiary of Mubadala, one of the UAE's sovereign wealth funds, backed the world's first commercial floating windfarm, in Scotland. On Thursday, the One Planet Sovereign Wealth Funds Network - a group of 45 of the world's largest institutional investors, controlling more than $37 trillion in assets - convened in Abu Dhabi to discuss ways to marshal its hefty resources towards a more sustainable future. One of the main topics up for discussion was renewable investment in emerging and developing markets. "The developing world, and the Middle East in particular, needs the world to find a greater balance in its climate response. But the region is not destined to be a passive beneficiary - it has the potential to lead the conversation, as Cop27 is sure to show. At "Countdown to Cop27 ", another event held in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates addressed the audience, highlighting the chronic underinvestment that plagues research and development on climate issues. 'The Middle East,' he said, 'can be part of the solution'," the daily concluded. \</doc>

By Binsal Abdulkader ABU DHABI, 10th October (WAM) -- COP 28, the UN conference on climate change to be hosted by the UAE next year, will be a significant one, as it will mark the first global stocktake of climate progress since the Paris Agreement, a top U.S. official told the Emirates News Agency (WAM), adding that the UAE's leadership in global climate action is going to be critical. "I am confident [about the success of COP 28] because the UAE has really been a leader in the climate sphere, which is one of the reasons that they were chosen to host the COP 28," said John F. Kerry, U.S. Presidential Envoy for Climate, while talking about the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will be held in Dubai in 2023. In an exclusive interview with WAM in Abu Dhabi, he said that 2023 would be a very special year, different from this year [in climate action], because the process [COP 28] is going to require that we evaluate where we are, so by definition COP 28 is going to be a very significant COP and the UAE's leadership is going to be critical," he emphasised. The U.S. Presidential Envoy was on a visit to attend the Sustainability Summit organised by the Economist, and the fifth annual One Planet Sovereign Wealth Fund summit in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. COP 27 and crucial cooperation with UAE Kerry expressed his hope that COP 27 to be held in Sharm El- Sheikh in Egypt next month would provide additional ambition for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. " COP 27 The U.S. and the UAE are cooperating on a number of climate action initiatives, and especially the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) that will help many other countries, the envoy said. AIM for Climate, a major new initiative led by the UAE and the U.S. with the support of over 30 governments, had announced in November 2021 an "early harvest" of US$4 billion of increased investment to accelerate innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems over the next five years. The initiative will help tackle drought, the challenges of extreme heat and develop resilient crops, Kerry noted. "There is a lot of work that the UAE has done on this. So, it's a very helpful partnership." U.S. remains committed to Gulf The United States remains deeply committed to peace and development in the Arabian Gulf region, the top diplomat stressed. He pointed out that the attention of world nations has been diverted to certain important global developments such as the conflict in Ukraine, the coronavirus pandemic and inflation in global economy. "[Still], I don't think there is any reason to believe that the United States is less, somehow, engaged or involved [in the Arabian Gulf]. And as you know, President Biden has been to the region and Secretary of State Blinken has been here, and we remain committed," asserted Kerry. He was sworn in on 20th January 2021, as the United States' first Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and the first-ever Principal to sit on the National Security Council entirely dedicated to climate change. \</doc>

In response to a UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report that highlighted that CO2 emissions in the construction industry hit an all-time high in 2021, Trackunit CEO Soeren Brogaard called for the sector to take stronger action on 2050 decarbonisation targets. At COP27 "This report highlights that, despite a lot of good initiatives in the construction sector on sustainability, we still have a very long way to go if we are to make 2050 targets. The industry needs to get even better at bringing emissions down and it will only do that if it puts sustainability right at the heart of everything it does," stated Brogaard. In early September 2022, a youth movement called for global leaders to take "urgent and bold climate adaption action" and, in November 2022, Abu Dhabi environment and energy agencies unveiled a 60% clean electricity plan for emirate by 2035. The UNEP said the sector made up more than 34% of global energy demand in 2021. It added that, in Europe, the buildings sector made up 40% of energy demand and said that 80% of that demand was met with fossil fuels. He pointed out that telemetry service providers like Trackunit could play a role in helping the industry meet 2050 targets because they delivered advanced machine insights that could give users the ability to extend the life cycle of machines, utilise their tools more efficiently and cut out bad practices that fueled the CO2 emissions crisis. Later in November 2022, Partanna and Red Sea Global signed a MoU that will see the firms explore carbon-negative concrete developments. He remarked, "We're at a crossroads. We're very active in the industry-wide push to eliminate downtime in construction and this is a potential opportunity to take the rich data we generate, share it, and democratise it, so that our downtime targets can be reached. Through connectivity and the constant evolution of the ecosystem, we can consign downtime to the past." He concluded, "Construction will emerge as a fitter, leaner industry and those 2050 targets are attainable. I really believe we can do this, but it will take commitment, a lot of hard work and some tough decisions that need to be taken as soon as possible."

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 14th November, 2022 (WAM) - Egypt's COP27 Presidency, in partnership with World Meteorological Organization (WMO), launched AWARe (Action on Water Adaptation or Resilience), an initiative that will champion inclusive cooperation to address water related challenges and solutions across climate change adaptation. AWARe aims at contributing to a successful outcome at the 2023 UN Conference on Water and it brings together the Water and Climate Coalition, the Adaptation Action Coalition as well as the Marrakesh Partnership Climate Action Pathway Water towards scaling up adaptation action. Speaking on the initiative, COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said: "Increasing water demand from a growing population and variable supply does not make for sound economics. As we work to design and implement solutions across adaptation, water management must feature prominently in the discussions and actions. Water is life and is vital to sustaining lives and livelihoods. Through the AWARe initiative we are bringing together stakeholders to alleviate the challenges faced by the world's vulnerable communities and ecosystems." In close cooperation with African Union (AU) and African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW) among other stakeholders, the initiative aims at offering transitional adaptation solutions for planet and people. AWARe will focus on three priorities for action: Decrease water losses worldwide and improve water supply. Propose and support implementing mutually agreed policy and methods for cooperative water-related adaptation action and its co-benefits. Promote cooperation and interlinkages between water and climate action in order to achieve Agenda 2030, in particular SDG 6. AWARe was launched during the opening session of COP27 's Thematic Day for Water with addresses by Dr Hani Sewilam, Egypt Minister of Water Systems, and Irrigation; Ambassador Ayman Amin Tharwat, Deputy Director for the Department of Climate, Environment and Sustainable Development for the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Dr. Elena Manaenkova, Deputy Secretary General of WMO. Minister Hani Sewilam said: "The Global Water Crisis is affecting billions of people worldwide. The AWARe initiative will catalyze inclusive cooperation to address water as a key to climate change adaptation and its co-benefits, as well as enhanced resilience." Dr. Elena Manaenkova, Deputy Secretary General of World Meteorological Institute also commented: "74% of all natural disasters are water related, we still need to do a lot more to help societies, we must have effective disaster management strategies that protect communities and limit climate-related hazards." The AWARe initiative promotes measures to decouple economic growth from freshwater use and degradation; develop national utilization plans, adaptation and mitigation strategies and protect and restore freshwater ecosystems; seek cooperative analysis of river basin scale adaptation and mitigation options and risk of mal-adaptation and support mutually agreed policy solutions to advance a 'do no harm' approach. It seeks to support promotion of sustainable waste-water management, sanitation policies and strategies, and water-wise energy pathways besides working on improving early warning systems for extreme weather events. It will also work towards linking water resources policies with national climate action to reflect climate change long-term impacts on water resources and demand, and to support preparedness and adaptation measures. The Pan-African Center for Water Climate Adaptation, hosted by Egypt, will ensure the principal delivery mechanism and will focus on main activities and actions including finance, technology and capacity building. \</doc>

ALGIERS, 1st November, 2022 (WAM) -- The upcoming COP27 UN climate change conference, taking place in the heart of the Arab world in Egypt, represents another vital opportunity for restoring trust between developed and developing countries, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said in Algiers on Tuesday, addressing the Summit of the League of Arab States. The UN chief urged wealthier countries to be at the forefront of action to curb global temperature rise. "They must reduce their emissions this decade - in line with keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees - and fully pivot to renewable energy. They must finally mobilize US$100 billion annually to support developing countries build resilience," he said. Additionally, half of all climate finance must go towards adaptation, and the global community must urgently address climate impacts that are beyond countries' abilities to adapt. "I just came from Pakistan, and it broke my heart to see a flooded area that is three times the size of my own country, Portugal," Guterres told the Summit. He stated that action on 'loss and damage' is a moral imperative that must be front and centre at COP27 "It is immoral and unreasonable to expect communities that did nothing to cause global heating to pay the price for climate impacts," he said. \</doc>

By Ghalia Taman Nov. 6 was a day that brought together world leaders in one room for the long-awaited conference known as COP27 . Taking place in Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh, this global event is all about making a complete shift in how the world will take on climate change. The excitement and build-up towards the event reached its peak on the conference's first day with EgyptAir alone making over 250 trips, bringing a mass of attendees from cities like Munich and London all the way to Sharm El Sheikh. To truly kickstart the climate-centered conversation, one of the airlines flying into Sharm was powered by biofuel showcasing one of the many ways to take real action. On the day, over 41,000 attendees made their way to the designated blue zone, the UN-managed space of 156 halls where all the negotiations and talks will happen, accessible only to attendees credited by the UNFCCC Secretariat. Some of the biggest world leaders also made a special appearance including the UK's Prime Minister, H.E Rishi Sunak, France's president H.E Emmanuel Macron as well as the UK's former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. At one point during the day, Macron and Sunak sat together for the first time since the British Prime Minister took office. Kicking off the 13-day event was the opening ceremony spearheaded by Alok Sharma, the president of COP26 who realistically stressed how this year's conference is all about taking active financial action: "We know that we have reached a point where finance makes or breaks the progress of the program ahead of us." - Alok Sharma via English Ahram As he stood in a room among world leaders and made his final remarks, it was time for him to pass the torch to this year's COP27 president HE Sameh Shoukry. The newest president was all about creating a united front stating that the reason why efforts towards climate change are slow and uneventful traced back to how the entire world is disjointed and polarized thus calling for transparency and more open conversations between world countries concluding that this is how change can actually happen. All these events and the destruction and impact represent a lesson to be learned and alarm all over the planet ... to invite us to more precaution, and to act quickly to take all necessary measures as per our commitments and pledges." - HE Sameh Shoukry via English Ahram Read More: Continuing in the same vein, Simon Stiell, the executive director of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) who says that a new era must begin, one in which action has to be taken seriously and that anyone who does not want to take action should not slow down the collective effort already in place. Since 2020, everything from wildfires and droughts to extensive floods have plagued world countries with the most recent victim being Pakistan. A big push for funding is needed to reverse the damage caused by the current deteriorating state of our climate. That is why for the very first time in COP history all parties taking part in the ongoing negotiations agreed to include loss and damage funding as an agenda item at the conference making a big step towards fixing the existing damage so that countries can take active change through a clean slate. As the ceremony was drawing to a close, Egypt's Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly ended it on a high note by inaugurating Sharm El Sheikh's Green Zone, an open 12,000 square meter space created to promote conversations and dialogue about climate change through events lead by local and regional voices including young people and various artists. For a taste of entertainment, Egypt's very own music producer, Hisham Kharma was chosen as the official Music theme composer at COP27 and knowing his past work including his contribution to the sci-fi show 'Al Neyaha' and the documentary 'Come to Egypt' he will definitely bring his creativity and ingenious talent to this esteemed event. The making of the official theme song will involve a collaboration with a group of Egyptian musicians as well as the renowned singer Clara Sorace known for her work on Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Le Casa de Papel. - Hisham Kharma Via Egypt today Bringing you just the highlights, COP27 has much more to offer in the upcoming days, especially with its jam-packed schedule of talks and conferences lasting until Nov 18.

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 13th November, 2022 (WAM) - The Adaptation and agriculture thematic day at COP27 focused on how the world will feed eight billion people. Throughout the day, a series of sessions and initiatives shed light on pathways forward on adaptation and climate resilient agriculture. Four initiatives - Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST), Climate Responses for Sustaining Peace (CRSP), Decent Life for a Climate Resilient Africa and Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition (I-CAN) - will urgently address the transformation of agrifood systems, the integration of climate responses to peace and security, the improvement of the quality of life of the most vulnerable in Africa by 2030, and delivery of healthy diets respectively. The focus comes at a particularly challenging year for food security as 37 million people now face starvation in the Greater Horn of Africa after four consecutive droughts; in Pakistan, unprecedented floods have battered the country's major agricultural regions; and record-breaking temperatures across Europe and the United States have led to drastically reduced crop yields. Crisis in Ukraine has caused global shortages and price hikes in wheat, oilseeds and fertiliser, underscoring the fragility of the fossil-fuel dependent food industry that has sacrificed diversity, sustainability and resilience for mass production and profits. COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said: "As we reach a milestone in human development, we must ensure that our food systems are equipped to provide communities around the world with food that is produced in an inclusive, responsible, and sustainable way. With 43 million people suffering of hunger each year, this is a wake-up call for implementation. Initiatives such as FAST are critical in today's world, where geopolitical shifts and extreme weather events can cause massive disruption to food supply chains that hurt the world's poorest and exacerbate hunger and malnutrition." Over the course of the day, several sessions and new initiatives highlighted the way forward on adaptation and climate resilient agriculture. These included: Food Security and Climate Change focused on the impact of climate change on hunger and malnutrition and how climate change adaptation could end hunger and malnutrition. How to avert, minimize, and address Loss and Damage to infrastructure which discussed the importance of partnerships between businesses and societies to invest in AI and technological early warning systems. Shaping The Way Forward for Adaptation where ministers explored specific measures needed to make progress on adaptation with regards and the development of comprehensive monitoring systems to advance climate change adaptation. Adaptation Innovations and Technologies which looked at the ways in which governments, businesses and institutions can scale up technology to support climate change adaptation. By dedicating an entire day to Adaptation and Agriculture, COP27 brought together diverse voices from policymakers, scientists, researchers, civil society, and government, who can share their successes and help communities that also need to achieve their sustainable development goals. \</doc>

The UAE and US have signed a $100bn strategic partnership deal to produce 100 gigawatts of clean energy by 2035, according to a report on WAM. The agreement was announced at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference and witnessed by UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The UAE-US Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), will see $100bn in financing and other support with the goal of deploying 100 gigawatts of clean energy in the US, UAE and emerging economies around the world by 2035. UAE clean energy ambitions Both the UAE and US reaffirmed climate ambitions with a view to their net zero 2050 goals. Ahead of COP27 , the United Nations climate change conference , being held in Egypt next month, both countries have highlighted investment in clean energy as the most reliable way to achieve essential net zero targets. COP28 will be held in the UAE next year and the country has made clear its ambitions towards being a clean energy pioneer. It has invested more than $50bn over the past ten years in clean energy technologies and solutions around the world, building three of the largest and lowest-cost solar projects in the world. The UAE's Peaceful Nuclear Energy Programme further emphasises the UAE's energy diversification strategy. UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change Dr. Sultan Al Jaber and Special Presidential Coordinator Amos Hochstein signed the Partnership on behalf of the UAE and the US. Ambassador Al Otaiba noted, "Strengthened by decades of close security, economic and energy cooperation, the UAE-US partnership on climate action and the energy transition is now a significant facet of our overall relationship. The UAE seeks to deepen cooperation across a range of initiatives with the US to maximise the multiple economic opportunities of the energy transition." Across the four pillars of PACE, the UAE and US will: &bull; Develop, finance and deploy clean energy projects in the US, UAE and third countries; invest in responsible and resilient supply chains; and promote investment in green mining, production and processing of minerals and materials that are vital to the energy transition. &bull; Accelerate investment in fossil fuel emissions mitigation; further develop CCUS technologies; and advance methane measurement and management, including enhancing domestic methane reduction programmes. &bull; Engage in the areas of advanced reactors, including Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), and to promote nuclear power as a clean energy solution to drive decarbonisation in the power sector as well as hard-to-abate sectors beyond electricity&mdash;for example, by producing cost-competitive, low-carbon applications to produce hydrogen, industrial process heat, and desalinated water that meet decarbonisation goals, air quality standards, and clean water needs. &bull; Encourage concrete investment and collaboration toward decarbonisation across all industrial sectors by 2030; scale up clean energy in long-distance transport sectors such as aviation and shipping; and promote electrification and energy efficiency as a key pathway to reducing emissions In a further boost to the UAE's clean energy ambitions Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) has added 300 megawatts of photovoltaic solar energy in 2022 from the fifth phase of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The world's largest single-site solar park using the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model will have a production capacity of 5,000MW by 2030. The fifth phase, built at an investment of AED2.058 billion, will be operational in phases. When complete in 2023, it will have a total capacity of 900MW. This year, DEWA has added 300MW to the 300MW that became operational last year from the 5th phase, taking the total to 600MW.

Masdar, Infinity Power and Hassan Allam Utilities have signed an agreement to develop a 10GW onshore wind project in Egypt. Once complete, the project will be one of the largest wind farms in the world. In a statement, Masdar, Infinity Power \- the joint venture between Masdar and Infinity (Egypt's main renewable energy developer) \- and Hassan Allam Utilities, said that the project will be part of Egypt's Green Corridor initiative. This is a grid dedicated to renewable energy projects, which will contribute to the North African country's goal of ensuring renewable energy makes up 42% of its energy mix by 2035. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, UAE Special Envoy for Climate, and Chairman of Masdar, and Dr Mohamed Shaker El-Markabi, Egypt's Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, on the side-lines of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. In August 2022, South Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power won a $2.2bn contract from Russia's Rosatom to build a nuclear plant in Egypt. The UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and President Abdel Fattah El Sisi of Egypt witnessed the signing of the agreement, along with HH Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidential Court; HH Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Tahnoun Al Nahyan, Advisor for Special Affairs at the Ministry of Presidential Court, along with a number of senior officials were also present during the signing. Dr Al Jaber said, "The scale of this mega 10GW onshore wind project \- one of the largest winds farms in the world \- is a testament to the renewable energy ambitions of the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Egypt and demonstrates Masdar's status as a global leader in clean energy. Under the guidance of our leadership, the UAE has been at the forefront of positive climate action in the region \- and globally, as reflected in the recent US-UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE). The UAE and Masdar will continue to support Egypt's net-zero goals, and we will endeavour to take forward the gains made here at COP27 , as the UAE prepares to host COP28 next year." When complete, the 10GW wind farm will produce 47,790GWh of clean energy annually and offset 23.8m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions \- equivalent to around 9% of Egypt's current CO2 emissions. In early November 2022, JLL published a whitepaper that outlined ways to decarbonise Egypt's built environment. The wind farm will also save Egypt an estimated US $5bn in annual natural gas costs and help create as many as 100,000 jobs. Direct employment in the construction phase is estimated at around 30,000, with as many as 70,000 people being employed indirectly. After construction, around 3,200 jobs will be added for operation and maintenance. Mohamed Ismail Mansour, Chairman \- Infinity Power, added: "We are proud to be working on this project in association with our partners, enabling the Egyptian government to build upon their efforts to deploy effective solutions that confront the global issue of climate change. The project will enable the country to save vast amounts of natural gas; thereby attaining economic growth, reduce carbon emissions and provide greater access to sustainable energy sources, enabling Egypt to move forward in its journey towards becoming a green economy." Nayer Fouad, CEO, Infinity Power, stated that the project will greatly benefit the country and enable Egypt to take significant steps towards becoming a more sustainable and green nation. Also in November 2022, Red Sea Wind Energy broke ground on a new 500MW wind farm in Egypt. "We look forward to expanding our portfolio of sustainable energy solutions that benefit not only Egypt, but provide the entire continent with a clean, green future," he added. Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer of Masdar commented, "With this agreement to develop our largest ever project, Masdar is proud to bolster our contribution to Egypt's renewable energy goals, while strengthening our partnerships with Infinity Power and Hassan Allam Utilities, and building on our relationship with the Egyptian Government. We are confident this project will help provide clean and sustainable energy to Egypt's people while ensuring the country meets its decarbonisation commitments." In April, Masdar and Hassan Allam Utilities signed two memoranda of understanding with Egyptian state-backed organisations to cooperate on the development of 4GW green hydrogen production plants in the Suez Canal Economic Zone and on the Mediterranean coast. Later in November 2022, Infinity Power Holding announced that its Sharm El Sheikh solar plant was fully operational. In the first phase of the project, a green hydrogen manufacturing facility will be developed and operational by 2026, able to produce 100,000t of e-methanol annually for bunkering in the Suez Canal. The electrolyser facilities could be extended to up to 4GW by 2030 to produce 2.3m tonnes of green ammonia for export as well as supply green hydrogen for local industries. Egypt enjoys abundant solar and wind resources that allow for renewable-power generation at a highly competitive cost \- a key enabler for green hydrogen production. It is also located near markets where the demand for green hydrogen is expected to grow the most, providing robust opportunities for export. Active in more than 40 countries across the world, Masdar is invested in a portfolio of renewable energy assets with a combined value of more than $20bn and a total capacity of more than 15GW. \</doc>

India has capitalised on these falling costs by designing clever power auctions that result in the lowest utility-scale solar-power prices in the world File photo As the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States is critical to preserving a liveable planet. And with the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act - which allocates hundreds of billions of dollars toward decarbonization - America has shored up its credibility just in time for the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. America is now well positioned to achieve its goal of halving its emissions by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. While the IRA's provisions could cut US emissions up to 43% by 2030, the remaining shortfall can be covered by new Environmental Protection Agency rules and stronger state-level action of the kind that we have seen this year in California. But while the IRA is a historic achievement in its own right, its largest benefits will come in the form of global economic spillover effects. Like the European Union's "Fit for 55" policies, the IRA will drive the deployment of solar, wind, and battery storage, thereby reducing the costs of these clean technologies for everyone. Ultimately, all countries will pay much less to cut their own emissions at the speed and scale necessary to keep climate change in check. To be sure, the US still needs to follow through on its other climate commitments, not least by providing the $11.4 billion per year (a paltry sum compared to other US expenditures) that it has pledged to finance mitigation and adaptation in the Global South. Counterintuitively, though, massive domestic investments in clean technologies by the US and the EU stand to be much more valuable than any direct financing they provide, owing to a little-known phenomenon known as Wright's Law. Named after the US engineer who first noticed it in the 1930s (Theodore Wright), Wright's Law predicts that every cumulative doubling of a technology's global production will reduce its cost by a constant percentage. And as recent research at the University of Oxford confirms, solar, wind, battery, and electrolyzer costs have declined steeply as their global production has increased. But even more significantly, the researchers found that Wright's Law holds true even after an innovative technology has achieved high levels of market maturity. That means the IRA's $370 billion dollar investment in clean-energy production could trigger even faster cost decreases for the technologies needed to solve the climate crisis, delivering a higher quality of life for billions of people. For example, our modelling at Energy Innovation shows that these government investments could add 1,053 gigawatts of new wind and solar energy to the US grid, making it 85 per cent clean in just eight years. Likewise, the law's new electric-vehicle (EV) tax credits could ensure that roughly one-third of all new passenger cars and heavy-duty trucks sold in the US are electric by 2030. IRA incentives are also expected to add five gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity to produce zero-carbon hydrogen, which will be critical to cutting emissions in the chemical industry and aviation. Moreover, the IRA's public investments will unlock several times as much private capital. Add in Europe's investments and China's massive push into clean energy and EVs, and annual deployment of innovative clean technologies is poised to explode. In addition to reducing emissions in the world's largest and most highly polluting economies, the exponential growth in clean technologies will make it dramatically cheaper for the rest of the world to transform their energy systems. In fact, we have already seen this dynamic playing out. Green investments by Germany and California at the start of the last decade helped reduce the costs of solar by 85% and of wind by 56% between 2010 and 2020. Similarly, EV demand in China has helped slash battery costs by 89% since 2010. For its part, India has capitalized on these falling costs by designing clever power auctions that result in the lowest utility-scale solar-power prices in the world. As the decrease in costs accelerates, countries across the Global South will be able to exploit the benefits of Wright's Law through bold policies to decarbonize cars, cooling, and electricity. Energy Innovation's modelling consistently shows that ambitious clean-energy policies expand economies and create jobs, while also improving air quality. To that end, performance standards - requiring an increasing minimum share of clean power and EVs each year - are a particularly powerful instrument. In low- and middle-income countries, such policies can elegantly leverage US and EU investments at no cost to governments beyond enforcement, and can prevent a country from becoming a dumping ground for polluting vehicles and equipment. Understanding Wright's Law can help reframe North-South dialogue at COP27 . Domestic investments by the wealthiest countries will cut costs for developing countries and stretch international finance further. The less expensive climate action becomes, the greater our chances of maintaining climate stability. Anand Gopal is Executive Director of Policy Research at Energy Innovation. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 5th November, 2022 (WAM) -- During its participation in the 2022 Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), which will begin on Sunday, 6th November, the UAE will showcase its achievements in the areas of climate action, energy transition and diplomatic campaigns to support international climate action, as well as its preparations to host COP28 next year. Through its close partnership with Egypt, the UAE will link the outcomes of COP27 and COP28 to support climate action and raise awareness of its visions and efforts to achieve sustainability. The UAE has a rich record of achievements in climate action, which it considers an opportunity to help find practical solutions to this global issue that affects everyone, in line with its efforts aimed at diversifying its economy and improving the skills of the youth. The UAE is among the world's largest humanitarian aid donors and provides direct aid during times of climate-related disasters and conflicts, whose repercussions are exacerbated by climate change. The country was the first in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement in 2015 and announce a climate neutrality strategy for 2050. Under the Paris Agreement in 2015, COP21 member states must work to adopt ambitious climate requirements. The ultimate goal of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system within a timeframe that allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enable sustainable development. The Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, which takes place annually, is the largest annual conference of the United Nations (UN). The UNFCCC has near-universal membership with 197 parties and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement, whose main objective is to keep the average global temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. The UAE announced a plan to increase the number of mangrove trees to 100 million by 2030, to promote natural solutions to limit the repercussions of climate change, protect biodiversity and help create a natural carbon store. The UAE hosts the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and has launched the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), a pioneer in the field of renewable energy. In September 2022, the UAE launched the updated version of the second edition of its Nationally determined contributions (NDCs), with the aim of reducing carbon emissions by 31 percent by 2030. The UAE is a leading global investor in renewable energy projects, allocating US$100 billion by 2030 for projects in over 70 countries. It is also empowering communities around the world and delivering sustainable solutions, through initiatives such as the Zayed Sustainability Prize. The UAE is strengthening the capacities of the youth, through hosting establishments such as the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence. The UAE has three of the largest solar power plants in the world and is the first country in the region to utilise carbon capture and storage technology on a large-scale, while diversifying its sources of emission-free energy, including peaceful nuclear energy and hydrogen. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 23rd November, 2022 (WAM) -- Ali Obaid Al Dhaheri, UAE Ambassador to China, has said that COP27 recently concluded in Egypt is an indispensable forum for bringing together the global family of nations under one roof to share scientific insights, discuss strategies and pledge commitments in combating climate change - the defining challenge of our time. In an op-ed in the China Daily newspaper, Al Dhaheri said, "Our beautiful planet is our shared home. Its bountiful rewards are nature's gifts to us all, but its ailments are problems that concern everyone - challenges we must all respond to and face together. COP27 , the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , recently concluded in Egypt. The annual summit is an indispensable forum for bringing together the global family of nations under one roof to share scientific insights, discuss strategies and pledge commitments in combating climate change - the defining challenge of our time. As my own country, the UAE, gets ready to take on the mantle of hosting COP28 in Dubai next year, it is worth reflecting on how we as Emiratis, along with our international friends and partners, especially in China, have been working towards these goals. In his recent policy report to the 20th Party Congress of the CPC, President Xi Jinping spoke astutely of the need for multilateralism and international cooperation in all spheres - diplomacy, trade, technological innovation. Perhaps nowhere is this multilateralism more desperately needed than in our planetary fight against climate change, a sentiment echoed by the President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his address at COP27 : "The dangers of climate change affect everyone without exception, and the future of our children and grandchildren depends on the measures we take today". Both of our national leaders are keenly aware of the fact that, as two advanced countries at the forefront of technological innovation, it is especially incumbent upon us to be active global stakeholders at this precarious time. We know the threat is real. We do not need alarmist predictions of impending doom; however, it is worth noting the geographical scope of recent climatic cataclysms to remind ourselves this is a responsibility we all share. Extreme weather phenomena have been unfolding all over the world: abnormal heatwaves across India, devastating monsoon rains in Pakistan; in China, the longest summer drought since official records began, alongside a record high in heavy rain warnings; in Europe, perhaps the worst summer drought for the continent in 500 years. I mention these things not to be defeatist in the face of uncontrollable forces, but to emphasise climate change is the one issue that concerns all of us, and must be acted on accordingly. It is surely no accident both this year's COP27 and next year's COP28 are taking place in the Middle East and North Africa region, an arid part of the world that has long been at the frontier of climate change and has had to adapt to living with desertification and water scarcity. As this year's host, Egypt should be applauded for doubling down on its focus on Africa - a vast and rich continent that nevertheless continues to bear the brunt of the globe's climate change woes, especially when it comes to food security. The UN has warned abnormal droughts have pushed some 22 million people in the Horn of Africa to be highly susceptible to starvation. In that regard, and largely through the efforts of the G77 group of developing countries, this year's summit has achieved an unprecedented breakthrough of agreeing on the creation of a "Loss and Damage" fund to help poorer nations facing the most risk from climate change. The UAE wholeheartedly supports Egypt's commitment to addressing the pressures faced by the Global South and recognises the far-reaching efforts China has made over several years in building resilience in some of the world's least developed countries. As the main logistics hub for the Belt and Road in the Middle East, the UAE understands first-hand the integral role multilateral initiatives can play in promoting development and connectivity, alleviating some of the absolute poverty that makes the effects of climate change immeasurably worse. For our part, to date the UAE has invested USD 16.8 billion in renewable energy ventures in 70 countries and has pledged to invest over USD 50 billion in clean energy projects at home and abroad over the next decade. Together, the UAE and China both strive to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of eliminating world hunger - something that can only be achieved through concerted scientific collaboration on an international level. Through the comprehensive strategic partnership between our two nations, the UAE and China are pioneering new agricultural technologies and sustainable methods, and working on enhancing food security. This was the main focus of our recent bilateral 'Sci-Tech' forum, hosted by the UAE Embassy to the People's Republic of China, which brought together leading policymakers and scientists from our country with their counterparts in China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Our joint efforts are bearing fruits and will go on to benefit some of those societies across the globe that are most vulnerable to climate change. Both the UAE and China understand our immense duties in nurturing and conserving our natural landscapes so that future generations can continue to enjoy their wonders. Despite its desert climate, the UAE is also blessed with some of the most impressive biodiversity in the Arabian Peninsula and an extensive wetland ecosystem. During our presidency of COP13 - the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands - in 2018, the UAE assembled the international community to discuss how best to protect these unique and fragile ecosystems, which play a major role in the mitigation of climate change. As China becomes the standard-bearer of wetland conservation this year with its presidency of COP14, it was a pleasure for me to address the opening ceremony in Wuhan at the invitation of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. I have no doubt China will continue to be a world leader in this area in the years to come. Most importantly, the UAE and China are resolutely devoted to our commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement - a resounding symbol of the very best in multilateral policymaking. The UAE was the first country in the MENA region to adopt and sign the Paris Agreement, as well as the first to commit to a net-zero target by 2050. As we prepare for our COP presidency next year, we should note COP28 in Dubai will conclude the first comprehensive assessment of all the progress that has been made on the Paris Agreement to date and determine a new way forward. Alongside this 'global stock-take', COP28 will also set the 'Global Goal on Adaptation' to assess the efficacy of ongoing global efforts to adapt to climate change. Adaptation is the very essence of our strategy. In the UAE, we do not see the fight against climate change as a zero-sum game, pitting the health of the planet in opposition to human progress. We are committed to cutting emissions, not to reducing development. While the UAE already produces some of the world's least carbon-intensive crude oil, our ongoing dedication to energy transition has inspired the Emirati people to develop a peaceful nuclear program, which prevents the release of 21 million tons of carbon emissions each year - the equivalent of removing 3.2 million cars from the road annually. As President Xi Jinping mentioned in his recent report, China is also focused on its energy transition and will seek to use existing sources in a cleaner and more effective way - this will also open up new opportunities for technological innovation. As Egypt passes the baton to the UAE for COP28, it is worth noting another resounding success of this year's summit has been the landmark deal between the two countries to build one of the world's largest wind farms, which will offset nearly 10 percent of Egypt's annual carbon emissions. The road to November 2023 and beyond is full of challenges, but the spirit of international cooperation the COP summits exemplify is strong, and it is the bedrock on which the battle against climate change must be fought." \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 8th November,2022 (WAM) -- Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, today announced the launch of the Mangrove Alliance for Climate (MAC). Led by the UAE and Indonesia, the initiative seeks to scale up and accelerate the conservation and restoration of mangrove ecosystems for the benefit of communities worldwide. The announcement took place at the 27th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), running in Egypt from 6th to 18th November. Five other countries - India, Sri Lanka, Australia, Japan, and Spain - have joined the Alliance. MAC seeks to raise awareness about the role of mangroves as a nature-based climate change solution, and, through its members, will work towards expanding and rehabilitating mangrove forests globally. Mangrove forests are among the most productive and ecologically important ecosystems on earth. They offer significant climate change mitigation and adaptation co-benefits, as they store carbon up to 400 percent faster than land-based tropical rainforests, protect coasts from rising sea levels, erosion, and storm surges, and provide breeding grounds for marine biodiversity. Around 80 percent of the global fish population depend on healthy mangrove ecosystems. Mariam Almheiri said, "Increasing reliance on nature-based solutions is an integral element of the UAE's climate action on the domestic as well as international level, therefore we seek to expand our mangrove cover. At COP26, we presented our ambitious target of planting 100 million mangroves by 2030." "We are pleased to launch MAC jointly with Indonesia, and believe it will go a long way in driving collective climate action and rehabilitating blue carbon ecosystems," she added. The Minister noted that the UAE intends to plant three million mangroves within the next two months. At the MAC launch ceremony, the website HYPERLINK https://mangrovealliance4climate.org https://mangrovealliance4climate.org MAC will follow a voluntary approach. Members can determine their own commitments towards planting and restoring mangrove forests, promoting multilateral cooperation, and sharing knowledge, while the Alliance will support their projects in the areas of mangrove research, management and protection of coastal areas, and educating the public about climate change mitigation and adaptation. Collectively, members will demonstrate their dedication to maximising the potential of nature-based solutions through mangrove planting and conservation campaigns, enhance mangroves' climate change mitigation capabilities through research and innovation, contribute to mangrove conservation worldwide through scientific and socio-economic studies, engage the community and the private sector in mangrove planting to expand blue carbon ecosystems, and step up concerted efforts to advance the global climate agenda. MAC will feature multiple interactive platforms, including annual meetings to track progress in implementing its goals, drive cooperation between members, and approve annual reports. \</doc>

NEW YORK,29th October, 2022 (WAM) -- This year's UN Climate Conference takes place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, against a backdrop of extreme weather events worldwide, an energy crisis propelled by the crisis in Ukraine, and scientific data reiterating that the world is not doing enough to tackle carbon emissions and protect the future of the planet. The Secretary-General has said COP27 must deliver a "down-payment" on climate solutions that match the scale of the problem, so, will leaders deliver? The COPs are the biggest and most important annual climate-related conferences on the planet. In 1992, the UN organised the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in which the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted and its coordinating agency - what known now as the UN Climate Change secretariat - was put into place. In this treaty, nations agreed to "stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system". So far, 197 different parties have signed it. During these meetings, nations have negotiated various extensions of the original treaty to establish legally binding limits on emissions, for example, the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 and the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015, in which all countries of the world agreed to step up efforts to try and limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, and boost climate action financing. This year marks the 27th annual summit, or COP27 . Last year's COP26, which marked five years since the signing of the Paris Agreement (one year was skipped because of the COVID pandemic), culminated in the Glasgow Climate Pact, which kept the goal of curbing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius alive, but "with a weak pulse", as the then UK Presidency declared. Advancements were made to make the Paris Agreement fully operational, by finalising the details for its practical implementation, also known as the Paris Rulebook. At COP26 countries agreed to deliver stronger commitments this year, including updated national plans with more ambitious targets. However, only 23 out of 193 countries have submitted their plans to the UN so far. Glasgow also saw many pledges made inside and outside the negotiation rooms regarding net-zero commitments, forests protection and climate finance, among many other issues. According to the Presidential vision statement, COP27 will be about moving from negotiations, and "planning for implementation" for all these promises and pledges made. Egypt has called for full, timely, inclusive, and at-scale action on the ground. According to experts, besides reviewing how to implement the Paris Rulebook, the conference will also see negotiations regarding some points that remained inconclusive after Glasgow. These issues include "loss and damage" financing so that countries at the frontlines of the crisis can deal with the consequences of climate change that go beyond what they can adapt to, and the fulfilment of the promise of $100 billion every year from adaptation finance, from developed nations, to low-income countries. The negotiations will also include technical discussions, for example, to specify the way in which nations should practically measure their emissions, so there's a level playing field for everyone. All these discussions will pave the way for the first Global Stocktake at COP28, which in 2023 will assess the global collective progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation of the Paris Agreement. So, what are the big objectives this time?1. Mitigation: how are countries reducing their emissions? Climate Change Mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent the emission of greenhouse gases. Mitigation can mean using new technologies and renewable energy sources, making older equipment more energy efficient, or changing management practices or consumer behaviour. Countries are expected to show how they are planning to implement the Glasgow pact call, to review their climate plans and create a work programme related to mitigation. This means presenting more ambitious 2030 emissions targets, since UN Climate Change has said that current plans are still not enough to avoid catastrophic warming. At COP26, delegates adopted a work programme on the global goal of adaptation established in the Paris Agreement. The plan was put in place to equip communities and countries with the knowledge and tools to ensure that adaptation actions they take, are indeed moving the world towards a more climate-resilient future. The COP27 Last year, developed countries agreed to at least double finance for adaptation, and many stakeholders are calling for even greater levels of adaptation funding to match the amounts that are now being spent on mitigation, as established in the Paris Agreement. This will definitely be a big conversation topic at Sharm el-Sheikh. 3. Climate Finance: the elephant that never leaves the negotiation room Climate finance will be a top theme once again at COP27 , many finance-related discussions are already on the agenda, with developing countries making a loud call for developed countries to reassure sufficient and adequate financial support, particularly to the most vulnerable. We will probably hear a lot about the yearly $100 billion promise by developed nations that isn't being delivered. In 2009 in Copenhagen, rich countries committed to this financing, but official reports still show that this target is being missed. Experts expect COP27 to actually make this pledge a reality finally, in 2023. The Egyptian Presidency aims to follow up on this and other commitments and pledges made in previous COPs. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 18th August, 2022 (WAM) -- A local English daily has said that record growth in renewables, representing over 80% of all new power-generating capacity last year, is the clearest sign yet that the energy transition is gathering pace. "Recent events have shown that unplugging the current energy system before we have built a sufficiently robust alternative puts both economic and climate progress at risk \- and calls into question whether we can ensure a just transition that is equitable to all," Khaleej Times said in an editorial on Thursday. A successful energy transition must be built on progress for the economy and the climate together. It must be based on scientific, economic, and engineering facts, appreciate the multiple dilemmas and challenging trade-offs, and accelerate the deployment of practical solutions. "And for that, we need an inclusive approach that leverages the experience of all sectors of society and, critically, does not exclude the energy sector," it added. What's needed is a realistic new strategy that is practical, pro-growth, and pro-climate. The strategy needs to appreciate the complexity of energy and industrial systems, and that the scale of the transition required is colossal, requiring greater alignment and collaboration on everything from capital allocation to product design, public policy, and behavioural change. This means examining the demand side of the energy system first. Wind and solar power are making great advances, but most energy is used in heavy industry, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and agriculture. These harder-to-abate sectors have the biggest effect on climate and thus require more investment, starting now. These realities are guiding the UAE's approach to the energy transition, which involves continuing to meet global needs today while investing in the new energy systems of tomorrow. The UAE has three of the world's largest single-site solar plants, has invested in renewable projects in over 40 developed and developing countries, and plans to increase its renewables portfolio to 100 gigawatts by 2030. "We have also invested in nuclear power and are laying the foundations of the hydrogen value chain, which is key to achieving net-zero emissions," the newspaper pointed out. The daily continued, "While the UAE remains a reliable supplier of some of the world's least carbon-intensive oil and gas, we will reduce its intensity by a further 25% before the end of this decade. And, as the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to announce a 2050 net-zero strategic initiative, we are decarbonizing our economy sector by sector. We have established the region's first industrial-scale carbon-capture program, and all the electricity consumed by our national oil company now comes from zero-carbon nuclear and solar power. "As this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 "This dialogue should bring everyone to the table, from governments and civil society to scientists and the private sector. It must include professionals from across the energy sector, because a rational discussion about the practicalities of an energy transition that reduces emissions without impeding economic progress is not possible otherwise." The Dubai-based stated, "But let's not wait to start this conversation. If we are going to make good on the pledges of the Paris agreement, we need to deliver results now for the climate and the economy. Our ultimate goal should be to hold back emissions, not progress." \</doc>

Climate Change has been a hot topic for the last few decades. Automotive companies are now going all-electric, fashion brands are pushing lines with ethically sourced raw materials, hardcore fast-food joints are churning out plant-based menus and billionaires are turning altruistic, all for the sake of fighting the phenomena. But corporates aside, the common man seems to be far removed from the scenes of sustainability. That being said, there are a few amongst us like Egypt's Ali Abdo Ali, a motorcycle maverick who is a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Manager by day, believes that 'Individuals are the core of any change' and that great things can be achieved by getting regular folk involved in small and frequent actions. He leads by example when he attempts the longest ride on an electric motorcycle ever in something called 'The Ride to COP27 '. COP27 COP27 is the 27th annual convention organised by the UN Climate Change Conference. It facilitates global climate talks and plans, turns these nouns into verbs by putting them into action; and provides opportunities to examine the impacts of Climate Change and propose innovations and solutions in the African continent. This year, Egypt, Ali's home nation plays host from November 6-18, 2022. 'The Ride to COP27 COP27 . The ride is expected to take between 30 to 45 days, and he is expected to cover an incredible 20,000 km or more. He will also be hitting several stopovers along the route to recharge his mind, body, and motorcycle and to hold discussions with the residents about the impact of Climate Change on their locale and the kind of actions they are taking to tackle it. Record-breaking resume As daunting a feat as this may seem, you should know that Ali is no stranger to the record books. He has three world records to his name, all ratified by the Guinness Book of World records. On January 14 , 2016, after riding a total of 5,864 km (3645 miles) he completed the 'Longest journey on a motorcycle across one country in seven days'. Just a little over a year later, he broke the record for 'The greatest distance on a motocross bike in 24 hours by an individual', which currently stands at 613.59 km (381.27 miles), which he accomplished in El Gouna, Egypt, on June 29-30, 2017. And his third record was etched into the record books on September 17, 2021 in New Alamain, Egypt when he set 'The greatest distance on an electric motorcycle in 24 hours (individual)', after covering a total distance of 919.87 km (571.5 miles). But his story is even more fascinating simply because, unlike the legends of other leagues, like Michael Schumacher who started karting at the tender age of four, Ali only began riding in 2013. His first motorcycle was a used 1993 Yamaha XTZ 660 Tenere. The less-than-mint-condition of the vehicle meant that he had to learn how to fix it himself. But he liked the bike so much that he ended up keeping it for almost four years. The ride & eco' stats For 'The Ride to COP27 ' venture, he has a different weapon of choice, a 2019 Energica EsseEsse9. It is an electric motorcycle powered by a 13.4 kWh battery that can produce a max torque output of 180 Nm of twist at the crank, which helps it propel from rest to 100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds. And with a claimed range of 200 km, he says he will be able to ride for two to three hours continuously, averaging about 70 to 90 km/h, before having to charge its battery. But one must be thinking about how does an electric motorcycle stack up to a traditional petrol engine 2-wheeler? For comparison's sake, let's consider an adventure or street bike with a relatively efficient 500cc engine. Such an example would return around 25 km/l and produce about 80 grams of CO2/km. At the end of a 20,000 km ride, it would have consumed about 800 litres of petrol and produced about 1,600,000 grams of carbon dioxide in total. In comparison, an electric bike like Ali's Energica EsseEsse9 produces zero emissions at the tail pipe. While it will be recharged at outlets that draw electricity from thermal sources, Egypt also has hydroelectric power plants and other renewable sources, such as wind and solar, which contribute to the power grid, upping the sustainability factor. The prep Ali states that for record-breaking purposes, he is not allowed to make modifications to the motorcycle, but a windshield and other accessories will be installed to improve riding comfort over the thousands of kilometres he is to travel. He will also have real-time roadside assistance in the form of a 3-member team who will be closely following him in a van with tyres, tools, and other spare parts. He is also ready to take on all sorts of weather and traffic conditions. Even the ask from a physical and psychological point of view is of a tall order. But Ali is a man of preparation. Being an avid motorcycle enthusiast, he rides several kilometers daily to keep in top mental and physical shape. The attempt will also involve several nights of desert camping, which he is quite used to and is something he often does with his wife and kids. Future fantastic The 37-year-old father of two says the fight against Climate Change doesn't end with 'The Ride to COP27 COP27 's delegates with the information and solutions collected from many discussions he would have had at the stopovers. He also plans to ride from Cape Town, South Africa to the UAE, just in time for COP28, next year. While feats like 'The Ride to COP27 ' may seem beyond belief for us commoners, it serves as a parable to help us see the bigger picture, a picture that involves the slow death of planet earth due to exaggerated consumerism and other evils, if not intervened by conscious living. Like Ali who emphasises the importance of the individual, we too would like to remind each one of you out there that 'If you think you are too small to make a change, try sleeping in a room with a mosquito'. And if enough of us do the little things like taking public transport, being part of the slow fashion movement, and eating less meat, we regain our right to live on this planet.

By Ghalia Taman Sharm El Sheikh is a resort town home to ceaseless white deserts, cascading mountain ranges and waters brimming with rich sea life. It is no wonder that it attracts divers, nature enthusiasts and ecotourists from all over the world. Now, the town is also pushing for a green transformation having already made big strides in promoting sustainable accommodation and touristic practices. This is what made Sharm the perfect host for the 27th edition of the United Nations Climate Change Conference set to run from November 6th to the 18th. If you are attending this prominent event and want to try out all that Sharm has to offer when it comes to a nature-fueled, eco-friendly adventure and experience, we have curated a guide, with the help of some experts in the field of rock climbing and free diving, to help you explore this special town and its surrounding nature. Climbing enthusiasts rejoice as Sinai is becoming a hub for ascending the region's highest peaks. Today, climbers would usually head to Wadi Gnai or St Catherine to partake in this adrenaline-fueled activity. Out of the two locations, most visitors would flock to Wadi Gnai, a deep canyon oasis that is located 100 km South of Dahab, as it is known for sport climbing. While speaking with Khaled Mousa, a professional climber and instructor who has been in the climbing scene for a decade now, he said that sport climbing is one of the easier versions of this sport. Whatever route the climbers would take, there would be anchors already in place for them to clip their ropes on. That is why St Catherine's climb at Mt. Sinai, 209 km North-West of Sharm, which offers trad or traditional climbing is considered harder because the climbers themselves have to attach the anchors as they climb and remove them on the way down. To try out the sport, Mousa recommended that climbers go on a trip or excursion to either of the two locations. The entire excursion would begin at 6 or 7 am and end during sunset. Depending on the level of each climber, there is a range of routes that can be taken that vary in terms of difficulty. The easiest is level 3A while the hardest is 7B where climbers would have to scale up vertical surfaces and slopes. After completing the climb, with Wadi Gnai, climbers have the option of an overnight stay at Mousa's camp. Food and camping tools would be available as per request. For a special private free diving course, you can also contact Khaled Mousa using this number: 00201008580011 For the true adventure junkie, Sharm is also a great spot for free diving; a type of diving that relies on one's ability to hold their breath for long durations of time underwater. We spoke with Khaled El Gammal, a free diving coach and athlete to learn more about the sport. He explained that because most of Sharm's coastline is populated with large reefs and corals, free divers can literally head out onto any pier or jetty and perform their free dive from there, reaching depths of 20 meters. For a deeper dive, freedivers can use a platform further up the water to dive depths reaching up to 100 meters. For safety reasons, each diver should have a buddy accompany them. This only applies to individuals who have received the required training. When it comes to first-timers, Sharm houses several schools specialized in freediving training including the Only One Apnea Center. Considered the first freediving center in Sharm, Only One Apnea Center opened its doors in 2007. At the school, divers would have access to introductory, intermediate and advanced courses yet to be able to free dive, students have to take a 3-dive course that would span three days. Once they have completed their training, they can either dive with the center or head to any of Sharm's coastlines and perform their dive from there. To try out your first free dive, you can contact Khaled El Gammal using this number: 00201011817770 or head to the center at Sharm. One of the main reasons why travelers flock to Sharm El Sheikh is its endless reefs teeming with bright-colored corals and kaleidoscopic collections of fish. Its waters are uniquely calm and still, allowing for better, clearer vision underwater. It's because of these conditions that Sharm has become an ideal diving spot for beginners, wreck divers, and the like especially as it boasts diverse diving opportunities ranging from wrecks and shore dives to day boats and liveaboards. For that reason, we have curated a mini guide on some cool diving spots to check out depending on your skill level. First Timers Just a few kilometers south of Na£ma Bay is the Ras Um Sid beach, an easy car or bus ride away from any of Sharm's hotels. Along the fringes of the beach is a narrow coral reef, by merely snorkeling along its waters, you will be able to see clownfish, angelfish as well as butterflyfish. To get a more immersive experience, Ras Umm Sid reef is also known to be a great diving spot, especially for first-timers. Local diving instructors would pick Ras Um Sid specifically to teach people how to dive. So if it's your first time trying out scuba diving, heading to Ras Um Sid beach can be a great first experience. Read More: Experience Qatar's World Cup At These Luxurious & Opulent&hellip; Wreck Divers In the diving community, it is known that there is one wreck that most would say is a must-visit. Along the Strait of Gubal, the passage of water that connects the Suez to the Red Sea, a cargo ship by the name of SS Thistlegorm that was stocked with supplies for British troops during WWII, sunk during the tumultuous war. Its wreckage can now be found 30 meters below the water's surface. Divers around the world visit this particular wreck because of the substantial amount of cargo that they can see and explore. Everything from motorcycles, boats to rifles, engine exhaust rings, and cylinders are found in that ship. To explore the infamous cargo ship, divers can take an overnight tour on a liveaboard, a boat built for scuba diving that spends more than one night at sea. They should be accompanied by an expert. To get the most out of the trip, visitors need to perform at least two dives to truly appreciate the wreck. Risk Takers Divers with a thirst for adrenaline usually like to head to Sharm's Blue Hole, a 120 meter sink hole lined with a vertical reef wall that is said to have taken the lives of several divers who attempted to traverse it. Its reputation is on the extreme side as it can be safe for divers as long as they attempt the dive under sensible limits. The Blue Hole is home to a very unique collection of sea life. Divers have been said to have spotted barracudas, napoleon wrasses, and parrotfish along its vertical reef. With it being located 100 kilometers north of Sharm El Sheikh, the easiest way to visit this infamous diving spot is through an organized day trip as taking a car alone can be difficult. You can head to any of the trip offices available at your hotel or certain centers at Sharm to book your tour. Located 209 kilometers northwest of Sharm is Mt. Sinai, a 2,285-metre mountain where several religious events have been said to have taken place. The most significant is that of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments along the foot of the mountain. To climb this mountain, you have to have a tour guide. This is required by the local authorities for safety reasons. That is why the easiest way to hike Mt. Sinai would be by joining a group tour that will head off from Sharm El Sheikh. As it can be extremely hot to hike during the day, most tours are known to travel overnight at 9 or 10 pm. That way hikers will reach the start of the trail in the early morning hours and by the time they reach the top of Mt Sinai, they will be able to watch the sunrise over the towering peaks. The hike itself will involve two options. Either going up the Camel Trail, known to be a switchback path, meaning that it follows a zig-zag pattern up the terrain. That path is considered the safest option when it comes to hiking. For a more difficult yet more scenic route, you can ask the tour guide to take you through the Steps of Repentance where you will have to climb up a set of stone-cut staircases to reach the peak of Mt. Sinai. During your trip, you should also make sure to visit the St. Catherine Monastery, considered one of the oldest functioning monasteries in the world and is said to house the infamous &ldquo;Burning Bush.&rdquo; It also has a museum filled with ancient manuscripts and religious icons that are said to be extremely rare. This will be a great stop for any history buffs joining the hike. If you want to try out the trip without an organized group or tour, you can contact a specialized driver through this number: 00201003157546 to give you a ride instead. With Sharm's endless desert landscape, camping can be an ideal activity for all visitors. One great spot to experience the ultimate camping trip would be at Ras Mohammed National Park. Through several platforms including TripAdvisor, you can find some great nature-based lodgings. One example is SinaCamp in the heart of Ras Mohammed National Park. It boasts a collection of tents nestled atop the white sands of the lapping desert. The camp is known to offer its guests the ultimate experience of tranquility and relaxation. With its prime location near the lapping shores of the Red Sea, guests can take a dip under the stars or lay on the sand by the water to soak up the sun's satisfying heat. At night, lodgers would huddle together around an open fire, sing and enjoy freshly brewed cups of tea. We recommend wrapping up your trip to Sharm by heading to this camp as you will get to relax and unwind before taking a flight back home.

NEW YORK, 3rd October, 2022 (WAM) -- As government representatives begin to finalize the agenda for the COP27 climate change conference in Egypt next month, for pre-COP planning in the Democratic Republic of the Congo capital, Kinshasa, Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres told journalists in New York that the work ahead is "as immense as the climate impacts we are seeing around the world". "A third of Pakistan flooded. Europe's hottest summer in 500 years. The Philippines hammered. The whole of Cuba in black-out. And here, in the United States, Hurricane Ian has delivered a brutal reminder that no country and no economy is immune from the climate crisis," he highlighted. And while "climate chaos gallops ahead, climate action has stalled," he added. The top UN Official underscored the importance of COP27 while warning that the collective commitments of G20 leading industrialized nations governments are coming "far too little, and far too late". "The actions of the wealthiest developed and emerging economies simply don't add up," he said, pointing out that current pledges and policies are "shutting the door" on limiting global temperature to 2 &deg;C, let alone meet the 1.5 &deg;C goal. Mr. Guterres warned, "we are in a life-or-death struggle for our own safety today and our survival tomorrow," saying there is no time for pointing fingers or "twiddling thumbs" but instead requires "a quantum level compromise between developed and emerging economies". "The world can't wait," he spelled out. "Emissions are at an all-time high and rising". He said that while pursuing their own "drop-in-the-bucket initiatives" international financial institutions must overhaul their business approaches to combat climate change. COP27 is "the number one litmus test" of how seriously governments take the growing climate toll on the most vulnerable countries. "This week's pre-COP can determine how this crucial issue will be handled in Sharm el-Shaikh," he informed the media, noting that the world needs clarity from developed countries on the delivery of their $100 billion pledge to support climate action in developing countries. Moreover, adaptation and resilience funding must represent half of all climate finance; multilateral development banks "must raise their game"; and emerging economies need support to back renewable energy and build resilience. While the Resilience and Sustainability Trust led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a good start, major multilateral development bank shareholders must be the driving force for transformative change, he continued. Meanwhile, in Kinshasa, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed warned environment ministers and others that the window of opportunity to avert the worst impacts of the climate crisis is closing. She stressed that greater support for climate adaptation in developing countries "must be a global priority", particularly progress on adaptation finance. Amina Mohammed recalled that at last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow, developed nations had promised to double adaptation support to US$40 billion dollars a year by 2025. The UN deputy chief called for a clear roadmap on how the funding will be delivered, starting this year. She added that US$40 billion is "only a fraction of the US$300 billion that will be needed annually by developing countries for adaptation by 2030". Ms. Mohammed underscored that the world "desperately needs hope". "We need progress, that shows that leaders fully comprehend the scale of the emergency we face and the value of COP, as a space where world leaders come together to solve problems and take responsibility," she said. The deputy chief said that it is time to prove that we are moving in the right direction "with an outcome that shows our collective commitment to addressing the climate crisis because people, and the children here today, and the planet matter". \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, 9th November, 2022 (WAM) -- First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), the UAE's largest bank and one of the world's largest and safest financial institutions, has today taken part in a panel discussion at COP27 hosted by the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). The panel, titled &lsquo;Regional Perspectives: Net Zero Banking Alliance' started with a forward-looking statement on the ambitions of the NZBA after nearly two years since its launch in April 2021. The discussion turned to topics such regional considerations that can contribute towards the ongoing development of NZBA's guidelines, as well as how more banks can be encouraged to join the NZBA. Shargiil Bashir, Chief Sustainability Officer, First Abu Dhabi Bank - FAB, said, "The word that best describes exactly what's needed to achieve net-zero is &lsquo;collaboration'. And since its inception in April 2021, NZBA has proven to be an important driver of impactful collaboration across the global banking sector. When FAB joined NZBA, we moved swiftly to align our portfolio and to meet the recommendations set out by the alliance. Our experience has been unique as the first UAE and GCC bank to join NZBA - and as we continue our journey toward decarbonisation we urge NZBA to continue their work with regional focus so that many other banks will join the alliance. It's only through collaboration, aligned frameworks, and alliances that we will all be able to achieve the ambitious target of net-zero." Eric Usher, UNEP FI Head added, "FAB and other members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance are successfully implementing the future of banking in the Middle East and African (or MENA) context. At this event, we look forward to celebrating progress and exploring opportunities for further progress in the region." The panel took place around one year on since First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) joined NZBA becoming the first UAE and GCC bank to join the alliance and in doing so committing to net-zero by 2050. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 5th November, 2022 (WAM) - Seeking ways to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, experts and decision-makers from 190 countries will gather in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18, 2022, for the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), to address threats posed by climate change. Climate change is a global emergency that goes beyond national borders. It is an issue that requires international cooperation and coordinated solutions at all levels. To tackle climate change and its negative impacts, world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris reached a breakthrough on 12 December 2015: the historic Paris Agreement. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, 194 countries agreed to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) which represent their individual emissions reduction targets. The Agreement sets long-term goals to guide all nations: -Substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature increase in this century to 2 degrees Celsius while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees; -Review countries' commitments every five years; and -Provide financing to developing countries to mitigate climate change, strengthen resilience and enhance abilities to adapt to climate impacts. The UAE has a proven track record in climate action and multilateral cooperation. It is the permanent host country for the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA); the first country in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, and the first in the region to commit to an economy-wide reduction in emissions. The UAE has a pioneering course of action for the environment since its establishment in the early seventies of the last century, in addition to 33 years of climate action that began with its signing of the the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the Montreal Protocol) in 1989. In 1995, the UAE joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate (UNFCCC) to participate in the international movement for climate action. In 2005, the UAE ratified the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Convention on Climate Change, becoming one of the first major oil-producing countries to do so and opted for implementing actions to slash its carbon emissions, including monitoring and tracking GHG emissions and assessing policies related to them. In addition, the UAE is committed to expanding the role of low-carbon technologies in the economy and investing in renewable energy and nuclear power. The UAE was the first Middle Eastern nation to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement and commit to lowering its carbon emissions. In 2006, the UAE took a major milestone in its environment and climate journey, launching the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) as a UAE global model for clean energy, sustainable and urban development. The Masdar Initiative underscores twin commitments to the global environment and diversification of the UAE's economy and focuses on the development and commercialisation of technologies in renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon management and monetisation, water usage and desalination. Reflecting the UAE's commitment to sustainability, climate action and deployment of clean energy solutions, the UAE became the seat of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in 2009, which opened its permanent headquarters in Abu Dhabi's Masdar City in June 2015. Over the past years, the UAE has been staunch supporter to the Agency's efforts to spread and use renewable energy solutions globally and has worked through a partnership between the Agency and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development to support a number of developing countries to finance the establishment of renewable energy projects with a value of $350 million. The UAE's ambitions have gone beyond deployment of clean energy solutions to adopt the latest global trends in energy production by launching the green hydrogen project, the first of its kind in the Middle East and Africa region and a key enabler in supporting the UAE's efforts to achieve global competitiveness in the green hydrogen market. The UAE submitted its first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat in 2015 after signing the Paris Agreement, and the second NDC report in 2020. In August 2022, the UAE Cabinet approved an updated version of the UAE's second NDC under the Paris Agreement. In support of the objectives of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, the document outlines the country's increased climate target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 31 percent compared to the business-as-usual scenario for the year 2030, which is projected to amount to 301 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), assuming a moderate annual economic growth rate based on historical trends. During its participation in the 2022 Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), which will begin on Sunday, 6th November, the UAE will showcase its achievements in the areas of climate action, energy transition and diplomatic campaigns to support international climate action, as well as its preparations to host COP28 next year. The UAE has a rich record of achievements in climate action, which it considers an opportunity to help find practical solutions to this global issue that affects everyone, in line with its efforts aimed at diversifying its economy and improving the skills of the youth. As part of the UAE delegation to COP27 in Egypt, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) will unveil new initiatives that enhance the country's efforts to protect the planet and face the challenge of climate change, including carbon reduction in all sectors, enhancing the participation of the private sector, expanding reliance on nature-based solutions internationally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and developing and expanding the climate research and development system. The UAE has also finalised the draft federal law on climate change, which will represent the federal framework and umbrella regulating standards and mechanisms for action for climate at the state level. The upcoming COP28 will be held at Expo City Dubai. The meeting of world leaders in November 2023 will try to find solutions to the threats posed by climate change. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said on Twitter the UAE is ready to deliver a meeting that mobilises countries to boost their efforts to fight climate change. "Hosting this global gathering will provide us with a prime opportunity to involve our most dynamic segment of society - our youth - in the meetings and negotiations that will ultimately ensure a sustainable future for generations to come," she said. COP28 focuses on key pillars, including the implementation of climate commitments and pledges, inclusion, working together to take concrete action and identifying solutions that contribute to overcoming challenges, and seizing opportunities to ensure a sustainable future for present and future generations. COP28 represents a moment of vital significance as the world seeks to maximise progress since the Paris Agreement. The conference will witness a critical stocktaking moment for climate action under the Paris Agreement, in addition to defining future Nationally Determined Contributions. With Egypt hosting COP27 , the UAE is committed to working closely with the host government to accelerate global progress in climate action and adapting to the repercussions of climate change. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 7th November, 2022 (WAM) - With climate-related disasters displacing more people than conflict, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres on Monday unveiled the details of his plan to ensure everyone on the planet is protected by early warning systems within the next five years. The Executive Action Plan for the Early Warnings for All initiative, calls for initial new targeted investments of $ 3.1 billion between 2023 and 2027, equivalent to a cost of just 50 cents per person per year. COP27 climate change conference, underway in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, during a meeting of government and UN leaders, financing agencies, 'Big Tech' companies and the private sector. Even though early warning systems save lives, vulnerable communities "have no way of knowing that hazardous weather is on its way", Guterres continued. "Countries with limited early warning coverage have disaster mortality eight times higher than countries with high coverage. The Action Plan launched today sets out the way forward to right this wrong, and protect lives and livelihoods." The UN chief had first announced the early warnings target back in March. The plan will address key gaps in understanding disaster risk, monitoring and forecasting, rapid communication, and preparedness and response. The $3.1 billion figure represents a small fraction - roughly six percent - of the requested $50 billion in adaptation financing, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The UN agency and partners drew up the plan, which was supported by a joint statement signed by 50 countries. WMO said the need for early warning systems is urgent as the number of recorded disasters has increased five-fold, driven in part by human-induced climate change and more extreme weather. Even though this trend is expected to continue, half of all countries do not have early warning systems in place, and even fewer have regulatory frameworks to link early warnings to emergency plans. Coverage is worst for developing countries on the front lines of climate change, namely the world's Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 17th November, 2022 (WAM) - COP27 is scheduled to wrap up in 24 hours but countries remain divided on several significant issues including 'loss and damage', the UN Secretary-General said on Thursday, urging parties to rise to the urgency of the moment and agree on real solutions to solve the greatest challenge facing humanity. "There is clearly a breakdown in trust between North and South, and between developed and emerging economies. This is no time for finger-pointing. The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction," Ant\'f3nio Guterres told journalists at the Sharm el-Sheikh International Conference Centre. The UN chief urged countries to deliver the kind of meaningful action that people, and the planet, so desperately need. "The world is watching and has a simple message: stand and deliver," he underscored. Mr. Guterres reminded world leaders that global emissions are at their highest levels in history, and climate impacts are decimating economies and societies. "The most effective way to rebuild trust is by finding an ambitious and credible agreement on loss and damage and financial support to developing countries. The time for talking on loss and damage finance is over. We need action," he stated, urging negotiators to deliver concrete solutions to resolve one of the thorniest issues on the table at this year's COP, or Conference of Parties, to the UN climate convention. The UN chief also asked negotiators to send a clear signal that the voices of those on the frontlines of the crisis are being heard, while the world burning and drowning before their eyes. "Reflect the urgency, scale and enormity of the challenge faced by developing countries. We cannot continue to deny climate justice to those who have contributed least to the climate crisis and are getting hurt the most," he explained. For the first time in the history of UN climate conferences, the issue of loss and damage has been included in the official agenda. The creation of a new financial facility to compensate for the losses suffered by vulnerable countries hit hardest by natural disasters, is a key demand by the negotiating bloc known as the Group of the 77, which represents nearly all developing countries. The Secretary-General also touched on another issue that has troubled climate activists in the past days: keeping up the ambition to curb global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. "The 1.5 target is not simply about keeping a goal alive - it's about keeping people alive. I see the will to keep to the 1.5 goal - but we must ensure that commitment is evident in the COP27 outcome," he said, adding that the current fossil fuel companies' expansion is "hijacking humanity" Once again, Mr. Guterres made the case for renewables, and a Climate Global Solidarity pact with developed countries taking the lead in reducing emissions. "A Pact with developed countries taking the lead in reducing emissions. And a Pact to mobilize - together with International Financial Institutions and the private sector - financial and technical support for emerging economies to accelerate their transition to renewable energy," he said. Mr. Guterres underscored that renewables are the "exit ramp from the climate hell highway", referring to one of the most powerful messages from his speech last week at the opening of COP27 . The UN Secretary-General also asked for the delivery of the $100 billion annually in climate finance promised at COP15 in Copenhagen. He asked the Parties to act in consensus to double their investments in adaptation and reform multilateral development banks and international financial institutions. "They must provide the support developing countries need to embark on a renewable energy and climate-resilient pathway", he highlighted. Finally, Mr. Guterres reminded negotiators that the "climate clock is ticking" and that they have a chance to make a difference, so they must act quickly. "We have agreed solutions in front of us - to respond to loss and damage, to close the emissions gap, and to deliver on finance", he concluded. \</doc>

NEW YORK, 26th October 2022 (WAM) - In less than two weeks, the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, and Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, called on governments to revisit their climate plans and make them stronger to close the gap between where emissions are heading and where science indicates they should be this decade. " COP27 Stiell urged national governments to show at the conference how they will put the Paris Agreement to work through legislation, policies and programs, as well as how they will cooperate and provide support for implementation. He also called for nations to make progress in four priority areas: mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, and finance. While plans submitted by most signatories of the Paris Agreement would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, they are still not ambitious enough to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, a new report by UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) warned on Wednesday. The current combined National Determined Contributions (NDCs)-meaning the countries' national efforts to tackle emissions and mitigate climate change-are leading our planet to at least 2.5 degrees warming, a level deemed catastrophic by scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In 2019, the IPCC indicated that to curb global warming, CO2 emissions needed to be cut by 43 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, but current climate plans show a 10.6 per cent increase instead. However, this is an improvement compared to last year's report, which showed a 13.7 per cent increase by 2030, and a continued raise of emissions after 2030. "The downward trend in emissions expected by 2030 shows that nations have made some progress this year," said Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change. "But the science is clear and so are our climate goals under the Paris Agreement. We are still nowhere near the scale and pace of emission reductions required to put us on track toward a 1.5 degrees Celsius world", he warned. Stiell underscored that national governments need to strengthen their climate action plans now and implement them in the next eight years. Last year, during the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, all countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their climate plans, however, only 24 out of 193 nations submitted updated plans to the UN. "...It's disappointing. Government decisions and actions must reflect the level of urgency, the gravity of the threats we are facing, and the shortness of the time we have remaining to avoid the devastating consequences of runaway climate change", highlighted the UN Climate Change chief. The good news is that most of the nations who submitted a new plan strengthened their commitments, demonstrating more ambition in addressing climate change, according to the agency, which deemed this fact as a "glimmer of hope". More positive trends were found in a second UN Climate Change assessment published on Wednesday looking at long-term net-zero strategies. 62 countries, accounting for 93 per cent of the world's GDP, 47 per cent of the global population, and around 69 per cent of total energy consumption, have these plans in place. "This is a strong signal that the world is starting to aim for net-zero emissions", the agency said. Nevertheless, experts note that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 10th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) and Majid Al Futtaim Retail, operator of Carrefour in the UAE, during the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), currently being held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The signing of the MoU was attended by Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment. Essa Al Hashmi, Assistant Undersecretary for the Sustainable Communities Sector and Acting Assistant Undersecretary for the Green Development and Climate Change Sector at MoCCAE, Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, EAD Secretary-General, and Bernardo Perloiro, Chief Operating Officer, GCC at Majid Al Futtaim Retail, signed the MoU. The purpose of the MoU is to enhance cooperation between the parties to further integrate sustainability in the public and private sectors, and it seeks to help conserve natural and environmental resources by encouraging the use of reusable products to address the challenge of excessive plastic waste. The three entities share a set of guiding principles in support of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative to achieve climate neutrality in the UAE. This includes encouraging the consumption of reusable products and alternatives with a low carbon footprint, as well as conducting studies into consumer incentives when it comes to purchasing reusable products. Through the MoU, the three organisations will enhance awareness and knowledge of the environmental impact of plastic pollution, most importantly single-use plastic bags. They will work closely to measure the impact of the initiative by monitoring the decrease in single-use plastic bag usage and the rate of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the switch to reusable alternatives. Al Hashmi said, "Approximately 7 billion of the 9.2 billion tonnes of plastics produced worldwide from 1950 to 2017 became plastic waste, ending up in landfills or dumped. Plastic pollution can alter habitats and natural processes, impairing the ability of ecosystems to adapt to climate change and directly affecting millions of people's livelihoods, food production capabilities and social well-being." He added, "The UAE is committed to combating plastic pollution on all fronts. At MOCCAE, we are working together with our partners to apply an all-inclusive, sustainable and circular approach that ensures effective interventions along the full lifecycle of plastics. Building on the outstanding work of EAD and Majid Al Futtaim Retail to date, the new MoU aligns with this direction, as well as with the objectives of the High Ambition Coalition (HAC) to End Plastic Pollution that the UAE joined in September 2022. The global initiative, launched in August 2022, aims to eliminate plastic pollution by 2040. We hope this example will encourage more entities to support our efforts and adopt multi-use solutions that help minimise waste and are kinder to the environment." Dr. Al Dhaheri said, "This MoU with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment and Majid Al Futtaim Retail will contribute greatly to the reduction of single-use plastics and a shift towards reusable alternatives that are innovative and sustainable. Carrefour, was one of the first leading retailers to sign a pledge with us for the ban on single-use plastic bags, effective from June 1st, and they are currently offering a wide variety of eco-friendly replacements, having already eliminated 90% single-use plastic bags." She added, "Our goal is keeping in mind the bigger picture of the UAE's vision of achieving climate neutrality through the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative that was announced last year prior to COP26. We are now here at COP27 signing this agreement in alignment with our wise leadership as we all strive to conserve the environment and reduce the amount of plastic waste harming human health, our habitats and biodiversity." Bernardo Perloiro, Chief Operating Officer - GCC Majid Al Futtaim Retail, said, "We are honoured to be representing retail at COP27 today through this partnership with EAD and MoCCAE. As part of the Majid Al Futtaim ecosystem, we set the standard for sustainable, responsible, self-sufficient business. Carrefour is at the forefront of adopting new solutions to protect the interests of our customers and the environment, having been the first retailer in the UAE to introduce reusable shopping bags back in 2007. Since then, we have pledged to eliminate single-use plastic across our operations by 2025 - driving positive change and promoting and rewarding green shopping habits." \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 10th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The National Center of Meteorology (NCM), today announced the targeted research areas for the Fifth Cycle research projects of the UAE Research Programme for Rain Enhancement Science (UAEREP), with a focus on two high-priority areas, which are enhancing cloud formation and rain enhancement. The programme is set to launch its Fifth Cycle on the sidelines of the 6th International Rain Enhancement Forum on 24th January, 2023, in Abu Dhabi. The announcement was made during a press conference held at the UAE pavilion at 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), currently underway in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. NCM is taking part in the leading global forum for discussions on climate change as part of the UAE's official delegation to the event to highlight its achievements in the field of meteorology and the study of extreme weather events in the context of climate change. The Center is also sharing its pioneering expertise in advancing rain enhancement science and technology. Identified by a team of prominent international experts and scientists in rain enhancement research and technologies, the targeted research areas aim to generate new knowledge and technologies that will have a significant impact on the field of rain enhancement, particularly for arid regions. The new targeted research areas include investigations of the physical chain of events leading to cloud and rainfall formation; evaluations of warm, cold and mixed-phase cloud physical processes and their interactions that lead to rainfall; multiscale modelling of relevant atmospheric processes connecting cloud microphysics and dynamics; nowcasting and forecasting of weather to support cloud seeding operations; innovative uses of Artificial Intelligence techniques, particularly novel machine learning approaches; and integration of new measurement and numerical tools to gain a clear, scientific understanding of the full chain of events and processes involved in cloud formation, among others. The Programme will particularly welcome research proposals that have a clear operational impact with measurable outcomes and robust Technical Readiness Level (TRL) in terms of technologies, models and outputs used. Research proposals with a TRL score of 6 and above will be given greater preference, allowing for their applications in countries suffering from a shortage of natural water resources. Dr. Abdulla Al Mandous, Director of NCM and President of the Regional Association II (Asia) of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), said,"In response to the growing challenges of climate change and water scarcity, the world needs to adopt a novel and science-based approach to find viable solutions to today's complex water resource problems. At NCM, we have made significant progress in addressing these issues over the past four cycles of the UAEREP as part of the UAE's commitment to supporting global efforts to enhance water security." "We are confident that the new areas of focus identified by the program's Fifth Cycle will significantly increase the program's capacity to deliver beneficial outcomes for communities at high risk of water stress through unlocking the enormous potential of the rain enhancement science and technology," Al Mandous added. Alya Al Mazroui, Director of the UAEREP, commented,"Since its inception, the program has made remarkable contributions to the development of new technologies in rain enhancement through undertaking cutting-edge research work and promoting collaborative efforts and knowledge transfers within the scientific community. Building on the success the program has made over its first four cycles, the areas focused by the Fifth Cycle will add new dimensions to our understanding of cloud formation, a topic that has gained increasing interest from the scientific community in the past cycle. Such efforts are aligned with UAEREP's endeavor to foster new research collaborations to explore promising new concepts in this important scientific domain, while consolidating the program's leadership in offering scientific solutions to bolster national and global water security." Launched in 2015 by H.H. Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidential Court, the UAE's pioneering rain enhancement research program supports innovative research and technology proposals to advance knowledge in the field of rain enhancement research, particularly in arid regions, through offering managed grant assistance to selected teams of researchers.

Young people have a lot of energy and potential to drive positive change. It comes down to the facilitation of those ideas that will make a difference Photo: Reuters R-U-F-U-R-F. This may seem like a bizarre code from The Da Vinci Code. But it's not. It is simply one of the many algorithms for solving a Rubik's cube puzzle. As a child, I always found this captivating puzzle an unsolvable one, no matter how much effort was spent trying to crack it Every choice that I made to solve the puzzle had to be contemplated and thought out. Which to be honest, was a bit intimidating for me. Until I noticed that if I had just looked at the bigger picture of the puzzle and tried to solve it slowly, following different algorithms that others have come up with, it would have been way easier. Finding my core values, identity and passion were no different than trying to solve this Rubik's cube. It needed a lot of exploration. Actually a lot. From going to beach clean-ups and trying different forms of art to participating in international conferences and competitions. This has helped me appreciate the worth of nature. A while earlier I was volunteering with my school for a cleaning campaign. When we reached the location I was amazed by the number of people who gathered with the same goals in mind. We were all there to make the world a better place. This connection I felt with the volunteers around me and the nature (which was a desert) sparked a feeling that I believe everyone should experience. I then made it my mission to raise awareness about the importance of being connected with nature and being a part of it. That is when I started to indulge in the field of environmental awareness and education. To be honest I was surprised by the number of dedicated people on this mission. It was a huge community. They had many ideas and points of action. Some would express themselves through marches and calls for action and others would host events. I have always known that the greatest truths come within us, which made me sure that as long as I am passionate about nature, people will get inspired and feel a connection to the earth. It always fascinates me that nature has such a huge impact on our lives. Personally, the serenity that surrounds me when sitting alone with natural surroundings is unmatched by any other place and it is always the best getaway I can find from our loud cities. My aspirations for COP27 and COP28 are that youth should be empowered from all countries around the world and our ideas are implemented on the ground. Young people have a lot of energy and potential to drive positive change. It comes down to the facilitation of those ideas that will make a difference. I believe that raising awareness is the key to creating the most impact. Thus, it is very important that we continue inspiring youth in our community and around the world. L-U-L-U. Ta-da! Now, I have a solved Rubik's cube puzzle sitting right in front of me. With this I also have one piece of my personality solved. Environmental activism has awarded me with diverse life experiences and long-lasting friendships. So I encourage everyone to take a step forward and inspire their own community as collective impact is the key to combating this crisis and driving positive change. - The writer is a UAE nature ambassador and a student at NYUAD. \</doc>

Masdar will make acquisitions and sell bonds as part of a plan to more than double its operations this decade and help the country achieve a net-zero target. Masdar is interested in acquisitions of power firms in the US and Europe, CEO Mohamed al Ramahi said in an interview at the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. "Our ambition is big," the CEO said. "We will consider all possibilities when it comes to financial strategy. Green bonds, specifically, are something we might consider." Masdar ambitions Abu Dhabi's Masdar is leading a consortium that will build a 10-gigawatt wind plant in Egypt. Al Ramahi said the $11bn project will start to produce power in around five years. It will be up to the Egyptian government to decide if the electricity is exported or only used locally, he said. The company is a key part of the UAE's goal to neutralise planet-warming emissions within its borders by 2050. OPEC's third-biggest oil producer wants to boost solar, hydrogen and nuclear-generated energy to achieve that aim. Masdar can today produce 20 gigawatts of clean power and wants to increase its capacity to 100 gigawatts in five years, Al Ramahi said. That's roughly double the target of BP Plc. Masdar is owned by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., wealth fund Mubadala and Taqa, the emirate's main utility. It recently bought UK-based Arlington Energy, a developer of battery-energy storage. It also signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this year to buy a stake in a BP-led project to make green, or carbon-free, hydrogen in Teeside in the north of England. "This is a very strategic, innovative project not only for us as partners and developers of this, but also for the UK," al Ramahi said. "We are hopeful that things will be concluded soon."

New renewable-energy projects will enable Egypt to accelerate plans to become a major supplier of power and hydrogen to Europe, according to the country's petroleum minister. Egypt wants to send electricity to Cyprus and Greece through a cable that will run under the Mediterranean. It also aims to export hydrogen, which can be used as a fuel for power stations. "There's a lot of advancement for this connectivity," Tarek el-Molla said in an interview at the COP27 climate summit at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. $11bn wind farm in Egypt Discussions about the cable are progressing and Egypt could be ready to send power to Europe in five years, he said. It's still unclear who will fund the cable. Abu Dhabi-based renewables firm Masdar is leading a consortium building an $11 billion wind farm in Egypt. It's designed to eventually produce 10 gigawatts of power, roughly one-fifth of what the UK has today. "The momentum that we got from having hosted COP 27 will help us to boom and speed up projects for emissions reduction," el-Molla said. The two-week summit is scheduled to end on Friday. The country aims to be a hub for LNG shipments in the Mediterranean. It is seeking to increase Israeli supplies of the super-chilled gas to its terminals, he said.

By Binsal Abdulkader ABU DHABI, 9th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The cooperation between the European Union (E.U.) and the Arabian Gulf countries in energy and security domains is very crucial as supplies from the Gulf have changed the Europe&rsquo;s energy landscape, the E.U. foreign policy chief told the Emirates News Agency (WAM), adding that &ldquo;your [Gulf&rsquo;s] security is our security.&rdquo; Josep Borrell, the E.U. High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, pointed out that before the Ukrainian crisis, the E.U. was importing 40 percent of its energy supplies from Russia, which was reduced to eight percent later. While looking for other suppliers, the Gulf, especially the UAE, offered the energy supplies, which has been very helpful, said the top diplomat who was on an official visit to the UAE. In an exclusive interview with WAM in Abu Dhabi, Borrell emphasised that an important part of energy supplies to the E.U. has come from this part of the world, including the UAE. &ldquo;This has changed the energy landscape of Europe.&rdquo; &ldquo;Energy partnership makes more sense than ever&rdquo; Since the current energy supply scenario may continue for years, he noted, &ldquo;We need to reduce our consumption of gas. We need other suppliers, and we need to continue fighting against climate change at the moment.&rdquo; He added that Europe is in a critical moment from an energy point of view. As COP 27 , the UN conference on climate change , is taking place in Egypt and the UAE is hosting the COP 28 next year, &ldquo;I think our energy partnership makes more sense than ever. You are supplier, we are consumer, but hydrocarbon will not be the energy forever. We need to look for new sources. You have sun. You are investing a lot on new renewables. It is also an important partnership,&rdquo; the top EU diplomat explained. The Ukrainian crisis has been a big push for the E.U. to understand the requirement of more renewables, especially the need to develop hydrogen, Borrell revealed. &ldquo;We need to look for partners to develop hydrogen, because here you have surface and sun to produce green electricity and green hydrogen,&rdquo; he pointed out, adding that the current energy crisis has accelerated the green transition in the E.U. Gulf&rsquo;s security is E.U. security The E.U. has a new strategy for more engagement and better partnership with the Gulf countries, the foreign policy chief said. &ldquo;They [GCC] have always been very important for us. Not only because they are supplying energy, but the Gulf is becoming a strategic part of the world in the middle of the way between Europe, and South and East Asia.&rdquo; As the region is facing a lot of security challenges, &ldquo;your security is also our security. We want to be a better partner. We have to engage more in order to face the big challenges,&rdquo; Borrell said referring to the issues such as climate change, migration, security and the new energy landscape that brings both parties closer. The war in Yemen, instability in Iraq and Syria, and negotiations on Iran nuclear deal are important developments in the wider Middle East, the foreign policy chief explained. &ldquo;The whole region is a mosaic of security issues. We want to work together with you to solve some of these problems. The peace between Israel and Palestine needs a strong engagement with the Arab world and the Europeans together,&rdquo; said Borrell, a Spanish politician who took charge as the E.U. foreign policy chief in 2019. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 11th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Mercedes Vela Monserrate, Head of Sustainable Finance at Abu Dhabi Global Market, has said that ADGM's participation in COP27 is part of this International Financial Centre leading role in supporting and promoting sustainability, and further underpinning its commitment to sustainable finance. In an exclusive interview with the Emirates News Agency (WAM), Monserrate said, "This is a key focus area for ADGM, as a financial centre that supports capital formation, raising and deployment as well as the creation and issuance of products to achieve positive economic, social and environmental objectives." Speaking about climate action efforts and the achievement of climate neutrality goals in the UAE, Monserrate said, "The UAE's Net Zero Strategic Initiative will resonate widely by encouraging neighbouring countries to follow the same path, and by drawing attention to the UAE's innovative approach to tackling climate challenges. "As a hydrocarbon producing country, the UAE has an important role to play in the energy transition. Leaders in the MENA region should also work together to create ambitious regional targets. The UAE is a proven convener on the issue of climate and will build on this tradition to continue to push for bold climate action, including through COP28." Highlighting ADGM's efforts to develop a sustainable global finance hub from Abu Dhabi, she stated, "We are closely aligned to UAE initiatives, supporting Abu Dhabi, the UAE and global stakeholders in achieving Sustainable Development Goals and climate change objectives of the Paris Agreement. "With an internationally recognised regulatory regime, direct application of common law and proximity to some of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors and private wealth, ADGM is ideally placed to develop a sustainable finance ecosystem catering to the needs of local and international investors ADGM is at the forefront of the sustainable finance industry and remains committed to collaborating with its partners to promote the integration of ESG considerations and sustainable finance into all that it does." She noted that ADGM's Sustainable Finance Agenda includes a roadmap for the integration of sustainability into ADGM's regulatory framework, building on existing UAE initiatives and global best practices. About the UAE's preparations to host COP28 next year, Monserrate said, "The UAE is built on a track record of practical climate action that is delivering social and economic benefit. We intend to use this experience for the benefit of COP28. Having invested over $17 billion in clean energy projects in six continents around the world, and as home to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UAE approach is built on bringing practical climate solutions to the international community. "The UAE is also the home to three of the largest and lowest cost solar plants in the world, the first country in the region to deploy industrial scale carbon capture technology, the first to deploy zero emission nuclear energy and a pioneer in new zero carbon energies such as hydrogen. The UAE's Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative and COP29 are the natural next step in this growth trajectory that directly aligns with the UAE's development vision for the next 50 years to create new knowledge, new industries, new skills and new jobs." To build a local carbon-free economy, she said that ADGM in 2022 teamed up with AirCarbon Exchange, a central marketplace for carbon credits, to create the world's first fully-regulated voluntary carbon market, and become the first jurisdiction in the world to regulate carbon credits and offsets as emission instruments. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 25th October, 2022 (WAM) - As part of the UAE delegation to COP27 in Egypt, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) will unveil new initiatives that enhance the country's efforts to protect the planet and face the challenge of climate change, including carbon reduction in all sectors, enhancing the participation of the private sector, expanding reliance on nature-based solutions internationally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and developing and expanding the climate research and development system. Issa Al Hashemi, Assistant Undersecretary for the Sustainable Communities Sector at the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment said that the 'National Dialogue on Climate Ambition' is one of the most important experiences that will be presented in cooperation with international organisations as an effective model for strengthening the partnership of the whole society in climate action, through which the Ministry aimed to support the country's future directions in reducing carbon and greenhouse gas emissions with an integrated sectorial partnership. In May 2022, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment launched the 'National Dialogue on Climate Ambition' initiative, which aims to enhance the private sector's participation in climate action and reach the highest rates of carbon reduction and removal. The initiative includes holding monthly meetings to discuss the needs and priorities of each sector separately as well as future directions to achieve net zero, with the participation of decision makers and stakeholders, and led by concerned government agencies, to ensure participatory design. Al Hashemi said that the Ministry's strategy focuses on enhance the participation of all national sectors in reducing greenhouse gas emissions rates, especially carbon dioxide, and raising the climate action ambition of these sectors, pointing out that manufacturing, energy, transportation, cement industries and finance are leading the sectors with which cooperation and coordination are implemented to increase their participation and efforts in confronting the challenge of climate change. He pointed out that as part of its work system, which includes approving a flexible legislative structure and launching specialised initiatives and programmes to promote climate action, the Ministry has launched the 'National Dialogue on Climate Ambition' series, which aim to hold direct meetings with representatives of relevant government and private organisations in various sectors to assess their position, exchange knowledge about requirements of raising ambition and enhancing participation in climate action efforts to ensure sustainable economic development. He continued: "The initiative also aims to define the sustainability and climate action expectations for each sector, the innovative technologies and solutions for accelerating work in each sector, and the main actors in each sector, especially private organisations." He explained that under the initiative a monthly meeting will be held to discuss the needs and priorities of each sector separately as well as future directions to achieve net zero, with the participation of decision makers and stakeholders, and led by concerned government agencies, to ensure participatory design. In October, the Ministry held the dialogue's fifth meeting with the aim of enhancing the participation of insurance sector organisations in climate action efforts. The meeting highlighted best practices and national efforts to enhance resilience to climate change by developing a wide range of insurance services and solutions that contribute to addressing these global risks. The dialogue estimated major risks associated with climate change in the country with the aim of developing solutions for priority sectors affected by climate change, such as agriculture, transport and construction. These risks will be evaluated by a national team that includes the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), in order to strengthen the national climate change adaptation plan. As part of the National Dialogue on Climate Ambition initiative, the Ministry had launched the 'Climate Responsible Companies Pledge', in which the signatory organisations are committed to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions in a transparent manner, drafting ambitious plans to reduce their carbon footprint, and sharing these plans with the relevant government agencies to achieve the highest levels of carbon reduction. The signatories also pledged to manage climate change mitigation and adaptation as core values and principles in their business and operational models, as well as adopt an all-inclusive approach that engages the youth, women and vulnerable segments of society in drafting their net-zero plans. At the end of last July, the third National Dialogue on Climate Ambition meeting targeted the financial sector and focused on the global, regional and local need for innovative financing programs that serve the goals of achieving net zero. Last May, the Ministry invited more than 50 entities from the government and private sectors and advanced technology companies operating in the waste, cement, energy and advanced technology sectors, to participate in the first meeting of the dialogue. The discussions came to the conclusion that the ability to reduce carbon depends on 4 proposed solutions or initiatives, including an initiative to reduce reliance on limestone in cement production and to use environment friendly alternatives, such as calcite, an initiative to enable the use of renewable energy in factories, and an initiative to use alternative fuels RDF and energy recovery systems, in addition to an initiative to promote the deployment of carbon capture, storage and reuse technologies. \</doc>

NEW YORK, 20th September, 2022 (WAM) -- The UAE announced today the establishment of the UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators (UICCA) during New York Climate Week. The UICCA is a non-partisan, climate action entity that will bring together members of the public and private sector, including academic institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to drive the UAE's commitment towards net zero by 2050. In the lead-up to the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28), which is set to take place in Dubai, the UICCA will establish an independent body that enables collaboration, cooperation and innovation. The UICCA, which will be led by Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, CEO and Founder of Alliances for Global Sustainability and Co-founder of Aurora50, is set to become the first of its kind entity on a global scale. Under Sheikha Shamma's direction and with the support of industry leaders and subject matter experts, the UICCA will operate as a think tank and predominantly focus on providing advice and recommendations to stakeholders on positive climate action that facilitates the transition to a green economy. This transition will contribute to boosting GDP growth, increasing job creation, and reinforcing the UAE's position as a global Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) hub and first-mover on climate action. Sheikha Shamma, Executive Director of UICCA, said, "It is an honour to be tasked, by the leadership of the UAE, with building and driving the UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators. Our goals as a nation are clear, and we have made significant headway towards implementing the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative \- however, this is only our first milestone; it's the synergies we create today that will allow us to live a more sustainable future, far beyond 2050. The only way for us to do this is by enabling and energising an ecosystem that actively participates in realising one shared vision, and the UICCA is the nucleus that will bring this ecosystem to life." In addition to acting as a catalyst for a knowledge-based green economy and attracting global talent to the UAE's sustainability sector, the accelerators will facilitate international business, innovation and technology partnerships that work towards the common goal of tackling climate change. The main sectors of focus will include electric mobility, sustainable fuels, energy efficiency, green buildings, smart cities, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, and a growing AgTech and Climate Tech segment. \</doc>

According to the latest assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) "most countries in the Middle East and North Africa region including Egypt are highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change". In March 2015, Egypt launched its strategy for sustainable development, "Egypt's Vision 2030" one of the long-term sustainability plans which spans over the three dimensions of sustainable development, namely; economic, social and environmental (ESG) dimensions, and outlines the broader principles, which will guide Egypt in pursuing its developmental goals. In addition, National Climate Change Strategy 2050" focuses on lowering carbon emissions, increasing reliance on clean energy and enhancing scientific research. In alignment with Egypt's ambition and SDG's goals, Egypt is also coordinating global action on climate adaptation, mitigation, and finance hosting COP27 in November 2022 in Sharm El-Sheikh as a representative of Africa to "advance African priorities and reach concrete actions on global climate change and clean energy transition". The Global Goal on Adaptation was one of the significant outcomes of COP26. COP27 makes the crucially needed progress, enhance global agenda for action on adaptation and urge all parties to demonstrate the necessary political will towards enhancing resilience and assist the most vulnerable communities. The upcoming Cop 27 's main goals and mission is to accelerate global climate action through emissions reduction, scaled-up adaptation efforts and enhanced flows of appropriate finance. Cop 27 will build upon the previous success of the African Continent Priorities, mainly the African "Race to net-zero, race to resilience" In the move towards a green and inclusive future, the government of Egypt continuously affirms the country's commitment to promote both private sector engagement and climate agenda. This was evident in President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi's opening speech at the beginning of COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021 as he affirmed the urgency of addressing climate change challenges and the significant role that the private sector can play in this arena. The consequence of climate inaction are becoming a real threat to economic growth. Solutions require public and private collaboration in financing and implementation. Businesses, banks, and investors play a crucial role in the process of climate resilience. This vision has been translated in multiple sectors through the 2015 Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy (ISES), which aims to produce 20% of Egypt's power from renewable resources by 2022, and 42% by 2035. Today, around "20% of Egypt's energy production comes from wind and solar energy, as well as hydropower and 54% for sustainable water supplies and wastewater management" according to the UNDP. In Addition, the country pushed forward the development of sustainable and green transportation networks through the development of the monorail and the upgrading and expanding of the metro lines; connecting people through inclusive transportation while reducing carbon emissions. Egypt also issued 5-year sovereign green bonds worth $750m, which are dedicated to funding green projects. In 2021, the Ministry of International Cooperation announced that the International Finance Corporation (IFC) "will invest $100m in Egypt's first private sector green bond issuance". However, to enhance the private sector engagement, particularly in moving towards a net zero emissions, the government is committed to adopting regulatory reforms. For example, since the issuance of the Renewable Energy Law, the private sector has been encouraged to play a role in the country's green transformation strategy and produce electricity from renewa strategy and produce electricity from renewable resources through several partnerships. KarmSolar was the first private solar integrator in Egypt to obtain a license from the Egyptian Electricity Regulatory Agency. This helped Egypt become one of the leading countries in renewable energy in the MENA region, according to the 2020 Solar Outlook Report. Moreover, a new law was issued to allow the National Authority for Tunnels (NAT) to enter into public-private partnerships (PPP) projects to manage and operate electric railways. Also, in terms of climate action, the Ministry secured $1.4bn in electricity, renewable energy, and petroleum sectors, and $230m for the environment sector last year, reflected through projects in clean and sustainable transport, and sustainable infrastructure. The government is now collaborating with the private sector to design, build, operate and finance 19 water desalination plants between 2020 and 2025. In addition, the Ministry of International Cooperation secured a total of $4.76bn in finance for the private sector; $3.19bn in 2020 and $1.57bn in 2021. Within the Ministry's current portfolio, there are 28 adaptation projects worth $2.85bn in development financing. These projects are deploying environmentally friendly principles and practices in several sectors; the most prominent of which being the environment, water, agriculture, and irrigation sectors, by enhancing climate-smart agricultural practices and investing in water desalination and wastewater management projects in addition to energy and transport, such as solar power stations and wind farms, as well as renovating and constructing new metro lines and electric trains to establish a sustainable transport system. The transition toward a low carbon climate-resilient economy will require effective actions to support an increased role of the private sector which enhance the intervention of lawyers as guiders in this new transition. While companies and financial institutions have been making positive steps towards their net zero promises to change the way they do business, the legal profession has been quietly making its own transition For further information, please contactKhaled Attia. Published in September 2022 Law firms have to adapt with the future sustainable goals by taking a proactive approach to mitigate the climate crisis and provide competent advice to clients explaining how they can achieve their objectives while minimizing the effects of climate change and promotes adaptation. A global response to the climate crisis will undoubtedly give rise to increased disputes, with lawyers representing the legal interests and rights of all sides. Parties to these disputes will include states, corporations, communities, civil society organisations and individuals who are the most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. In this regard, law firms can prepare themselves to the new changes, both internally and in their relationship with clients by: Introducing practical measures to reduce the environmental impact on their business; Developing well-supported career paths for lawyers who wish to transition into distinct disciplines relating to climate change; Developing a strong understanding for lawyers by doing seminars to have a good understanding of what net zero means as it begins to steer business planning, governance, and policy; Reduce Waste and move towards paperless and clean desk policy; Optimize Employees' Transportation by adopting a work-from-home policy and virtual meetings policy as much as possible. Raising awareness among Employees, Clients and other Stakeholders. Engaging with current and future legislative and policymaking efforts to mitigate the climate crisis and protect the human rights of those most affected by it.Egypt has shown a great initiative to the environmental cause, by hosting the COP27 and leading Africa towards net zero emissions while advocating climate justice and resilience, not to mention the progress in this area embodied by the massive green projects in different sectors and collaboration with the private sector and financial institutions. This transition is supported by the legal practitioners through their effective and proactive approach in this revolutionary transition \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 1st August, 2022 (WAM) -- Haitham Al Ghais, Secretary-General of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), affirmed that the UAE has a major, important and pivotal role in securing oil supplies around the world, as it is one of the world's largest oil producers, and in light of future directions to raise energy productivity. In his statement to the Emirates News Agency (WAM) coinciding with his taking of office as the OPEC Secretary-General, Al Ghais extended his sincere thanks and gratitude to President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for the UAE's support of his candidacy. He also expressed his appreciation to Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, and other proponents who helped garner the support of all OPEC member states, leading to his election last January. Al Ghais said, "Today, we open a new page of cooperation, driving OPEC's rise to higher levels in the face of future roadblocks, in order to meet the various challenges in the energy arena in general, and the oil markets in particular, where many challenges, whether geopolitical, or COVID-19-related, are still affecting some regions of the world," noting that an action plan will be developed in consultation with the OPEC member states and technical committees, in line with OPEC's long-term strategy. He explained that December 2022 will mark six years since the conclusion of the OPEC+ agreement, of which the UAE is a pivotal part, through its support and firm stance, adding that the UAE plays a leading role in backing the agreement by laying sound foundations and expanding its cooperation, which supports the interests of the market, consumers and oil-producing countries. The new OPEC Secretary-General said that the UAE will host the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28) next year, a platform that will enable OPEC member states to voice their opinions of oil-producing countries on energy transition, to ensure a balanced and fair transition inclusive of all stakeholders around the world, as well as avoid disrupting global economic activity and developmental efforts, and support optimal energy utilisation. \</doc>

The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment will present a comprehensive plan at the annual summit, which will be held at Sharm el-Sheikh between November 6 and 18 Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri. Photo: WAM The UAE's journey in climate action began three decades ago, when it joined the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and will reach new heights next year when the nation hosts the 28th Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP28). The event will include the first global stocktaking of the countries' progress in implementing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement that was signed in November 2016. Over these more than 30 years, thanks to the vision and directives of its wise leadership, the UAE achieved three milestones that testify to its voluntary commitment to protecting the planet and raising its climate ambition to ensure a better, more sustainable future. The UAE submitted its first NDC to the UNFCCC Secretariat in 2016 after signing the Paris Agreement as the first country in the region. In its second NDC in 2020, the UAE pledged to boost the share of clean energy in the domestic energy mix, increased its emission reduction target and set a goal to plant mangroves with the aim of offsetting emissions. In September 2022, the country voluntarily updated its second NDC to raise the emission reduction targets in the energy and industry sectors, upgrade its waste management approach by reducing and treating waste and transforming it into a clean source of energy, and scale up nature-based carbon sequestration solutions. The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) is finalising the third NDC, which will be submitted early next year. As part of the UAE delegation to COP27 , which will be held between November 6 and 18 at at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, the MOCCAE will present its leading model of climate action that involves plans, strategies, projects, initiatives, programmes and guidelines aimed at advancing research and development (R&D), leveraging innovative solutions and modern technologies to accelerate the clean energy transition, shifting to a green economy and driving sustainable development. The first NDC The UAE's first NDC included reaching a 24 per cent clean energy share in the domestic energy mix by 2021, increasing reliance on modern technologies that enhance energy efficiency and reduce resulting emissions, and decarbonising key sectors. The UAE also committed to cutting down on electricity and water consumption in buildings by adopting green building standards, expanding the district cooling system, and shifting to energy-saving lighting. In addition, it pledged to develop an environment-friendly public transport system, initiate a wide-scale conversion of conventional motor vehicles to compressed natural gas (CNG) with a focus on taxis, buses, government vehicles and commercial vehicles, adopt sustainable waste management methods and enhance efforts to conserve blue carbon ecosystems that play a key role in CO2 sequestration. The second NDC The UAE's second NDC included stepping up emission reduction, boosting reliance on clean energy, expanding carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) and blue carbon projects, and adopting sustainable agricultural and waste management systems through integrated climate change mitigation and adaptation plans. The country increased its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target to 23.5 per cent compared to business as usual for the year 2030, which translated into an absolute emission reduction of about 70 million tonnes. This goal reaffirmed the UAE's commitment to the Paris Agreement as the best option for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Many national initiatives and projects supported the NDC by deploying the latest green technologies, increasing the use of renewable energy solutions and planting thousands of trees. Climate change mitigation In terms of climate change mitigation, the UAE committed to increasing its clean energy capacity to 14 gigawatt (GW) by 2030, compared to only 100 megawatt (MW) in 2015 and 2.4 GW in 2020. To date, total investments in domestic clean energy projects have amounted to $40 (Dh146.92) billion. The country pledged to continue to reduce emissions across key economic sectors (energy, transport, industry, services, agriculture and waste). In this context, it has established the region's first commercial-scale CCUS network, advancing the deployment of a technology critical for carbon abatement and climate change mitigation. Climate change adaptation To enhance its climate change adaptation capabilities, the UAE committed to expanding its blue carbon ecosystems by planting 30 million mangrove seedlings by 2030. The country also pledged to adopt climate-smart agricultural methods, step up food waste reduction efforts, and promote sustainable production and consumption patterns. Updated second NDC The updated version of the UAE's second NDC increased its emission reduction target to 31 per cent compared to the business-as-usual scenario for the year 2030 that forecasted 301 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The new target represents a decrease of 93.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The update responds to the call of the Glasgow Climate Pact, one of the most important outcomes of COP26, for countries to raise their climate ambition by end-2022 to enhance their capabilities to fight climate change. The NDC is supported by previously announced climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, which include conserving blue carbon ecosystems with an increased target of planting 100 million mangrove seedlings by 2030. Enhancing private sector participation To boost the contribution of the private sector to achieving the targets of the updated second NDC, the MOCCAE launched the National Dialogue for Climate Ambition (NDCA). The series of industry-specific assemblies provides a national platform for raising climate ambitions and supporting emission reduction in key sectors, such as industry, cement, waste, transportation and energy. It also seeks to develop a national sustainability outlook and support the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative. In addition, the ministry introduced the Climate-Responsible Companies Pledge to enhance the participation of private sector entities in the country's emission reduction efforts. The signatories commit to measuring and reporting their GHG emissions in a transparent manner, drafting ambitious plans to reduce their carbon footprints, and sharing these plans with the relevant government agencies to fast-track the country's journey to net zero. The enablers The NDCs identified the main enablers of climate action and strengthening climate change resilience of all sectors. These include shifting to a green economy, adopting circular economy principles and promoting the use of the latest technologies to ensure sustainability. The UAE welcomes international cooperation in the deployment and financing of clean energy solutions locally and globally. The nation has invested around $16.8 (Dh61.71) billion in renewables projects across 70 countries, and provided more than $400 (Dh1,469.20) million in aid and soft loans for clean energy ventures around the world.

Many determined to fight temptation to suspend climate goals AFP As Europe faces potential energy scarcity and soaring prices amid a scorching hot summer, the pressure to suspend climate goals could become enormous. Some countries are quietly talking about firing back up their coal plants while others are desperately trying to stockpile enough gas for the coming winter, regardless of the source or other concerns. But many are determined to fight the temptation to suspend climate goals, as demonstrated by the just-concluded Connecting Europe Days summit in Lyon, France, where all sorts of sustainable transport were celebrated, studied and used, even electric cars that travelled 2,500 km to prove they have the range and Europe has the recharging infrastructure. Despite the current pressure, Europe needs to accelerate, not suspend, efforts to reach net zero. That was also the message delivered on the sidelines of the recent G7 conference in southern Germany, where new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz seemed to feel the heat most. Alex Scott, a programme leader at climate change think-tank E3G, said the G-7 demonstrated global collaboration to tackle the climate crisis, but some heads of state are forgetting to demonstrate that at home. COP27 ", the next United Nations Climate Change Conference , which was delayed from 2021 due to the pandemic. Scott's colleague Johannes Schroeten, a policy advisor at E3G, says that "Chancellor Scholz's attempt to carve out large exemptions from the COP26 statement on international public support has been averted - but only just. The G-7 has just wasted this golden opportunity to accelerate the end of international fossil fuel public finance." One of the big concerns for climate change activists is continued investment in fossil fuel infrastructure as nations seek additional gas supplies. Germany, for example, does not have even a single terminal to accommodate liquefied natural gas shipments. Climate activists are worried that once an ad-hoc investment in infrastructure is made it could continue to run to justify the initial effort and expenditure. "We're getting signals that some are rowing back" on their green energy transition commitment, Scott from E3G told the press. 'It was a big triumph getting Japan to sign up to ending investment in overseas fossil fuels. We're worried Germany could now water down the language because of the urgency they feel in replacing short-term gas supplies." Another question is how many European nations are quietly planning to bring back decommissioned coal plants. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned against suspending climate initiatives in just that scenario. "We have to make sure that we use this crisis to move forward and not to have a backsliding on dirty fossil fuels," she said. Reports say fossil fuel companies are capitalizing on energy security anxieties to lobby hard for long-term infrastructure investments. "That's the battle we're in right now," said Jennifer Morgan, ambassador at large for climate change in the German Foreign Ministry and a former president of Greenpeace International. "We're in a moment of massive disruption due to the invasion, and that's either a big risk or it's a big opening on the climate." Some published reports contend Germany, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands will all resurrect old coal plants, but not nuclear facilities. Germany is still planning to shut down its last two nuclear plants later this year. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck termed the squeeze in gas supplies an "attack on us". Europe's biggest economy responded by putting its energy sector on the second-highest level of alert, one step away from rationing. Germany said it still plans to entirely stop coal use by 2030, but environmental groups are skeptical. Returning to coal "is a bad choice", said Neil Makaroff, of Climate Action Network, an umbrella organization for such groups. "Countries are continuing to back fossil energy rather than investing enough in renewables," he said. "The risk is substituting one dependency for another - importing Colombian or Australian coal, US or Qatari liquefied natural gas to replace Russian hydrocarbons." As industrialized nations try to swear off their addiction to hydrocarbons, the familiar fuel is so alluring and institutionalized that even the best intentions can succumb to temptation. A novel initiative launched by a group of young climate change victims seeks to blunt one of the pressure points. Last week they began legal action in Europe's top human rights court against an energy treaty that they say protects fossil fuel investors. The five plaintiffs aged between 17 and 31 - who have experienced devastating floods, forest fires and hurricanes - are bringing the case to argue their governments' membership in an energy treaty that enables fossil fuel companies to sue governments for lost profits is a barrier to climate change initiatives. It's just one in a range of actions underway as Europe swelters in unseasonably hot weather. As if to underscore the reality of climate change, a bizarre accident triggered by a melting glacier in the Dolomites of Italy claimed the lives of at least six last weekend, with as many as 15 still missing. Rescue crews, scientists and meteorologists all said abnormally hot weather is to blame for the tragic incident that saw an outcrop give way and send an avalanche of rock, ice, snow and debris surging onto climbers.

ABU DHABI, 6th November, 2022 (WAM) - For Egypt and the UAE, as hosts of COP27 and COP28 UAE respectively, the renewed urgency in how the two nations approach climate change has reaffirmed their resounding commitment to encourage closer cooperation and generate greater climate progress. As part of concerted efforts to work together and strengthen global climate action, the UAE will host one of the most diverse national delegations at COP27 , representing more than 70 public and private entities. Aligned with the COP27 theme of &lsquo;Together for Implementation', the UAE delegation will highlight the nation's deep commitment to inclusivity and ambition, by including our senior leadership, government representatives and policymakers, negotiators, business leaders as well as representatives of women and youth groups. The UAE is committed to working closely with the Egyptian COP Presidency to help mobilise international support, while drawing global attention to the developing world, particularly African nations. With climate change impacting all countries coupled with the urgent need to do more, the UAE believes access to clean technologies and climate solutions is critical. Accordingly, we must deploy them at a global scale. At COP27 To enable this transformation requires substantial investment in net-zero infrastructure. With the world needing an estimated $275 trillion over the next 30 years to reach Net Zero by 2050, countries must collectively work together with the public and private sector to explore innovative financing mechanisms that will scale up finance and support the global energy transition. The UAE is also focusing on progress toward a Global Goal on Adaptation, which must be brought to the foreground of the negotiations at COP27 and COP28 to end the old tug of war between accelerating the reduction of emissions or building global climate resilience. The UAE has been clear that the global mission must be to do both. As the UAE engages with countries to scale international assistance, especially to the most vulnerable communities, it will build on the momentum of COP27 for COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference in 2023, by aligning global climate ambition with global climate action. At COP28, ambition and inclusivity will be core components of catalysing collective action with practical solutions to climate change, while contributing to global, sustainable economic and social development. In this regard, the UAE updated its second NDC last month. This aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 31 percenty in 2030, up from the previous commitment of a 23.5% reduction. With the renewed urgency to combat climate change, fresh pressure is being placed on all countries to work closer together. Regionally, the UAE and Egypt are maximising their efforts to mitigate and adapt to the risks of climate change and leverage sustainable economic growth. Collective action is needed to scale up assistance to the whole of the international community. No region should be left behind in the transition. \</doc>

60% of UAE CEOs expect earnings to increase 2.5 to 4.5% annually over the next three years The UAE has one of the most diversified economies in the region, which has enabled it to withstand a number of challenges, right from the global pandemic to geopolitical uncertainly and macro-economic challenges, according to KPMG. - File photo UAE CEOs remain optimistic about their business prospects than their global counterparts, with 60 per cent of them expecting earnings to increase 2.5 to 4.5 per cent annually over the next three years, which is more than twice the number of CEOs worldwide. The findings are part of the latest findings of the KPMG 2022 CEO Outlook Survey, which polled 1,325 CEOs from 43 countries, including 25 from the UAE. UAE CEOs are better placed than their global counterparts to respond to an economic crisis, with 68 per cent of local leaders diversifying their business compared to a mere 32 per cent of global CEOs, putting them ahead of their global counterparts by at least six months. Nader Haffar, Chairman and CEO of KPMG Lower Gulf, said: "The UAE has one of the most diversified economies in the region, which has enabled it to withstand a number of challenges, right from the global pandemic to geopolitical uncertainly and macro-economic challenges. The government's comprehensive diversification program for a knowledge-driven economy backed by technology and sustainable development has pivoted the nation forward. This year's edition of the CEO Outlook survey shows that the UAE is set for unprecedented growth, powered by a hybrid workforce and enhanced digital capabilities as a result of improved IT infrastructure, a focus on cybersecurity and diversified supply chains." Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) also emerged a key priority, with more than two-thirds of global and UAE CEOs expressing significant demand from stakeholders to increase reporting and transparency in the future. This follows the UAE's heavy investments in the green economy for the last 10 years and its announcement to commit to net-zero emissions by 2050, the first Gulf country to do so. In 2023, the UAE will also host COP28, the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference . This sentiment comes as a vast majority of CEOs worldwide are expecting a recession in the next 12 months, with 86 per cent saying they agree an economic downturn is coming. In the UAE, the situation is quite different, with only 24 per cent of CEOs expecting a recession. However, local CEOs were less confident about growth prospects for the global economy, with only 56 per cent expressing confidence in global growth over the next three years, compared to 71 per cent of CEOs worldwide. Robust national policies, including Vision 2021 and Vision 2030, which set out to transform the country into a competitive knowledge-driven economy, have put the country on an accelerated path to growth. The UAE posted its strongest growth in more than a decade, driven by a sharp increase in oil production and a noticeable improvement in non-oil GDP. According to the UAE Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the UAE economy grew by 8.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2022, with total annual growth projected to exceed 5 per cent and inflation expected to remain well below the global average. The survey also revealed that a vast majority (96 per cent ) of UAE CEOs reported having an aggressive digital strategy in place, which was much higher than the global figure of 72 per cent . Furthermore, given the rising threat of cyber-attacks, 92 per cent of UAE respondents said their organizations were well-prepared for a cyberattack, compared to 56 per cent of global CEOs. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt, 6th November 6, 2022 (WAM) - Ambassador Majid Al Suwaidi, Director General of COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference today reiterated the UAE's support for Egypt's focus on implementation, including adaptation, at 27th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh. He made his remarks at the Opening Plenary of the COP27 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Ambassador Majid commended Egypt and the General Secretariat of the UNFCCC for bringing the world together and advancing real progress in climate change. He said: "This is the time to get investment decisions made, innovations deployed, finance released, spades in the ground and cranes in the air. This is the time for action." He emphasised the economic benefits of climate action, noting that the world has the opportunity to "unleash global economic growth". Ambassador Majid said: "By turning ourselves into global leaders in clean energy, we have been able to create new jobs, new skills and new prosperity for our citizens and residents. "At a time when people everywhere are feeling the pain of a tough global economy, now is the time to push the accelerator on climate action on a truly global scale." Ambassador Majid pointed to the global energy transition as a particular opportunity to seize to fuel both climate action and economic growth. "That is why the UAE has committed $50 billion to build renewable energy projects in over 70 countries, including 31 island developing-states that are most vulnerable to climate change. The nation has also committed an additional investment of US$50 billion over the next decade in several countries to accelerate clean energy transition. It's why we have joined with the United States to catalyze $100 billion dollars to pick up the pace of clean energy development worldwide." Emphasising the need for ambition and action to deliver results, His Excellency said: "we view living up to the goals of the Paris Agreement not only as the greatest responsibility we have, but as the greatest opportunity too. We have the greatest chance of our lifetimes, to propel global development with concerted climate action. We must not hesitate to seize upon it and make every moment here at COP27 count." Ambassador Majid underscored the UAE's unwavering commitment to supporting Egypt and stressed that the UAE was committed to building off of progress at COP27 going into COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference, next year. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 27th October, 2022 (WAM) -- The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) kicked off its twenty-fourth Council meeting today in Abu Dhabi. The biannual two-day meeting, chaired this year by Uruguay, gathers more than 400 delegates from 108 countries to discuss the world's energy transition ahead of the annual UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sham el-Sheikh, Egypt. "We are staring into a terrifying abyss of irreversible climate consequences, if we fail to act," said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera. "The IRENA Council meeting comes at a critical point in time and gives the international community an opportunity to strengthen collaboration and bolster the world's commitment to renewables for climate action ahead of COP27 and COP28." "We are convinced that IRENA must continue to spearhead the penetration of renewable energy around the world," said the 24th Council Chair and National Director of Energy of Uruguay, Mr Fitzgerald Cantero. "The solutions to mitigate energy poverty and the solution to the current energy crisis will come from renewables; and those of us who are already on this path will take further strides in this direction." This year's Council meeting will hold high-level events on pressing energy transition topics including hydrogen, critical materials, agri-food and enabling frameworks for the energy transition in high-risk environments. Journalists can access the live stream of the sessions here. Council Members will also discuss the Agency's medium-term strategy among other relevant matters. Despite continuous growth in renewable energy capacity over the past decade, IRENA views the pace of change inadequate in limiting rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees. According to the Agency's World Energy Transitions Outlook, a renewables-centred energy transition is the only realistic way to meet the 2030 time-frame for emissions reductions established by the IPCC, as well as the objectives of the 2030 timeline for sustainable development. Tripling investments in renewables will be fundamental for the scale and pace of the energy transition to reach the levels required to achieve Paris Agreement targets. IRENA will host a pavilion at COP27 and deliver a series of interlocking events based on the organisation's unparalleled mix of knowledge capacity, planning and implementation tools. Each event held with global partners and allies is designed to promote meaningful action and renewable energy investments in developing countries. The Agency is working closely with Egypt in its capacity as COP27 President and is the energy lead in supporting the High-Level Champions and the Marrakesh Partnership for Global Climate Action. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 14th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Tom Vilsack, United States Secretary of Agriculture, has affirmed that the UAE is a firm and committed partner for climate action and is in their very interest to steward climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation globally. In a statement to the Emirates News Agency (WAM) on the sidelines of COP27 , currently being held in Sharm El Sheikh, Vilsack expressed confidence that the UAE will bring together an exceptional COP28, commending the efforts of Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, in this regard. He added that in the agricultural sector, innovative products and methods have enabled the nation to turn deserts into farms. An example of such is Bustanica, the world's largest vertical farm, launched in July 2022 as a joint venture between Emirates Flight Catering and US-based Crop One. The country's latest project in this space is the Food Tech Valley, a first-of-its kind AgTech city that aims to serve as a testbed for pioneering innovations that drive the transition to sustainable food systems. Regarding the importance of the COP27 climate conference, Vilsack said, "I'm excited to be in Egypt and participate in COP27 as it gives us an opportunity, as the United States Department of Agriculture, to share US knowledge and experience on the global stage in climate-smart agricultural practices. I believe it is an opportunity for us to work with our Aim for Climate Ministerial (AIM) for Climate co-lead, the UAE, and our growing network of over 275 partners, to spur innovation in climate-smart agriculture and food systems, to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes, promote regenerative and sustainable practices, enable ways in which methane can be reduced, and ways in which we can use fertiliser more efficiently. He added that AIM for Climate was launched for two goals: first, to raise awareness of the importance of innovation in climate-smart agriculture to address climate challenges and second, to accelerate that innovation. COP27 to announce more than doubling of the investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation, initially from the $4 billion announced at COP26 to now over $8 billion, which includes over $1 billion from 30 innovation sprints. We have also tripled our number of partners, which now stands at 275.  The support from the private sector helps put resources into programs, ideas, thoughts, and technologies that will help innovate our way to a more adaptable and mitigated agricultural sector. He stated that Washington will be hosting the AIM for Climate Summit on 8th-10th May, 2023, convening partners to increase and accelerate investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Supported by the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research, this premier global event, exclusively for AIM for Climate partners, will provide a game-changing platform to raise ambition, build collaborations, and share knowledge on innovative solutions in the lead-up to COP28 in the UAE. \</doc>

The IMF and the multilateral development banks can and must do more to provide relief from today&rsquo;s food, energy, and debt crises At recent gatherings of G7 leaders, NATO members, and G20 foreign ministers, it was clear to everyone that the world is facing a confluence of emergencies unlike anything we have seen in decades. International tensions have risen to alarming heights on the back of increasing food and energy insecurity, depreciating currencies, looming debt crises, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the intensifying effects of climate change, and armed conflicts. Previously a forum for tackling financial and economic problems, the G20, chaired by Indonesia this year, is being pushed into perilously sensitive terrain. The group&rsquo;s Leaders Summit in mid-November will be critically important; but we cannot wait until then to address today&rsquo;s intertwined crises. The G20 should launch a virtual (online) process to start working toward a common, coordinated response in advance of its November summit. According to the World Food Program (WFP), more than 800 million people are now chronically hungry, with up to 323 million facing the prospect of starvation. Energy prices have soared, and COVID-19 continues to rage through the world&rsquo;s under-vaccinated populations (only 16.5% of people in low-income countries have been fully vaccinated). Moreover, some 60% of low-income countries are in debt distress, and communities around the world are experiencing droughts, floods, wildfires, and other symptoms of climate breakdown. In April, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres warned that today&rsquo;s confluence of crises &ldquo;could throw up to 1.7 billion people &ndash; over one-fifth of humanity &ndash; into poverty, destitution, and hunger on a scale not seen in decades.&rdquo; But though the situation is perilous, we are not powerless to change it. Some multilateral initiatives have already been launched to address debt, energy, and food insecurity. To be effective, however, such efforts must be coordinated and comprehensive. Our problems are too interconnected to be addressed piecemeal. The immediate priority is to ensure fair prices and secure supplies across food and energy markets. At least $10 billion is needed to bridge the WFP&rsquo;s financing shortfall this year. So far, international institutions and many governments have responded to the food crisis with initiatives such as the Global Alliance for Food Security, which was launched this spring to coordinate humanitarian financing and investments in food-system resilience. And more than 80 countries have endorsed a US-led Roadmap for Global Food Security Call to Action, and there have been important regionally focused summits such as the Mediterranean Ministerial Dialogue on the Food Security Crisis and the Uniting for Global Food Security Ministerial Conference. But even though it is well known that open trade is crucial to containing food insecurity, more than 20 countries have imposed restrictions on food exports (through export licenses, taxes, or outright bans). While World Trade Organization member states recently agreed to exempt the WFP&rsquo;s humanitarian purchases from export restrictions, that is not enough. We need to take full advantage of our knowledge of how the global food market operates both in the short and long run, and in terms of both supply and reserves. To that end, major countries holding grain stocks in reserve should release them onto international markets to dampen further price increases; and governments should strengthen the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) to improve transparency and monitoring (including of futures markets) and to prevent speculation. We must ensure that more countries can build self-sufficiency through agricultural-import diversification and more resilient domestic production (where possible). On energy, leaders have discussed creating an oil-purchasing cartel to negotiate better prices; and there are many new initiatives to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. But we need to pick up the pace in the run-up to November&rsquo;s United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. For their part, the International Monetary Fund and the multilateral development banks can and must do more to provide relief from today&rsquo;s food, energy, and debt crises. Only one-quarter of the IMF&rsquo;s trillion-dollar balance sheet is currently committed to providing financial assistance and debt-service relief to struggling countries. Likewise, the World Bank could lend more, by negotiating a capital replenishment with its member states and by leveraging its triple-A credit rating to crowd in private capital with loan guarantees. To address the looming debt crisis, we need a robust preemptive multilateral restructuring and relief initiative for developing countries with unsustainable debt burdens. The share of low-income countries in debt distress, or at high risk of it, has doubled from 30% to 60% since 2015. Making matters worse, many middle-income countries&rsquo; credit ratings are being downgraded, which means that they will face higher debt-service costs, especially now that the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks are tightening their monetary policies. New initiatives to alleviate debt distress will need to go much further than similar recent efforts did. The Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) that was launched early in the pandemic has since expired, after providing only $13 billion in temporary relief to 48 low-income countries. Moreover, it covered only official bilateral creditors, thus excluding the private creditors who hold the largest share of developing-country debt. Following the launch of the DSSI, the Common Framework for Debt Treatments was established to deal with sovereign insolvency and protracted liquidity problems in DSSI-eligible countries. It is supposed to provide debt relief and restructuring consistent with a debtor&rsquo;s essential-spending needs and capacity to pay; but, one and a half years after its inception, only three countries have signed up (Chad, Ethiopia, and Zambia), and none has successfully completed a debt restructuring. With participation in the Common Framework currently limited to the 73 poorest countries, the eligibility criteria may need to be reviewed and expanded, and all creditors &ndash; including China and the private sector &ndash; will need to be incorporated into the process. Greater debt transparency is essential for effective sovereign-debt renegotiation. While securing Chinese participation may prove difficult, private-sector participation can be required by regulation, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, where there is already a precedent for this. Finally, IMF surcharges (extra fees charged to highly indebted borrowing countries) should be suspended immediately. The number of countries incurring such costs has already risen from nine to 16 since the pandemic began, and the IMF projects that the total could rise to 38 by 2025. We are facing an unprecedented confluence of crises that could gravely jeopardize our future. Once again, the world needs the G20 to step up and act with resolve. - Project Syndicate \</doc>

JEDDAH, 3rd October, 2022 (WAM) -- Dr. Muhammad Sulaiman Al Jasser, Chairman of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) Group, has said that his group has provided US$165.630.5 billion to finance development projects in various economic sectors, since its launch and up to 30th June, 2022. In an interview with the Emirates News Agency (WAM), Dr. Al Jasser said that food security is a major issue facing the member states of the IsDB, which is promoting smart agriculture and the need to increase strategic food reserves in these countries. By 2025, the bank hopes to make at least 35 percent of its new operations environmentally friendly, and it is cooperating with the UAE by offering technical support to ensure the success of the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28), which it is also currently doing with Egypt for COP27 , to be held in Sharm El Sheikh. Below is the full interview: - What are your support mechanisms for member states that enable them to address current economic challenges? The bank's main goal is to support the social and economic development of its member countries, and its strategic objectives revolve around this mission and are reflected by its financing of many major projects in various sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, education, transportation, energy, industry, mining, urban development, water and sanitation, information and communication technology, digitalisation and finance. The bank has also financed various projects over the past years, including those empowering women and the youth, countering climate change, supporting non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society groups, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and expertise and regional cooperation, and encouraging economic integration among member countries. - The need to maintain food security was made more urgent by the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Eastern Europe. What related measures has the IsDB implemented as a response to the urgent needs of its member states? In response to these challenges, in July 2022, the IsDB adopted a comprehensive food security response programme worth US$10.54 billion to support member states in addressing the food crisis. The bank is also assisting the efforts to increase the resilience of its member states against future food crises. Therefore, the bank will focus on supporting eco-friendly smart agriculture that will increase productivity, ensure food security and maintain the strategic food reserves of its member states, as well as enable small farmers to access markets and attract agricultural investment. - In November 2023, the UAE will host COP28. Can you tell us about the details of your cooperation with the UAE and what are your target sectors? The bank is proactively adopting green economy and sustainability standards in its financial operations, so it set a target of having least 35 percent of its new operations as climate-sensitive by 2025, meaning that it will concurrently assess the need to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. Under its plan to address climate change and its repercussions, the bank launched a leading Shariah-compliant financing programme, titled, "Green Sukuk", with the aim of encouraging the adoption of green projects and reducing the negative effects of other developmental projects on the climate. - Digitisation is crucial to a variety of sectors. What is the bank's strategy for supporting member states in this area? The IsDB is currently updating its strategy to ensure that its activities are in line with the ever-changing requirements of its member countries, by prioritising their efforts to achieve recovery and build resilience. The bank is also helping its member countries make their healthcare systems more inclusive and sustainable, as well as bridge the digital divide, preventing some half a billion children from continuing their education during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also supporting the digitisation of various economic and governmental sectors in its member countries. Through its Reverse Linkage mechanism, the bank can help spread the UAE's advanced expertise in this area to other member states. - What are the effects of the digital economy and virtual economy on the real economy? The technological advancements of recent decades led to the Fourth Industrial Revolution based on digitalisation and AI. The major effects on the real economy can be summarised in two words, acceleration and temporary confusion. Innovation accelerates growth and creates major opportunities, especially in the services sector and with high added value. On the other hand, the rapid adoption of new innovations has led to the restructuring of the labour market and changed priorities, due to the urgent need to train and qualify human capital and re-organise to keep pace with these new innovations. - During its previous meeting, the IsDB's Board of Executive Directors agreed to provide funds worth US$1.12 billion for development projects in its member states. What are the features of these projects? The ISDB's Board of Executive Directors approved funds to finance development projects valued at US$1.12 billion, which will cover many key sectors and infrastructure projects, include those in the areas of food security, health, transportation, energy, urban development, education, and water and sanitation. These projects will improve the living standards of target categories in member countries, as well as support their economic growth. The board also approved an aid package worth US$1.79 million to finance other projects, including facilitating market access in Yemen, as well as special aid for Muslim communities in three non-member countries earmarked for upgrading school facilities and offering quality education and skills training to young people to encourage their economic and social participation. - What is the total value of financing provided by the IsDB to member states up to the end of the first quarter of 2022? Since its launch and up to 30th June, 2022, the IsDB has provided US$165.630.5 billion to finance development projects in various economic sectors. The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit, the insurance arm of the IsDB Group, has insured trade and investment operations in its 48 member countries for US$83.3 billion. To mitigate the risks facing these operations, the corporation offers insurance solutions and services that comply with the Islamic Sharia. - How many regional offices does the bank have? And what are their roles? In order to provide fast and flexible solutions to assist the development of member countries, the IsDB has been keen to decentralise. It established 10 regional centres in some member states, in addition to the Centre of Excellence in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, while a new regional centre is being constructed in the UAE. The bank's regional centres enable it to better meet the needs of member states while improving performance and increasing efficiency. Decentralisation will accelerate the implementation of the group's projects and reduce costs, as well as enable its regional offices to promote communication among the general public, provide news to the media and coordinate with them, and cooperate with the business sector. \</doc>

He noted that climate action is an urgent priority and is essential for achieving sustainable economic growth in the region. "Climate issues are of global concern. The international community must take all necessary measures to recover from climate impacts, and promote investments in climate finance and environment-friendly projects such as clean energy and green infrastructure, to achieve sustainable economic and social development," he stated. On the sidelines of the "Finance Day", Al Hussaini met with Odile Renaud-Basso, President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), to discuss means of deepening collaboration in the context of the UAE's Presidency of COP28. They exchanged visions on joint work areas, namely measures to increase private finance for adaptation, and climate finance, especially for food and water resilience and early warning. This is in addition to increased project preparation funding and de-risking for clean energy projects in developing countries, as well as increasing partnership and promising investment opportunities between EBRD and the public and private sectors in the UAE. He added: "We appreciate EBRD's support in facilitating our engagement with the Multilateral Development Banks on climate, in order to set systematic frameworks for positive and effective cooperation. We look forward to further cooperation with MDBs through the COP28 preparatory process." Minister of State for Financial Affairs also met with Sigrid Kaag, Minister of Finance, Kingdom of the Netherlands, and both parties discussed climate finance issues and the mechanisms required to advance the sector. COP27 , which is being held from 6th to 18th November and hosted by Egypt in Sharm El-Sheikh, is focussed on devising implementable mechanisms to achieve climate targets through legislations, policies, and programmes devised by the Paris Agreement. The "Finance Day", held on the sidelines of COP27 , included 13 sessions that discussed means of combating climate change, sustainable finance, and the transition to green economy. \</doc>

The World Trade Organisation (WTO) called for accelerated actions on climate change as climate change was a major threat to future growth and prosperity due to potential productivity losses, production shortages, damaged transport infrastructure and supply chain disruptions. "Without significant reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, many countries are likely to find their comparative advantages changing, with agriculture, tourism and some manufacturing sectors particularly vulnerable to climate impacts," the World Trade Report by WTO said. The report also pointed out that trade is a force multiplier for countries' adaptation efforts in the face of climate disruptions, reducing costs of technologies and critical goods and services. The 2022 edition of the trade report, released at the ongoing COP27 meeting in Egypt, presented new analysis and recommendations on how international trade and greater cooperation can amplify global efforts to address climate change and put the planet on a sustainable trajectory. "In the longer-run, open international markets would help countries achieve necessary economic adjustment and resource reallocation. This is particularly relevant for the most vulnerable economies - least-developed countries, small-island developing states and landlocked developing countries," it said. Sign up for our free newsletterSign up "This report is being launched at the same time as COP27 . What I hope to see emerge there and elsewhere is a trade and investment facilitation pathway in support of a just transition to a low-carbon economy," Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who is participating in the climate summit, said in her foreword to the report. "The report argues that trade is a force for good for climate and part of the solution for achieving a low-carbon, resilient and just transition," she said. The Director-General is slated to present the report at a high-level event for world leaders at COP27 on Tuesday. The report said trade could reduce the cost of mitigating climate change - by supporting the reduction or prevention of GHG emissions - and speed up the transition to a low-carbon economy and the creation of green jobs. The report pointed out that without global cooperation on ambitious climate policies, the world will not achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. \</doc>

Kuwaiti has reaffirmed its commitment to achieving carbon neutrality in the oil and gas sector by 2050, KUNA reported. In remarks to the state-run news agency made at COP27 and the Middle East Green Initiative Summit currently held in Egypt, the Kuwaiti minister stated that Kuwait executed many projects to preserve the environment and reduce emissions. Kuwait makes climate pledge He said that Kuwait sticks to all the commitments it made since the launching of the first climate conference in Brazil in 1992 all the way to the Paris conference in 2015. He noted that the representative of Kuwait took part in the two summits and said that one of the UN summit's goals is to encourage world countries to announce specific dates to reach carbon neutrality, indicating that Kuwait had pledged to reach that objective by 2050. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, meanwhile, has pledged $2.5bn in funding to the Middle East Green Initiative. The announcement came as the Kingdom's Crown Prince hosted the Middle East Green Initiative summit alongside COP27 in Egypt. The Middle East is increasingly looking to sustainable business and diversifying its economy.

(Image: source/31/11/images/WhatsApp-Image.jpg) Middle East's green ambitions and developments are under a sharp focus as Egypt and the UAE prepare to host the next two major world summits on climate change. This year, the 27th annual summit of the United Nations Climate Conference of the Parties or COP27 takes place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, starting November 6, while the UAE readies to host COP28 in 2023. According to the UN, COP27 is being held against a backdrop of extreme weather events worldwide, an energy crisis propelled by the crisis in Ukraine, and scientific data reiterating that the world is not doing enough to tackle carbon emissions and protect the future of the planet. A report published by UN Climate Change, said Egypt and the UAE are among 26 countries that have updated their climate targets in line with the pledges made last year at COP26 in Glasgow, UK. Egypt is promising to further cut greenhouse-gas emissions from electricity, transport and the oil and gas sectors, although this is only compared to previously forecast levels &mdash; and the commitment is contingent on receiving international financial support. The UAE is pledging to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 31per cent by 2030, compared to business-as-usual level, which is beyond its previous promised cut of 23.5per cent. The UN report says commitments made by countries in the past year will reduce projected emissions rises to 10.6per cent above 2010 levels by 2030, compared to the 13.7per cent forecast in a similar analysis last year. But they remain well short of what the world needs to limit warming to 1.5-degC by the end of the century. According to the UN statement, COP27 will be about moving from negotiations, and "planning for implementation" for all these promises and pledges made. Egypt has called for full, timely, inclusive, and at-scale action on the ground. Oxford Economics' research shows that the economic impact of global warming rises for countries that are already among the hottest in the world. The GCC belongs to this group. Although dependent on oil and a manufacturing sector based on energy competitiveness, the GCC economies are undergoing transition and have long held plans to diversify. This means ambition and spending could be higher in the GCC than in other parts of the world, which could enable rapid progress in new sectors. This presents opportunities but also carries risks - GCC countries need to get it right or risk becoming old and dusty oil states. "The GCC countries are embarking on a clean energy transition pathway, which targets more sustainable, efficient and cost-effective methods for using energy," Dr Mohamed Al Rashidi, Director of Energy, Secretariat General of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), said. "We are witnessing a real change happening in the region, with exciting visions and ambitious projects launched. This creates an attractive environment for the GCC and EU entities to be partners in this endeavour," he added. Al Rashidi was addressing a webinar which was held with the goal of fostering closer ties on climate change issues between the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council ahead of COP27 . The experts addressed the current debate around climate change, challenges of energy efficiency in the building sector, and the necessary strategies, policies and regulations to facilitate energy efficiency. They also discussed investment and finance, business models in the energy efficiency sector, and the need for local and global sustainable growth and development. Focusing on energy efficiency as a critical driver toward decarbonisation in the sector, the event called for collective action through quick, cross-sectoral and human-centered interventions. Participants presented practical solutions to issues such as low energy efficiency and chronic reliance on fuel subsidies, and discussed the role of clean energy in cost-effective energy consumption. In May 2022, the European Union introduced its Joint Communication on a Strategic Partnership with the Gulf, aiming to broaden and deepen the EU's cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council and its Member States. The Communication presents concrete proposals to strengthen cooperation on energy, green transition and climate change, trade and economic diversification, regional stability and global security, humanitarian and development challenges, and closer people-to-people contacts.  \</doc>

Abu Dhabi-headquartered International Renewable Energy Agency concluded biannual two-day meeting yesterday Abu Dhabi-headquartered International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is working with its 168 member states to support countries globally in their transition to a sustainable energy future, a top official said in Abu Dhabi. IRENA, based in Masdar City, supports the adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy, said Dr Nawal Al-Hosany, the Permanent Representative of the UAE to the IRENA. "IRENA supports and helps accelerate the adaptation of renewable energy around the world, and they do that through different pillars. But mainly, IRENA helps countries to develop their legislative framework. They give them support on policies and help them to develop their skill sets in the country but also understanding (sic) the type of technologies that can be adapted in certain countries. Some will have more solar potential others will have more wind potential. So, just helping them mapping their environmental resources to understand which technology works best for them," Dr Al-Hosany told Khaleej Times in an interview. In partnership with the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) and initiating initiatives like the Climate Investment Platform, IRENA has been able to advance energy transitions in developing and least-developed countries, especially in Africa, Asia and Latin America. This week, Abu Dhabi hosted the 24th IRENA Council and related meetings, which concluded on Friday. The biannual two-day meeting gathered more than 400 delegates from 108 countries to discuss the world's energy transition ahead of the annual UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. "Even non-Council members were present because they also wanted their voices to be heard and understood. With 168 members, IRENA is almost reaching global membership. And we have developed, developing, least developed countries and those suffering from climate change and which want to be part of the solution. The UAE is offering a platform that helps, with the support of IRENA, certain countries transition into a more sustainable energy future." According to the IRENA's World Energy Transitions Outlook, the pace of change seen globally has been inadequate in limiting rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees - the target the Paris climate agreement set. The latest UN Environment Programme data indicates that the world is on track for a temperature rise of between 2.4 degrees and 2.6 degrees by the end of this century. Meanwhile, the UAE has embarked on the ambitious goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, making the country the first Mena nation to do so. "The UAE is working closely with member states to understand how we can transition towards our carbon and renewable energy targets. Having a knowledge hub like IRENA here in the UAE is very important for us. It is helping us understand and benefit from its work." "We are also part of the conversation and part of this international collaboration when it comes to global transition together to an inclusive energy future. So, having IRENA here, gives us the opportunity to host and convene different stakeholders and players that would be part of a solution that we are all seeking, which is a more sustainable and inclusive future." Dr Al-Hosany noted that the UAE would have a high-level representation and active participation at COP27 "The UAE is going to be very active in COP27 . We will have a huge delegation. We will be participating in most of the platforms. We will have a very active pavilion to not only present the work we do but also provide a platform that convenes different stakeholders, and players, to see how we can prepare with the outcomes of COP27 for COP28. The UAE is going there with a clear mandate that we speak about how we are partners in this energy transition and climate action. So, we are going to speak about the work that we do. We will be active in the negotiation rooms," Dr Al-Hosany added. \</doc>

Africa launched a new framework to support growth of carbon credits production, create jobs and protect biodiversity in the continent - the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI). The new initiative, announced at the ongoing COP27 meet in Egypt - will be led by a 13-member steering committee of African leaders, CEOs, and carbon credit experts. ACMI has set an ambitious target of reaching 300 million credits offered annually by 2030, which is expected to unlock $6 billion in income and support 30 million jobs. By 2050, ACMI is targeting over 1.5 billion credits annually in Africa, leveraging over $120 billion and supporting over 110 million jobs. A number of African nations including Kenya, Malawi, Gabon, Nigeria and Togo shared their commitments to collaborating with ACMI to scale up carbon credit production via voluntary carbon market activation plans. Sign up for our free newsletterSign up The initiative was launched at COP27 in collaboration with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), and the UN Economic Commission for Africa, with the support of the UN Climate Change High Level Champions - Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping. ACMI also released a roadmap report on harnessing carbon markets for Africa at the launch event. The report identifies 13 action programmes to support the growth of voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) on the continent. Although voluntary carbon markets are already growing quickly - retirements of African credits have grown by an average of 36 percent annually over the past five years - aggressive action will be required to maintain this level of growth over the coming decades, ACMI said.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a grande dame of international organisations. Its stately proceedings can be credited with shepherding many a nation through the complex and challenging task of hosting a COP summit. At least, that was my experience being on the COP26 team for the UK Government. Now, as we race towards the first United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP) to be held in the Middle East since Marrakech in 2016, eyes from all corners of the world are settling on Sharm El Sheikh, and quickly refocusing on Dubai in 2023. As communications professionals, one of the challenges for us is that COPs are inherently confusing affairs and the success of COP27 and 28 will be in part due to our collective ability to communicate issues and outcomes effectively with diverse stakeholders and audiences. The climate community and international media have endless, renewable energy for speculation and gossip. A bucket load of scepticism needs to be poured over 'insider' knowledge about what will or will not be achieved this year. The annual carousel of host countries means they are often heroically working round the clock to get a grasp on the process, negotiations and strategy of getting 197 countries to agree on anything. If COP26 is anything to go by, the complex balancing of diplomacy and persuasion demanded by the negotiations take place almost entirely behind closed doors. That means COPs are fertile ground for rumour and supposition. This is valuable to bear in mind as you read reports of COP27 and 28 in the coming weeks and months. With that caveat in mind, it is broadly accepted that expectations for COP27 are muted. There are strong headwinds to overcome. They read like a checklist of extremely challenging hurdles: global energy and cost-of-living crises, fractured and polarised politics, populist disinclination to support climate action, and limited resources and institutional capacity of the host country. The cards are stacked against game-changing achievements. That's a tragedy for the climate and humankind, but it also means that expectations will be higher for the UAE to pull the rabbit out of the hat for COP28. As liberal democracies in the global north are consumed by the crises outlined above, there's little evidence of the kind of long-term planning that's needed to reconfigure energy, food, transportation and construction systems on a necessary scale. The energy system accounts for 31 per cent of global emissions, followed by food at 11 per cent, then transportation and construction systems at 15 and 20 per cent respectively. Such is the state of despondency about climate action, that this could be the moment for the decisive leadership of the UAE to shine. But where are we likely to see action? Here are some predictions for COP28. That's food security, but also innovation in the food system. In Glasgow last year, the UAE and US agreed to put $4bn into an Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate initiative focusing on agricultural innovation. This could be expanded. Second, the trilemma of energy supply, renewability and affordability will be a central recurring theme. So, while further announcements of investments in hydrogen, carbon capture and solar could be on the cards, lower-carbon fossil fuels will be too. Third, youth will play a big role. The UAE is a young country and, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer, the government enjoys one of the highest levels of trust among its Gen Z population in the world. And lastly, the focus on practical solutions may lead to more regional climate financing deals along the lines of the Just Energy Transition Partnership between South Africa, Germany, France, the UK, the US and the EU. There is a slogan in the UAE: 'Impossible is Possible'. As climate action faces enormous challenges, and the prospect of staying within 1.5 degrees of global warming is slipping away, we need to see impossible achievements. Those include new types of partnerships, increased action to meet targets, and using communications to unite people and organisations. 'AS LIBERAL DEMOCRACIES ARE CONSUMED BY CRISES, THERE'S LITTLE EVIDENCE OF LONG-TERM PLANNING.' \</doc>

Upcoming gathering to focus on strong and sustainable recovery, namely food and energy security Supplied photo As Indonesia prepares to host the G20 Summit in Bali this November, the Indonesian Ambassador to the UAE Husin Bagis has emphasised the need for a coordinated commitment to mutual cooperation by nations in order to navigate the various challenges of today's world. "Mutual cooperation is what Indonesians call "Gotong Royong", which means everyone carries the same burden, hence, we all should work together to achieve a defined and common purpose of a prosperous and peaceful world. This is the message that we are trying to convey through G20," Bagis told Khaleej Times. In its 17th edition, which will run from November 15-16, the G20 Summit will focus on three priority sectors that are the key to a strong and sustainable recovery, namely food and energy security, strengthening global health architecture, as well as digital transformation. "To address the global challenges, each country needs to develop cooperation both at the multilateral and bilateral levels," the ambassador noted. Road to recovery "Indeed the pandemic has hit us hard, especially in economic growth. Although Indonesia is confident in the positive trajectory of economic growth, after the pandemic, there are many other challenges that will impact the growth," Bagis said. Those issues, he said, include food and energy insecurity, and climate change. "That is why Indonesia is actively involved in the efforts to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine, to ensure that the food supply will not be disrupted any longer, and also Indonesia's active role in the COP of the UNCCC." "As a forum that was established in response to the global crisis, we believe that the G20 becomes the appropriate forum for international economic cooperation." The ambassador went on to express the importance of the UAE's participation at the Summit, especially being a leader in priority issues facing world. "We believe that the UAE will contribute to reaching concrete results at the G20 this year, to benefit the world economy. We all know the UAE is indeed one of the countries that lead in the three priority issues (Global Health Architecture, Digital Transformation, and Sustainable Energy Transition)." One notable partnership between the UAE and Indonesia was the signing of the Indonesia-UAE CEPA (Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement) on July 1, 2022. It is projected to enhance trade balance between the two countries to$10 billion in the next few years. "The IUAE CEPA is expected to be Indonesia's entry point to the UAE, which is a hub for increasing exports to potential export destination countries such as the Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia," Bagis explained. According to the agreement, Indonesia will get 0% (tariff-free) for the exporting products of gold, tyres, spare parts, automotive accessories, car batteries, solar batteries, palm oil, jewellery, paper, rubber, and spices. "In addition to strong economic ties, Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country in the world, and the UAE are highlighting shared common values regarding moderate Islam and a readiness to work together to promote tolerance and fight against religious extremism," Bagis added. Road to COP27 The ambassador said that Indonesia and the UAE are both committed to addressing environmental and climate change, which remains to be a shared mission and concern for both nations, and a growing area for cooperation. "No country is immune to the effects of climate change. In Indonesia, we have experienced harsher weather with high rainfall and temperature. This has wide-ranging consequences for the ecosystem in Indonesia and will jeopardise food and water security, land loss in coastal areas, and increase health risks." "I'm happy that one of our cooperation with the UAE is on mangroves, which provides a natural barrier for coastal communities and whole ecosystems from storm surge, flooding, and erosion." A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Mangrove Development Programme was signed on February 15, 2021 and the two sides are in the process of having the Implementing Arrangement, Bagis said. "One of the programmes is A Mangrove Alliance for Climate which aims to support and promote mangroves as the solution to climate change in form of mangrove plantation, joint study, and research. "Leaders [from both countries] continuously cooperate in the areas of transfer of knowledge and technology for green transitioning and waste management. Both countries agreed to achieve said goals and milestones in the G20 Leaders' Summit and COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh," he concluded. \</doc>

SHARJAH, 27th September, 2022 (WAM) -- BEEAH Group and Green Planet, Egypt's emerging environmental services company, have formed a partnership to deliver a landmark ten-year contract in Sharm el-Sheikh. The development comes ahead of Cop27 , which will be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, between 6th-18th November 2022. In the presence of Dr. Mostafa Madbouly, Prime Minister of Egypt; Khaled Al Huraimel, Group CEO of BEEAH Group; and Dr. Mohamed Asaad, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Green Planet, signed the contract with the Governorate of South Sinai. The signing ceremony was attended by Dr. Mohamed Maait, Egypt's Minister of Finance, Dr. Yasmine Fouad, Egypt's Minister of Environment, Major General Hisham Amna, Egypt's Minister of Local Development, and Major General Khaled Fouda, Governor of South Sinai in Egypt. Delegations from the UAE Embassy in Cairo, Sharjah Municipality and BEEAH Group were also present. In preparation for Cop27 and over the next decade, BEEAH Group and Green Planet will implement future-ready waste management strategies that align with Egypt's sustainability agenda, such as deploying world-class waste management infrastructure, streamlined waste collection solutions and recycling services. Bringing together a network of RFID-tagged bins, a GPS-enabled fleet and a skilled workforce, BEEAH Group and Green Planet aim to set a new standard for operational efficiency while meeting waste management demand. The contract will be served across the city, including in and around the Sharm el-Sheikh International Convention Centre, where Cop27 is to be held, and tourist hotspots in desert and beach areas. Commenting on the announcement, Al Huraimel said, "Alongside Green Planet, BEEAH is pleased to serve the city of Sharm el-Sheikh. Through our solutions and services, we aim to keep the city clean, preserve the environment and pioneer a sustainable quality of life for residents and visitors. With Cop27 approaching, it is the ideal time to support Egypt as it solidifies its initiatives under the Vision 2030 agenda. Today, we will begin by deploying world-class infrastructure and services to streamline waste management. "Over the next decade, in partnership with Green Planet, our goal is to scale up services, build on zero-waste to landfill strategies, and help shape Sharm El-Sheikh into a sustainable, smart city of the future." Dr. Asaad, in turn, stated, "We are optimistic about the future and look forward to working with the South Sinai Governorate and environmental affairs institutions to enhance waste management infrastructure in Sharm El Sheikh, which will help maintain its position as a leading tourist destination. "In collaboration with BEEAH Group, we will also launch an awareness campaign that aims to educate the city's residents about the importance of preserving marine and desert environments, as well as natural resources. The climate crisis has made it clear that we must unite efforts globally, with each of us having a role to play in mitigating the negative effects. Through ongoing collaboration between government, environmental institutions, and society, we believe we can drive real impact in securing a sustainable future for all." Recycling of used cooking oil is one of the specialised waste collection services that BEEAH Group and Green Planet will offer. This will help minimise the burden on public plumbing infrastructure that arises from used cooking oil disposal through pipes and drains, while also enabling the production of alternative green fuels. As per the contract, BEEAH Group and Green Planet will deploy used cooking oil deposit machines throughout the city. Then, thousands of special used cooking oil collection bottles will be distributed among residents. Once a bottle is full, individuals can deposit it into the used cooking oil machine. As soon as a deposit is made, the machine will dispense an empty collection bottle, encouraging users to continue collecting and recycling used cooking oil. The contract with Sharm el-Sheikh is the BEEAH Group's second in Egypt. In 2020, BEEAH Group signed the Middle East's largest waste management contract with the New Administrative Capital, one of the largest urban development projects in the world, which targets an ambitious landfill waste diversion rate of 80%. The new contract adds to BEEAH Group's efforts to consolidate its position in Egypt and across the region, following its success in the UAE as a sustainability pioneer. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 12th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Two weeks of transparency events kicked off at COP27 in Egypt on 8th November under the banner "Together4Transparency". With discussions ranging from the need for reliable greenhouse gas emissions estimates accessible to all, to the role that information plays in reducing risks and uncertainties in order to attract financial support for action, the series of events addresses the full range of actors and issues related to transparency. At the opening ceremony, keynote speaker and former US Vice President Al Gore called for "radical transparency" to guide us toward a net-zero emissions future and observed the simple truth that "you can't manage what you cannot measure". Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) Marianne Karlsen, UN Climate Change Transparency Director Donald Cooper, and Egyptian YOUNGO representative Riham Refaat, reinforced the role of the Enhanced Transparency Framework in ensuring that the Paris Agreement is effectively and credibly implemented. "Together4Transparency" aims to unite stakeholders involved in supporting the transition toward the Enhanced Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement. The two-week series of events covers a range of transparency issues - from celebrating the progress and achievements made over the past 30 years, to showcasing successes and best practices in the reporting and review processes and paving the way for full implementation of the Paris Agreement by all Parties. Midway through COP27 , a high-level "Together4Transparency" event was held to exchange views on what transparency means and what benefits it can bring. In his opening remarks, Deputy Executive Secretary Ovais Sarmad noted, "The health of our planet - and life as we know it - depends on each of us doing our part to address the climate emergency and moving us closer to net-zero emissions by 2050. We must act now to achieve results and ensure that promises made are promises kept. But to ensure that, we need to have reliable climate data and information. The reporting, review and consideration of this climate data and information is referred to as 'transparency'. Without it, we are left to act blindly, without knowledge of our circumstances and our impacts. This is why transparency is at the very core of the Paris Agreement, and everything we do here." \</doc>

CAIRO, 15th June, 2022 (WAM) -- Today in Cairo, on the occasion of the visit of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and her meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi, the EU and Egypt issued a joint statement on climate, energy and the green transition. The two sides reviewed and discussed enhanced cooperation on climate, energy and industrial transformation challenges ahead of COP27 in Egypt later this year. President von der Leyen said: "We are starting to tap into the full potential of EU-Egypt relations, by putting the clean energy transition and the fight against climate change at the heart of our partnership. I look forward to working with Egypt as COP27 Presidency to build on the good momentum from last year in Glasgow. Egypt is also a crucial partner in our efforts to move away from Russian fossil fuels and towards more reliable suppliers." The EU and Egypt will join efforts to implement the Paris Agreement and ensure ambitious outcomes at COP27 , which takes place in Sharm El-Sheikh in November. The joint statement commits both parties to work together on a global just energy transition, on improving adaptation capacity, mitigating loss and damage due to climate change, and on increasing climate finance to respond to the needs of developing countries. The cooperation will have a particular focus on renewable energy sources, hydrogen, and energy efficiency. The EU and Egypt will develop a Mediterranean Hydrogen Partnership to promote investments in renewable electricity generation, strengthening and extension of electricity grids, including trans-Mediterranean interconnectors, the production of renewables and low carbon hydrogen, and the construction of storage, transport and distribution infrastructure. Security of gas supply is a common major concern. Egypt and the EU will work together on the stable delivery of gas to the EU and on the sustainable exploitation of natural gas resources in the framework of robust long-term decarbonisation objectives and measures to manage and reduce fugitive methane emissions. In that context, Egypt and the EU welcome the signature of the Memorandum of Understanding between Egypt, Israel and the European Union represented by the European Commission, signed on June 15, 2022. Egypt and the EU will reinforce their bilateral cooperation on green transition based on a spirit of shared ambition, principles and partnership to allow both sides to reap all the benefits from investing into a low emissions, climate-neutral and climate-resilient future in line with the EU-Egypt Partnership Priorities. \</doc>

On October 6, 2022, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) brought together some of the world's brightest minds in climate action when it hosted the Economist Impact's Countdown to COP27 Summit. Among these were philanthropist Bill Gates and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate - John Kerry. They were joined by leading UAE business and environmental figures such as Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan, founder and CEO of Alliances for Global Sustainability; Hana Al Rostamani, Group CEO of FAB; and Mohamed Al Ramahi, CEO of Masdar. In one of the standout moments from the summit, John Kerry outlined his vision as well as his pragmatism for net zero by telling the audience that: "This is a moment that is unbelievably exciting... this is also an opportunity for big economic transition that will be as big as the Industrial Revolution". But Kerry's vision struck a more realistic tone when he indicated that "the transition to net-zero and the estimated $4tn needed can be achieved 'only' with the support of the private sector", he went on to say that: "There's barely a government in the world that has money to do this. I believe this very deeply. We don't get there without the private sector". In my view, the banking industry will spearhead that private sector participation that John Kerry spoke of. This is because banks have a unique window into the entire economy, they uniquely touch every sector, and interact with almost every individual. Enabling engagement To date, banks are already facilitating private sector engagement in net zero, and this will surely deepen and widen in the coming years as the world's financial institutions play a more profound role in helping corporations walk the talk on their climate ambitions. To put it more specifically, banks provide strategic advisory and innovative sustainable financing, so they are well positioned to lead the change across the private sector by financing the future direction of energy supply, buildings, transportation, waste, water, and food. I also believe that COP27 this year will further underscore the power of finance on the road to net zero. At FAB, as the UAE's leading bank, we are stepping up and playing a decisive role in efforts to drive climate action through our proactive engagement and partnerships with our customers, clients, and the UAE government and regulators. We're operating across the full breadth of the private sector by working collaboratively with large corporates and SMEs. We're helping them to unlock new possibilities and enabling them to redefine the rules of their engagement with net zero and the possibilities that it brings. This involves understanding the diverse and specific needs of private sector entities and tailoring our solutions to best meet their requirements. Sustainable solutions A big part of this is strategic investments that are directly linked to sustainable solutions. FAB has been an industry leader in green financing since we issued the region's first green bond in 2017. But our engagement extends well beyond the 'financing', as it includes advisory and education in the communities we serve, as well as in measuring market emissions. At FAB, we're combining near-term action with a long-term view. In recent memory, we've made tangible progress and now we've set clear targets in relation to climate action. Around one year ago, we were the first UAE and regional bank to join the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) - in doing so we committed to achieving net zero by 2050. Alongside this, we have set a target of $75bn in green financing for the period 2022-2030. In addition, we believe that information and disclosure will be crucial to drive the climate action needed to turn ambition into action. Putting these standards in place will prove critical in helping investors assess climate and sustainability risks and opportunities, which in turn will direct capital toward long-term sustainable projects. To achieve the required systemic change across global economies, we will need the best efforts of individual institutions: we will need coordinated action across the entire public and private sectors so that every financial decision takes climate into account especially now that more than 80 per cent of global GDP is covered by a net-zero pledge according to the University of Oxford. All eyes are now firmly fixed on MENA as it hosts the next two COPs: COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt and COP28 in the UAE. Perhaps now will be the time to turn principles into lasting progress. At FAB, we're ready to play our part in turning the environmental crisis into an immense opportunity that will benefit both people and planet alike. \</doc>

Etihad Airways is to implement the contrail prevention feature in partnership with SATAVIA on the carrier's special net-zero flight for the COP27 meet in Egypt - its first transatlantic crossing flight to actively manage non-CO2 climate effects from contrail formation. Tackling contrail - or condensation trails - prevention is a major sustainability challenge responsible for up to 60 percent of aviation's climate footprint. The Abu Dhabi-based airline will fly its net-zero flight operating on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) EY130 from Washington Dulles Airport to Abu Dhabi on November 13. Mariam Alqubaisi, Etihad's head of sustainability and business excellence, said the Etihad-SATAVIA collaboration demonstrated the possibility of dramatic sustainability advances in day-to-day commercial operations. COP27 , tackling aviation's non-CO2 impacts with industry-leading technical innovation," he said. Sign up for our free newsletterSign up Aircraft-generated contrails cause surface warming responsible for up to two-thirds of aviation's climate impact, significantly outweighing direct CO2 emissions from aircraft engines. Transatlantic routes such as Washington to Abu Dhabi typically combine high air traffic density with atmospheric conditions that can lead to significant non-CO2 climate impact. In winter operations, cool and moist conditions frequently lead to strongly warming contrails. In addition to enabling contrail prevention in day-to-day flight operations, SATAVIA conducts post-flight climate impact analysis for conversion into future carbon credits, with an initial world-first trade by auction planned with AirCarbon Exchange in December 2022. SATAVIA CEO, Dr Adam Durant, said the company's contrail platform DECISIONX:NETZERO supports smarter, greener aviation. "By implementing minimal changes to a small percentage of flights, eco-conscious operators like Etihad can eliminate the majority of their non-CO2 climate footprint with essentially no impact on day-to-day operations and on shorter timescales than other green aviation interventions," Durant said. He said for transatlantic operations, up to 80 percent of contrail climate impact can be avoided by rerouting just over 10 percent of flights.

UAE energy Masdar and its partners for the 2GW green hydrogen project in Egypt - Infinity Power Holding and Hassan Allam Utilities - have expanded their consortium by roping in three Egyptian state-owned entities. Egyptian New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA), Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) and the Sovereign Fund of Egypt (TSFE) are the new members of the consortium which will be implementing the project in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE). The Masdar-led consortium signed the agreements with the new partners on the sidelines of the ongoing COP27 meet in Egypt on Wednesday. Wednesday's agreement followed Masdar signing two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) in April with Egyptian entities related to developing two green hydrogen production plants in the country - one in the SCZONE and the other on the Mediterranean. Masdar said the latest agreement set out the key terms and conditions for the green hydrogen development program, with focus on the first phase of the programme. In the first phase of the project, the consortium will establish a green hydrogen manufacturing facility in the SCZONE, scheduled to begin operations by 2026. Sign up for our free newsletterSign up The electrolyzer facilities in the SCZONE and on the Mediterranean could be extended to up to 4GW by 2030 to produce 2.3 million tonnes of green ammonia for export as well as supply green hydrogen for local industries. Masdar, Infinity Power and Hassan Allan Utilities last week announced they had signed an agreement to develop a 10GW onshore wind project in Egypt - one of the largest wind farms in the world. Once completed, the wind farm will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 23.8 million tonnes a year - equivalent to 9 percent of Egypt's current output. Egypt enjoys abundant solar and wind resources for generation of renewable power at a highly competitive cost - a key enabler for green hydrogen production. It is located within proximity to markets where demand for green hydrogen is expected to grow the most, providing a robust opportunity for export. Egypt is targeting renewables to make up 42 percent of its energy mix by 2035, while Egyptian authorities are reportedly working to revise the country's renewable energy strategy to include green hydrogen. Africa is expected to capture as much as 10 percent of the global green hydrogen market, helping to create up to 3.7 million jobs and adding as much as $120 billion to the continent's gross domestic product (GDP), according to a report issued jointly by Masdar and its Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) platform at COP27 last week.

GENEVA, 11th December, 2022 (WAM) - Some 20 million jobs could be created by investing in policies that support nature and address climate change, disaster risk, food insecurity, and other major challenges, according to a UN report Launched by the International Labour Organization (ILO), UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and International Union for Conservation of Nature at the UN's Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal, the Decent Work in Nature-based Solutions report underscores the need for greening the economy in a way that is fair and inclusive, creating meaningful work opportunities for all. "It is critical that as we scale up the use of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) we make sure we do not also scale up decent work deficits, such as the informal work, low-pay and low productivity conditions that many workers in NbS currently face", said Vic van Vuuren, Director, ILO Enterprises Department. "The ILO's Just Transition Guidelines  provide a framework to help us do this". Nature-based solutions aim to protect, restore, and sustainably manage waters and marine ecosystems while also provide human well-being, ecosystem resilience and biodiversity benefits. Currently, NbS employs nearly 75 million people, 96 per cent of whom live in Asia and the Pacific and lower middle income countries - despite the fact that most global NbS expenditure occurs in high income countries. However, the report cautions that there are challenges in measuring NbS employment and that the figures do not capture job losses and displacements that may occur while implementing Nature-based Solutions. Nearly all NbS work in low and lower-middle income countries - 98 and 99 per cent respectively - is in the agriculture and forestry sectors. This falls to 42 per cent for upper-middle income nations, and 25 per cent for high income. In industrialized countries, where agricultural productivity is high, NbS spending is concentrated in ecosystem restoration and natural resource management. Public services contribute 37 per cent of NbS work in high income countries. An additional 20 million jobs could be generated worldwide if investment in NbS were tripled by 2030 - a key step toward achieving biodiversity, land restoration and climate goals like those set out in the UN State of Finance for Nature 2021 Report. "We welcome the emphasis given to Nature-based Solutions at COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh. Not only are NbS a critical part of the mitigation equation - they host multiple co-benefits, including buffering the impacts of climate change", said Susan Gardner, Director of UNEP's Ecosystems Division. "What this report brings to light is how to make NbS work for people and the economy, and this will be a key success factor. A broad-based coalition with youth at the fore, is needed to achieve this". \' Just Transition' policies will also be needed to mitigate the risks to jobs and livelihoods during the transition to more sustainable practices. Meanwhile, the new Green Jobs for Youth Pact, launched by ILO and UNEP at COP27 , aims to create one million new green jobs and ensure the realization of the report's recommendations on the ground. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 18 October 2022 - The UAE will be at the heart of the global dialogue on the future of energy, as industry leaders, policy-makers and innovators from around the world gather in Abu Dhabi from the 31 October to 3 November for ADIPEC, the world's most influential forum for the energy industry. Under the newly bestowed patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, ADIPEC has evolved to reflect a rapidly changing global energy landscape. The event is taking place at a time of unprecedented complexity in energy market and the global economy, as industry and governments work to achieve energy security and advance climate goals at the same time. The flagship global energy event will engage the global sector in helping answer the industry's most pressing questions under the theme of 'The Future of Energy: Secure, Affordable and Sustainable' and will play an important role in spotlighting the energy needs of today, with fewer emissions, and also working towards a clean energy future. The event will highlight the balanced approach needed to advance a successful energy transition: fast-tracking decarbonisation of today's energy sources, while diversifying into future energies. Taking place the week before COP27 in Egypt, and as the UAE prepares to host COP28, a particular focus will be on how the industry is delivering on climate action, turning Net Zero commitments into realised emission reduction. Suhail Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy & Infrastructure, said: &ldquo;ADIPEC reinforces Abu Dhabi and the UAE's role at the heart of the dialogue on the future of energy. A future where energy must be secure, affordable and sustainable. It also provides and important platform to make the case for a progressive and pragmatic energy transition that is both pro-climate and pro-growth. This year, global industry must use the event to highlight the action they are taking to meet the world's energy needs and rapidly decarbonize oil and gas production, while investing to diversify into new and cleaner energy sources.&rdquo; &ldquo;As the UAE prepares to host COP28, we have already made clear that it will be a COP that gives a voice to all parts of society, developed and developing countries, the public and private sector including a responsible energy industry, as we build momentum in the transition. ADIPEC is a powerful global platform that can help present the possibilities of a more inclusive approach by welcoming the solutions and skills of the energy industry of today, in shaping the future of energy.&rdquo; ADIPEC 2022 will be opened with a keynote address by Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Managing Director and Group CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) & UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change. The conference will also see the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) launch 'An Eye on Methane', the second edition of its International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) report. The report will outline the progress made to set, track and achieve a reduction of methane emissions, with a particular focus on the oil and gas industry through the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0. In addition, OPEC will release its annual World Oil Outlook report to highlight and further the understanding of the many possible future challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for the oil industry. It will also work to encourage dialogue, cooperation and transparency between OPEC and other stakeholders within the industry. ADIPEC 2022 will host a series of conferences providing strategic and technical insights, including the ADIPEC 2022 Strategic Conference and hydrogen-focused sessions. More than 1200 speakers, including over 40 Ministers, CEOs, and policy influencers, will participate in more than 350 sessions. This year, ADIPEC's conference programme will focus on five strategic themes: &bull; 'The long-term impact of geopolitics on the global economy and energy industry' &bull; 'The road to COP27 and COP28' &bull; 'An industry transition: adapting to the new fundamentals of supply, low-carbon and new energy solutions' &bull; 'Innovation and the energy transition: pioneering a new era of technology development' &bull; 'The new management agenda: future workforce and the leaders of tomorrow' ADIPEC 2022 will also see the launch of the new Decarbonisation Zone and Decarbonisation Conference. Centred on the latest developments in methane, hydrogen, Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and new energies, the conference will put the spotlight on the industry's path towards net-zero through deployment of cleaner forms of energy and innovative technologies. The Ministerial panel discussions will encompass the most pressing geopolitical, sustainability and economic issues. Sessions will explore the future of energy supply, security, and affordability, including &ldquo;Geopolitics of today: how the energy industry is navigating through change&rdquo;, and &ldquo; COP27 : key policy considerations to deliver net-zero ambitions in an uncertain time.&rdquo; Key strategic speakers include Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure and Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Managing Director and Group CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). CEOs of top global energy companies including BP, Oxy, Eni, INPEX, OMV and others will also be among the high-level speakers. Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, organisers of ADIPEC 2022 said: &ldquo;ADIPEC will convene business leaders, innovators and policymakers from around the world, spurring action towards energy security at a time when it is needed most. &ldquo;Taking place just ahead of COP27 in Egypt, and almost exactly one year before COP28 will be hosted by the UAE, policymakers will gather in Abu Dhabi to discuss the solutions that respond to current global energy market challenges, while delivering on climate action and sustainability commitments.&rdquo; This year's ADIPEC Exhibition will accommodate 54 NOCs, IOCs and IECs, and 28 international country pavilions, providing a world-class environment for trade across the industry's full value chain. More than 150,000 energy professionals from 160 countries are projected to attend the event, with more than 2,200 exhibiting companies set to unveil what the industry has in store.

Prince Abdulaziz said that both the countries were working to ensure an &ldquo;energy mix of future&rdquo; With common emission pathways, climate goals and initiatives, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE were exemplary countries for energy producers, a top minister said during an international energy event in Abu Dhabi. At the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (Adipec) 2022, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Minister of Energy, Saudi Arabia, noted that both the Kingdom and the UAE are &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; oil production and refining, and &ldquo;working&rdquo; on clean hydrogen. In his remarks during Adipec 2022, he termed the Kingdom and the UAE&rsquo;s shared vision on sustainability as a &ldquo;twinning&rdquo; factor. &ldquo;There is so much that we could prove together in our twinning, you can call it, aspiration. We should continue to be the exemplary two countries for energy producers,&rdquo; he said while addressing Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidential Court, who was present for the opening day&rsquo;s ceremony. Prince Abdulaziz said that both the countries were working to ensure an &ldquo;energy mix of future&rdquo;. &ldquo;We cannot afford but to put together a modern energy system that can give us the calling of this conference, which is a secure, sustainable and affordable energy system. We are working on defining or standardising hydrogen as being clean hydrogen without the tag of grey or blue or green or pink.&rdquo; The Saudi minister noted that both the countries were &ldquo;working diligently hard&rdquo; in carbon sequestration. Both have shared a common vision of Net Zero, mission innovation and several other climate initiatives to ensure a secure future for everyone. &ldquo;We and the UAE have a young, ambitious and determined population that cannot and will not stand us sitting doing nothing in preparing for their better future to come. We and the UAE are going to be exemplary producers, hydrocarbon carbon producers but also achieve all the sustainability goals.&rdquo; Prince Abdulaziz noted that countries must not continue to work proactively. &ldquo;If we lose focus in the future, we will repeat what is going on today. In order to attend to the present, we must not let go of the future.&rdquo; Prince Abdulaziz added that cohesive efforts were needed to make the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 &ldquo;We need to work with our friends in Egypt to make their COP27 a successful one. We need to build on that success, to another success, hopefully next year when Abu Dhabi hosts COP28. We don&rsquo;t owe it to anybody but us.&rdquo; \</doc>

A renewables-centred energy transition is the only realistic way to solve the current energy crisis, they add File photo The world faces irreversible consequences without collective action on climate change, a top official from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) said in Abu Dhabi. "We are staring into a terrifying abyss of irreversible climate consequences if we fail to act," Irena Director-General Francesco La Camera said during the two-day council meeting, which started on Thursday. The biannual two-day meeting, chaired this year by Uruguay, gathers more than 400 delegates from 108 countries to discuss the world's energy transition ahead of the annual UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. "The Irena Council meeting comes at a critical point in time and gives the international community an opportunity to strengthen collaboration and bolster the world's commitment to renewables for climate action ahead of COP27 and COP28," he said. Fitzgerald Cantero, the 24th Council Chair and National Director of Energy of Uruguay, noted that Irena must continue to spearhead the penetration of renewable energy around the world. "The solutions to mitigate energy poverty and the solution to the current energy crisis will come from renewables; and those of us who are already on this path will take further strides in this direction." This year's Council meeting will hold high-level events on pressing energy transition topics including hydrogen, critical materials, agri-food and enabling frameworks for the energy transition in high-risk environments. Council members will also discuss Irena's medium-term strategy among other relevant matters. Despite continuous growth in renewable energy capacity over the past decade, Irena views the pace of change inadequate in limiting rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees. According to the Agency's World Energy Transitions Outlook, a renewables-centred energy transition is the only realistic way to meet the 2030 time-frame for emissions reductions established by the IPCC, as well as the objectives of the 2030 timeline for sustainable development. Tripling investments in renewables will be fundamental for the scale and pace of the energy transition to reach the levels required to achieve Paris Agreement targets. Separately, a new UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report released on Thursday finds that the international community is still falling far short of the Paris goals, with no credible pathway to 1.5 degree in place. "We had our chance to make incremental changes, but that time is over. Only a root-and-branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate disaster," Andersen added. \</doc>

Industry players participate in ADIPEC 2022 to promote next-gen tech roles in helping energy firms meet the trilemma - security, sustainability and affordability The United Nations (UN) has estimated that the world's population will reach approximately 10.4 billion by the 2080s. In parallel, increased urbanisation is seeing more people moving into cities across the globe. As per a report by the World Economic Forum (WEF), the share of the world's population living in cities is expected to rise to 80 per cent by 2050, up from 55 per cent at present. These two factors will contribute significantly to the global demand for energy. A report by S&P Global Commodity Insights said that global energy demand will grow 47 per cent by 2050, with oil continuing to be the top source. The report also said that by 2050 renewables would make up 27 per cent of the global energy mix, which suggests that traditional energy sources will keep the world's cities and businesses turning over in the near and long-term. The S&P report, citing the US Energy Information Administration, also said it expects to see energy-related carbon dioxide emissions continuing to rise through to 2050. This is to the detriment of the ongoing fight against climate change and the goals of the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015. Achieving the agreement's goal calls for countries to peak greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) as soon as possible, to achieve a climate neutral world by mid-century. At present, the energy sector produces the most GHGE globally according to the World Resources Institute; it stated the sector was currently responsible for 75.6 per cent of worldwide GHGEs at 37.6 giga tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions. As a result, energy sector stakeholders are under increasing scrutiny by governments and regulators to reduce their impact on the environment in terms of resources used and the emission of GHGs, while continuing to meet growing demands for energy. In response, many energy sector players have been setting sustainability goals, and are turning to Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies to meet growing customer demand, improve efficiency, optimise processes, curb GHGE and costs. Results thus far are encouraging according to digital transformation and technology enablers. Within the region, FTSE-100 industrial software company - AVEVA worked closely with regional energy major Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to develop its Panorama Digital Command Centre in Abu Dhabi. The solution is said to allow the visualisation of millions of data points through a number of dashboards, which enables ADNOC engineers and executives to boost efficiency by addressing operational issues, prevent failures and downtime, and respond quickly to market changes. &ldquo;ADNOC's Panorama Unified Operations Centre enables savings between $60 to $100 million through optimised operations,&rdquo; says Caspar Herzberg, Chief Operating Officer at AVEVA. Speaking more broadly about the firm's experience in the sector, Evgeny Fedotov, Senior Vice-President and Head of EMEA region at AVEVA, adds: &ldquo;AVEVA's solutions have already enabled 19 of the world's top 20 petroleum companies to embrace digital transformation and realise significant business and environmental benefits. As requirements to remain competitive and deliver value while meeting climate targets pervade the energy sector further, firms must make a conscious decision to begin their digital transformation journeys and take advantage of data and innovative automation tools to evolve and thrive.&rdquo; Commenting on his firm's results in the energy sector, Peter Harding, Founder and CEO of collaborative control software company Kelvin, states: &ldquo;Our customers, like BP, experienced an impact that cut emissions by 74 per cent, cut costs by 22 per cent, and increased production by 20 per cent. Across our customers, we have delivered over $100 million in value and three times ROI. We convert engineering insights into action that deliver decarbonisation objectives through Kelvin co-pilots; it enables engineers to easily scale decarbonisation efforts across their operations. This is how we rapidly get to net zero.&rdquo; Harding and his firm are participating at ADIPEC 2022 to highlight how its Kelvin Carbon Maps and Kelvin co-pilots solutions, can help firms slash carbon emissions and boost efficiency. &ldquo;We plan to accelerate how companies become more sustainable and reach their net zero goals,&rdquo; he states. Discussing the role technology plays in helping energy firms tackle energy security, sustainability and affordability (referred to as the energy trilemma), and how current challenges can be addressed, Herzberg adds: &ldquo;The energy trilemma is extremely complex and will demand collaboration among multiple parties. Organisations need to find the way to decarbonise and increase the energy supply while making it robust and reliable all at the same time.&rdquo; Asked how energy companies should begin their digital journeys, Herzberg recommends companies start with solid fundamentals. &ldquo;Information management systems including engineering, operational and financial data, provide easy access to real time data and capability to convert data into information and insights timelessly and effortlessly. You need to identify the gaps to be able to make improvements. Covestro, a global player in polymers, has reduced specific CO2 emissions by 40 per cent by leveraging AVEVA PI System data in energy management.&rdquo; AVEVA has itself set targets it describes as &lsquo;bold' to achieve net zero across its entire value chain by 2050, so it aligns with the Paris Agreement. As part of this, the firm has returned to ADIPEC to demonstrate the business and sustainability benefits of digital transformation to the energy sector, in line with the event's overarching theme. In addition, the firm is sponsoring the Climate Innovation Zone at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt from 6-18 November. The theme this year is &lsquo;Together for Implementation'. &ldquo;Its aim is to bring public and private sector actors together to create tangible impacts in the real economy, i.e. to help close the implementation gap. AVEVA believes that public-private partnerships are critical to breaking down silos in the development of new low-emission products, as the development of entirely new supply chains require a wider ecosystem approach that allows for the sharing of collective risks. AVEVA joined the First Movers Coalition (FMC) in 2022 to send a powerful market signal on the importance of commercialising zero-carbon technologies more rapidly, making them economically viable in the next seven years.&rdquo; Talking about how the use of technology can be scaled up to achieve net zero in the near term, Herzberg emphasises: &ldquo;Strong relationships across the supply chain are key to beginning the transition to net zero in the energy sector. AVEVA proposes a systemic platform called the Connected Industrial Economy - a data-driven network that connects enterprises along a digital data thread to facilitate exponential and sustainable growth across the entire ecosystem.&rdquo; Herzberg notes that data, which is increasingly referred to as the &lsquo;new oil of the digital economy', is central to delivering this paradigm shift. He continues: &ldquo;When aggregated and transformed into actionable information using machine learning and AI, and that information is shared within companies and with external partners, data helps unlock innovation at scale for all players. If each business along this connected digital thread is sharing data back and forth, the speed at which new products and services can be developed is increased, leading to exponential gains.&rdquo; Kelvin's Harding also advocates for the power of data driving actionable intelligence that can enable energy companies to achieve their goals. He comments: &ldquo;Accurate data is vital to making good decisions. We deliver industrial intelligence by capturing the right data sources and empowering engineers by converting those insights into actions. In doing so, we enable companies to learn how these actions impact their results, which allows them to become more intelligent over time, as they learn from past decisions. All of this is built on accurate data to deliver industrial intelligence.&rdquo; Harding points out that action is needed to achieve net zero goals and that there are two options to address carbon output today: optimise or offset. He remarks: &ldquo;We believe that &lsquo;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure', so we must find ways to optimise our existing systems today, so we don't have the financial burden of offsetting our failures in the future.&rdquo; The potential benefits of technology and digital transformation have seemingly struck a chord with energy sector players. As per a study conducted by cloud enterprise software company IFS, more than three-in-ten (31 per cent) oil, gas and utility organisations worldwide cited tighter integration and collaboration across functions among the top two drivers for the adoption of enterprise software systems, while 30 per cent said better project management, 29 per cent improved asset lifecycle management, and 29 per cent improved operational efficiency were other drivers. IFS is participating at ADIPEC 2022 to showcase how its innovations can help energy companies optimise assets and gain better control of projects. The firm said it polled over 600 senior decision-makers at large energy companies across France, Australia, Japan, the Nordics, USA, the UK, and the Middle East for the research. It added that 44 per cent of organisations with sustainability goals want to invest in more energy-efficient assets and infrastructure to meet those objectives. Its research also found that 57 per cent of oil, gas and utility companies that have digital transformation projects are looking for a composable platform to support their entire journey, while only 38 per cent are going down the niche solution route. The firm pointed out there are still significant barriers to change however; nearly three in ten (29 per cent) companies said the chief barrier to adoption is the inability to accurately measure value from investment during the digital transformation journey. A fifth (20 per cent) also noted it's the biggest barrier to digital transformation overall. Carol Johnston, VP Energy, Utilities and Resources, IFS concludes by saying: &ldquo;Companies in the energy sector are often very risk averse and are frequently dealing with regulators and other stakeholders that demand proof of RoI. The inability to put a quantifiable number on what they will get for spend, and when, is preventing them from progressing. Due to the economic and social pressures the industry is under, simply doing nothing is, in contrast, not an option. The good news is that an ever-growing number of organisations understand this today. "The energy trilemma is extremely complex and will demand collaboration among multiple parties," said Caspar Herzberg, Chief Operating Officer, AVEVA. We believe that &lsquo;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure', so we must find ways to optimise our existing systems today,&rdquo; said Peter Harding, Founder and CEO, Kelvin. Companies in the energy sector are often very risk averse and are frequently dealing with regulators and other stakeholders that demand proof of RoI,&rdquo; said Carol Johnston, V-P Energy, Utilities and Resources, IFS. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 9th November, 2022 (WAM) -- In pursuit of the sustainable growth of the nation and recognition of the co-ordinated actions of the 27th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), the UAE Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) members today issued their second public statement entitled &lsquo;2022 Public Statement on Collaboration on Sustainable Finance in the UAE&rsquo; providing an overview of their ongoing efforts and progress updates on sustainable finance within the UAE. Through the second high-level statement, SFWG members reiterated their commitment towards enabling the UAE&rsquo;s economic transition and encouraging the adoption of sustainable finance at a national level. The members include ministries (the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, the Office of the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change) and, financial regulators (Central Bank of the UAE, Securities and Commodities Authority, Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market, Dubai Financial Services Authority), and UAE exchanges (Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, Dubai Financial Market, and Nasdaq Dubai). Showcasing the expansion of the UAE&rsquo;s international commitments, such as the UAE Green Agenda 2015-2030, the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017- 2050 and the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, the latest statement further indicated the importance of the financial sector in directing private capital towards sustainable projects, businesses and products within the UAE. Subsequently, the 2021 Public Statement, built on the Guiding Principles on Sustainable Finance in the UAE provided a &lsquo;Roadmap&rsquo; through which the required scaling up of sustainable finance in the country could occur. This focused on three interlinked topics, namely, strengthening sustainability disclosure; fostering sustainability-focused corporate governance; and designing the UAE&rsquo;s Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. The progress made in this direction in 2022 includes extensive benchmarking and fact-gathering exercises undertaken by the SFWG members to gain a first-hand understanding of evolving standards and international best practices. In this context, the SFWG met with regulators from other regions and jurisdictions, international organisations, industry standard-setters and consultants with expertise in sustainable finance. Additionally, several publications, such as the International Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s proposals on General Sustainability-related Disclosure Requirements and Climate-related Disclosure Requirements, and the Basel Committee&rsquo;s Principles for the Effective Management and Supervision of Climate-related Financial Risks are being considered by international standard-setters such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions and International Association of Insurance Supervisors. These have notably informed the SFWG&rsquo;s work this year. The SFWG&rsquo;s approach is also being influenced by global policy priorities set by the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. The SFWG was established in 2019 and is co-ordinated by the FSRA of ADGM to support the development of sustainable finance in the UAE and facilitate regulatory co-operation amongst the UAE authorities on practices and frameworks that can enable the finance sector to deliver on this goal. The publishing of the second Public Statement coincides with COP27 &rsquo;s Finance Day, given the international focus on addressing environmental concerns that COP provides. In light of the UAE hosting COP28 next year, the SFWG will continue to progress its work over the coming year and intends to publish more specific outputs in 2023. The members plan to seek feedback from the industry and relevant stakeholders on these proposals. \</doc>

Saudi Arabia defended its decision to lower oil production and said its relationship with the US was strong enough to survive the fallout. "We have had a disagreement with regards to the oil market," Adel Al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia's minister of state for foreign affairs and main climate envoy, said. "We have our position and we believe our position is correct. Some in the US take a different approach, but we'll be able to overcome this." The White House criticised Saudi Arabia after it orchestrated an OPEC+ move last month to cut 2 million barrels a day of oil output. The US said it came at the "worst possible moment" for the global economy given inflationary pressures. President Joe Biden pledged to reassess US military support for the kingdom. "It's a very strong relationship," Al-Jubeir said Saturday at the Saudi Green Initiative during the COP27 Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said on Friday in a separate interview that OPEC+ will remain cautious because of worldwide economic "uncertainties." The alliance is set to meet on Dec. 4 to decide whether to cut production again, keep it steady or reverse course and pump more. Oil has dipped since June as central banks raise interest rates and China maintains its Covid Zero strategy. But Brent is still above $95 a barrel and up 23% this year, with many traders concerned about supply shortages once the European Union effectively bans the importation of Russian crude from next month. "We will continue to work on what's in our best interests," Al-Jubeir said. "There's a lot of alignment of interests between the kingdom and the US." Climate activists wrong about Saudi Arabia, says energy ministerby Staff WriterSat 12 Nov 2022Saudi Arabia pledges $2.5bn to Middle East Green Initiativeby Staff WriterMon 7 Nov 2022Saudi Arabia cuts oil price for Asiaby Staff WriterFri 4 Nov 2022 Al-Jubeir said he would be meeting the US climate envoy, John Kerry, in Sharm el-Sheikh, where COP27 "Saudi Arabia and China have a huge interest at stake," he said. "China is our largest trading partner. We have large investments in China and Chinese companies have large investments in Saudi Arabia." Saudi Arabia defends climate stance Responding to criticism from climate activists that Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, is playing down the need to move away from fossil fuels, Al-Jubeir said there's no contradiction between pumping hydrocarbons and protecting the environment. "We can do both," he said. The kingdom's put "tremendous financial resources" into its climate initiatives, he said. They include planting billions of trees and investing in solar power and hydrogen production.

His Excellency Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change, said the UAE believes that inclusive climate action can accelerate economic growth for all nations. He said climate action is an opportunity to diversify economies and the energy mix creating new growth sectors in clean energy and new jobs for the future. Dr. Sultan was speaking ahead of the UAE's participation at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) being held from November 6 to 18 at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt. He said the UAE will focus on building on its close partnership with Egypt, especially during the 50th Anniversary Year of the UAE-Egypt relations and look forward to bridging the outcomes of COP27 with COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference, to be hosted by the UAE in 2023. UAE to host climate conference next year His Excellency said the priorities for the UAE at COP27 are to engage with the nearly 200 participating nations, understand their aspirations, and contribute to the global dialogue for stronger climate change solutions and implementation. What are the UAE's main objectives at COP27 ? The UAE's primary objective at COP27 is to contribute practical solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate impacts, accelerate low-carbon economic growth and create sustainable economic and social development opportunities across all nations, including the Global South. We aim to highlight the UAE's decades-long track-record of climate diplomacy and creating practical climate solutions especially across developing and vulnerable nations. We also want to build capacity and enhance cooperation ahead of COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference, with the goal of identifying practical, inclusive and ambitious pathways to climate action that will benefit billions of people across the world. His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, has always emphasised that we cannot ignore the realities on the ground. We must face them and not shy away from challenges. His Highness guides us to address these challenges by adopting a positive mindset and by working out solutions with like-minded partners. His Highness always reminds us that pursuing progress is in the DNA of the UAE. Can you explain more about the UAE's decades-long track-record of climate action and how it can benefit the world through its inclusive approach? Our commitment to reducing emissions and promoting climate action is not new. Our founding father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan set the foundations for sustainability to preserve the environment and natural resources several decades ago. We are the first country in the MENA region to adopt and sign the Paris Agreement, and the first to commit to Net Zero by 2050. The UAE is now home to three of the world's largest and lowest-cost solar plants, and we have been the first in MENA to invest in industrial-scale carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS). We have also set new records for the most cost-competitive wind power, in the UAE and internationally. Further, we are the first country in the region to deploy peaceful nuclear power. We are pioneered the exploration of clean alternatives such as green hydrogen. We achieved the lowest methane intensity in the energy sector 20 years before the global pledge calling for a gradual reduction was made. In September this year, the UAE updated its second Nationally Determined Contributions, with the aim to reduce our carbon emissions by nearly a third (31%) by 2030. And we work with all stakeholders globally to advance climate action because we believe that climate change needs pragmatic and inclusive solutions. Today, the UAE is one of the world's largest investors in global renewable energy projects and has invested $50 billion in renewable energy projects in over 70 countries, including 31 island developing-states that are most vulnerable to climate change. We have also committed an additional investment of US$50 billion over the next decade in several countries to accelerate clean energy transition. Most recently, we signed a strategic partnership agreement with the US to accelerate transition , advance shared climate goals and strengthen global energy security. This UAE-US Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) aims to will catalyse US$100 billion in financing and other support in addition to deploying 100 new gigawatts (GW) of clean energy in the US, UAE and emerging economies around the world by 2035. Earlier this year, the UAE launched Etihad 7, an innovation program dedicated to securing funding for renewable energy projects in Africa, with the goal of supplying clean electricity to 100 million people by 2035. We believe that such increased flows of climate finance to vulnerable communities - especially for food, water, and resilience - is also an investment in stability and peace. We have also empowered communities at the grassroots level, through initiatives such as the Zayed Sustainability Prize, and we are nurturing the next generation to prepare them for the jobs of the future through institutions such as the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence. We have set an enhanced target to plant 100 million mangroves by 2030, a program led by Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi, to advance nature-based solutions to address climate change, protect biodiversity, and contribute to natural carbon sinks. We also strongly support the 30\'d730 biodiversity target to protect 30 per cent of sea and 30 per cent of land by 2030, and nature-based solutions to address the interlinked climate and biodiversity crises. Your Excellency, you had recently highlighted the need for the world to maximise energy and minimise emissions. Could you explain this further in the context of UAE's energy transition strategy? Our world is on its way to being home to 9.5 billion people. To meet their needs, we will have to produce 30 per cent more energy than today. If the basic energy needs of the billions of people across the world are not met, economies will slow down significantly, impacting the resources which need to be made available for the energy transition and climate action. While meeting the energy demand through the infrastructure and capital assets that the world currently relies on, we must focus on driving down emissions and accelerating investment in new clean energy systems. We believe that energy transition will not happen at the flip of a switch, but it is attainable if we are pragmatic, practical and commercially focused. We should keep in mind that the solutions the world needs are also major opportunities for the global economy. As we meet those needs, we will be helping to bring electricity to almost 800 million people who don't have it today. We will improve the lives of the 2.6 billion people who have no access to clean cooking and heating fuels. And we will be lifting people from poverty, raising living standards and creating sustainable economic growth. As the Chairman of Masdar, how do you see the role of this renewable energy company in supporting the UAE's strategic Net Zero by 2050 plans as well as the world with proven technologies and investments? When Masdar was launched in 2006, many said the company was ahead of its time. Today, it is seen as the pioneer in advancing clean energy transition and a key enabler of the UAE's vision to be a global leader in sustainability and climate action. We believe access to clean technologies and climate solutions is critical, and we must deploy them at scale, a strategy the UAE has actively pursued for over a decade. With investments in over 40 countries with a combined value of more than $20bn, Masdar's projects generate over 15GW of clean power and displace nearly 19.5 million tonnes annually. Across Africa, Masdar and its partners are empowering local communities, developing over 1 GW of clean energy projects capable of delivering electricity to over 845,000 homes in Egypt, Morocco, Mauritania, and Seychelles. Masdar also manages the Zayed Sustainability Prize, which has, for the past 14 years, positively impacted the lives of over 370 million people around the world. Masdar is also offering knowledge-sharing platforms to stimulate further development in the wider renewable energy, and clean-tech industry. We are further supporting clean energy transition by leveraging the opportunity in hydrogen, which we see as the fuel of the future. Masdar has been exploring hydrogen production for more than a decade and aims to become a global green hydrogen leader supporting Abu Dhabi's ambition to become a global hub for green hydrogen. Masdar has plans to grow its green hydrogen capacity to 1MT by 2030. Earlier this year, the company signed a landmark agreement to develop 4GW-capacity green hydrogen plants in Egypt by 2030. Last year at COP26 Glasgow, the UAE and US joined with several nations to launch the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate and announced $4bn of increased investment to accelerate innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems. What has been the progress of this initiative? AIM for Climate is focused on transforming food systems, building climate resilience in the agricultural sector by promoting investments in innovation that in turn lead to greater food security and climate mitigation benefits. At the same time, the global initiative seeks to protect the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers around the world who are on the frontlines of climate change. The $4bn of increased investments announced by AIM for Climate at COP26 represents commitments to increase investments made by country partners for the period of 2021 to 2025. The UAE has pledged $1bn of increased investments in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation by several government entities. The UAE is situated in an arid, water-scarce region, but innovation and technology have enabled us to turn deserts into farms. A key example is Bustanica, the world's largest vertical farm operated by the Emirates Group, which produces over 1,000 tons of leafy greens every year, and farms in Al Ain that are now producing UAE-grown blueberries and strawberries. You earlier mentioned that the UAE is looking to build capacity and enhance cooperation in preparation for the nation to host COP28 in 2023? Can you explain more? Our priority at COP27 is to work with the Egyptian Presidency and the nearly 200 participating nations to find pragmatic solutions for climate change. As we prepare to host COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference next year, it is important to understand the priorities of all the nations, and that is one of our key tasks into the next year. COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference, marks the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake - a progress report of how the world has performed based on their pledges which led to the COP21 Paris Agreement in 2015. This is an important outcome for COP28 and a critical milestone as we move towards making COP28 an inclusive, and solutions-oriented climate summit. This approach will focus on youth and women empowerment, accelerating climate finance, enhancing advanced technology access and deploying them at scale, and supporting indigenous and vulnerable communities. We believe that by working together for climate action, the world can unlock vast economic growth opportunities. This is the long-held view of the UAE, and we are guided by the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to continue to explore new opportunities for a decarbonised world. UAE President Sheikh Mohamed will the attend UN climate change conference.

UAE energy major Masdar and Infinity, Egypt's leading renewable energy developer, will join hands to develop a 10-gigawatt (GW) onshore wind project in Egypt - one of the largest wind farms in the world. When completed, the 10 GW wind farm will produce 47,790 GWh of clean energy annually and offset 23.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions - equivalent to around 9 percent of Egypt's current CO2 emissions. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the joint venture wind project was signed by Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE minister of industry and advanced technology, and chairman of Masdar, and Dr. Mohamed Shaker El-Markabi, Egypt's minister of electricity and renewable energy, on Tuesday. UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi, were present at the MoU signing ceremony, held on the sidelines of the on-going COP27 meet in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The project will be part of Egypt's Green Corridor initiative - a grid dedicated to renewable energy projects - and will contribute to Egypt's goal of ensuring renewable energy makes up 42 percent of its energy mix by 2035. The wind farm will also save Egypt an estimated $5 billion in annual natural gas costs, and help create as many as 100,000 jobs. Direct employment in the construction phase is estimated at around 30,000, with as many as 70,000 people being employed indirectly. Dr. Al Jaber said the scale of this mega 10 GW onshore wind project was a testament to the renewable energy ambitions of the UAE and Egypt, and demonstrated Masdar's status as a global leader in clean energy. COP27 In April, Masdar and Hassan Allam Utilities signed two MoUs with Egyptian state-owned organisations to cooperate on the development of 4 GW green hydrogen production plants in the Suez Canal Economic Zone and on the Mediterranean coast. In the first phase of the project, a green hydrogen manufacturing facility will be developed and operational by 2026, able to produce 100,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually for bunkering in the Suez Canal. The electrolyzer facilities could be extended to up to 4 GW by 2030 to produce 2.3 million tonnes of green ammonia for export as well as supply green hydrogen for local industries. Egypt enjoys abundant solar and wind resources that allow for renewable-power generation at a highly competitive cost - a key enabler for green hydrogen production. It is also located near markets where the demand for green hydrogen is expected to grow the most, providing robust opportunities for export. Active in more than 40 countries across the world, Masdar is invested in a portfolio of renewable energy assets with a combined value of more than $20 billion and a total capacity of more than 15 GW.

This prestigious award, in partnership with the Genius 100 Foundation honors outstanding purpose-driven creative work that inspires action to create impact. Entries submitted into the Genius 100 category were judged by a panel of Genius 100 Visionaries selected from an impressive cross-section of fields of 100 globally recognized, accomplished and compassionate minds. This year's Genius 100 Executive Jury included the late Genius 100 Global Ambassador and Inspiration Award Chairman, James Caan, Jose Miguel Sokoloff, Sima Simar, and Don Tapscott. "NYF is proud to partner with the Genius 100 Foundation to honor work that engages and inspires others to take action and influence our world in a beneficial manner," said Scott Rose, Executive Director, New York Festivals Advertising Awards. "We are honored to partner with New York Festivals Advertising Awards to present the G100 "Work of Genius" Inspiration Award. We (G100) are "Inspired by Einstein", and this very special award celebrates truly inspired, imaginative work which demands attention and fosters undeniable and significant impact," said Hilarie Viener, Chief Executive Officer, Genius 100 Foundation US. "Now more than ever, we must recognize how much we can gain from embracing creativity to influence positive change." "We are deeply honored to win this highly prestigious award. The Genius 100 Inspiration Award is not only about purpose-driven creative work but also about impact to inspire people to act. To have 14 orchestras around the world playing their local version of The [Uncertain] Four Seasons is truly remarkable and outstanding. And we are so happy that more orchestras still join our beloved project with more performances taking place right now and in the near future." Joachim Kortlepel, Executive Creative Director, Jung von Matt AG, Germany The Genius 100 Inspiration Award winner for 2022 "The [uncertain] Four Season" was created by Jung von Matt AG via a partnership between the UN Act Now, digital design agency AKQA, musicians and scientists from around the world, composer Huge Crosthwaite and Monash University's Climate Change Communication Research Hub. The award-winning campaign combined music theory and a climate algorithm to generate variations of Vivaldi's Four Season's composition that represent the dramatic environmental climate changes affecting each season. The algorithm altered the music score to account for predicted changes in rainfall, biodiversity, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events as laid out in the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports. The composition variations portrayed a future where the world failed to act decisively on global warming. "For us the challenge and the struggle when talking about climate change is how we translate data into the lived experience. We believe that we need to humanize climate science and climate data so that we can connect more with people. The [Uncertain] Four Seasons is our emotional attempt to show climate data in a new way that people will not only understand but feel. After all, we've seen all the climate crisis pictures, watched all the climate documentaries and seen all the data science graphs \- our hope is that by reflecting the risks of climate change in music - as the one universal language everybody speaks - we can help people experience what a radically new aesthetic and lived experience might feel like. Finally, we wanted to offer something that local communities could collectively rally around, discuss, and take direct action through their leaders or the UN's ActNow platform," said Joachim Kortlepel. "The [uncertain] Four Seasons" campaign's goal was to place pressure on world leaders to act decisively at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP26 that took place in November 2021. At the start of Youth and Public Empowerment Day at COP26 on November 5, 2021, "The [uncertain] Four Seasons" released the performances of 14 orchestras from across 6 continents \- half of which are youth orchestras. The performances elevated the voices of young people in the ongoing movement for climate action and placed and continues to place further pressure on world leaders to sign the Leaders Pledge for Nature and commit to reversing biodiversity loss by 2030. The Genius 100 Foundation brings together visionaries, philanthropic impact investors and its extended global community, collectively and in collaboration, to: re-imagine the future and implement creative initiatives to improve our world.

NEW YORK, 8th October, 2022 (WAM) -- The people of Pakistan are the victims of "a grim calculus of climate injustice", Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres told the UN General Assembly on Friday, reminding that while the country was responsible for less than one percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is paying a "supersized price for man-made climate change". During a full session of the UN's most representative body on the country's devastating floods, he recalled last month's visit where he saw "a level of climate carnage beyond imagination". He described floodwaters covering a landmass three times the total area of his own country, Portugal, saying that many lost their homes, livestock, crops and "their futures". "Lives were washed away", he spelled out. Worse to come While the rains have ceased and water is beginning to recede, many areas in the south remain inundated and, with winter approaching, the situation is going from bad to worse. "Pakistan is on the verge of a public health disaster", warned the top UN official, pointing to threats of cholera, malaria and dengue fever claiming "far more lives than the floods". He painted a picture of nearly 1,500 devastated health facilities, two million damaged or destroyed homes and more than two million families without their possessions. "Many have no shelter as winter approaches," he noted. Cascading calamities At the same time, the scale of crop and livestock destruction is "creating a food crisis today and putting the planting season in jeopardy tomorrow", continued Guterres. "Severe hunger is spiking. Malnutrition among children and pregnant lactating women is rising. The number of children out of school is growing. Heartache and hardship - especially for women and girls - is mounting," he elaborated. Moreover, more than 15 million people could be pushed into poverty. The effects of the floods will be felt not just for days or months but will linger in Pakistan for years to come. Massive support needed Working with the Pakistan Government to convene a pledging conference to provide rehabilitation and reconstruction support, the UN chief urged donor countries, international organisations, the private sector and civil society to fully support these efforts. Meanwhile, the Organisation launched the Pakistan Floods Response Plan calling for US$816 million - a surge of US$656 million from the initial appeal - to respond to the most urgent needs through next May. "But this pales in comparison to what is needed on every front - including food, water, sanitation...and health support," said the Secretary-General. G20's 'Moral responsibility' As the calendar moves quickly to next UN climate conference ( COP27 ) in November, he said, "the world is moving backwards [as] greenhouse gas emissions are rising along with climate calamities." The UN chief stressed that COP 27 must be the place where these trends are reversed, serious action on loss and damage taken, and vital funding found for adaptation and resilience. Reminding that the G20 leading industrialised nations drive 80 percent of climate-destroying emissions, he called it their "moral responsibility" to help Pakistan recover, adapt and build resilience to disasters "supercharged by the climate crisis". Young boys and a man using crutches pass through the flooded streets of Nowshera Kalan, one of the worst affected area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. 'We must act now' Noting that a third of Pakistan had been deluged, Guterres said that many island States face "the very real prospect of their entire homeland going under". "Communities everywhere are looking down the barrel of climate-driven destruction," he said. "We must act - and we must act now". While this time it was Pakistan, the Secretary-General warned that tomorrow, "it could be any of our countries and our communities". "Climate chaos is knocking on everyone's door, right now," he concluded. "This global crisis demands global solidarity and a global response." 'Litmus test of solidarity' General Assembly President Csaba K r&ouml;si, underscored the importance of time, as "the price we are paying for delays rises each day". He said that today, the world faced a "litmus test of solidarity" in how Member States react to Pakistan's plight. "This is a tragedy of epic proportions" that requires "immediate interventions," to prevent a "permanent emergency". Rebuilding together The Assembly President highlighted the need to be better prepared as droughts and rains return. More than ever, international relief efforts must focus on transformative solutions, he said. "Adaptation and resilience are the seeds of sustainability." K r&ouml;si urged the ambassadors to "make use of science and solidarity...to enhance our crisis management capacities...[to] rebuild together". Appealing for help Meanwhile, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, is urgently seeking to help more than 650,000 refugees and members of their host communities affected by Pakistan's calamitous flooding. Noting that the scale of devastation is "hard to comprehend," spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh told a press briefing in Geneva on Friday that as Pakistan faces "a colossal challenge" to respond to the climate disaster, more support is need "for the country and its people, who have generously hosted Afghan refugees for over four decades". He reported on the latest estimates of the unprecedented rainfall and flooding, recorded at least 1,700 deaths; 12,800 injured, including at least 4,000 children; some 7.9 million displacements; and nearly 600,000 living in relief sites. On 'the frontlines' "Pakistan is on the frontlines of the climate emergency," said Saltmarsh. UNHCR seeks additional funds to address immediate needs and assist in early recovery processes. "It could take months for floodwaters to recede in the hardest-hit areas, as fears rise over threats of waterborne diseases and the safety of millions of affected people, 70 percent of whom are women and children," he said, reminding that "environmental sustainability will remain central to the response." \</doc>

By Belal Nawar World Environmental Health Day is observed on Sept. 26 to raise public awareness of various environmental health-related issues. Since the inaugural Environmental Health Youth Summit and conference of the International Federation of Environmental Health (IFEH) in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia, in 2011, the day has been observed annually. The Middle East, and especially Egypt, have been working hard with organizations that are essential for the journey for a healthier environment. VeryNile VeryNile works to create environmentally sound ways to clean the Nile, recycle and up-cycle solid waste in collaboration with regional stakeholders, and take preventive measures to lessen the use of single-use plastics and water contamination. It was founded as the first effort to provide extensive cleaning techniques for the Nile while promoting the value of environmental preservation. Through a sustainable, effective system that enables ongoing and efficient cleaning of the Nile, they plan cleanup events and promote methods to remove trash from the river. Banlastic Egypt Since 2018, Alexandria-based Banlastic Egypt has worked to combat the issue of plastic pollution. By providing alternatives to single-use plastic and building a client base of informed consumers through the delivery of workshops, training, beach clean-ups, and various environmental events, they seek to outlaw single-use plastic in Egypt. They also make an effort to get in touch with decision-makers to support the laws' efforts to outlaw plastic. This campaign was primarily undertaken in reaction to the plastic pollution that has taken over the waters in our nation. YouThinkGreen Using a skilled team of professionals, YouThinkGreen is a non-profit social enterprise that has been operating in Egypt since 2013. Through the creation of top-notch hands-on and empowerment programs for youth, it aims to educate and empower young people to use sustainable ecological solutions to address Egypt's most serious sustainability concerns and issues. They want young people to drive and take the lead in Egypt's sustainable development by using creative local solutions. Greenish Using engaging educational programs, environmental assessment services, and support for regional communities at risk from climate change, the Greenish Foundation in Egypt seeks to achieve sustainable development. With the help of simple measures that everyone can take, Greenish seeks to address the issue at its source rather than simply taking plastic and recycling it at a facility. The organization has adopted a number of measures to address plastic waste with the goal of eventually fully eliminating it. One of these measures is promoting the reuse and decrease of plastics rather than recycling them. This entails removing plastic from the source and replacing it with sources that are more environmentally friendly. Read More: The Blue House Restoration: A Recapturing Of Beirut's Rich... Thalassains Thalassains is an organization dedicated to protecting the Red Sea and working to build a sustainable future for Egypt. The organization's goals are to give the people more authority and use commerce to create a sustainable future for everybody. A sustainable coastal and marine ecosystem near the Red Sea is eventually the aim. While the Thalassa crew can salvage plastic that is already polluting the Red Sea, the organization's aim is to provide locals and visitors with the tools they need to assist them in 'Guarding The Sea'. Eco Egypt Eco Egypt seeks to reacquaint adventurous visitors with Egypt's myriad natural landmarks and protected regions. The Eco Egypt Experiences campaign highlights all the animal, and plant diversity, and natural landscapes that Egypt has to offer in order to encourage ecological protection and natural rediscovery. Additionally, the campaign promotes sustainable, responsible travel for tourists looking for uncommon experiences. The organization promotes support for local livelihoods by offering a platform for the distinctive habits, practices, and traditions of local communities. These tribespeople ranges from Nubians to Bedouins, and their perspectives, experiences, and customs are central to the organization. The Egyptian government is also preparing for the 27th session of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry reviewed Egypt's 2030 Vision on the 5th of Sept. for the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference 'Conference of the Parties'( COP27 ). This came during Shoukry's meeting with the President of the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP) of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Alain Richard Donwahi according to the State Information Service. The foreign minister also looked into ways to strengthen international efforts connected to combating climate change at all levels, notably the processes for adaptation and mitigation as well as for putting climate commitments into action and making them a reality on the ground. Hopefully, what COP27 aims to do is to accelerate global climate action through emissions reduction, scaled-up adaptation efforts, and enhanced flows of appropriate finance.

By Belal Nawar In order to diversify its energy supply and assure its stability, the Egyptian government created an integrated and sustainable policy back in 2019. The "2035 Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy" seeks to increase the amount of electricity produced from renewable sources to 20 percent by 2022 and 42 percent by 2035, with wind power contributing 14 percent, hydropower 2 percent, and solar energy 25 percent by that year. Therefore, the Egyptian government will, according to Daily News, announce a tender for the construction of a solar power plant at the Sharm El-Sheikh Museum on Aug. 15. According to sources, contracts for the project will be given within a week with the intention of beginning operations by November, when Sharm El-Sheikh will host the climate summit ( COP27 ). The new solar power plant will be able to produce 280 kilowatts. In the meantime, several resorts and tourist destinations rush against the clock to put in solar panels so Sharm El-Sheikh may become a green city in time for the impending climate summit. Sharm El-Sheikh Museum One of the first antiquities museums to be constructed in the Sinai Peninsula is the Sharm El-Sheikh Museum. Although the idea for this museum in a vacation town was first developed in 2006, the building process wasn't completed until late 2020, when the museum finally opened to the public. Read More: The Past Predicting The Future: 5 Inventions That Showed Up In Movies... While focusing specifically on ancient Egyptian civilization, the museum's exhibition scenario broadly reflects the various facets of human civilization and culture. This is accomplished by the careful selection of historical items from the museum's storage areas. Ancient Egyptian teachings were versed in science, mathematics, industry, crafts, family life, and intense affection for animals this is shown in the museum's Grand Hall, which exhibits a history of people and wildlife in ancient Egypt. More projects to come The South Sinai governorate announced plans to build three more solar power plants, two garages for electric public transportation buses, and rapid charging stations for electric vehicles back in May 2022. The country's goal is to create a new Sharm El-Sheikh that will be entirely free of single-use plastic bags, according to prior announcements by Yasmine Fouad, Minister of the Environment and COP27 Ministerial Envoy and Coordinator. This move is in line with numerous other initiatives to make Sharm El-Sheikh a green city. In addition to reducing plastic consumption, Fouad noted that the city is also implementing a number of additional policies and green initiatives in the areas of waste management, electric transportation, green tourism in hotels and dive shops, and renewable energy use. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, 7th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Renewables are the backbone of the energy transition and a viable climate solution. Yet out of the 183 parties to the Paris Agreement with renewable energy components in their Nationally Determined Commitments (NDCs), only 143 have quantified targets with the vast majority focusing on the power sector. Only 12 countries had committed to a percentage of renewables in their overall energy mixes. Renewable Energy Targets in 2022: A guide to design, released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) at the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 , assesses the level of renewable energy ambition in national climate pledges and benchmarks targets against the global climate goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5&deg;C. It clearly shows the collective level of energy transition ambition to date is not enough despite the Glasgow Climate Pact to upgrade 2030 targets in national pledges. IRENA's Director-General Francesco La Camera said, "At a time when we desperately need to see rapid implementation, I call on world leaders to urgently close the renewable deployment gap in pursuit of resilience, energy security and inclusive economies. IRENA's report is a warning to the international community telling them that renewables offer a readily achievable climate solution but require immediate action. Climate pledges must enhance ambition to unlock the full and untapped potential of renewables." "There is a need for real urgency. Despite some progress, the energy transition is far from being on track," he added. "Any near-term shortfall in action will further reduce the chance of keeping 1.5&deg;C within reach. Under the COP27 slogan &lsquo;Together for implementation' we must move from promises to concrete solutions to benefit people and communities on the ground." IRENA's World Energy Transitions Outlook sees half of the energy consumed in 2050 coming from electricity. 90 per cent of all decarbonisation will involve renewable energy through direct supply of low-cost power, efficiency, electrification, sustainable bioenergy and green hydrogen. However, achieving the 2050 climate target will depend on sufficient action by 2030. IRENA's new analysis finds that by 2030, countries are targeting to reach 5.4 terawatts (TW) of installed renewable power capacity. This would only be half of the 10.8 TW of installed capacity needed according to IRENA's 1.5&deg;C Scenario. To achieve net zero, the targeted renewable power capacity by 2030 would have to double compared to the level of ambition in current targets. This is readily achievable today as current renewable power targets lag recent deployment levels, IRENA's report finds. To achieve current targets by 2030, countries would need to add 2.3 TW of capacity, equivalent to average yearly additions of 259 gigawatts (GW) in the next nine years. This is below the actual installed capacity added in the past two years: in 2020 and 2021, despite the complications that resulted from the pandemic and consequent supply chain disruptions, the world added almost 261 GW each year. Furthermore, renewable power targeted by 2030 remains concentrated in a few regions globally. Asia makes up half of the global targeted capacity, followed by Europe and North America. In comparison, the Middle East and North Africa account for just 3 per cent of global deployment targets for 2030, despite the region's high potential. And Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for just over 2 per cent of total global for 2030. The countries targeting the highest level of deployment are all part of the G20, making up almost 90 per cent of the global aggregated target. Although they make up a small share of past renewable deployment, aggregated targets by least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS) would double their current renewable capacity. \</doc>

CAIRO, Egypt: Ayman Soliman, CEO of Egypt's Sovereign Fund, said as part of the first $3 billion phase of a renewable energy program, the country plans to award contracts next year to build 21 water desalination plants nationwide. In an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference, Soliman said that Egypt, which recently hosted COP27 and is trying to attract investment in renewables, also aims to start production at a series of proposed green hydrogen projects in 2025-2026. The first phase of the desalination program aims to generate 3.3 million cubic meters of water per day, eventually reaching 8.8 million cubic meters daily at a cost of $8 billion. Soliman noted that the first phase of the program has attracted the interest from more than 200 developers from 35 countries. The Sovereign Fund, which was established in 2018 to attract private investment in state-owned assets through partnerships and co-investments, is currently focused on getting private consortia to develop brownfield infrastructure, and private equity to develop state-owned enterprises ahead of public listings. A state ownership policy will help to map out which parts of the economy are open to private investment, and serve as the government's "economic constitution" going forward, Soliman said. "We as a fund are very sharply focused on trying to find those champions to scale up, be it in agriculture be it in tourism, be it in infrastructure, or be it in banking financial services," he added. \</doc>

Road transport accounts for more than 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) declarations and action plans called for a new normal by 2030 of making zero emissions vehicles "accessible, affordable and sustainable" globally. GCC countries, in particular Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar have invested heavily in their transport networks in the past decade, but there can be no denying that for internal travel, all countries are still heavily reliant on fossil fuel-based car ownership and use, as well as road-based freight. Among other reasons, this is due to the rapid growth of cities and communities that have been designed around the car. To help the region achieve its Net Zero targets, the SNC-Lavalin Group, including Atkins and Faithful+Gould, have published the 'Engineering Net Zero in the GCC' report that highlights challenges, opportunities, and recommendations to decarbonize the built environment, energy, and transport sectors. Public transport Dubai's metro opened in 2009, Doha's in 2019 and Riyadh's will begin operating shortly. In addition, buses have seen improvements in scale and quality in recent years and may become more important for short distance journeys, supported by walking, cycling and micromobility. In terms of rail, Saudi Arabia has the most extensive rail network in the GCC, offering freight and passenger services across three lines. The longest at 2,800km is the Northern Train Network, running from Riyadh to Jordan. Within the UAE, the Etihad Rail element of the GCC network will stretch across 1,200km and run to the borders of Saudi Arabia and Oman. Once construction has been completed, the GCC Rail Network will connect major cities across all six GCC countries and taking a large number of heavy goods vehicles off the roads. More public transport is needed to meet decarbonisation plans within the various Net Zero national strategies. Significant investment is required to extend current lines, routes and interconnections that allow for longer journeys and residential communities need to be better served if car use and ownership is to be reduced. First and last mile connectivity must also be improved to make it easier to access the public transport network. Plans for national passenger and freight rail need to be extended, whether conventional, high-speed or new technologies such as Hyperloop or Maglev; as long as they are electrified, and that power comes from clean energy sources. Electric and hydrogen vehicles Many GCC communities have developed or expanded around road infrastructure. Getting people to shift en-masse to public transport would be a significant task that is unlikely to be appropriate within the region, at least in the short term. If people will not abandon their cars, then the region needs a policy of electrification, be that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) or hydrogen Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs). Electric Vehicles (EVs) use is increasing. In May 2021, 3,100 EVs and 9,300 hybrid cars were registered in Dubai alone and the UAE wants 42,000 EVs on its roads by 2030. Dubai's commitment to electric cars has gained momentum through the recent opening of a EV manufacturing facility in Dubai Industrial City with manufacturing capacity of 10,000 cars annually and the government agencies having converted 20% of automobile fleet to EVs. 3% of car sales in Saudi Arabia were for hybrid and EVs in 2020, and the government has stated that by 2030, 30% of cars in Riyadh will be electric. However, adoption of EVs alone will not decarbonise the region's transport infrastructure. They take the same space as petrol and diesel cars and must be able to cope with the region's high summer temperatures when car users are reliant on battery-draining air conditioning to cool their vehicles. To meaningfully decarbonise transport, charging points must be expanded and powered by renewable energy sources. This again, proves the critical link between energy and transportation. Aviation Around the Gulf, airports are being built, expanded or upgraded to attract more passengers or freight business. Dubai remains the busiest international airport in the world, having successfully built a world-leading aviation hub and air fleet in the past decade. In 2019, it had more than 85m passengers through the airport and handled around 2.5m tonnes of freight. These major aviation hubs add pressure to government Net Zero strategies, as aviation levels return to pre-pandemic levels. For instance, Dubai's 2021 passenger numbers were 29m, although freight was in line with previous years, at 2.3m tonnes. For 2022, Dubai estimates it will have 55m people travel through its airport. Due to the complexity of the aviation sector, it will likely decarbonise later than other transport modes. Regulatory and policy frameworks at global and regional levels need to be established to drive the development of sustainable aviation fuels (including hydrogen), and this will require collaboration across the whole sector. Key to minimising the carbon footprint for airports is to focus firstly on greater energy efficiency within buildings, followed by usage of low carbon/Net Zero energy. Through smart building technologies, airport operators can manage demand and optimise technical infrastructure to drive savings in energy usage. Decarbonising airport vehicle fleets, as well as making staff commuting and passenger access trips more sustainable, are other areas to be tackled. In conclusion, changing long-held behavior towards land-based mobility will be challenging, and require a combination of awareness and policies. An appropriate future approach that can be taken is that of Avoid, Shift and Improve, which offers a useful way forward for key public agencies and private sector stakeholders to integrate planning and action across the value chain. The first two options focus on behavioral change \- getting people to think differently about how they travel or access transport services. A broader perspective is required that ensures the long-term planning of a functional, integrated transport strategy, including balancing supply-based approaches with the management of demand, as well as user attitudes and behavior.

ABU DHABI, 27th October, 2022 (WAM) -- A local newspaper has commended the relationship between the UAE and Egypt, saying that "few relationships in the Middle East are as strong as that between Egypt and the UAE". This week, the two countries are celebrating 50 years of ties, and a three-day festival is being held in Cairo to mark the occasion. "The relationship is unique and builds not only on brotherly ties, but the understanding of the current situation of the MENA region and the world," said Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah El Sisi, in an address to officials from both countries gathered in Cairo on Tuesday. In an editorial on Thursday, The National said, "A shared understanding of regional issues has been at the core of bilateral relations. Egypt and the UAE have worked together strongly in the interests of regional security, including by deepening their defence relationship. They run regular military exercises together, such as last year's 'Zayed 3' exercise and another this year that also included Special Forces from Saudi Arabia, Greece and Cyprus. "In a region fraught with long-standing political and security issues, such exercises have reinforced the role that powerful allies such as the UAE and Egypt play in ensuring stability and laying the groundwork for greater prosperity." One way in which such prosperity grows is through more intimate links at the societal level. On this front, the UAE and Egypt's relationship goes back generations, even before the UAE's formation 50 years ago. In his address, President El Sisi noted that the foundations for Egyptian-Emirati ties were laid by the UAE's Founding Father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. It is a bond of which Egyptians living in the UAE are well aware. The country, one Egyptian professor at Zayed University told The National, "is a large part of my soul". Thousands of Egyptians who call the Emirates home undoubtedly feel similarly, taking advantage of a shared language and culture to put down roots and build new lives for their families. The sentiments also go the other way. "The economic and trade relations between Egypt and the UAE are a model for Arab and regional relations," said Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of State for Foreign Trade. That model, moreover, has borne fruits that benefit wider Egyptian society. The UAE is the number-one foreign direct investor in the Egyptian economy, and last year bilateral trade reached $7.5 billion. The paper continued, "Now, as Egypt gears up to host the Cop27 climate summit, the two countries will face challenges together that go beyond security and the economy. As neighbours in one of the world's most arid regions, the UAE and Egypt will be at the forefront of efforts to safeguard the Middle East's environment in the coming decades, sharing the expertise and technology required to ensure a sustainable future for the region. "The conversation on the Middle East's environmental future will receive a boost at Cop27 in Sharm El Sheikh, and it will continue as the summit moves to the UAE next year. The two are working together to ensure global implementation of climate pledges." "In this respect, Egyptians and Emiratis can be assured their countries are already in lock-step," concluded the Abu Dhabi-based daily. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 18th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) hosted the first in-person ADGM EU-MENA Regulators Summit during Abu Dhabi Finance Week, bringing together representatives from the MENA region, the European Union, and the USA. The closed session allowed regulators to discuss two themes that dominate Abu Dhabi Finance Week: the international agenda on sustainable finance and the regulation of digital assets. The overarching objective of the event was to strengthen partnerships and increase cooperation in regulating financial services with countries across the MENA region and the European Union. Collaboration at a global level contributes to supporting consistent international standards and addressing regulatory gaps across jurisdictions that can lead to harm financial markets and investors. The first session, which focused more specifically on new technologies and digitalisation, confirmed that cooperation and partnerships are paramount. The emergence of digital assets, in their multitude of use cases from payments to investment, can generate significant efficiencies and value but also confronts regulators with shared new risks and challenges. The second session on sustainable finance at the COP27 Summit showed that financial regulators have a strategic role in providing internationally consistent regulatory frameworks, particularly on disclosure and taxonomy, facilitating the transition required to meet the 2050 Net Zero targets. It was also discussed how regulators can support the journey to reach these targets, while potentially adopting different transition paths reflecting the specificities of the respective economies. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 10th November, 2022 (WAM) - Today at COP27 , leading global experts from the natural and social sciences presented ten essential insights on climate change since 2021. Convened by the international networks Future Earth, The Earth League, World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), scientists from around the world released the annual 10 New Insights in Climate Science report with UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell. The 10 New Insights in Climate Science presents key insights from the latest climate change-related research this year and responds to clear calls for policy guidance during this climate-critical decade. The authors emphasise and unpack the complex interactions between climate change and other drivers of risk, such as conflicts, pandemics, food crises and underlying development challenges in the report. The scientific synthesis report identifies that the potential to adapt to climate change is not limitless. Rising sea levels capable of submerging coastal communities and extreme heat intolerable to the human body, are examples of 'hard' limits to our ability to adapt. It also highlights that over 3 billion people will inhabit 'vulnerability hotspots' -- areas with the highest susceptibility to being adversely affected by climate-driven hazards by 2050, double what it is today. The report further outlines that persistent dependence on fossil fuels exacerbates major vulnerabilities, notably for energy and food security, and that deep and swift mitigation to tackle the drivers of climate change is immediately necessary to avert and minimise future loss and damage. "People and ecosystems in different places across the world are already confronted with enormous impacts, and if the planet warms beyond 1.5/2\'b0C, more widespread breaching of adaptation limits can be expected. Adaptation efforts cannot substitute for ambitious mitigation," says said Prof. Mercedes Bustamente, Department of Ecology, University of Brasilia, Brazil. "The latest science confirms the rising social costs of severe climate extremes and the urgent need to deviate away from risks of going beyond limits to adaptation and crossing irreversible tipping points. As science advances, we have more evidence of massive costs, risks but also global benefits of reduced loss and damage, through an orderly safe landing of the world within the Paris climate range. To succeed requires global collaboration and speed at an unprecedented scale," says Prof. Johan Rockstr\'f6m, co-chair of the Earth League, the Earth Commission and Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. "Decision makers must recognise the interconnectedness of biophysical-social challenges, and that the most impactful responses are not siloed. Substantially shifting the allocation of capital and land use towards meaningful mitigation, enacting robust and coordinated global policy responses for adaptation, loss and damage, as well as deconstructing the barriers to just climate action are some of the approaches identified within the report to accelerate reaching Paris Agreement Goals," says Prof. Chukwumerije Okereke, Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Nigeria. In 2022, the 10 New Insights in Climate Science covers crucial topics that are key focus areas for negotiators at COP27 , from adaptation and mitigation, to the intersections of climate and food systems, security, and finance: 1. Questioning the myth of endless adaptation 2. Vulnerability hotspots cluster in 'regions at risk' 3. New threats on the horizon from climate-health interactions 4. Climate mobility: From evidence to anticipatory action 5. Human security requires climate security 6. Sustainable land use is essential to meeting climate targets 7. Private sustainable finance practices are failing to catalyse deep transitions 8. Loss and Damage: The urgent planetary imperative 9. Inclusive decision-making for climate-resilient development 10. Breaking down structural barriers and unsustainable lock-ins. "We need an urgent, global and coordinated response to reverse the growth of greenhouse gas emissions to secure a safe and just future for humankind. In a year of compounding crises, including geopolitical instability, extreme weather events, and reverberations from the pandemic, 10 New Insights in Climate Science delivers essential research findings to inform decisions," says Wendy Broadgate, Global Hub Director (Sweden), Future Earth. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt: During this week's COP27 climate summit in Egypt, Israel and Jordan signed a memorandum of understanding to activate a water-for-energy agreement, after an initial assessment of the project found it to be feasible. Under the MOU, Jordan will build 600 megawatts of solar power capacity to be exported to Israel, which will, in return, provide the water-scarce Arab country with 200 million cubic meters of desalinated water. The memo was signed at an event hosted by the UAE, which became the first Gulf state to normalize relations with Israel in 2020 and is a partner in the project. A statement on Emirati state news agency WAM said that the agreement, entitled, "Project Prosperity," was signed in the presence of UAE climate envoy and industry minister Sultan al-Jaber and U.S. special envoy for climate John Kerry. Teams representing each country met regularly over the past year to assess the project's financial, planning and regulatory feasibility, said Israel's Energy Ministry. The signing of the memo "expresses the countries' shared desire to deal with the climate crisis through cross-border cooperation," the ministry added. In a statement, the UAE said that together with Jordan and Israel, all sides will continue jointly drafting the necessary implementation plans for the project in time for COP28, which is to be held in the UAE next November. \</doc>

The funding for a green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia's megaproject NEOM, is set to be completed in the upcoming months, according to ACWA Power Co., Bloomberg reported. The project, valued at $5 billion, has begun construction in the north-west of the kingdom, and is "very much on track" to be finished by 2026, ACWA's chief executive officer Paddy Padmanathan told Bloomberg. COP27 climate summit in Egypt. "We are almost done." ACWA, which is the kingdom's biggest renewable energy firm, is a member of the consortium leading the green hydrogen project. US-based Air Products & Chemicals Inc is also involved in the project. The equity partners have put in about $900 million of their own money, Padmanathan said. "Saudi Arabia wants to be the world's main exporter of hydrogen. The fuel only emits water vapor when burned, making it less polluting than oil, natural gas and coal. The technology for producing it on a mass scale is still unproven, but the market could be worth $700 billion annually by 2050 if manufacturers can bring down costs," according to BloombergNEF.

Mita SrinivasanConnect With Me10x IndustryPublished: 11 Nov 2022The planned investment of billions of (UAE) dirhams in clean energy infrastructure will be transformative in helping the transition to a low carbon economy with positive environmental and social outcomes. EAD will work with 26 Abu Dhabi entities as members of &lsquo;The Abu Dhabi Climate Change Taskforce&rsquo;, to develop climate change policy and related strategic plans to achieve this transformation. The Environment Agency &ndash; Abu Dhabi (EAD) and Department of Energy (DoE), are leading a fundamental shift in Abu Dhabi's energy mix to achieve significantly lower carbon emissions in the Emirate. This will be achieved through new regulations aimed at generating a large proportion of Abu Dhabi&rsquo;s electricity from clean and renewable sources by 2035, marking a significant milestone in the UAE&rsquo;s journey to deliver carbon neutrality by 2050. The new regulations, drafted by the DoE, will see 60 percent of the Emirate&rsquo;s electricity being generated from clean and renewable sources by 2035, and up to 75 percent reduction in carbon emissions per MWh produced by the electricity sector. The DoE&rsquo;s &lsquo;Clean Energy Strategic Target 2035 for Electricity Production in Abu Dhabi&rsquo; regulatory framework is the first legally binding clean and renewable energy target in the Middle East for the electricity sector. It forms part of an ongoing energy transition to accelerate the UAE&rsquo;s decarbonisation and green growth efforts. At the United Nation&rsquo;s annual climate summit, COP27 , in Egypt, Her Excellency Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary General of EAD, said the new regulations would promote economic diversification, attract domestic and foreign investment, and encourage technology development and innovations in the clean and renewable energy space. &ldquo;The planned investment of billions of (UAE) dirhams in clean energy infrastructure will be transformative in helping us transition to a low carbon economy with positive environmental and social outcomes. We are working closely with 26 Abu Dhabi entities, including the Department of Energy, as members of &lsquo;The Abu Dhabi Climate Change Taskforce&rsquo;, to develop climate change policy and related strategic plans to achieve this transformation.&rdquo; EAD is leading a set of framework initiatives to reduce the impact of climate change, including the preparation of the climate change policy for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and a comprehensive strategy for the years 2023-2027. Her Excellency also announced that EAD is developing a Nexus decision support system that would allow Abu Dhabi to achieve policy coherence between Water, Environment, Energy and Food. The project would be implemented with the participation of the key custodians of these sectors. This pioneering initiative aims to support the Government of Abu Dhabi in achieving more sustainable utilisation of the natural resources of the Emirate, improved water, energy, and food security and more cost-effective projects and efficient management in the relevant sectors. To complement this scheme, there would be existing voluntary programmes, such as the electronic platform for trading carbon credits on the Abu Dhabi Global Market. DoE Chairman, His Excellency Awaidha Murshed Al Marar said the clean energy targets 2035 framework would have a deep impact on the Abu Dhabi energy structure, allowing the broader economy and industrial sector to quickly move in the sustainability direction. He added that the speed of transition and deployment of 60 percent clean and renewable electricity by 2035 would be among the most profound globally. Abu Dhabi, therefore, will be a leading contributor to the UAE&rsquo;s updated climate targets to achieve a 31 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 and net zero by 2050. The UAE&rsquo;s new targets were published in its &lsquo;Second Nationally Determined Contribution&rsquo; in September ahead of COP27 and as part of the COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact commitments. As the UAE prepares to host COP28 UAE in 2023 at Expo City Dubai, a focus will be on bringing together all stakeholders to deliver practical and actionable sustainable energy solutions that accelerate climate progress, energy security and energy transition. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 10th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Etihad Airways, the national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, is implementing contrail prevention on a special NetZero flight during the COP27 event as part of its continuing partnership with SATAVIA. The airline is set to operate a dedicated NetZero flight EY130 from Washington Dulles Airport to Abu Dhabi on Sunday 13th November, combining SATAVIA contrail prevention with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), alongside other operational efficiencies, to demonstrate the potential for net-zero commercial aviation using current technology. The flight is the latest in Etihad's programme of ecoFlights carried out over the past two years, and follows the EY20 Sustainable Flight Etihad operated from London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi last year, reducing overall climate impact by 72 per cent. Building on Etihad's weekly contrail prevention exercises with SATAVIA, the flight will be the first Etihad transatlantic crossing to actively manage non-CO2 climate effects from contrail formation, tackling a sustainability challenge responsible for up to 60 per cent of aviation's climate footprint. Mariam Alqubaisi, Etihad's Head of Sustainability & Business Excellence, said: "The Etihad/SATAVIA collaboration demonstrates the possibility of dramatic sustainability advances in day-to-day commercial operations. COP27 , tackling aviation's non-CO2 impacts with industry-leading technical innovation." Aircraft-generated condensation trails, or contrails, cause surface warming responsible for up to two-thirds of aviation's climate impact, significantly outweighing direct CO2 emissions from aircraft engines. Transatlantic routes such as Washington to Abu Dhabi typically combine high air traffic density with atmospheric conditions that can lead to significant non-CO2 climate impact. In winter operations, cool and moist conditions frequently lead to strongly warming contrails. In addition to enabling contrail prevention in day-to-day flight operations, SATAVIA conducts post-flight climate impact analysis for conversion into future carbon credits, with an initial world-first trade by auction planned with AirCarbon Exchange in December 2022. SATAVIA CEO, Dr Adam Durant, said: "Our contrail platform DECISIONX:NETZERO supports smarter, greener aviation. "By implementing minimal changes to a small percentage of flights, eco-conscious operators like Etihad can eliminate the majority of their non-CO2 climate footprint with essentially no impact on day-to-day operations and on shorter timescales than other green aviation interventions. For transatlantic operations, up to 80 per cent of contrail climate impact can be avoided by rerouting just over 10 per cent of flights." The Greenliner flight will combine contrail prevention with SAF Book & Claim via Etihad partners World Energy, with purchased SAF delivered into the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) fuel system for use by other flights. The additional cost will be mitigated by subsidies, by Etihad's Corporate Conscious Choices programme, and by trading SATAVIA-generated future carbon credits. "The aviation industry can't achieve climate-neutral operations without managing non-CO2 effects," said Alqubaisi. "We look forward to our continued collaboration with SATAVIA, expanding the art of the possible and accelerating progress towards climate-neutral aviation." The flight is being described as NetZero rather than 'Carbon Neutral' as it is achieving more than off-setting the CO2 emissions.

AMEA Power, a Dubai-based renewable-energy company, secured $750m of funding for a solar plant and a wind farm in Egypt and said it will consider an initial public offering in the next three years.  Listing is one option, merging with another organisation is the second option, and an alliance with a major global player, the third option, Chairman Hussain Al Nowais said in an interview.  At this stage, our intention is to continue growing. Dubai eyes energy in Egypt The family-owned firm hopes to finish the Egyptian plants, which will have a combined power capacity of 1 gigawatt, within two years, he said. It has raised debt to build them from lenders including Standard Chartered Plc, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and the International Finance Corp., he said. Egypt is garnering plenty of interest from clean-energy investors, many of who see it as a prime location to build wind and solar farms and green-hydrogen plants. The country hosted this month's COP27 climate summit, during which it announced the construction of an $11 billion wind farm, one of the biggest in the world. Copt28 will be staged in Dubai next year. The AMEA wind plant, in which Japan's Sumitomo Corp. will own a 40% stake, will be located at Ras Ghareb on the Red Sea. The solar project will be at Abydos on the Nile.

Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Mansour said he has cut his investments in social media including stakes in Twitter and Meta while boosting his involvement in green projects, like building electric cars for the Middle East's most populous country. Mansour, whose family's wealth is valued at $6.8bn plans to produce 15,000 electric vehicles in Egypt over the next three to five years through his company Al-Mansour Automotive, which has a long-running partnership with General Motors Co. It also plans to import and market five models of Cadillac EVs by 2025. "I feel it's going to be a big success," Mansour, 74, said in an interview in Sharm El-Sheikh, site of COP27 . He said his almost 50 years of experience in the automotive sector helps him "understand what's marketable and what's not." By the end of the decade, more than 77 million passenger EVs will be on the road globally, according to BloombergNEF research. That's almost triple the current number. "We want to be a leader in that aspect," said Mansour. The use of electric cars in Egypt, which is home to about 104 million people, is still extremely limited. A government official last year estimated that only a few hundred of the vehicles are plying the busy streets. But there are signs that's changing, with state-backed plans to build affordable vehicles and open a network of charging stations. Mansour has been running the family's conglomerate, which originated as a cotton exporter in 1952, since his father's death 46 years ago. It has since diversified into real estate, food services and manufacturing, including owning one of the world biggest Caterpillar construction equipment dealerships and the franchise for all McDonald's restaurants in Egypt. The Mansours do much of their investing through a London-based family office, Man Capital. In recent years, one of the biggest drivers of the family's growing fortune has been tech. Mansour was an early investor in juggernauts like Airbnb., Snowflake and Spotify. He also invests in tech via San Francisco-based venture capital firm 1984 Ventures, which he helped found in 2017.

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 11th November (WAM) -- The US President Joe Biden pledged that the United States will "do our part to avert" a "climate hell". The remarks came as the US president cited a warning by the U.N. secretary general earlier this week in Sharm El-Sheikh, the Egyptian resort city hosting this year's U.N. Climate Change Conference. "We're not ignoring harbingers that are already here," Biden said. "So many disasters &mdash; the climate crisis is hitting hardest those countries and communities that have the fewest resources to respond and to recover." During his remarks Friday at COP27 in Egypt, President Biden underscored his administration's push to cut emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Biden noted that the United States led the effort to create a Global Methane Pledge, in which scores of countries have vowed to agree to help reduce global methane emissions at least 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. In addition, Biden highlighted long-awaited measures, announced earlier Friday by the Environmental Protection Agency, to curb emissions from domestic oil and gas producers. He touted his Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience, also known as PREPARE, and said more than $150 million dollars in initiatives would go toward supporting adaptation efforts throughout Africa. Some of the initiatives include expanding early warning systems, broadening access to climate finance, providing disaster risk protection and strengthening food security. What's more, Biden said, the funding will support a new training center in Egypt to "accelerate adaptation all across the continent." \</doc>

French mobility giant Alstom has signed a framework agreement with Egypt's National Authority of Tunnels (NAT) to design, build, and maintain Line 6 of the Cairo Metro. In a statement issued at the COP27 Summit, Alstom said the 35km-long line will be the first driverless metro in Africa and will accommodate around half a million passengers. The line will run north to south through the Greater Cairo neighbourhoods of Shubra El-Kheima and New Maadi, ending at the beginning of Ain El-Sokhna Road, Al-Khosos. It will include 27 stations, with 12 of them underground. The creation of Cairo Metro Line 6 will reduce the congestion on Cairo Metro Line 1 and provide more options to residents moving across Cairo, Alstom noted. In January 2021, it was announced that the Cairo Metro Line III had reached the 49% completion mark and, October 2022, Alstom opened a new regional office in Riyadh. "In 2019, the city's CO2 emissions due to transport was around 22m tonnes of CO2 representing 40% of Egypt's total transport emissions. The agreement demonstrates Egypt's commitment to ensuring Cairo is an inclusive, safe, and resilient city," said Andrew DeLeone, President of Alstom in Africa, Middle East, and Central Asia. Alstom will provide the rolling stock and 294 metropolis cars. It will also supply signalling systems, telecom systems, traction, power supply, high voltage substation, depot equipment, depot design, trackwork, third rail and automatic fare collection, it added. In addition, the French firm will be responsible for the maintenance work on Cairo Line 6, which will be carried out at the depot in Cairo and managed locally. In early November 2022, Bahrain said it would launch a tender for the construction of its metro project by Q1 2023. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 10th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Climate change adaptation requires significant infrastructure investment to increase resilience and reduce vulnerabilities, and the transition to a low-carbon global economy will generate enormous investment, employment, and growth opportunities, said WTO Director General Okonjo at a high-level forum held on the sidelines of the COP27 in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt. Okonjo-Iweala highlighted the need to develop climate-smart policies to promote international trade and investment in mitigation and adaptation projects. She added that fostering cooperation to develop common approaches to carbon pricing was critical to driving new transformations. "We need to build a coherent framework of trade and investment policies supported by roadmaps that can accelerate the energy transition and boost re-investments," the Director-General said. The Global Investment and Trade for Climate Transformation forum, convened by the WTO and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), addressed what the international trade and investment communities could do to advance the Paris Climate Agreement. UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebecca Grynspan told the forum that recent research showed the number of new climate change investment projects announced in the last two quarters had decreased, indicating the need for climate funding, particularly in developing countries. "We must ensure that trade and investment policies are an integral part of nationally determined contributions," she said. "That is not always the case, and we need to change that." Grynspan also discussed the role that trade can play in climate adaptation, highlighting the need to maintain a policy environment conducive to the cross-border flow of climate financing in order to promote international investment in mitigation and especially adaptation. \</doc>

DUBAI, 10th August, 2022 (WAM) -- The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have signed a regional Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to support joint advocacy, capacity development, and resource mobilisation for the coordinated national-level implementation of anticipatory action (AA) in response to climate shocks in the Middle East and North Africa region. The signing took place at the conclusion of "Road to COP27 : Anticipatory Action Milestones and Way Forward in MENA", an event that was hosted by the International Humanitarian City (IHC), Dubai, and attended by high-level speakers and representatives from the UAE government, Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, WFP, IFRC, Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and national societies, regional and international humanitarian organisations, including UNDRR, FAO, Start Network, REAP. The event emphasised the ongoing importance of acting early ahead of climate-related disasters, through anticipatory action. Anticipatory action is an effective way of mitigating the worst consequences of predictable climate risks, which are expected to become more frequent and intense because of climate change and conflict in the MENA region. "In a region where climate hazards such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves are increasing humanitarian needs, anticipatory action aims to reduce or mitigate the impact of these hazards on the most vulnerable people," said Mageed Yahia, WFP Representative to the GCC. "We are grateful for the strong representation from the UAE in this event today, an important ally in the quest to make the humanitarian system as anticipatory as possible," he added. Over the last few years, WFP and IFRC have been making progress in setting the scene for an AA approach in the MENA region for acting earlier ahead of disasters. "Let us not forget that COP27 goals and vision are mitigation, adaptation, finance, and collaboration. Today we are addressing these four main elements, as Anticipatory Action allows for the mitigation and adaptation of climate change impacts," said IFRC MENA Deputy Regional Director, Rania Ahmad. "This collaboration between IFRC and WFP will allow for increased sharing of experiences and financing and make the most vulnerable populations better prepared and enhance their resilience." During the event, WFP and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) also launched the "Anticipatory Action in the MENA Region: State of Play and Accelerating Action" report, supported by the Swedish government, which highlights the state of anticipatory action in the region, and its potential to help avoid and reduce the impacts of disasters. Regional coordination and collaboration across all stakeholders will be necessary to complement efforts and engagements to scale up the anticipatory actions agenda in the region with tangible results. To support this, IFRC and WFP are establishing the "MENA Anticipatory Action regional community of practice" as a space for technical and advocacy coordination, collaboration, learning exchange, and capacity strengthening on anticipatory action and acting earlier ahead of disasters in the region. The initiative will bring together UN agencies, the Red Cross Red Crescent movement, as well as international organisations, governments, NGOs, the public and private sector, and academia, to coordinate and work together to effectively scale up and deliver anticipatory action programmes as the threat of climate shocks continues to grow. \</doc>

A 'global youth movement for adaption' is calling on world leaders to take "urgent and bold action to adapt our world to the increasing impacts of the climate crisis". The 'Youth Dialogue on Adaptation Action: Delivering on the Glasgow Climate Pact' convened by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and its Youth Advisory Panel took place on 3-4 September in Rotterdam ahead of the Africa Adaptation Summit. With climate-related disasters striking everywhere, from dramatic floods in Pakistan to deadly heatwaves and droughts sweeping across continents, young people have shown that they are taking the lead and adapting their communities, while increasing their calls on governments to adopt ambitious policy and increase finance for adaptation, the GCA said. "We are in a climate emergency today and what we will see tomorrow will be exponentially worse. You are the generation that will be the most affected. I urge you to be more vocal on the adaptation agenda. Together we can lead the change for a climate-resilient world," GCA CEO Prof. Dr. Patrick Verkooijen told youth delegates during a visit to the GCA's offices. In July 2022, in an exclusive interview with Middle East Construction News (MECN), WSP Middle East's Sophia Kee said, "We have 93% certainty within the next five years of hitting new temperature highs". The #Youth4Adaptation Appeal contains four major asks from the youth to world leaders: promote education, capacity-building and upskilling of young people on climate adaptation; provide an inclusive and participatory environment for youth in climate adaptation decision-making processes; empower youth entrepreneurs and young professionals to advance the adaptation agenda, and increase financing for youth-led adaptation initiatives through adapted and flexible funding mechanisms. The conclusion of the two-day dialogue and the seven regional forums that took place throughout the year are enshrined in the #Youth4Adaptation Appeal, the GCA noted. The document is billed as a "a call to action by young leaders to decision-makers to adapt our world to the cascading impacts of the climate emergency by providing an urgent, ambitious and robust response to deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact". Following his meeting with youth, Verkooijen committed to presenting their requests to international leaders at the Africa Adaptation Summit on 5 September, and at the vital UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt scheduled to take place between 6 and 18 November. In August, the UAE's Ministry of Climate Change and Environment unveiled a pledge designed to boost the private sector's contribution to the UAE's Net Zero by 2050 initiative. Former UN Secretary-General and GCA Board Chairman Ban Ki-moon and UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed also participated in the dialogue and are commended the youth's determination to act on the climate adaptation agenda. Both leaders also encouraged young delegates to keep pressing governments to deliver on their promises ahead of COP27 . In an opinion piece shared with MECN, Katarina Uherova Hasbani, Partner and Global Director of Strategy and Advisory at AESG said that with time running out in the climate change battle, all sectors must work together to ensure a brighter, safer future.

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 8th November, 2022 (WAM) -- COP27 has seen nine new countries, including Belgium, Colombia, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, the UK, and the US join the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA), pledging to a rapid ramp up of offshore wind in order to tackle the climate and energy security crises. The alliance, initiated by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Denmark and the Global Wind Energy Council, will bring together governments, the private sector, international organisations and other stakeholders to accelerate the deployment of offshore wind power. Countries joining GOWA have agreed to work together to drive national, regional, and global ambitions and remove barriers to the deployment of offshore wind in new and existing markets. Offshore wind can be deployed at large scale, in short time frames and at competitive cost &ndash; it is a fast and viable route to closing the growing gap between renewable energy targets and current rates of implementation. Both IRENA and the International Energy Agency (IEA) expect that offshore wind capacity will need to exceed 2000 GW in 2050, from just over 60 GW today, to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degree Celsius and achieve net zero. To reach this target, GOWA will aim to contribute to accelerating growth to reach a total of at least 380 GW installed capacity by the end of 2030. Francesco la Camera, Director-General, International Renewable Energy Agency, said, "Offshore wind represents a unique opportunity for countries to add huge volumes of new zero-carbon power generation, increase their climate ambition and ratchet up their NDCs. Offshore wind is more than competitive with fossil fuel generation, and can also provide a massive boost to investment and job creation." \</doc>

Trade in voluntary carbon credits could grow 100-fold by 2050 if teething problems are addressed, Joseph McMonigle said in a keynote address to the S&P Global Carbon Markets Conference in Barcelona. "There is a huge opportunity for voluntary carbon markets, which can only be realized with concerted international efforts. Overall, the market is characterized by low liquidity, scarce financing, inadequate risk-management services, and limited data availability. Building trust in the market is vital to achieving these goals so we must work harder to improve transparency, standardization and stability," he told the audience in Barcelona. A carbon credit is a permit which allows a country or organization to produce a certain amount of carbon emissions and which can be traded if the full allowance is not used. They come from four categories: avoided nature loss including deforestation; nature-based sequestration, such as reforestation; avoidance or reduction of emissions such as methane from landfills; and technology-based removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere like carbon capture, utilization and storage. According to the World Bank, global carbon credit revenue grew 60 percent to $84 billion in 2021. The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets estimates that demand for carbon credits could increase by a factor of 15 or more by 2030 and by a factor of up to 100 by 2050. Management consultant McKinsey issued a report in 2021 that estimates demand in 2030 in the range of 8 to 12 gigatons of CO2 per year of carbon credits. "It is critical that purchasing a carbon credit can be trusted to bring a real reduction in CO2 emissions," Mr McMonigle told the conference. "The market today lacks transparency and there is a lack of data on how money is spent. The world will need a voluntary carbon market that is large, transparent, verifiable, and environmentally robust." In 2016, the European Commission found that 85 percent of projects it examined were unlikely to achieve their stated reduction claims. Similar conclusions were found in a 2019 ProPublica investigation and a 2021 study on forest preservation in California. The second issue is supply of credits, Mr McMonigle said. "The development of projects would have to ramp up at an unprecedented rate," he said, adding that most of the potential supply of avoided nature loss and of nature-based sequestration is concentrated in a small number of countries. Project and financing risks could reduce the supply of carbon credits to as little as 1 gigaton of CO2 per year by 2030, according to the McKinsey report. Policy makers need the carbon markets to work better because they are increasingly relying on them to deliver a portion of their promised reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement, he told the conference. And companies are seeking higher volumes of carbon credits because their regulators and shareholders are demanding rapid and measurable progress towards net zero goals beyond what they can deliver internally. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is central to the development of an effective international market for trading carbon credits, Mr McMonigle said. "It serves as the crucial link between the trade in carbon credits and countries' commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, so it is vital that we see these talks come to a successful conclusion." Talks at COP27 "Differences relate to the deadline for transferring emissions reduction projects listed under the Clean Development Mechanism to the new registry, the procedure for moving credits between countries, and the conditions for mandatory cancellations of credits," Mr McMonigle said. Governments are also looking at how carbon credits can be used to promote clean energy technologies in the developing world, he added. The United States launched an initiative at COP27 to enable companies to earn credits for funding clean energy projects in the developing world. Launched by White House Climate Envoy John Kerry with the Bezos Earth Fund and Rockefeller Foundation, the Energy Transition Accelerator will create a new type of carbon credit for companies that deploy capital to retire unabated coal-fired power and accelerate the buildout of renewables in developing countries. Governments in emerging markets, and in particular energy producers, have recently embraced carbon credits, Mr McMonigle said. Saudi Arabia, for example, held its first auction in October, selling 1.4 million tons of high-quality, CORSIA-compliant and Verra-registered carbon credits. Elsewhere in the Middle East, Abu Dhabi Global Market and AirCarbon Exchange are setting up a voluntary carbon market based in the UAE capital, aiming for a launch in January. \</doc>

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has pledged $2.5bn in funding to the Middle East Green Initiative. The announcement came as the Kingdom's Crown Prince hosted the Middle East Green Initiative summit alongside COP27 in Egypt. The Middle East is increasingly looking to sustainable business and diversifying its economy. Saudi Arabia investing in green initiatives Last Week the Crown Prince announced the launch of Ceer, the first Saudi electric vehicle brand. Ceer is the first Saudi automotive brand to produce electric vehicles in Saudi Arabia, and will create up to 30,000 direct and indirect jobs in the region. Ceer is projected to directly contribute $8bn to Saudi Arabia's GDP by 2034. Last year the Kingdom said it would contribute 15% of the $10.4bn estimated requirements for the Middle East Green Initiative's clean energy projects. This has been upped to $2.5bn with the country also offering to host a headquarters for the organisation. The crown prince also said the kingdom's Public Investment Fund would aim for net-zero emissions by 2050. The Middle East Green Initiative last year announced its plans to plant 50 billion trees across the region, as part of its strategy to confront climate change. Under the Middle East Green Initiative which, the kingdom will coordinate with neighbouring states and regional allies to plant 40 billion trees. The remaining 10 billion trees will be planted in KSA under a separate green initiative, making the combined total the largest reforestation program in the world.

ABU DHABI, 8th September, 2022 (WAM) -- A UAE newspaper has said that the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference, Cop26, took place in the British city of Glasgow, surrounded by the rolling, green and well-watered Scottish countryside. At the time, the autumn weather was surprisingly good for a country famous for its rain, perhaps ominous of the great changes on the horizon when it comes to global climate. This year, Scotland had a hot summer and much of the UK suffered droughts. " Cop27 The topics that are up for discussion are crucial. But so is the location. Egypt has made clear that it wants this instalment of the conference to be for Africa, in addition to the wider goal of moving "from pledges to implementation". At home, Egypt is demonstrating how to implement these promises. Speaking to The National, Egypt's Minister of International Co-operation Rania Al Mashat said "climate action has to be nationally motivated". In her mind, Egypt is making sure "climate and development come hand in hand". Her case is strong. The country unveiled its "NWFE" programme, which stands for the nexus for water, food and energy. It involves pursuing ideas to safeguard these vital areas in the years ahead, which are particularly stressed in Africa and the Middle East. An important part of getting such projects off the ground is securing funding. NWFE is a good template for doing so. The government is hoping to raise almost $15 billion to fund the project by November 2023. It is making progress. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development is leading the energy strand, the African Development Bank on water and the International Fund for Agricultural Development food. A focus on African issues will also raise awareness of today's unacceptable climate injustices. The continent is responsible for about 2 to 3 per cent of global emissions, and yet, according to the UN Environmental Programme, it is "disproportionately the most vulnerable region in the world". Keeping focus on these issues will be important as even the richest countries grapple with severe economic troubles. If Cop26 was about keeping focus on ambitious targets during a pandemic, this year's is about doing so in a time of war, food and energy shortage and what seems to be a more general weakening of global diplomacy. In a speech at the beginning of the forum, the president of Cop27 and Egypt's foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, stressed that his country will address gaps in the implementation of the climate promises the world made in Paris in 2015. "Egypt is well-placed to be an advocate for climate issues in Africa, but, spanning the two regions, it is also in a good position to build momentum for the Middle East in the run-up to Cop28, which will be held in the Emirates next year. Mena is another region that is going to feel, indeed already does, a changing climate earliest and most severely. The next two years, then, are shaping up to be crucial for their futures," concluded the Abu Dhabi-based daily. \</doc>

Discussions and agreements on OPEC+ oil production cuts hit the headlines over the past month and these levelled out with an agreement by the group on October 5 to cut production by 2mn barrels per day (bpd). This agreement was set to stand until the end of 2023. Leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and Algeria all lined up behind this agreement, with some adding that it was "a purely technical response based on purely economic considerations". The point about this is that the statement is a counter to a comment from the US that the cut would boost Russia's foreign earnings and suggested that it had been engineered for "political reasons" by Saudi Arabia, hinting at support for Moscow in its invasion of Ukraine. The issue arose at the recent COP27 conference in Egypt where OPEC+ members lined up to endorse the steep cut to its output target agreed earlier in the month. The issue has rumbled on, however, and Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has been reported as denying recent reports stating that the Kingdom is currently discussing an increase in output of 500,000 bpd with other OPEC+ producers. The minister added that it is no secret that OPEC+ does not discuss any decisions before its meetings, Saudi Press Agency reported. Prince Abdulaziz repeated that the cartel's decision to cut production by 2mn bpd will stand till the end of 2023. He said: "If there is a need to take further measures to reduce production to restore balance between supply and demand, we are always ready to intervene." Meanwhile, UAE\~Minister of Energy and Infrastructure Suhail Mohamed Al-Mazrouei denied that his country is "engaging in any discussion with other OPEC+ members to change the last agreement which is valid until the end of 2023. We remain committed to the OPEC+ aim to balance the oil market and will support any decision to achieve that goal." \</doc>

JLL has outlined simple, rapid changes that can be made in Egypt, so that it can start its the journey towards Net Zero buildings and combat climate change. In a white paper titled 'Egypt's Road to Decarbonisation', the firm looked at the decarbonisation of the built environment and examined ways in which Egypt can win its climate battle. The report includes a real estate perspective on climate change and the critical role of transparency for decarbonisation; the power of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in tackling climate change; and the importance of closing the funding gap with climate financing and green bonds. "It is important for Egypt, alongside other nations, to review the plans and actions of the most climate-progressive cities we identified in our recent Global Real Estate Transparency Index, and follow their path in implementing and mandating suitable, climate-friendly real estate regulations, while aligning with international property measurement standards," said Ayman Sami, Country Head Egypt at JLL. In August 2022, South Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power won a $2.2bn contract from Russia's Rosatom to build a nuclear plant in Egypt. "This could eventually lead to the country committing to a Net Zero goal and the development of a plan to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions across new and existing stock, including establishing a national retrofitting program." Egypt will be hosting the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh between 6-18 November. The country has emphasised the coming global climate summit will be specifically important, as it will be the year of 'implementation' and 'unlocking climate finance'. COP 27 will also be an opportunity for Egypt to represent the entire African continent and voice all its financial and technological needs to the world. Sami added, "More governments are becoming aware of the drastic effects of buildings' carbon emissions on the climate and are starting to mandate energy efficiency and emissions standards for buildings, as well as adopting green building certificates. For Egypt, it's an opportunity to encourage investors, landlords and occupiers to develop a greener mentality and take their own initiatives to act quickly, without waiting for regulatory measures to kick-in \- given the urgency of the climate emergency." In early September 2022, Egypt's Archplan Developments said the region's first urban forest project reached the 60% completion mark. Research suggests that now, especially as the host of COP 27 , Egypt can drive simple, rapid and effective actions in the real estate sector, such as (retrofitting) LED lighting and installing photo voltaic solar panels \- which drastically reduce emissions from electricity, he pointed out. Over the years, Egypt has made great progress to strengthen its position as an advocate for green financing, most notably with its first sovereign green bond in the Middle East and North Africa (worth US $750mn) issued in September 2020 to finance its climate action plan and achieve its sustainability goals and ambitions. However, proceeds from the debt sale will be used to finance or re-finance green projects in the transportation sector (46% of proceeds have been allocated for the Cairo monorail), as well as clean water and wastewater management (54% has been dedicated to this sector), with no funding plans relating to buildings. In early October 2022, Bloom Holding expanded its educational portfolio into Egypt via a joint venture agreement. Egypt has stated that it requires $250mn to install energy efficient cooling in buildings, and an additional $345mn to incorporate energy efficiency and renewable energy measures in hotels and resorts. The government has also stressed that without the complete support from developed countries, it will not be able to allocate the right financial, technological, and human resources to fulfill the emission reduction pledges of the Paris Agreement. According to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT), Egypt will only be able to meet its Paris Agreement temperature goals by 2030 if it reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 25% from current levels. Egypt's recently updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal remains conditional on receiving funding to the tune of $246bn for its mitigation ($196bn) and adaptation ($50bn) plans. In addition to Egypt's enhanced goals and ambitions to address climate change, the whitepaper also highlighted the need for enhancement to achieve its Paris Agreement pledges. The country could further strengthen the enforcement of its existing laws, establish a long-term Net Zero carbon goal and join other nations in mitigating climate change, while keeping in mind the built environment's role in the mitigation process as it is a major contributor to global carbon emissions. Late in October 2022, Orascom Construction said it added $670mn to its backlog in Q3 2022. \</doc>

CAIRO, 21st October, 2022 (WAM) - Egypt will host the 24th Ministerial Meeting of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) from 23rd to 25th October, 2022, under the chairmanship of Minister of Petroleum and Mineral resources Tarek El-Molla. El-Molla explained that the meeting comes amid a global dialogue about energy security and just weeks ahead of the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) set to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh from 6th to18th November, according to a statement from the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, carried by Ahram Online . The three-day event, El-Molla added, is an opportunity to improve cooperation among the member states that posses a large proportion of gas reserves, production and exports, and to ensure work is done an environmentally responsible manner. The GECF comprises of 11 member states: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. It also includes eight observers: Angola, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Malaysia, Mozambique, Norway, Peru and the UAE. Together, these states are home to 72 percent of the global proven natural gas reserves, 55 percent of exports by pipeline and 50 percent of LNG exports. El-Molla stressed Egypt's keenness on establishing a constructive global dialogue among member states focusing on the key role of natural gas in the transition from fossil-based energy to zero-carbon energy. Natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel and is affordable, the minister noted. The GECF was established in 2001 and it was transformed into an international governmental organisation headquartered in Doha, Qatar in 2008. The GECF ministerial meeting, which is the supreme governing body of the forum, meets once a year. \</doc>

What has been your approach to championing sustainability in the AMESA region? Which area has been of utmost importance to you? Delivering on our vision of 'Winning with PepsiCo Positive (pep+)' means becoming a more sustainable company by striving for a more sustainable food system. Sustainability doesn't exist in a vacuum; it is a part of our DNA. The launch of pep+ last year, our end-to-end transformation strategy, guides what we do and how we do it to create growth and shared value with sustainability and human capital taking centre stage. As part of pep+, we drive action across three key pillars: Positive Agriculture, Positive Value Chain, and Positive Choices. A crucial part of the pep+ 'Positive Agriculture' pillar is to spread regenerative practices for earth restoration across the land equal to our entire agri- cultural footprint, to enable our efforts to sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and to improve the livelihoods of people in our agricultural supply chain and our communities, with a heavy focus on economically empowering women by 2030 in this sphere. So far, we have successfully adopted regenerative agricultural practices across 11,000 acres of land and have improved the livelihoods of more than 13,000 people in our agriculture supply chain. Since 2018, we have invested over $5.7m in our flagship 'She Feeds the World' programme which is reaching out to 880,000 farmers and their families. The programme, especially supporting women farmers, is improving economic resilience, food security and nutritional wellbeing. In 2021, 67 per cent of our direct potatoes were sourced sustainably through over 40 demonstration farms in AMESA. Hundred per cent of the palm oil we sourced in 2021 is RSPO certified. Since 2018, PepsiCo Foundation has invested $5.5m in the AMESA region, distributing meals to over 30 million people. Programmes like the UN's World Food Programme, Sub Saharan Africa's Pioneer Foods School Breakfast Programme and other local initiatives are helping PepsiCo in AMESA close the gap in food insecurity. We hear you are attending COP27 . What are you most looking forward to? The upcoming months are particularly exciting for AMESA with the COP27 being held in Egypt. Climate change impacts and its increasing vulnerability on food systems is felt even more in the African continent. I believe that the 'Africa COP' presents a golden opportunity for us as a region to champion the climate change agenda by sharing best practices and driving concrete action that extends beyond the COP. I am proud of our marquee regenerative agriculture initiatives as well as food and water security programmes in Egypt and Sub- Saharan Africa that are transforming lives making them stronger, better, healthier, and empowered. With our plans to mobilise sustainable innovation and entrepreneurship, we believe that COP27 will serve as a key moment to lift the region's profile as a global leader in sustainability and green economic transformation. Throwing light on the critical food-water-energy nexus, we understand that agriculture is the focal point of your sustainability efforts. What has been your approach to water and energy? With our long history of water stewardship, we are working towards making every drop of water go as far as possible. As a foods and beverages company, we are acutely aware of the critical role water plays in the food system and our ambition is to become 'Net Water Positive' by 2030. To achieve this, we have adopted an approach to watershed management that includes improving water-use efficiency across our value chain: on farms and in manufacturing facilities; replenishing water and improving the health of the local watersheds that are most at risk and where we operate; and increasing safe water access for communities that face water insecurity, including scarcity and unsafe water sources. We strive to understand the water challenges at a local level, especially in high-water risk areas, and support collaborative solutions that address the specific needs of the watershed and the communities that depend on it. So far, we have avoided the use of approximately five billion litres of water in 2021 compared to 2020 by changing the way farmers irrigate crops, focusing on at-risk locations and improving water- use efficiency. Since 2021, PepsiCo AMESA estimates that it has improved water efficiency by a historic 50 per cent in company-owned high-water risk sites across the region (excluding Pioneer Foods facilities in Sub Saharan Africa). Additionally, it is estimated that in 2021, PepsiCo in AMESA has replenished 2.5 billion litres of water through community partnership projects in six high risk watershed areas through with science-based interventions. PepsiCo Foundation in AMESA has invested more than $8m in safe water access programmes, impacting about 27 million people's daily lives since 2018. On the energy front, we have pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, one decade earlier than called for in the Paris Agreement. Our target aligns with the 'Business Ambition for 1.5&deg;C' pledge, which we signed in 2020, joining other leading companies committing to set science-based emissions reduction targets in line with limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C above preindustrial levels. PepsiCo AMESA has driven the climate agenda within its manufacturing operations by achieving 12 per cent energy use reduction in 2021 vis-&agrave;-vis 2015. Additionally, PepsiCo AMESA has installed solar panels on 17 manufacturing sites and signed MOUs with multiple partners for power purchase agreements (PPA) in different markets in 2021. What about your efforts in creating a circular economy? We are demonstrating circularity in the AMESA region by unlocking rPET in nine countries as well as by diverting over 107,000 tonnes of plastic and over 19,000 tonnes of multilayered plastic (MLP) films from the landfills of across seven countries. Additionally, I'm proud of our first Lay's RePlay pitch launched in South Africa's Tembisa to drive the circular economy and provide support to disadvantaged communities. The pitch used more than three million chip packages to form the underlayer beneath the turf. Each field is created with a shock- absorbing layer, which is formed when reclaimed chip packs are converted into rubberised pellets. More than just a planet positive pitch, Lay's RePlay placed a strong emphasis on including community members and local organisations throughout the planning, construction, and maintenance phases of each pitch, with the goal to develop programming that can address social issues impacting each community, while fostering safe access to the sport of football. &ldquo;ON THE ENERGY FRONT, WE HAVE PLEDGED TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS BY 2040, ONE DECADE EARLIER THAN CALLED FOR IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT. OUR TARGET ALIGNS WITH THE BUSINESS AMBITION FOR 1.5&deg;C PLEDGE, WHICH PEPSICO SIGNED IN 2020&rdquo; \</doc>

Emirate counts on the role of the private sector to meet the net zero target, says senior official KT photo by Shihab Abu Dhabi will plant one million mangrove trees in its efforts to achieve the net zero target and also counts on the role of the private sector to meet the target, a senior official said on Wednesday. "We will be planting one million mangroves trees by 2030 to capture carbon emission as this is a good natural solution," said Abdulla Al Remeithi, Director - Integrated Environmental Policy and Planning, Environment Agency Abu Dhabi, during the panel discussion at The Journey to Net Zero forum hosted by Khaleej Times. The forum was sponsored by sustainability partner Accenture, Gold Sponsor Trane Technologies, Silver Sponsor Fugro and supported by Clean Energy Business Council, Middle East Solar Industry and Energy Industries Council Mena. The Dubai Supreme Council of Energy officially endorsed by the forum. Scientists say that mangroves are powerful carbon sinks as they can store carbon many times more than forests "Climate change is one of the main risks globally and the UAE was one of the first countries in the Mena region to adopt and sign the Paris Agreement. The UAE was also the first country in the region to commit to net zero. Since the 1970s, our late founders had a target for sustainability. Though terminology has changed but the concept remains the same," he said. Al Remeithi said the private sector is also involved in initiatives taken related to net zero. "We are counting on the private sector because it plays an important role in climate targets and it is a shared responsibility." He praised Egypt for their efforts at the Cop27 summit held recently as the country pushed for different agendas. The Cop28 will be held in the UAE next year. \</doc>

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been signed by carbon negative concrete pioneer Partanna with Saudi-based developer Red Sea Global. The MoU was signed at COP27 and, as part of the agreement, the parties are exploring an arrangement for Partanna to establish production facilities on Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast. The MoU comes just four days after Partanna announced a partnership with the Government of the Bahamas to build the world's first carbon-negative housing development. Partanna's concrete technology is said to avoid carbon emissions, absorb carbon from the atmosphere and generates tradeable carbon credits. Partanna is as durable, versatile and scalable as traditional cement. Its use of brine as a core ingredient also brings unique benefits to the Middle East, where desalination plants can harvest more fresh water per litre processed and provide Partanna with the rest, the firm said in a statement. "It's time for action. Whilst others use COP27 to talk and promote themselves, we're here to do business with developers who share our vision of changing how the world builds. We're moving quick because humanity can't afford to wait. Red Sea Global share our vision and wanted to move quickly to make it a reality. We're delighted to strike up an agreement with one of the world's most ambitious and innovative developers and see this as the start of our work in the Middle East," said Rick Fox, former Los Angeles Lakers and actor, Co-Founder of Partanna Global. Rick Fox, Founder of Partanna Bahamas Concrete is one of the most destructive materials on earth, with 9% of worldwide man-made emissions associated with its production. It's also the world's most widely used building materials \- with the Middle East and North Africa accounting for 21% of cement production in 2021, Partanna explained. Commenting on the agreement, Carlos M. Duarte, Distinguished Professor at King Abdullah University and Technology stated, "I am delighted to see Partanna and Red Sea Global announce a collaborative program today. Partanna has developed ground-breaking technology to produce concrete that absorbs CO2 and is, therefore, climate positive. However, most importantly, they have developed a system that mimics how corals, the great cement producers of the biosphere, do it, as they incorporate brine as an essential feed stock of Partanna concrete." "This is a game changer, as the Arabian Peninsula produces about 60% of the world's brine and we were lacking a solution to avoid delivering it to the ocean, where it may impact marine life. With Partanna and Red Sea Global working together, RSG buildings will be climate positive and embody brine, to make them more resistant, and conserve marine life. A win-win for the RSG, Partanna, the ocean and the planet. Most importantly, this is inspired by our beautiful corals!" In October 2022, Red Sea Global confirmed its new brand identity and mandate. John Pagano, Group Chief Executive Officer, Red Sea Global RSG is the developer behind two giga regenerative tourism projects in Saudi Arabia \- The Red Sea and AMAALA. Both will be completely off-grid and powered by 100% renewable solar energy. The Red Sea is set to welcome first guests early next year when the first three hotels and international airport open. A further 13 resorts will complete by early 2024. The first phase of AMAALA will comprise nine hotels, delivering 1,300 hotel rooms. It is on track for completion in 2024, the statement noted. John Pagano, Group Chief Executive Officer of Red Sea Global commented, "Through this partnership with Partanna, RSG is continuing its efforts to accelerate green technologies that can lead the world to a more sustainable and even regenerative future. We are on track to be carbon neutral from day one of operations at The Red Sea when we welcome our first guests in early 2023. This material, which can be manufactured utilising recycled raw materials, and which can generate carbon credits, could be key to achieving our even more ambitious goal of creating carbon negative tourism destinations." RSG's approach toward responsible development that prioritises people and planet, has seen the company explore and implement experimental technologies and pilot programmes to solve some of the world's most complex and pressing challenges, such as off-site manufacturing and modular construction methods at scale, destination-wide clean mobility strategies, and sustainable food production through new farming approaches, the statement concluded. In early November 2022, RSG appointed Reem Emirates Saudi for fa\'e7ade works on RSI Airport.

ABU DHABI, 6th November, 2022 (WAM) - - Sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - or COP - have been running since 1995. They review progress made by members of the global community to limit climate change. Since 2015, these sessions have focused on progress to implement the Paris Agreement. As countries set out for COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the sober reality is that the window of opportunity to limit global warming to less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels is narrowing. All three of the key UN agencies have produced sobering reports in the last two days. The UN environment agency's report found there was &ldquo;no credible pathway to 1.5C in place&rdquo;, while the UN's meteorological agency reported that all the main heating gases hit record highs in 2021, with an alarming surge in emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. More ambitious and vastly accelerated climate action has therefore become a necessity. Thankfully, the economic case for climate action is stronger than ever. The UAE's experience shows that climate change action can have a positive impact on a country's economic performance, helping to drive growth; attract new investment; act as a springboard for new industries, as well as modernise existing ones; and create new, high-quality, sustainable employment opportunities. Foreseeing the substantial job growth potential of the green economy, five years ago the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment launched the UAE Green Jobs Programme. It found that investment of one to two per cent of GDP per year could create up to 165,000 new jobs by 2030, providing the basis for a just transition. The UAE has consistently been proactive on climate action, and has seen the benefits of moving early on climate action. It was the first country in the Middle East & North Africa to deploy large-scale renewable energy. It was the first to pursue peaceful nuclear power, starting operations at the third of four nuclear power units earlier this year, and the first to commercialise industrial-scale carbon capture, utilisation and storage technology (CCUS). Today, the UAE is actively pursuing new emissions-free technologies, such as green hydrogen. The UAE is home to three of the world's largest solar power projects, such as Al Dhafra in Abu Dhabi, which set a record for low-cost solar energy in 2020 for cost at 1.35 cents kW/hr. This further underscores the economic benefits of climate action - unlimited and affordable energy. As a proactive and responsible member of the international community, and aware of the immense economic benefits, the UAE is working with other countries to realise these opportunities. Today, the UAE is one of the world's largest investors in global renewable energy projects and has invested $50 billion in renewable energy projects in over 70 countries, including 31 island developing-states that are most vulnerable to climate change. These include the Zarafshan Wind Farm in Uzbekistan, which will power half a million homes and displace over 11 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. The nation has also committed an additional investment of US$50 billion over the next decade in several countries to accelerate clean energy transition. Most recently, the nation signed a strategic partnership agreement with the US to accelerate transition, advance shared climate goals and strengthen global energy security. This UAE-US Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE) aims to will catalyse US$100 billion in financing and other support in addition to deploying 100 new gigawatts (GW) of clean energy in the US, UAE and emerging economies around the world by 2035. Similar projects are underway across the globe. From hurricane-resilient solar in the Caribbean, to the London Array - a vast offshore windfarm - the UAE is working with partners to ensure an ambitious and practical energy transition. One that guarantees energy security, economic growth, and reduced carbon emissions. While getting nations to agree on key climate actions is understandably challenging, the COP process provides a platform for negotiated outcomes and ambitious partnerships, often with success. Only last year at COP26 137 countries swung behind reversing forest loss, while 190 nations agreed to phase down coal-fired power generation. The number of new coal power plants is expected to fall by as much as 76%. These positive developments show that collection action works. At COP27 In presenting this &lsquo;whole-of-UAE' approach to climate action, the UAE is sending that message that climate change should be viewed not only a challenge, but also as an opportunity. The reality is that climate action pays. The business case for climate action is overwhelming and the UAE is evidence of that. \</doc>

With COP 27 "The media must hold decision-makers accountable to make a lasting change," Huet-Trupheme said. Those in the Middle East and North Africa, in particular, should be committed to highlighting the issue, since these regions will be the first to run out of water, she warned. Huet-Trupheme also turned the spotlight on how the region has contributed to the global carbon footprint. "In the last decade, the Middle East has overtaken Europe in its emissions of CO2 gases," she said. "It is time to address the problem." Weather changes According to Huet-Trupheme, temperatures in the Middle East can rise by up to 5 degrees by the end of this century which is much more than what humans can adapt to. Sands in the region are becoming drier, leading to more sandstorms. With global warming and sea levels rising, agriculture is at risk and this could threaten food security. "It will be critical to see if we can move towards renewable sources of energy," she said. "With the COP 27 taking place in Egypt this year and COP 28 scheduled to take place in Dubai next year, these conversations about renewable energy must take centre stage." Rearranging the newsroom Huet-Trupheme placed the onus on editors in newsrooms to increase the media coverage of climate change. She highlighted how AFP switched to a hybrid model of reporting regarding climate issues in 2020. "We have a hub of 20 climate and economic specialists," she said. With their resources, AFP has done several special reports about environmental issues including the drying up of the Tigris river in Iraq and how Gazans are turning to solar power. "This hub is improving the conversation about environment between journalists," said Huet-Trupheme. "That is what is important to make sure that emphasis is being placed where it is needed." She also stressed the importance of training journalists in environmental reporting. "It is a field that is very visually driven," she said. "Reporters need to know to choose the right words and the right background. Training them must be supported by top management, too." \</doc>

A "fundamental shift in Abu Dhabi's energy mix" is being spearheaded by the Environment Agency \- Abu Dhabi (EAD) in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Department of Energy (DoE). The initiative, which was unveiled at COP27 in Egypt, aims to achieve significantly lower carbon emissions in the emirate through a raft of new regulations aimed at generating a large proportion of Abu Dhabi's electricity from clean and renewable sources by 2035. The successful achievement of this goal will mark a significant milestone in the UAE's journey to deliver carbon neutrality by 2050, the EAD pointed out. The new regulations were drafted by the DoE and will see 60% of Abu Dhabi's electricity being generated from clean and renewable sources by 2035, and up to 75% reduction in carbon emissions per MWh produced by the electricity sector. The DoE's 'Clean Energy Strategic Target 2035 for Electricity Production in Abu Dhabi' regulatory framework is the first legally binding clean and renewable energy target in the Middle East for the electricity sector. It forms part of an ongoing energy transition to accelerate the UAE's decarbonisation and green growth efforts, the EAD said. Speaking at COP27 "The target to produce 60% of all electricity using clean sources by 2035 is an important step towards meeting the UAE's Net Zero aspirations by 2050. Planned investment of billions of dirhams in clean energy infrastructure will be transformative in helping us transition to a low carbon economy with positive environmental and social outcomes. We at EAD are working closely with 26 Abu Dhabi entities including the Department of Energy, as members of 'The Abu Dhabi Climate Change Taskforce' to develop climate change policy and related strategic plans to achieve this transformation," she explained. In January 2022, EAD and ENGIE announced the success of Phase II of their Mangrove Rehabilitation Project and, in July 2022, the Abu Dhabi DoE inked a deal to collaborate on energy opportunities with Colombia's Ministry of Mines and Energy. HE Al Dhaheri indicated that the new regulations would contribute to enhancing the efforts made by EAD within the framework of its commitment to the UAE government's sustainability vision. She stated that the EAD is leading a set of framework initiatives to reduce the impact of climate change, including the preparation of the climate change policy for Abu Dhabi, and a comprehensive strategy for the years 2023-2027. She also announced that the EAD is developing a Nexus decision support system that would allow the emirate to achieve policy coherence between water, environment, energy and food. The project would be implemented with the participation of the key custodians of these sectors. This pioneering initiative aims to support the Government of Abu Dhabi in achieving more sustainable utilisation of the natural resources of the Emirate, improved water, energy, and food security and more cost-effective projects and efficient management in the relevant sectors, the statement highlighted. Al Dhaheri noted that in the same context, EAD was developing a scheme in which the emissions and trading ceilings would be determined. The feasibility of implementing the system at the state level is being studied to ensure competitiveness and sustainability. To complement this scheme, there would be existing voluntary programmes, such as the electronic platform for trading carbon credits on the Abu Dhabi Global Market. She added, "We hope the emirate will be the first in the region to implement this initiative, which will further strengthen the UAE's climate leadership role, and support its hosting COP28 next year," said Al Dhaheri. HE Al Marar said the clean energy targets 2035 framework would have a deep impact on the Abu Dhabi energy structure, allowing the broader economy and industrial sector to quickly move in the sustainability direction. He commented, "This will open the door to improved added value and increased productivity for local businesses. These decarbonisation policies will help operationalise the UAE Net Zero 2050 pathways from today. They represent real, live commitments for our people, planet." He added that the speed of transition and deployment of 60% clean and renewable electricity by 2035 would be among the most profound globally. The DoE said that it expects the new regulatory framework to drive a 75% reduction in carbon emissions per MWh produced in Abu Dhabi by 2035, compared to 2016 levels. Abu Dhabi, therefore, will be a leading contributor to the UAE's updated climate targets to achieve a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), relative to business as usual, in 2030 and Net Zero by 2050. The UAE's new targets were published in its 'Second Nationally Determined Contribution' in September ahead of COP27 and as part of the COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact commitments, the statement from EAD highlighted. Abu Dhabi is said to already be making huge strides in the area. In 2021, the DoE introduced the complementary Abu Dhabi Clean Energy Certificates Scheme as an innovative measure to support carbon footprint reduction of power demand and meet the growing interest of corporate clients and households to contribute to the climate change fight, the statement said. Late in September 2022, the EAD said it was awarded LEED certification for three of its facilities and, in October 2022, four cement factories said they would use alternative fuels following a deal with MOCCAE and Emirates RDF. "We are very encouraged by the uptake of this scheme. Commercial entities are purchasing clean energy certificates in increasing numbers to claim the use of low or zero emissions electricity, thereby reducing their carbon footprint. Since electricity generated from clean energy sources is indistinguishable from that produced by any other source, some form of tracking is required. Once the power provider has injected the energy generated from identifiable clean resources into the grid, the Clean Energy Certificates act as a tracking mechanism for the source of clean energy. Entities can then claim the environmental benefits of low carbon energy production in enhancing the sustainable credentials of their product lines," clarified Al Marar. Outlining additional enablers that will help achieve the 2035 target, the EAD statement outlined: Solar power plant site map: Clarity on availability of land and appropriate sites for solar plants will help increase energy generation through clean sources Capacity requirements for energy storage: Accelerated growth in energy storage installations in the Abu Dhabi transmission and distribution grid is essential to store the energy produced through clean sources. Abu Dhabi has already introduced grid-scale advanced facilities in the electricity system as it installed 108MW of distributed sodium sulfur batteries with six hours of energy storage capacity Transmission and distribution grid enhancement: Major coordinated network infrastructure enhancements are required by key stakeholders for connection and operation of safe and secure system for clean energy Flexible natural gas system: Gas system upgrades and storage facilities are needed to provide flexibility for higher penetration of clean energy and support the intermittency of renewable solar PV through dispatchable high-efficiency gas plants. This will be essential until reliable storage systems are developed and become economically viable, robust solutions within the system Electric vehicle (EV) readiness & vehicle-to-grid technology: EVs can help make clean daytime energy available to the grid at night and reduce demand peaks during critical hours. Abu Dhabi recently released the regulatory policy for electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the Emirate, which includes the criteria for establishing a network of EV charging stations across Abu Dhabi Hydrogen production: The DoE has drafted a new hydrogen policy and strategic regulatory framework that will position Abu Dhabi as a competitive hydrogen player globally and contribute to the clean energy targets \</doc>

DUBAI, 23rd November, 2022 (WAM) -- During a high-level meeting at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, a collaboration agreement was signed between Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary-General of the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi (EAD), and Laila Mostafa Abdullatif, Director-General of Emirates Nature-WWF (ENWWF). The collaboration showcases the UAE's commitment to scaling up Nature-based Solutions (NbS) as a key pillar to tackling climate change and nature loss in the lead-up to COP28 to be held in the country next year. With each COP that passes, the urgency to close the emissions gap in addressing the climate emergency becomes ever greater. COP27 has represented a real opportunity to advance dialogue on the nature-climate nexus and the role that NbS can play in supporting climate mitigation and adaptation actions. More and more countries are indeed recognizing that nature can play a key role in global climate action strategies, and this is reflected in an increased number of countries including nature in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A 2021 WWF report found that countries were increasingly recognising the value of NbS in their efforts to address the climate crisis. Some 92% of the updated NDCs assessed in the study included NbS. "The UAE's NDC clearly recognizes the climate adaptation and mitigation co-benefits of natural ecosystems, particularly blue carbon ecosystems. As part of the overall commitments, it includes the conservation, restoration, and expansion of mangrove habitats. In addition, the emirate of Abu Dhabi is targeting the inclusion of a minimum of 20% marine blue carbon habitats within its protected areas. Our collaboration with EAD and Emirates Nature-WWF demonstrates our dedication to maximizing the potential of nature-based solutions. We aim to ensure that our collective efforts are inclusive, transparent, and developed with the needs of local communities in mind, and that their benefits are equally distributed," said Almheiri. The UAE has a remarkable track record of inclusive local and global efforts to combat climate change. And one true evidence of that collective effort is the multi-actor cooperation agreement that was signed by the three partners to implement the NbS project in the UAE. The 'NbS for Climate, Biodiversity & People' project, funded by HSBC through the global philanthropic fund and established under the global initiative of the Climate Solutions Partnership, led by Emirates Nature-WWF regionally and implemented together with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE), the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), and the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA), with the Government of Umm Al Qaiwain as an implementation partner, is already well underway in the region. "We are very proud to be collaborating with MOCCAE and Emirates Nature-WWF to create a solid Nature-based Solution proposition that will enhance coastal ecosystem resilience as part of our efforts on climate change mitigation and adaptation, while delivering benefits for the UAE at large. The success of this collective action will be determined by the advance collaboration among private and public sector, civil society and scientists to increase interest and participation in scaling-up NbS. At EAD we have stressed greatly on Nbs and we have several programmes of which the most important are the Blue Carbon project launched in 2013 and Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative inaugurated in February of this year," commented Dr Al Dhaheri. "Our team has been working meticulously on the ground in the UAE to implement NbS that will conserve, restore, and promote resilient coastal ecosystems which deliver multiple socio-economic benefits; such as climate mitigation and adaptation, food security and sustainable social and economic development. The work has already begun in two highly valuable coastal seascape sites that were selected following a robust evaluation and evidence-based process, informed by scientific data and local ecological knowledge. By bringing more partners on board to drive forward quality NbS projects in the region, we look forward to showcasing positive nature and climate outcomes, while enabling conditions and creating new opportunities that can attract blended financing and public-private participation towards effective design and implementation of NbS in the lead up to COP28," said Laila Abdullatif. The UAE's hosting of COP28 indicates an opportunity to demonstrate at-scale action on the ground, and the NbS collaboration is a concrete hands-on solution in conserving blue carbon ecosystems that will support the UAE's Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative. COP28 will be especially significant as it will provide a platform to present the results of the first global stocktake of national commitments, which in 2023 will assess the collective progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation of the Paris Agreement. As the host of COP28, the UAE will continue building on its climate ambition towards 2023 and beyond and will reflect the voices of all relevant stakeholders to achieve global consensus for practical climate progress. \</doc>

Saudi Arabia says climate activists are "more than wrong" to cast doubt on its ambitions to reduce carbon emissions. COP27 . "We are so proud of what we've been achieving. We are setting an example for hydrocarbon and energy producers." Saudi Arabia's climate targets Saudi Arabia has laid out plans to neutralise planet-warming emissions within its borders by 2060. It has said it will achieve that by planting billions of trees, investing in carbon-capture technology and hydrogen, and boosting its use of solar and wind power. At the same time, itis spending billions of dollars to increase its crude-production capacity to 13 million barrels a day from 12 million. It's also said it will use some sequestered carbon to enhance its extraction from oil fields. That has led to criticism from activists including Greta Thunberg, who said Saudi Arabia is playing down the need to move away from fossil fuels. The Saudi government regularly says companies and investors in the West are trying to transition too quickly. It has pointed to this year's surge in prices as evidence there's been too little investment in oil and natural gas exploration in recent years. "I believe Saudi Arabia will be a producer of hydrocarbons even by the end of the 21st century," Prince Abdulaziz said. "The world needs all sorts of energy." Sign up for our free newsletterSign up The Paris Climate Accords from 2015 were not about "getting rid of sources of energy, but about mitigating emissions," he said. Saudi Arabia has started to build a carbon-capture plant in the eastern port city of Jubail. Once finished in 2027, it should be able to trap 9 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, equivalent to the emissions from about 2 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles over the same period.

(Image: source/xliii/12/images/DX3_8486.jpg) In line with the global buzz around the environment and climate change which was brought to a peak last month during the COP27 conference in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, The Big 5 show in Dubai is set to launch its own initiative to discuss the construction sector's impact on the environment when the premier event opens this month. Global and regional sustainability leaders, innovators, disruptors, and ESG (environmental, social and governance) advisors are expected to attend the inaugural Global Construction Impact Summit at Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) on the third day of the show (December 7), to explore how the industry can collaborate to meet the Middle East's ambitious net-zero targets by 2050. The Big 5, the largest construction industry event in the region, will be held at the DWTC from December 5 to 8. The expo has attracted more than 2,000 exhibitors from 60 countries and 20 national pavilions, who are looking to tap the lucrative opportunities offered by the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region which is riding high on $6.5 trillion projects - $3.5 trillion under way and a further $2.9 trillion in the pipeline, according to the organiser dmg events. The Big 5 aims to help professionals keep abreast of the latest industry trends and standards through its series of CPD-certified Industry Talks. The organiser expects more than 55,000 visitors from over 152 countries to attend The Big 5, which will feature a series of events to complement the showcase of the latest construction products and services displayed by these exhibitors. Among the most-influential industry events, The Big 5 is now a one-stop shop for the global construction community to meet face to face, says dmg events. It covers the full construction cycle across dedicated sectors and six specialised events - The Big 5 Heavy, Middle East Concrete, HVAC R Expo, Middle East Stone, the Urban Design & Landscape Expo, and FM Expo - enabling industry professionals to source solutions for every stage of construction. Middle East Concrete and The Big 5 Heavy will bring together the concrete supply chain and heavy machinery players; Middle East Stone will cater to the regional stone industry; the Urban Design & Landscape Expo will focus on new ground-breaking landscape, infrastructure, and urban development solutions; FM Expo will cater to facilities management professionals offering new technologies to support them in safely maintaining their assets; and finally the HVAC R Expo focuses on providing healthy air-conditioning solutions. Highlighting the importance of the inaugural Global Construction Impact Summit, Ben Greenish, Senior Vice-President of Construction at dmg events, says: "According to the recent World Green Building Council's (WGBC) Beyond Buildings Report, the macro urban built environment is responsible for 75 per cent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, with buildings alone accounting for 37 per cent. The industry must demonstrate a willingness to make changes if we are to meet the WGBC targets for the sector which include achieving at least 40 per cent less embodied carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving 100 per cent net zero emissions by 2050. By driving the shift from high-emission products, for example, to near-zero emission products, the industry can take a significant step forward." Forum for discussion and knowledge sharing ... this year, The Big 5 will launch the Global Construction Impact Summit on the third day of the show. Sustainability Greenish adds that the sustainability spotlight on the Middle East and Africa is shining brighter than ever thanks to the two editions of COP being held in the region - the COP27 , which has just concluded in Egypt, and COP28 in the UAE next year. "It is critical that the construction sector does its part to help both nations realise their commitments on net-zero ambitions. The Global Construction Impact Summit will emerge as a green pathway for the regional industry, which has the chance to demonstrate international leadership by highlighting commitment to national net-zero visions," he says. Discussion topics throughout the day will include how to advance net zero throughout the industry, ESG leadership in construction, the acceleration of change by scaling up solutions and collaboration, achieving zero waste through substitute materials use, and ESG metrics reporting - all focused on applications for the construction industry. Bex Porter, Built Environment Lead, UN High Level Climate Champions team, says: "Having the opportunity to bring the Race to Zero campaign to the upcoming Global Construction Impact Summit is both exciting and timely. Our campaign, backed by the United Nations, is in full swing, but lacking representation from the UAE. We need to continue to drive action and ambition in the region as we look ahead to COP 28 in Dubai. Visitors can view the products and services of 2,000 exhibitors at The Big 5 2022. "We are rallying non-state actors - including companies, cities, regions, financial and educational institutions - to take rigorous and immediate action to halve global emissions by 2030 and deliver a healthier, fairer zero-carbon world in time. In joining the Race to Zero, non-state actors can drive the ambition loop to show policymakers that the sector is stepping up to the needed transformation. On behalf of the team, we look forward to updating the industry on how we are progressing through our plan and hope to find partners to help us deliver our goals." Speakers, delegates, and partners committed to integrating sustainability and net zero into their core businesses will attend and look for collaboration on how the construction ecosystem will support the region's ambitious net-zero targets. Campbell Gray, CEO, Middle East and Africa at Atkins, a member of the SNC-Lavalin Group and the headline sponsors of the summit, says: "As one of the world's leading professional services and project management organisations, we've set Engineering Net Zero as our north star and have been working closely with governments and the private sector to help them meet their net zero targets, manage their climate risk, and build climate resiliency into their portfolios. "This year, we have also published our Engineering Net Zero in the GCC report that outlines key challenges, opportunities, and recommendations to decarbonise the built environment, energy, and transport sectors. The Global Construction Impact Summit provides a strategic platform to connect with key stakeholders and be a part of thought leadership industry discussions that will help the region achieve its low-carbon future. We're also excited to see what discussions happen around both COP27 and COP28, as any new insights will help us deliver informed strategies to support our clients on their net zero targets that will benefit the UAE and the broader region." Industry leaders from around the globe will be available to share their expertise and the latest advancements in the construction sector at The Big 5. Also sponsored by France-based Lafarge, the Global Construction Impact Summit will hear from speakers such as Sarah El Battouty, Chairman Founder of ECOnsult and Global Ambassador, UNFCCC High Level Climate Champions; Matthew Tribe, Managing Director, Planning, Design, and Engineering, Middle East; Majd Fayyad, DSM Strategy and Policy Lead, Supreme Council of Energy; Farah Naz, Sustainability & Innovation Lead, Aecom and Chair, CIBSE UAE; and Ivano Iannelli, Board of Directors, ESG Foundation. Meanwhile, dmg events has also added a new 'Carbon Net-Zero Initiative of the Year category to The Big 5 Construction Impact Awards, which champion net zero initiatives and recognise sustainable development and technological and digital achievements in the construction industry. The finalists include 'Aedas Project: Enoc Future Mobility Station - Dubai Expo 2020'; 'AESG Project: AESG championing carbon reduction across the built industry'; 'Gensler Project: Gensler Cities Climate Challenge (GC3)' and 'Millenium Project: Mindca Green Homes'.

Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary General of the Environment Agency \- Abu Dhabi, and Laila Mostafa Abdullatif, Director General of Emirates Nature-WWF at a high level meeting at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The collaboration between the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE), Environment Agency \- Abu Dhabi (EAD) and Emirates Nature-WWF (ENWWF) is said to demonstrate the UAE's commitment to scaling up NbS as a key pillar to tackling climate change and nature loss in the lead-up to COP28, which will take place in Dubai next year. By enhancing and restoring highly productive and valuable coastal ecosystems \- including mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass habitats \- partners aim to highlight how working with nature can benefit people, nature and climate and make a significant contribution to the UAE's Net Zero 2050 Strategy, a statement from the MOCCAE. In late August 2022, the MOCCAE unveiled a pledge designed to boost the private sector's contribution to the UAE's Net Zero by 2050 initiative and, in early September 2022, the MOCCAE introduced the National Air Quality Agenda 2031. With each COP that passes, the urgency to close the emissions gap in addressing the climate emergency becomes ever greater. COP27 represented a real opportunity to advance dialogue on the nature-climate nexus and the role that NbS can play in supporting climate mitigation and adaptation actions. More and more countries are indeed recognising that nature can play a key role in global climate action strategies, and this is reflected in an increased number of countries including nature in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). A 2021 WWF report found that countries were increasingly recognising the value of NbS in their efforts to address the climate crisis. Some 92% of the updated NDCs assessed in the study included NbS, the statement elaborated. "The UAE's NDC clearly recognises the climate adaptation and mitigation co-benefits of natural ecosystems, particularly blue carbon ecosystems. As part of the overall commitments, it includes the conservation, restoration, and expansion of mangrove habitats. In addition, the emirate of Abu Dhabi is targeting the inclusion of a minimum of 20% marine blue carbon habitats within its protected areas. Our collaboration with EAD and ENWWF emonstrates our dedication to maximising the potential of nature-based solutions. We aim to ensure that our collective efforts are inclusive, transparent, and developed with the needs of local communities in mind, and that their benefits are equally distributed," explained Almheiri. In early October 2022, Global Mission launched a $17bn fund to achieve the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals and, later in the month, four cement factories agreed to use alternative fuels following a deal with MOCCAE and Emirates RDF. The 'NbS for Climate, Biodiversity & People' project, funded by HSBC through the global philanthropic fund and established under the global initiative of the Climate Solutions Partnership, led by ENWWF regionally and implemented together with the MOCCAE, EAD, and the International Center for Biosaline Agriculture (ICBA), with the Government of Umm Al Quwain as an implementation partner, is already well underway in the region, the statement pointed out. "We are very proud to be collaborating with MOCCAE and ENWWF to create a solid NbS proposition that will enhance coastal ecosystem resilience as part of our efforts on climate change mitigation and adaptation, while delivering benefits for the UAE at large. The success of this collective action will be determined by the advance collaboration among private and public sector, civil society and scientists to increase interest and participation in scaling-up NbS. At EAD we have stressed greatly on NbS and we have several programmes of which the most important are the Blue Carbon project launched in 2013 and Abu Dhabi Mangrove Initiative inaugurated in February of this year," commented Al Dhaheri. The UAE's hosting of COP28 indicates an opportunity to demonstrate at-scale action on the ground, and the NbS collaboration is a concrete hands-on solution in conserving blue carbon ecosystems that will support the UAE's Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative, the statement explained. In early November 2022, Abu Dhabi environment and energy agencies unveiled a 60% clean electricity plan for the emirate by 2035. Abdullatif remarked, "Our team has been working meticulously on the ground in the UAE to implement NbS that will conserve, restore, and promote resilient coastal ecosystems which deliver multiple socio-economic benefits; such as climate mitigation and adaptation, food security and sustainable social and economic development. The work has already begun in two highly valuable coastal seascape sites that were selected following a robust evaluation and evidence-based process, informed by scientific data and local ecological knowledge. By bringing more partners on board to drive forward quality NbS projects in the region, we look forward to showcasing positive nature and climate outcomes, while enabling conditions and creating new opportunities that can attract blended financing and public-private participation towards effective design and implementation of NbS in the lead up to COP28." COP28 is expected to be significant as it will provide a platform to present the results of the first global stocktake of national commitments, which in 2023 will assess the collective progress on mitigation, adaptation, and means of implementation of the Paris Agreement. As the host of COP28, the UAE will continue building on its climate ambition towards 2023 and beyond and will reflect the voices of all relevant stakeholders to achieve global consensus for practical climate progress, the statement concluded. \</doc>

Temperatures in some parts of the region have topped 50\'b0C in recent weeks Dried up riverbed of the Zayandeh Roud river that no longer runs under the 400-year-old Si-o-seh Pol bridge in Isfahan, Iran. Photo: AFP Temperatures in the Middle East have risen far faster than the world's average in the past three decades. Precipitation has been decreasing, and experts predict droughts will come with greater frequency and severity. In Iraq, intensified sandstorms have repeatedly smothered cities this year, shutting down commerce and sending thousands to hospitals. Rising soil salinity in Egypt's Nile Delta is eating away at crucial farmland. In Afghanistan, drought has helped fuel the migration of young people from their villages, searching for jobs. In recent weeks, temperatures in some parts of the region have topped 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). This year's annual UN climate change conference, known as COP27 , is being held in Egypt in November, throwing a spotlight on the region. Governments across the Middle East have awakened to the dangers of climate change, particularly to the damage it is already inflicting on their economies. "We're literally seeing the effects right in front of us. ... These impacts are not something that will hit us nine or 10 years down the line," said Lama El Hatow, an environmental climate change consultant who has worked with the World Bank and specializes on the Middle East and North Africa. "More and more states are starting to understand that it's necessary" to act, she said. Egypt, Morocco and other countries in the region have been stepping up initiatives for clean energy. But a top priority for them at COP-27 is to push for more international funding to help them deal with the dangers they are already facing from climate change. One reason for the Middle East's vulnerability is that there is simply no margin to cushion the blow on millions of people as the rise in temperatures accelerates: The region already has high temperatures and limited water resources even in normal circumstances. Middle East governments have a limited ability to adapt, the International Monetary Fund noted in a report earlier this year. Economies and infrastructure are weak. Poverty is widespread, making job creation a priority over climate protection. At the same time, developing nations are pressuring countries in the Mideast and elsewhere to make emissions cuts, even as they themselves backslide on promises. The threats are dire. In Egypt, precipitation has fallen 22 per cent in the past 30 years, according to the World Bank. Droughts are expected to become more frequent and severe. The Eastern Mediterranean recently saw its worst drought in 900 years, according to NASA, a heavy blow to countries like Syria and Lebanon where agriculture relies on rainfall. Demand for water in Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries is putting unsustainable pressure on underground water aquifers. In Iraq, the increased aridity has caused an increase in sandstorms. At the same time, warming waters and air make extreme and often destructive weather events more frequent, like deadly floods that have repeatedly hit Sudan and Afghanistan. The climate damage has potentially dangerous social repercussions. Many of those who lose the livelihoods they once made in agriculture or tourism will move to the cities in search of jobs, said Karim Elgendy, an associate fellow at Chatham House. That will likely increase urban unemployment, strain social services and could raise social tensions and affect security, said Elgendy, who is also a non-resident scholar with the Middle East Institute. Adapting infrastructure and economies to weather the damage will be enormously expensive: The equivalent of 3.3 per cent of the region's GDP every year for the next 10 years, the IMF estimates. The spending needs to go toward everything from creating more efficient water use systems and new agricultural methods to building coastal protections, beefing up social safety nets and improving awareness campaigns. So one of top priorities for Mideast and other developing nations at this year's COP is to press the United States, Europe and other wealthier nations to follow through on long-time promises to provide them with billions in climate financing. So far, developed nations have fallen short on those promises. Also, most of the money they have provided has gone to helping poorer countries pay for reducing greenhouse gas emissions - for "mitigation," in U.N. terminology, as opposed to "adaptation." For this year's COP, the top theme repeated by UN officials, the Egyptian hosts and climate activists is the implementation of commitments. The gathering aims to push countries to spell out how they will reach promised emission reduction targets - and to come up with even deeper cuts, since experts say the targets as they are now will still lead to disastrous levels of warming. Developing nations will also want richer countries to show how they will carry out a promise from the last COP to provide $500 billion in climate financing over the next five years - and to ensure at least half that funding is for adaptation, not mitigation. World events, however, threaten to undercut the momentum from COP26. On emissions cuts, the spike in world energy prices and the war in Ukraine have prompted some European countries to turn back to coal for power generation - though they insist it's only a temporary step. The Middle East also has several countries whose economies rely on their fossil fuel resources - Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf most obviously, but also Egypt, with its increasing natural gas production. Persistent inflation and the possibility of recession could make top nations hesitant on making climate financing commitments. With international officials often emphasising emission reduction, El Hatow said it should be remembered the countries of Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere in the developing world have not contributed substantially to climate change, yet are bearing the brunt of it. "We need to talk about financing for adaptation," she said, "to adapt to a problem they did not cause." \</doc>

GENEVA, 30th October, 2022 (WAM) -- Cross-border investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation is projected to decline in 2022 against the backdrop of a global investment downturn, according to a new report published by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Citing a bleak outlook for global foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022, the report released in the lead-up to the UN climate change conference COP27 shows the number of new investment projects falling across most industries, notably those tackling climate change. Between January and September 2022, climate mitigation and adaptation sectors had, respectively, 7 percent and 12 percent fewer new projects announced, in stark contrast to the previous year's strong acceleration. Most mitigation investments are in renewable energy and, to a lesser extent, in various energy efficiency projects. Overall, developed economies made up two thirds of international project finance deals and greenfield investments in renewables. Europe alone accounted for more than half of renewables' projects, with more than 700 in the first three quarters of 2022. North America and developing Asia attracted about 200 projects each, while Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa had about 150 and 100 respectively. The report found that new investment project announcements - an indicator of forward trends - weakened in the first three quarters of 2022, while pointing to the ongoing tightening financial conditions and higher investor uncertainty. The number of greenfield project announcements - mostly in manufacturing - dropped by 10 percent, whereas that of international project finance deals - mostly in infrastructure - stagnated at the 2021 level. In both cases, monthly numbers show a downward trend. The biggest declines in new investment projects were registered in developed economies and in Latin America and Central Asia. According to the report, project numbers fell across most industries, with a few exceptions, notably in extractives and petrochemicals. In terms of value, greenfield projects still experienced growth, due to a few large announcements concentrated in electricity and gas supply. \</doc>

CABU DHABI, 6th November 2022 (WAM) - From November 6 to 18, the eyes of the world will be on the 27th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The UAE is a key participant at the talks, prior to hosting COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference, next year. But what is a COP and why does it matter to the world? Historical Context In 1949, the UN Scientific Conference on the &lsquo;Conservation and Utilization of Resources' formally addressed the depletion of natural resources and the need to manage them for social and economic development for the first time. More than two decades later, this resulted in the UN Conference on the Human Environment, also known as the Stockholm Conference, in 1972. The Stockholm Declaration observed that &ldquo;a point has been reached in history when we must shape our actions throughout the world with a more prudent care for their environmental consequences.&rdquo; It outlined 26 principles, all of which remain relevant today. The conference inspired the creation of the UN Environment Program (UNEP), which adopted the first international instrument on climate in 1979, the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The US scientist Wallace Broecker coined the term &lsquo;global warming' as the title of a scientific paper four years earlier. Evidence of Climate Change With evidence of climate change emerging in the 1980s, such as &lsquo;acid rain' in Europe and North America, UNEP recommended limiting the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), commonly used in aerosols, packing materials and refrigerators, to protect the Earth's ozone layer. The ozone layer helps absorb the sun's radiation, preventing it from reaching the planet's surface. This led to the adoption of the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer in 1985, followed by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer in 1987. The UAE signed the Vienna and Montreal treaties in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Birth of COP The global scientific community came together at the Second World Climate Conference in Geneva, in 1992, to highlight the risk of climate change. The UN Conference on Environment and Development took place the same year in Rio de Janeiro. The Rio Earth Summit conceived the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Convention to Combat Desertification. All three are intrinsically linked. Since its adoption, the UNFCCC has become the centerpiece of the international community's effort to combat global warming. By March 1994, 165 countries had signed the UNFCCC. The UAE ratified the Convention in 1995. Countries that ratify the UNFCCC are called Parties to the Convention. The Conference of the Parties (COP) is the convention's ultimate authority. The first COP session was held in Berlin in 1995, leading to the Berlin Mandate, which called on governments &ldquo;to establish specific, legally binding targets and timetables for reducing developed country emissions of greenhouse gases.&rdquo; COP meetings take place annually and there have been several historic COPs since Berlin. Each gathering now receives tens of thousands of participants, and more than 100 heads of state. The formal negotiations take place within a dedicated area known as the Blue Zone. Another space, the Green Zone, is reserved for business and civil society participants. Historic COPs The Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, agreed at COP3 in 1997, bound developed nations to reduce their overall carbon emissions to 5 percent below their level in 1990. COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 introduced the now familiar global warming threshold of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 in Paris in 2015 succeeded the Kyoto Protocol. It bound countries to declare nationally determined contributions to arrest climate change, or NDCs. It also committed them to limiting global warming to no more than 2 degrees, and ideally no higher 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UAE was the first Arab world nation to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement. Negotiated & Non-Negotiated Outcomes Since Paris, there are both &lsquo;negotiated' and &lsquo;non-negotiated' outcomes at every COP. The first relate to the text of the Paris Agreement itself. The second are positions adopted by likeminded countries outside the UNFCCC process. These help to maintain the forward momentum of the talks, particularly when multilateral government on certain issues is elusive. COP26 in Glasgow last year was notable for mobilizing countries, and indeed the private sector, around pledges to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. The UAE announced its Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative on the eve of the Glasgow negotiations in 2020, inspiring other Middle East nations to issue their own commitments. The focus of COP27 COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference in the UAE will be another historic COP, as it will deliver the first Global Stocktake, or GST, of the nationally determined contributions made since Paris. It will be held at Expo City in Dubai, the highly sustainable venue purposely built to house Expo 2020, which welcomed more than 20 million visitors in 2020 and 2021. \</doc>

Human influence over the climate and environment has become apparent since the Industrial Revolution. The trend has accelerated in the second half of the twentieth century. Because of this, the climate change conversation has become increasingly urgent and it is one that developed and developing economies are grappling with. The world looks with trepidation at the consequences of climate change. Reduced food and water security and intensity of weather extremes are consequences that will impact all nations directly or indirectly, with the most profound immediate effects being felt by the global south. With a focus on Egypt as the COP27 host country, this article will focus on the climate-friendly efforts by the Egyptian Government and provide some insights on Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, the seventh High-Level Champion for Climate Action for COP27 . At an institutional level, the Ministry of Environment was established in 1997 through which all climate efforts are managed. As climate change is becoming a more pressing global matter, the Egyptian National Climate Change Council was founded in 2015 as the national Egyptian authority concerned with climate change, which combines relevant ministries under one government body. At the policy level, the Government bodies are incentivizing environmentally conscious investments in tax and customs relief, and real estate ownership for strategic and sustainable activities. The combined efforts of the Egyptian Government through its regulatory bodies are manifested in several sectors. In the energy sector, the Egyptian Government has adopted a feed-in-tariff mechanism in the power generation sector including for private investors. Through individual efforts in households or enterprise contributions to solar and wind farms, the fossil fuel dependency would decrease, in line with Egypt Vision 2030's sustainable environment goal. Egypt is aiming toward the preservation of both development and the environment together through the rational use of resources in a way that preserves the rights of future generations in a more secure and adequate way. The Government believes this is achievable by facing the effects of climate change, enhancing the resilience of ecosystems and the ability to face natural hazards and disasters, increasing reliance on renewable energy and adopting sustainable consumption and production patterns. The Government had also initiated multiple waste projects including waste management and waste-to-energy plants. On the mass transportation front, the Government has started a major overhaul in the transit infrastructure including metro upgrade, electric high-speed rail, electric light rail and an electric run bus rapid transit system. Combined with green energy initiatives, this would lead to a significant carbon footprint reduction in Cairo; the capital known to be congested and polluted. In the industrial sector, the major contribution of the Government is witnessed in the \' Egyptian Programme for promoting Industrial Power Efficiency'. The first meeting of the working group was last June aiming at a policy reform that would be required for a major change towards more efficient industrial utilization of power. On water resources, the Government initiated several programs such as water desalination using solar energy, protection of shore lines, rehabilitation of irrigation canals, solar pumping for irrigation and modernization of on-farm practices. That feeds directly into agricultural programs that include the enhancement of agricultural production for adaptation to climate change, rehabilitation of agricultural areas and on-farm irrigation development programs. The Government programs have also included urban development where there is growing appetite for building green cities. In addition to governmental efforts at a policy and infrastructure level, there are more plans for green projects including biodegradable plastic, biofuel production and recycling in which the private sector will have a key role. Financing Government green ambitions has also been a focus of innovation. To further the goals of the sustainable development strategy enshrined in Egypt Vision 2030, the Government issued a five-year term green bond for the first time in 2020. Being the first of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa, the bond directed finance to greener solutions such as low-carbon mass transit, renewable energy, pollution prevention and control, energy efficiency, climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable water and wastewater management. From a global viewpoint, the high-level climate champion is one who takes forward the Paris Agreement Agenda. Dr. Mahmoud Moheildin, the current and seventh UN high-level climate champion contributed with his work on the environment before the Paris Agreement. Having 30 years of working experience in the public sector and at the International Monetary Fund, Dr. Mohieldin contributed to the creation of the United Nations' global sustainable development goals. With the thirteenth goal comprising climate action, it is becoming a pressing matter to take the necessary steps. Coral reef degradation and disappearance, rising sea levels, droughts, climate disasters and the rising temperatures are key issues. Since humanity is a contributing factor, Dr. Mohieldin is a firm believer that investment in human capital is fundamental to address climate challenges. Noting the costs of fighting climate challenges, Dr. Mohieldin believes that  with the climate gaps being in trillions of US Dollars, the private sector isn't the singular answer, but it has a big role . The private sector's involvement is encouraged on on two levels; the first is financing by way of public-private partnerships in green projects, and the second is compliance with governmental sustainable policies. The key to private sector participation is, according to Dr. Mohieldin, commercial viability. The private sector by nature seeks to monetize opportunities, which is not the ultimate goal of a public sector that is seeking the broader goal of sustainable development. The two agendas are complementary \- with government setting a policy framework that the private sector can then use as a platform for sustainable investment. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 13th November, 2022 (WAM) - Greater investment in sustainable food cold chains is needed to reduce hunger, provide livelihoods to communities, and adapt to climate change, two UN agencies said in a report launched at the COP27 climate change conference underway in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. These systems are critical to maintaining the quality, nutritional value and safety of food, especially as an estimated 14 per cent of all food produced for human consumption is lost before it even reaches consumers. "At a time when the international community must act to address the climate and food crises, sustainable food cold chains can make a massive difference," said Inger Andersen, the UNEP Executive Director. "They allow us to reduce food loss, improve food security, slow greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs, reduce poverty and build resilience - all in one fell swoop." Food waste is happening as the number of hungry people worldwide rose to 828 million in 2021, or 46 million more than in the previous year. In 2020, nearly 3.1 billion people could not afford a healthy diet, up 112 million from 2019, as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic drove up inflation. This year, the crisis in Ukraine has threatened global food security. The report argues that developing countries could save a staggering 144 million tonnes of food annually if they reached the same level of food cold chain infrastructure as richer nations.The report contains recommendations that include quantifying the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in existing food cold chains, establishing benchmarks, and identifying opportunities for reductions. Sustainable food cold chains can also make an important difference in efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), according to FAO Director-General Dongyu Qu. "All stakeholders can help implement the findings of this report, to transform agrifood systems to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable - for better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life for all, leaving no one behind," he said. \</doc>

By Ghalia Taman Underneath the temple of the ancient city of Egypt's Taposiris Magna, archeologists worked hard in search of the tomb of the legendary Cleopatra. During their extensive excavation, they ended up stumbling upon a massive tunnel dubbed the "Geometric Miracle." This large structure was found 13 meters below the surface of the earth and ended up generating a newfound spark toward unraveling its story and formation. Leading this excavation was Kathleen Martinez, an archaeologist at the University of Santo Domingo who has been in search of Cleopatra's tomb for over two decades. Her discovery of the tunnel is considered a pivotal breakthrough in bringing her a step closer to finding Cleopatra's tomb. During an interview with National Geographic, Martinez expressed how there is a one percent chance that the tunnel might guide her to the infamous tomb as she also found burial shafts containing Greco-Roman burials, so to her, this may mean that Cleopatra and Mark Anthony may have been placed in similar tombs. Read More: What COP27 When it comes to the tunnel itself, this special structure dates back to the Ptolemaic period (304 BC to 30 BC), a time when Egypt was under the rule of kings that were descendants of one of Alexander the Great's generals. Standing 2-meters tall, it is said that to create this tunnel a staggering 1,305 meters of sandstone were hacked through, requiring extensive effort and labor. As the archaeologists explored its interiors, they also discovered that a part of the tunnel was submerged under the Mediterranean water but what made this structure truly miraculous is how it continued to exist even after withstanding several earthquakes over many years. The "Geometric Miracle" is not the only fascinating discovery made by the team of archaeologists as they have previously uncovered coins engraved with the faces of Cleopatra and Alexander the Great in addition to beheaded statues that included statues of the goddess Isis. It's almost becoming a norm where discoveries are made left and right, with just yesterday, 100 mummies and a special pyramid were found near King Tut's tomb. WE SAID THIS: Don't Miss...

Lauded for its commitment to sustainability, the university continues to be a leader among its peers in terms of environmentally-friendly initiatives Sustainability is of strategic importance to American University of Sharjah (AUS), with the university leading sustainability initiatives in the region's higher education sector over recent years. In 2020, AUS became the first university in the UAE to ban single-use plastics on campus. The university has recently launched its first Climate Action Plan, which will align AUS' efforts with the UAE's Net Zero by 2050 initiative. At a student level, EcoReps-students with a desire to promote sustainable change on campus-are an integral part of campus life, with these volunteers educating the broader AUS community on issues such as waste reduction and energy conservation. Students can also make sustainability a key part of their academic experience, regardless of their chosen major, with AUS offering a total of 23 undergraduate and 18 graduate courses focused on solving sustainability challenges. AUS researchers are also at the heart of many ground-breaking projects helping to minimise the impacts of climate change and pollution, with 24 per cent of AUS faculty engaged in research related to sustainability. From using ionic liquids to clean caustic wastewater to developing a mathematical model to enhance the effectiveness of solar panels, AUS researchers are fostering solutions to some of this generation's most pressing environmental challenges. For this year's COP27 event held in Egypt, the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment invited AUS representatives to join the official UAE delegation, with a group of four AUS students presenting at the event's UAE Pavilion about bringing sustainability into the classroom. AUS also expects to play an important role at COP28, to be held in the UAE next year. AUS has been internationally recognised for its commitment to sustainability. In 2018, the university was the first in the GCC to be rated for sustainability, earning a Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System bronze award for sustainability in higher education from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). Recently, AUS was named as one of the top five institutions worldwide for community engagement in sustainability by the 2022 Sustainable Campus Index issued by AASHE.

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, said that COP28 will be the most important event hosted by the nation in 2023. Sheikh Mohammed was addressing the UAE Government Annual Meetings, which reviewed the significance of the UAE hosting COP28 next year. During the session, Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, highlighted the importance of the UAE hosting COP28. He said the determination of the UAE, its strong diplomatic relations with global nations and pragmatic position on climate action, underpinned by proven experience in the energy and sustainability sectors led to the nation securing the international consensus in 2021 to host COP28 in 2023. History of environmental awareness in UAE Dr. Al Jaber highlighted the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, in promoting sustainable development and environmental protection. "The late Sheikh Zayed laid the foundations of environmental sustainability and climate action that we have built on in the past decades. "Today, we have a proven track record of reducing emissions, accelerating the growth of renewable energy and enabling the energy transition," said Dr. Al Jaber. He also provided examples of the UAE's achievements over the years, including stopping gas flaring since the 1970s under the directives of the late Sheikh Zayed. Dr. Al Jaber said that led by the vision and directives of President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Masdar was launched in 2006 as the region's first renewable energy and sustainability initiative. Today, Masdar has implemented several clean energy projects globally, including a solar-powered desalination project as well as a project to study the feasibility of low wind speed turbines. Dr. Al Jaber said the first phase of the Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park was launched in 2013, another testament to the country's commitment to promoting renewable energy. Dr. Al Jaber said the UAE was the first country in the region to ratify the Paris Agreement and to announce a strategic initiative to achieve Net Zero by 2050. The UAE also hosts the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency. Dr. Al Jaber said the UAE has invested more than $50bn in clean energy projects in 70 countries including 40 developing nations, and the recently announced the UAE-US Partnership to Accelerate the Transition to Clean Energy (PACE). The project will catalyse $100bn in financing, investment, and other support and will deploy 100 gigawatts of clean energy globally. "The COP is a global political, economic, scientific and social platform to achieve commitments to reduce the impact of climate change through negotiations and to assess the progress in climate action," said Dr. Al Jaber. He added 27 COP events have been held so far, including COP21 which was a milestone moment that witnessed the landmark Paris Agreement. Dr. Al Jaber stressed that the UAE is committed to advancing climate action based on the outcomes of the past summits, including COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, which made significant progress in many areas including the landmark agreement to establish a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' the launch of the Just Energy Transition in the Energy Sector work program and many others. He said that COP28, which will be hosted in the UAE in 2023 at Expo City Dubai, will be an important global event coinciding with the UAE National Day, adding that the event will welcome high-level participation including over 140 heads of state and government leaders, more than 80,000 delegates and more than 5,000 media professionals.

A newly-formed group of leading hardware manufacturers are set to meet to discuss how to reduce emissions across the semiconductor supply chain. Members of the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC), made up of the likes of Intel, Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, TSMC, AMD, Google, and Microsoft, will hold sessions at the COP27 climate conference in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt. The semiconductor industry's carbon footprint remains a huge problem; despite the growing use of renewable energy to power semiconductor manufacturing, hardware manufacturing activities continue to dominate the carbon output of the largest tech firms, if recent research from Havard University is to be believed. SCC aims The founding members have all affirmed their support for the Paris Agreement and related accords driving the 1.5 C pathway, and claim that they are aligned on the need "to drive climate progress within the semiconductor value chain". The SCC was conceptualized by companies meeting under the SEMI Sustainability Initiative and says it will continue to focus on non-climate related Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) issues. The body claims to be the first global collaboration by semiconductor ecosystem companies focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain. The consortium's members say they are committed to working toward a number of objectives including collaboration and alignment on common approaches, technology innovations, and communications channels to continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the group's aims include pushing for more publicly reported progress on Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions annually as well as a setting near- and long-term decarbonization targets with the aim of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) announced a collaboration and strategic investment partnership, mobilising up to $1 billion for financing of green energy transition and renewable energy projects. The financing will be extended to projects in both public and private sectors. The investment partnership, announced at the ongoing COP27 meet in Egypt, would see the two institutions identifying co-financing opportunities for projects and programmes of common interest in grid-based renewables, distributed renewables and fossil fuel transitioning areas. The partnership deal followed extensive cooperation between AIIB and GEAPP over the past year. This is the first time AIIB partnered with a global philanthropic foundations-led initiative. The capital will be directed to those countries eligible to AIIB's financing activities and that meet the multilateral development bank's strategies and policies, while also being areas of GEAPP activity in alignment with and furtherance of GEAPP's charitable objectives. AIIB President Jin Liqun said despite challenges last year, AIIB achieved a 48 percent climate finance share of total approvals in 2021. "Through our timely collaboration, AIIB will continue striving to find new ways to provide our members with access to additional capital and resources. We highly anticipate a fruitful collaboration with fellow members of the platform and look forward to paving the way towards the greater, greener good," he said. Simon Harford, CEO of GEAPP, said clean energy generation grew by 522 TWh last year, about a quarter of what is needed to end energy poverty. However, most of this generation occurred in developed countries, he said. "As a global multilateral development bank, AIIB has the capital, convening power and commitment to invest in innovative, clean energy projects across developing countries, which makes the bank an ideal partner to join GEAPP. Together we will deliver transformational projects that accelerate and scale the energy transition for communities in Asia and beyond," Harford said.

By Belal Nawar The National News reported that hackers targeted official websites in Bahrain just hours before the start of a parliamentary election to elect the 40 members of the Council of Representatives. While the Ministry of Interior did not yet identify all the websites targeted, the country's state-run Bahrain News Agency (BNA) could not be reached online, nor could the website for Bahrain's parliament. In a series of screenshots taken by internet users, many speculated that the hack was carried out by an unknown account called Al-Toufan, or "The Flood" in Arabic. These are merely speculations as no evidence can pinpoint yet a suspect in this cyberattack. The country claimed it had been the subject of a "state-backed hack in an attempt to undermine the voting process" in a statement to The Associated Press. However, the state suspected of carrying out the attack was not identified. The attack had no impact on the voting process since all systems were up and running during the election. Even Bahrain's official television broadcasted images of individuals casting their ballots, and the country's 55 polling places reported that the election went "smoothly." In a statement by The Guardian, there was a ban on candidates including two main opposition groups: the Shia Al-Wefaq and secular Waad parties which were dissolved in 2016 and 2017. This comes as the Deputy Secretary-General of the Bahraini political party Al-Wefaq, Sheikh Hussain Al-Daihi, announced that his party is boycotting the general elections. The reasons justifying this boycott are said to be diverse but mainly concern the failure to implement a crucial reform in the country.

The government also claimed that Individuals who "intentionally harm or disrupt the constitutional and parliamentary process" will be prohibited from running for office and participating in upcoming elections. In this election, Bahrainis are choosing 40 members for the lower house of parliament, the Council of Representatives, as well as 30 members of the municipality council. According to the final lists, a total of 507 candidates are taking part in the elections, including 94 women, BNA stated. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 8th November,2022 (WAM) - In partnership with Belgium, Egypt announced today the launch of the Global Renewable Hydrogen Forum, which aims at establishing a permanent platform for dialogue between hydrogen-producing countries and hydrogen-consuming countries and the private sector, organisations and financial institutions operating in this field. The dialogue's main objective is to coordinate policies and procedures and create paths for trade and investment in hydrogen, thus contributing to accelerating the pace of the just transition we aspire to have. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi launched the forum at a Round Table on "Investing in the Future of Energy: Green Hydrogen", held on the sidelines of COP27 . "Green hydrogen"has probably become the most commonly used term in the past few years in the context of making a shift to renewable energy and reducing reliance on traditional energy sources. This comes at a time particularly when the energy crisis that the world is currently going through is imposing on us all a real challenge in securing energy supply which our countries need, thus avoiding breaching duties with regard to facing the global climate crisis or falling short of the goals we agreed upon and the national policies through which we contribute to this effort. And here comes the green hydrogen as one of the most prominent solutions, in terms of making a shift to green economy in the coming years. It represents a real opportunity for economic development that is compatible with efforts to confront climate change and the Paris Agreement goals,' President El-Sisi said. In fact, he added, many countries have already begun to take serious steps in this direction, whether through formulating national hydrogen policies or setting ambitious time-bound goals for the gradual transition to green hydrogen, as a main source of energy, either through local production, import or both. Egypt was one of the first of these countries that have realized early on the opportunities available in this field, based on its huge potential in the production of clean energy. This, in turn, would enable it to become a global hub for green hydrogen production in the medium and long term. The round-table brings together some of the largest hydrogen-producing and hydrogen-consuming countries and heads of organizations and companies operating in this sector. \</doc>

LONDON, 8th November,2022 (WAM) -- "Our job is to create jobs," UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili told tourism sector leaders as education, sustainability, and governance took centre stage at the Ministers' Summit at the World Travel Market. This consolidated platform for public and private sector leaders addresses tourism's most pressing issues and sets the agenda for the years ahead. Held around the theme of &lsquo;Rethinking Tourism', the 16th Summit gathered Ministers and high-level delegates from 19 countries, alongside business leaders. Reflecting the heightened relevance of tourism for cross-cutting economic and social wellbeing, this year's edition was the most successful to date. Opening the event, Secretary-General Pololikashvili emphasised the unique opportunity to transform the sector. However, with UNWTO data showing that global tourism now at around 70% of pre-pandemic levels, "the window of opportunity will not stay open forever. We need to rethink tourism: as a provider of jobs, an economic pillar, and, against the backdrop of COP27 , as a solution to the climate emergency". Presenting an overview of UNWTO's work leading the transformation of tourism, Secretary-General Pololikashvili focused on investing in sustainable infrastructure and in people, most notably through quality education and providing decent jobs. Echoing UNWTO's position, Juliette Losardo, Exhibition Director at World Travel Markets, noted that "a post-pandemic world has revealed exciting opportunities, and given us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reconsider tourism and ask ourselves how we can rebuild and better prepare for the future". Julia Simpson, President and CEO of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), which co-organises the Summit with UNWTO, emphasized the "talent, speed and capital" of the private sector. While the Summit promoted diversity of thought, background and experiences, a focus on tourism's unique power as a driver of sustainability and as a promoter of peace and understanding proved a common theme. High-level participants emphasized that now is the time for the tourism sector to focus more on cooperation rather than competition. Ministers also acknowledged UNWTO Secretary-General Pololikashvili's call for tourism to be mainstreamed within the political agenda and for greater collaboration between ministries of tourism and those of economy, business and environment. \</doc>

The Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), in partnership with the Department of Energy (DoE), is leading a fundamental shift in Abu Dhabi's energy mix to achieve significantly lower carbon emissions in the Emirate. The new regulations, drafted by the DoE, will see 60% of the Emirate's electricity being generated from clean and renewable sources by 2035, and up to 75% reduction in carbon emissions per MWh produced by the electricity sector. The DoE's 'Clean Energy Strategic Target 2035 for Electricity Production in Abu Dhabi' regulatory framework is the first legally binding clean and renewable energy target in the Middle East for the electricity sector. At a press briefing at the United Nation's annual climate summit, COP27 , in Egypt, Her Excellency Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary General of EAD, unveiled the new regulations with DoE Chairman, His Excellency Awaidha Murshed Al Marar. Key Highlights:  The target to produce 60% of all electricity using clean sources by 2035 is an important step towards meeting UAE's Net Zero aspirations by 2050.  The speed of transition and deployment of 60% clean and renewable electricity by 2035 would be among the most profound globally.  The DoE expects the new regulatory framework to drive a 75% reduction in carbon emissions per MWh produced in Abu Dhabi by 2035, compared to 2016 levels.  Abu Dhabi, therefore, will be a leading contributor to the UAE's updated climate targets to achieve a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, relative to business as usual, in 2030 and net zero by 2050. Original Press Release: Nov. 9 -- Abu Dhabi Department of Energy issued the following news release: The Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), in partnership with the Department of Energy (DoE), is leading a fundamental shift in Abu Dhabi's energy mix to achieve significantly lower carbon emissions in the Emirate. This will be achieved through new regulations aimed at generating a large proportion of Emirate of Abu Dhabi's electricity from clean and renewable sources by 2035, marking a significant milestone in the UAE's journey to deliver carbon neutrality by 2050.

The DoE's 'Clean Energy Strategic Target 2035 for Electricity Production in Abu Dhabi' regulatory framework is the first legally binding clean and renewable energy target in the Middle East for the electricity sector. It forms part of an ongoing energy transition to accelerate the UAE's decarbonisation and green growth efforts. At a press briefing at the United Nation's annual climate summit, COP27 , in Egypt, Her Excellency Dr. Shaikha Salem Al Dhaheri, Secretary General of EAD, unveiled the new regulations with DoE Chairman, His Excellency Awaidha Murshed Al Marar. HE Al Dhaheri said the new regulations would promote economic diversification, attract domestic and foreign investment, and encourage technology development and innovations in the clean and renewable energy space. "The target to produce 60% of all electricity using clean sources by 2035 is an important step towards meeting UAE's Net Zero aspirations by 2050. Planned investment of billions of dirhams in clean energy infrastructure will be transformative in helping us transition to a low carbon economy with positive environmental and social outcomes. We, at EAD, are working closely with 26 Abu Dhabi entities, including the Department of Energy, as members of 'The Abu Dhabi Climate Change Taskforce', to develop climate change policy and related strategic plans to achieve this transformation." Several climate change policies and initiatives on the cards HE Al Dhaheri indicated that the new regulations would contribute to enhancing the efforts made by EAD within the framework of its commitment to the UAE government's sustainability vision. She added that the EAD is leading a set of framework initiatives to reduce the impact of climate change, including the preparation of the climate change policy for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and a comprehensive strategy for the years 2023-2027. Her Excellency also announced that EAD is developing a Nexus decision support system that would allow the Emirate of Abu Dhabi to achieve policy coherence between Water, Environment, Energy and Food. The project would be implemented with the participation of the key custodians of these sectors. This pioneering initiative aims to support the Government of Abu Dhabi in achieving more sustainable utilisation of the natural resources of the Emirate, improved water, energy, and food security and more cost-effective projects and efficient management in the relevant sectors. Al Dhaheri noted that in the same context, EAD was developing a scheme in which the emissions and trading ceilings would be determined. The feasibility of implementing the system at the state level is being studied to ensure competitiveness and sustainability. To complement this scheme, there would be existing voluntary programmes, such as the electronic platform for trading carbon credits on the Abu Dhabi Global Market. "We hope the emirate will be the first in the region to implement this initiative, which will further strengthen the UAE's climate leadership role, and support its hosting COP28 next year," said Al Dhaheri. Climate benefits of the 60% clean electricity target by 2035 HE Al Marar said the clean energy targets 2035 framework would have a deep impact on the Abu Dhabi energy structure, allowing the broader economy and industrial sector to quickly move in the sustainability direction. "This will open the door to improved added value and increased productivity for local businesses," he noted. "These decarbonisation policies will help operationalise the UAE net zero 2050 pathways from today. They represent real, live commitments for our people, planet." He added that the speed of transition and deployment of 60% clean and renewable electricity by 2035 would be among the most profound globally. The DoE expects the new regulatory framework to drive a 75% reduction in carbon emissions per MWh produced in Abu Dhabi by 2035, compared to 2016 levels. Abu Dhabi, therefore, will be a leading contributor to the UAE's updated climate targets to achieve a 31% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, relative to business as usual, in 2030 and net zero by 2050. The UAE's new targets were published in its 'Second Nationally Determined Contribution' in September ahead of COP27 and as part of the COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact commitments. Abu Dhabi is already making huge strides in this area. In 2021, the DoE introduced the complementary Abu Dhabi Clean Energy Certificates Scheme as an innovative measure to support carbon footprint reduction of power demand and meet the growing interest of corporate clients and households to contribute to the climate change fight. "We are very encouraged by the uptake of this scheme. Commercial entities are purchasing clean energy certificates in increasing numbers to claim the use of low or zero emissions electricity, thereby reducing their carbon footprint," explained Al Marar. "Since electricity generated from clean energy sources is indistinguishable from that produced by any other source, some form of tracking is required. Once the power provider has injected the energy generated from identifiable clean resources into the grid, the Clean Energy Certificates act as a tracking mechanism for the source of clean energy. Entities can then claim the environmental benefits of low carbon energy production in enhancing the sustainable credentials of their product lines." Additional enablers that will help achieve the 2035 target  Solar power plant site map: Clarity on availability of land and appropriate sites for solar plants will help increase energy generation through clean sources.  Capacity requirements for energy storage: Accelerated growth in energy storage installations in the Abu Dhabi transmission and distribution grid is essential to store the energy produced through clean sources. Abu Dhabi has already introduced grid-scale advanced facilities in the electricity system as it installed 108MW of distributed sodium sulfur batteries with six hours of energy storage capacity.  Transmission and distribution grid enhancement: Major coordinated network infrastructure enhancements are required by key stakeholders for connection and operation of safe and secure system for clean energy.  Electric vehicle (EV) readiness & vehicle-to-grid technology: EVs can help make clean daytime energy available to the grid at night and reduce demand peaks during critical hours.

An initiative to support processes for climate adaptation finance for female entrepreneurs and youth has been launched by the Africa Climate Change Fund (ACCF) Secretariat. The 'YouthADAPT: Empowering Women and Youth for Entrepreneurship and Job Creation in Climate Adaptation and Resilience' scheme aims to develop innovative, transformative climate-resilient bankable projects aligned with African countries' Nationally Determined Contributions. The initiative was launched virtually, following the approval of US $1mn grant funding by the ACCF's development partners for the project. The event is said to have rallied together stakeholders including the project team, quality control, adaptation, gender, and communication experts, and climate change and green growth experts to share experiences. According to the ACCF, YouthADAPT is a flagship program under the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), which is unlocking the untapped potential of youth in Africa to drive resilience and green enterprise. ACCF Coordinator Rita Effah, and Portfolio Officer, Lucy Debrion, explained the Fund's operational guidelines on Bank-implemented projects. "African youth are leading the way, not in talk, but in concrete climate action; as agents of change, innovators, and entrepreneurs," said AAAP Coordinator and Principal Climate Change Officer Edith Ofwona Adera. In mid-November 2022, EARTHDAY.ORG unveiled the Climate Education Coalition at COP27 . Following the launch, the AAAP secretariat will regularly engage with the ACCF Secretariat on significant project milestones to ensure that the objective is fully accomplished. The ACCF is a multi-donor trust fund that aims to contribute to the African Development Bank's (AfDB) goal to triple its climate financing efforts and build a climate-resilient Africa. It was established by AfDB in April 2014 with an initial contribution of approximately $4.91mn from the government of Germany to support African countries build their resilience to the negative impacts of climate change and transition to sustainable low-carbon growth. The ACCF was then converted to a multi-donor trust fund in 2017 with contributions from the governments of Flanders, Belgium and Italy. The Global Affairs Canada and the Government of Quebec joined the Fund in 2020 and the Global Center on Adaptation in 2022. The current trust size is said to be $25.71mn. Later in November 2022, MOCCAE, EAD and ENWWF inked a deal to scale up Nature-based Solutions in a bid to address climate change. \</doc>

At a pre-conference webinar for the World Cement Association (WCA), an all-CEO panel argued that cement producers in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) can halve carbon emissions with zero or low capital expenditure. The Mena region is responsible for approximately 7% of total global CO2 emissions, and also currently produces around 7% of the world's cement. In fact, it is the largest-producing region outside of China and India, underlining the importance of WCA's annual conference in calling attention to the region's urgent need to embark on the net zero journey. The webinar brought together 30 CEOs representing cement-producing companies from Iraq, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey (among others), ahead of the WCA's annual conference \- set to be held in Dubai. The theme of the conference is: 'Navigating the Climate Challenge: Reducing Carbon and Reducing Costs'. The CEO forum also took the view that there is an opportunity now for being proactive, shaping the industry roadmap rather than waiting for government regulations to be imposed. Notwithstanding, the panel also explained how the region's main challenges are due to variable limestone quality in some countries and the limited availability of supplementary cementitious material. Yet it is still the case that new, innovative technologies can help overcome a number of these limitations \- and projects such as waste heat reduction now have highly attractive returns. Meanwhile, the WCA have partnered with A3 & Co, a cement business consulting firm, to promote decarbonisation as a strategy, with a major emphasis on cost reduction and the competitive edge that decarbonisation will bring to the Mena cement sector. As COP27 The post Can the Mena cement industry halve emissions? appeared first on Middle East Construction News. \</doc>

The world could reach Net Zero up to 10 years ahead of the 2050 target date if industries make the most of existing and emerging space technologies, according to new data modelling from Globant\' s Sustainable Business Studio, commissioned by Inmarsat. Satellite technology already saves 2.5% of total GHG emissions, but the report reveals a clear missed opportunity to fast-forward the transition. Globant\' s analysis suggests that full adoption of currently available satellite technologies by 2030 would make it possible to achieve a further 9% reduction in global emissions. Commenting on the findings of the report, Elena Morettini, lead scientist behind the report and Global Head of Sustainable Business at Globant, said: "Following the close of COP27 it remains clear that solutions to reducing humanity\' s carbon emissions are vitally important. What we know is that from a technological and scientific standpoint, the potential reduction in CO2 emissions from satellite technologies is immense. "It is definitely not a lack of innovation preventing greater sustainability success. Instead, it is a lack of investment that stands in the way of bringing the Net Zero reality closer to the findings of our modelling." Rajeev Suri, Inmarsat CEO, stated: "Satellite technology today helps tackle climate change and, with greater will and investment, it can deliver even more in the future. Globant\' s modelling demonstrates how space can make a major contribution to slashing humanity\' s carbon emissions, with emerging technologies offering even more benefits, alongside other similar initiatives. Progress does not need to stop, nor be reversed for the world to meet its Net Zero goals. That is why it is imperative that governments and industry leaders take the initiative to assess their decarbonisation strategies with satellite technologies in mind and align their investments to solutions that not only decarbonise, but make industries more efficient and resilient, helping to build for the future." Diego Tartara, Chief Technology Officer at Globant, commented: "Our perspective is that any challenge is better solved in a collaborative manner and that technology can be a powerful decarbonisation accelerator. We are proud that Inmarsat chose us to produce such eye-opening research that confirms the amazing opportunities, both, in terms of efficiencies and optimisations that satellite communications can offer to a broad array of sectors", he added. \</doc>

Challenges facing the space industry, including safety, exploration and climate change discussed at Abu Dhabi Space Debate Speaking on the panel discussion titled 'COP28 and the space industry', Sara Venturini Climate Coordinator with GEO Secretariat said that there was a missed opportunity at COP27 . Kristofer Hamel, Head of Adaptation, Recovery and Humanitarian Response at COP28 said that they are currently hearing different voices and pulling different threads to be able to move forward. "We are interested in learning more about what could be done, to use the COP28 platform to advance things like the early warning system," he said. According to Selima Ben Mustapha, Head of Earth Observation Applications at the Swedish National Space Agency, a recent budget boost announced at the recently held European Space Agency Ministerial Council meeting means that Europe will stay in the space race and that this will reflect on earth observation programs. "All members contributed to the budget which was 16.9 billion euros so we can continue to develop our programs to build new satellites for earth observation," she said, adding that this budget, an 17% increase from the previous one, means that resources will be available. "Climate change observation is the top of our priority in addition to navigation, exploration, communication and space safety," she said. Also speaking on the panel was Shereen Zorba Head, Secretariat, UN Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment who said that despite data gathering efforts not enough action is taking place. "An increasing number of satellites, public and private, are continuously orbiting and collecting data about the state of the world's environment at a scale never known before," she said. Yet, the world is not on track to meet any of the environmental goals least of all the Paris agreement, she added. This highlights a dilemma between data and knowledge, according to Shereen. She stressed the importance of having the technology available. "We do not have at scale, the artificial intelligence capabilities, the technology is there but not for free and its implementation at scale can mean the difference between success and failure," she said. Curiosity, according to Eytan Stibbe Israeli astronaut and founding director of Vital Capital Fund, is a driver for development and knowledge and said that monitoring the planet is important to understand it and to understand other planets. "If we see lightening on another planet, does that mean that we understand it here? And what it means on other planets?" he said. \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 7th November, 2022 (WAM) - Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, urged today leaders participating in the Middle East Green Initiative Summit to put forward innovative ideas and constructive proposals that would contribute to bolstering climate action in 'our countries' in the context of the principle of implementation. I am confident that our meeting today will come up with results that will demonstrate our rigorous commitment to climate action across all levels for the benefit of the coming generations of the Arab region and the entire world,' said President El-Sisi during his opening speech at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit. He added that the launch of this initiative by His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Crown Prince , around a year ago, came to address one of the necessary aspects in climate action in our Arab world and in the Middle East region, which both suffer more than anywhere else from the negative impacts of climate change on the quality of agricultural land, the fertility of its soil, in addition to the steady rise of temperature, water scarcity and drought. 'The large number of countries which joined this initiative since its launch, might be testimony to the seriousness our countries in the Arab region accord to efforts to combat climate change, either in terms of reducing emissions and the transition to renewable energy or in taking vigorous measures to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. The two aspects constitute the core of this initiative. In Egypt, for example, we were able to take broad steps toward the transition to renewable energy, either solar, wind or hydrogen energy. Currently, we are launching ambitious projects in the area of clean transport.' With regard to adaptation, he noted that Egypt has succeeded to achieve tangible successes in the sustainable management of water resources. The document of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which was updated in accordance with the Paris Agreement, includes a number of ambitious goals for adaptation in the sectors of agriculture, the protection of coastal areas and sustainable urban development. 'And just like Egypt, all countries in our Arab region are exerting similar efforts in this context. Our region's hosting of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UNFCCC this year in Egypt, and next year in the United Arab Emirates, is good proof of the role our countries have assumed at the level of international climate action and their commitment to the implementation of climate pledges,' he further added. \</doc>

OPEC this week cut its forecast for 2022 global oil demand growth for a fifth time since April, also trimming its 2023 outlook, citing mounting economic challenges, including high inflation and rising interest rates. Oil demand in 2022 will expand by 2.55mn barrels per day (bpd) or 2.6%, OPEC said in a monthly report - down 100,000 bpd from the previous forecast. "The world economy has entered a period of significant uncertainty and rising challenges in the fourth quarter of 2022," the group said in the report. "Downside risks include high inflation, monetary tightening by major central banks, high sovereign debt levels in many regions and persisting supply chain constraints," it added. In just over two weeks' time, the OPEC+ group will\~meet in Vienna on December 4. OPEC+, which recently cut production targets, will remain cautious, Saudi Arabian\~Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, OPEC+'s de facto leader, was quoted as saying last week. In 2023, OPEC expects oil demand to increase by 2.24mn bpd, also 100,000 bpd lower than previously forecast. Despite commenting on the growing challenges OPEC left its 2022 and 2023 global economic growth forecasts steady and suggested there was upside potential, despite risks being\~skewed to the downside. "These come from a variety of sources. [In particular] inflation could be positively impacted by any resolution of the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe, allowing for less hawkish policies," OPEC said. For October, with oil prices weakening on fears of a recession, the group made a 100,000 bpd cut to the OPEC+ production target, with an even bigger reduction planned for November. Saudi Arabia said the latest cut was necessary to respond to rising interest rates in the West and a weaker global economy. US President Joe Biden has criticised the decision, calling it short-sighted. In the report, OPEC said that in Q2 and Q3, global oil supply had outpaced oil demand by 200,000 bpd and 1.1mn bpd respectively, having been in a deficit of 300,000 bpd during Q1. OPEC's output for October was reported to have fallen by 210,000 bpd to 29.49mn bpd, more than the pledged OPEC+ reduction, led by a 149,000 bpd cut by Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom\~itself, however, reported a smaller drop to OPEC - of 84,000 bpd, bringing its October output to just below 11mn bpd. Prince Abdulaziz said OPEC+ would remain cautious on oil production, noting that members saw uncertainties in the global economy ahead of the bloc's next meeting in December. "Our theme is being cautious," he was quoted as saying at the COP27 summit in Egypt, adding: "it's being responsible and not losing sight of what the market required". \</doc>

NEW YORK,10th November, 2022 (WAM) -- The global building and construction boom has pushed the sector's CO2 emissions to an all-time high of 10 gigatonnes, meaning that it is now "off track" to meet decarbonisation pledges by 2050, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said. "Years of warnings about the impacts of climate change have become a reality," said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. "If we do not rapidly cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, we will be in deeper trouble." According to a report from the UN agency, more than 34 per cent of global energy demand in 2021 came from the sector, along with around 37 per cent of "energy and process-related" CO2 emissions. Data crunched for the UNEP publication ahead of COP27 climate talks in Egypt, also found that 2021 CO2 emissions were five per cent higher than in 2020 and two per cent more than the pre-pandemic peak in 2019. This was despite a 16 per cent investment boost for energy-efficient new-builds, to $237 billion, which UNEP explained had been simply "outpaced" by the growing amount of floor space that is being built. In 2021, demand for heating, cooling, lighting and equipment in buildings increased by around four per cent from 2020 and three per cent from 2019, UNEP said, indicating that the gap between the sector's climate performance and the need to decarbonize by 2050 is widening. From a regional perspective, UNEP noted that Africa was set to see raw resource use, double by 2060, with "an estimated 70 per cent" of buildings for 2040 still on the drawing board. This is in line with estimates that Africa's population is set to reach 2.4 billion by 2050, 80 per cent living in cities, and the reason why the continent could make use of its renewable energy sources to power its buildings sustainably, UNEP said. "Steel, concrete and cement (are) already major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions," the UN agency explained, adding that building materials already account for around nine per cent of energy-derived CO2 emissions on the continent. On Europe, UNEP noted that the buildings sector accounted for 40 per cent of Europe's total energy needs, and that 80 per cent of that came from fossil fuels. "This makes the sector an area for immediate action, investment, and policies to promote short and long-term energy security," Andersen said. To reduce overall emissions, the UN agency explained that the building sector could help by: Improving building energy performance; Decreasing the carbon footprint of building materials; Key global trends identified by UNEP indicated that the increase in built floor space between 2015 and 2021 was equivalent to the total land area covered in buildings in Germany, France, Italy and Netherlands. \</doc>

Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud this week reiterated the Kingdom's efforts to achieve the `net zero' emissions goal it announced last year. Speaking at ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi, Prince Abdulaziz said: "We are working to increase refining rates and develop clean hydrogen." He noted that Saudi Arabia and UAE are working together to "achieve sustainable development through a number of important" climate initiatives, while stressing the need to harness existing investments and technologies to achieve the goals they aspire to accomplish in the future, according to the Saudi Gazette. "What is happening today will never prevent us from focusing on the future, and we will work together to achieve our aspirations, and we will be a positive example for energy-producing countries," he said. The comments come ahead of next week's United Nations COP27 summit in Egypt, during which Saudi is expected to make further climate-related announcements. In October 2021, Riyadh announced that it would reduce emissions from the Kingdom to net zero by 2060, with oil firm Saudi Aramco also setting an ambitious target for emissions. Aramco's target is to achieve `net zero' Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, suggesting that both goals will rely heavily on the offshoring of emissions, with Riyadh set to remain reliant on crude oil exports for decades to come. Saudi's ambitious target was announced by Abdulaziz's brother, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), during the Kingdom's Saudi Green Initiative Forum ahead of the COP26 climate conference. He said that 450mn trees would be planted across Saudi Arabia amid efforts to rehabilitate large areas of degraded land by 2030 and the mitigation of 200mn tonnes of emissions. Meanwhile, a statement released by Aramco disclosed the company's "ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions across its wholly-owned operated assets by 2050". It added: "This ambition is an important part of the company's focus on long-term shareholder value creation by advancing its goals through a company-wide approach [to] sustainability." Scope 1 and 2 emissions cover direct emissions from company-owned or controlled sources as well as indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by company. Meanwhile, Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur throughout the company's value chain. The omission of Scope 3 was unsurprising, as Aramco has not yet reported these indirect emissions in the three years since it began external reporting. The company did, however, expand the reporting boundaries of Scope 2 in 2019 to include affiliates under Aramco's control, which include Saudi Aramco Jubail Refinery (SASREF), Motiva in the US and Netherlands-based chemicals specialist Arlanxeo. \</doc>

(Image: source/31/12/images/Gulf Cryo.jpg) Saudi mining giant Ma£den has signed an agreement with Gulf Cryo, the regional leader in managing the carbon full circular value chain - from capture to utilisation - with a view to setting up a carbon capture plant in the kingdom. As per the deal, Gulf Cryo will construct and operate the mega carbon dioxide capturing plant within Maaden's integrated phosphate complex at Ras Al Khair for a 20-year period, said the company. The partnership aims at reducing the carbon emission of the national mining company while providing a clean carbon dioxide (CO2) source to be used in industrial gases applications in the kingdom, creating a domestic circular carbon economy which increases the domestic value creation, fully supporting the plan to localise industries as per Saudi Vision 2030. The captured CO2 will be distributed by Gulf Cryo, partly to International Maritime Industries (IMI), Saudi's giant maritime yard, and the rest will be used in industrial applications such as EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) and water desalination, as well as in other industries such as food and beverage and agriculture. The agreement was signed by Engineer Hassan Al Ali, Executive VP Phosphate of Ma£den, and Engineer Abdulsalam Al Mazro, Vice Chairman of Gulf Cryo at the Saudi Green Initiative Forum, which took place on the sidelines of COP 27 in Egypt. Gulf Cryo Chairman Amer Huneidi said: "It is with great pleasure that we sign this partnership with Ma£den. We will provide the necessary solutions and expertise to support Ma£den's sustainability strategy." \</doc>

The construction of one of the world's largest wind farms in Egypt is set to start in 2024 and could provide electricity to Europe and Saudi Arabia, according to one of the main companies backing the $11bn project. A consortium that includes Abu Dhabi-owned Masdar and Infinity Power Holdings will finish building the 10-gigawatt onshore plant by 2030, said Mohamed Mansour, chairman of Infinity Power. That capacity is roughly one-fifth of what the UK has today for all forms of renewable energy. The Egyptian government will buy the power, some of which may be exported via existing and planned cables to Europe, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Libya, Mansour said in an interview at the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh. Abu Dhabi's Masdar expanding in Africa The companies expect to secure land for the project this year, he said. They are looking at two locations in Egypt's Western Desert, one near Minya and the other Aswan, both of which have wind speeds that can reach 10 meters per second, according to Mansour. Governments and investors are pouring money into wind and solar plants around the world as they seek to transition away from fossil fuels and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The same group is also working on an Egyptian green-hydrogen facility that may be able to produce 480,000 tons a year of the fuel by 2030, said Mansour. Around 80% of the two projects will be financed through debt, while the rest of the money will come from equity. While Infinity Power is able to secure funding for its projects, rising interest rates might lower the firm's profits, said Mansour. "We look to optimise in other areas to make up for that setback," he said. "This will make projects more costly." Infinity Power aims to increase its capacity in Africa three-fold by 2025 to 3.75 gigawatts. It's considering projects in Zimbabwe, Guinea and Tunisia, and expanding in South Africa. Africa "is where the power generation is mostly needed," said Mansour. "We believe in generating clean electricity through renewables and we believe that everybody has the right to access to electricity." The continent has some of the lowest per-capita generation rates in the world, with regular blackouts in many countries holding back economic growth. Infinity Power hopes to finalize the takeover of Amsterdam-based Lekela Power, which has about 1 gigawatt in wind-generation capacity, in January. "The acquisition of Lekela is very strategic for us," said Mansour, "We were very knowledgeable in the solar-technology space, while Lekela brings us wind expertise."

By Belal Nawar Every year on Oct. 31, World Cities Day seeks to raise awareness of how local and regional governments can build greener, more equitable, and more sustainable cities. Many Middle Eastern cities are already moving in the direction of sustainability thanks to initiatives that reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, shrink their carbon footprint, and adopt cleaner and more sustainable methods of construction, agriculture, and transportation. Dubai Dubai is leading the way with the 2050 strategic initiative, which plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and drive sustainable economic growth. Among those initiatives is the Shams Dubai project, which is Dubai Electricity & Water Authority&rsquo;s first smart initiative to connect solar energy to buildings. It supports the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to make Dubai the smartest city in the world. Another noteworthy project is Dubai&rsquo;s Green Economy which attempts to accomplish economic growth while preserving and protecting the environment. For start-ups looking to explore the market potential for green energy, this program is proving to be very advantageous. Additionally, due to Dubai&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to the transformation of its city, international investors are demonstrating enormous interest in projects supported by the Dubai Government according to ME Construction. Riyadh Green Riyadh is one of Riyadh&rsquo;s four mega projects launched by King Salman Bin Abdulaziz that contributes to fulfilling a key goal of Vision 2030 to promote Riyadh&rsquo;s position among the world&rsquo;s top 100 most livable cities. 7.5 million trees will be planted across Riyadh city in 3,330 neighborhood gardens, 43 parks, 9,000 mosques, 6,000 schools, 64 universities, 390 healthcare facilities, and 1,670 public facilities. Not only that but also Riyadh announced back in July that Al Nama smart city will be the first smart zero-carbon destination in Riyadh. The city will promote sustainable living in a 10-square-kilometer community with various hubs including residential, educational, commercial, tourism, and medical.

Last year Dentsu international became one of the first companies in the world to have its Net Zero target validated by the globally recognized Sciences Based Targets initiative against the Net-Zero Standard, as they transition to a low carbon future and seek to reduce the impact of climate change. As leaders unite at COP27 in Egypt, the focus will be on action. Dentsu has announced a new partnership with Sacred Groves, as part of an ongoing commitment to climate action, the promotion of more sustainable consumption, and investment in nature-based solutions. Sacred Groves' mission is to protect natural habitats and inspire meaningful change with the aspiration to protect and conserve 100,000 acres of natural habitats with the support of a flourishing community of 500,000+ Guardians by 2025. Deforestation and forest degradation continue to take place at alarming rates, with the world losing a soccer field equivalent to a primary forest every 6 seconds. According to the UN-REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation), 11% of all carbon emissions stem from deforestation - more than emissions from all means of transport combined - and halting deforestation and forest degradation can avoid emissions of more than 5 gigatons CO2/year. Working with their auction platform partners, NorthLadder - the region's leading pre-owned device company which powers secondhand device exchanges at more than 500 outlets of leading Retailers and Telcos across 5 countries in the GCC - Sacred Groves converts depreciated electronic assets into the protection of forests and natural habitats around the world. The devices sold go back to consumers in emerging markets, thus promoting a circular economy, and reducing the risk of electronic equipment ending up in landfills. Tarek Daouk, CEO of Dentsu MENA said, "The work Sacred Groves is doing protecting our planet's natural habitats is inspiring. At Dentsu, we place nature at the heart of our net-zero commitment, driving projects that balance climate action with our commitment to biodiversity. We are in a new era of climate accountability and the moment demands urgent action. The proceeds from the sale of our donated equipment will go towards the protection of natural habitats globally, as well as supporting a circular economy. It is a win-win situation for all involved, and I encourage all of our clients, partners, and peers to get involved so we make a real difference together. Monisha Krishna, Co-Founder of Sacred Grove said, "We thank Dentsu for their ongoing support and contributions, and are confident that with the deep commitment of them and likeminded companies to further the global Climate Change agenda, we will be able to create sustainable value for everyone." "We are delighted to partner with Sacred Groves in offering an innovative and compelling value proposition to corporates. Dentsu taking the lead on this is a big step forward in encouraging other companies to do the same, in line with the UAE government's sustainability vision," added Sandeep Shetty, Co-Founder, and CEO of North Ladder. \</doc>

By Belal Nawar National Geographic has listed Egypt as one of the top 25 travel destinations for 2023, according to Ahram Online. Egypt, a nation with a rich history, has become one of the top locations for tourists interested in culture and heritage. This is relevant in consideration of the Grand Egyptian Museum's opening in Giza, which will display King Tutankhamun's complete collection in addition to several other artifacts that date back to ancient Egypt. But that's not all; earlier this year, Egypt was named one of the greatest tourist destinations for the spring and summer of 2022 by the UK's Daily Mail News website. Together with National Geographic and The Daily Mail News, TripAdvisor named Cairo the second most popular destination in the globe and the ninth best for city lovers in 2022. In light of this, let's learn more about some amazing locations where you may enjoy the rich culture of Egypt as winter approaches. Colored Canyon Because of the intense heat of the summer, it is advisable to hike this canyon best in the winter. The canyon is conveniently accessible from Nuweiba, although journeys from Dahab or even Sharm el Sheikh can be arranged. This is one of the most fascinating natural wonders you may view when visiting the Sinai Peninsula is this 800-meter canyon, which is a part of a bigger mountain range. The Red Sea tides slowly eroded these limestone and sandstone mountains millions of years ago, leaving behind these red-hued rock formations according to Local's Guide To Egypt. Read More: Luxury Villas, Cozy Camps & Beyond: Unconventional Qatar Stays To&hellip; The Colossi of Memnon Across the Nile river from the city of Luxor lie two standing ruined statues that used to depict Pharaoh Amenhotep III. He was an Ancient Egyptian Ruler in the 1400 BCE and these statues are all the remains of the biggest temple ever constructed in Egypt. This temple was destroyed by a massive earthquake about 2000 years ago. The Colossi of Memnon got its name because some Romans and Greeks claimed to hear strange sounds coming from the statues and they named it after their Trojan War hero the Colossi of Memnon. Catacombs Of Kom El Shoqafa The catacombs of Kim El Shofaqa also known as the &ldquo;hill of treasure,&rdquo; is regarded as a huge necropolis and royal cemetery that dates back to the second century AD. The necropolis has a unique mixture of Roman and pharaonic art elements reflected in the paintings on the wall, and the style of the statues, funeral objects, and tombs. The archaeological site was one of the seven wonders of the middle ages. The name is a reference for the clay objects left and the stone mud construction. In fact, this archaeological site has too many names. Lastly, as we approach COP27 set to take place in Sharm El Sheikh, it's good to know that TripAdvisor named Sharm El-Sheikh as one of the top travel destinations in the world for environmentally friendly travel in 2022. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 16th November, 2022 (WAM) - A local newspaper has said that the global population is estimated to have passed 8 billion people, noting that "Tuesday was a remarkable day for humanity". "It was only in 2011 that the number reached 7 billion. To put that blistering rate of growth into perspective, it took 123 years, from 1804 to 1927, for the global population to increase from 1 to 2 billion," The National said in an editorial on Tuesday. The paper added, "The official UN announcement about the 8-billion mark was made at the Cop27 climate summit, which is currently taking place in Egypt. Some will have viewed the timing as both ominous and symbolic. Manmade factors are, after all, contributors to the climate crisis, and there are fears among some activist groups that an increase in population inadvertently poses a greater threat to the planet." But the UN was keen to stress that passing the 8 billion milestone was hardly an inauspicious moment. John Wilmoth at the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs was more optimistic, saying that a large population is a "reflection of our success as a species," although he did go on to say that the news raises "questions" about our impact on the planet. In the most basic terms, a large population is a sign of health. The UN lists longer lifespans as a key reason for today's rate of growth, particularly in developing nations. This points to rising living standards across the board, and a global economy in which more and more people can take part and earn a sustainable living. It continued, "It is also worth noting that while population is expected to rise for roughly the next 60 years, fertility rates worldwide have mostly been dropping since 1950, when women on average had five children, more than double today's average, 2.3. "Advanced economies are disproportionately driving this downturn. Regions that buck the trend are most often in poorer parts of the world. The region with the highest birth rate is, for example, Central Africa, home to many of the world's lowest-GDP-per-capita nations. "The Middle East is a mixed picture. Iran's birthrate has tumbled since the late 1980s, whereas Egypt's actually started to rise after 2006, only to start very gradually declining 10 years later. "Nonetheless, the UN lists Egypt as one of a group of eight countries that are projected to constitute half the global population growth by 2050, the others being the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and Tanzania." This seismic trend must be factored into future climate strategies. Developing countries will have to strike a complex balance between growing their economies to provide ample jobs for larger populations with responsibilities towards protecting the planet. The world population is estimated to increase by another billion sometime in the early 2040s. That is an important window to carry on preparing for a growing world. "There have been successes in this regard during the past 11 years. Medical science continues to advance, technology provides more equitable access to jobs across the world and countries are committing to ambitious climate targets in the hope that action now can protect us from climate change. This work must never stop. Billions of lives to come rely on it," concluded the Abu Dhabi-based daily. \</doc>

By Peter Nurse Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen edging higher at the open Monday, starting the week on a positive note ahead of potentially significant U.S. midterm elections and the release of important inflation data. At 07:00 ET (12:00 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 180 points or 0.6%, S&P 500 Futures traded 20 points or 0.6% higher, and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 55 points or 0.5%. The midterm elections are set to take place on Tuesday, with the latest polls suggesting that the Republican party could take back control of the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate for the second half of President Joe Biden's term, likely stymieing his administration's legislative agenda. Also of interest this week, on the economic front, will be Thursday's release of U.S. consumer inflation data for October. Economists are expecting the annual rate of inflation to come in at 8.0%, down from 8.2% in September, and the monthly rate of inflation to rise by 0.6%. The major indices all posted a negative week last week, weighed by worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve will continue to aggressively raise interest rates after Chair Jerome Powell signaled that rates may peak at a higher level than previously assumed. This inflation release is set to provide fresh insight into the challenge facing the central bank policymakers, with the Fed next set to discuss interest rate moves in mid-December. FOMC members Loretta Mester, Susan Collins, and Thomas Barkin are due to speak later Monday, and their comments will be closely studied for clues towards future policy. The corporate earnings season is starting to wind down, but there are still a number of companies reporting results Monday, including Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX), Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO). Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be in the spotlight after the iPhone maker warned that it expects reduced shipments of its premium iPhone 14 model, following a significant production cut at a plant in China, which has been impacted by COVID restrictions. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), the parent of social media giant Facebook, is planning to begin large-scale redundancies this week, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. Oil prices fell Monday on the confirmation that China's zero-COVID policy was here to stay, dashing hopes of a rebound in oil demand from the world's top crude importer. China's crude oil imports to the highest level since May, but the volume for the first 10 months was still 2.7% below the same period a year earlier. The COP27 climate talks kicked off in Egypt, with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva saying that the price of carbon needs to average at least $75 a ton globally by the end of the decade for global climate goals to succeed, according to a report from Reuters. By 07:00 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% lower at $92.16 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $98.23. Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,679.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 0.9979. Reuters. \</doc>

GENEVA, ABU DHABI, 2nd November, 2022 (WAM) - Temperatures in Europe have increased at more than twice the global average over the past 30 years - the highest of any continent in the world. As the warming trend continues, exceptional heat, wildfires, floods and other climate change impacts will affect society, economies and ecosystems, according to a report released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The report, issued ahead of the annual UN Climate Change Conference COP27 , in Sharm-El Sheikh, includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, climate experts, regional bodies and UN partner agencies. The State of the Climate in Europe report, produced jointly with the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, focused on 2021. It provides information on rising temperatures, land and marine heatwaves, extreme weather, changing precipitation patterns, and retreating ice and snow. The report says that between 1991 and 2021, temperatures in Europe warmed significantly, at an average rate of about +0.5 \'b0C per decade. As a result, Alpine glaciers lost 30 metres in ice thickness from 1997 to 2021. In 2021, high impact weather and climate events led to hundreds of fatalities, directly affected more than half a million people and caused economic damages exceeding $50 billion. About 84 per cent of the events were floods or storms. As the climate continues to change, European people's health is expected to be impacted in many ways, including death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Increases in zoonoses, where diseases are transmitted to humans from animals, are also expected along with food, water and vector-borne diseases, and a rising incidence of mental health disorders. The deadliest extreme climate events in Europe come in the form of heatwaves, particularly in western and southern countries. The combination of climate change, urbanization and population ageing in the region creates, and will further exacerbate, vulnerability to heat. However, the report indicates that it's not all bad news. A number of countries in Europe have been very successful in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, in the European Union (EU) greenhouse gas emissions decreased 31 per cent between 1990 and 2020, with a net 55 per cent reduction target for 2030. Europe is also one of the most advanced regions in cross-border cooperation in climate change adaptation, in particular across transnational river basins. It is one of the world leaders in providing effective early warning systems, with about 75 per cent of people protected. Heat-health action plans have saved many lives from extreme heat. But the challenges are formidable, said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas: "Europe presents a live picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from impacts of extreme weather events. This year, like 2021, large parts of Europe have been affected by extensive heatwaves and drought, fuelling wildfires. In 2021, exceptional floods caused death and devastation." "On the mitigation side, the good pace in reducing greenhouse gases emissions in the region should continue and ambition should be further increased. Europe can play a key role towards achieving a carbon neutral society by the middle of the century to meet the Paris Agreement," said Mr. Taalas. \</doc>

Vice-President delivers keynote address at Arab League Summit in Algeria Photo: DMO His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, affirmed on Wednesday that the UAE plays a prominent role in addressing critical challenges at the regional and international levels. "The choice of the UAE is to propagate the slogan 'peace, recovery and prosperity' based on the rules of international law and cooperation in the fields of economy, sustainable development, advanced technology and scientific research, and to overcome challenges and confront existing threats," Sheikh Mohammed said in his address to the 31st Arab League Summit in Algeria. He said the UAE gives priority to peaceful resolution of conflicts, humanitarian relief, maintaining peace and addressing global health crises in a spirit of solidarity, supporting women's empowerment, emphasising the role of youth in nation-building, harnessing the potential of innovation and advanced technology, and developing the international system to combat extremism and terrorism. "In light of the unprecedented challenges facing Arab countries, we are in urgent need to intensify work, increase the pace of Arab coordination and cooperation, and resolve crises in the region to spread hope, optimism, unity, peace and tolerance. These values   are the basis of the UAE's approach since the era of the father of nation, late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and his founding brothers. "The UAE, through the success of its experience in hosting Expo 2020 Dubai, its current non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council for the period 2022-2023, and the planned COP28 Conference, plays a prominent role in addressing the critical challenges before us at the regional and international levels," he said. The UAE is keen to continue its commitment to building a knowledge-based and diversified economy based on scientific and technological progress and strengthening the economic and development partnership in the region, Sheikh Mohammed said. "Today, we are witnessing the emergence of a progressive society in the Middle East that will form a pillar for joint action around major global priorities, as the UAE is moving forward rapidly to enhance its competitiveness and sustainability of its economy, and the exploration of new opportunities. "We strive to make our country a global capital for investment and economic and cultural innovation. The UAE has also launched a package of strategic projects and initiatives aimed at establishing internal and external growth and providing an impetus for investment in digital and circular economies as well as sectors based on artificial intelligence and the Fourth Industrial Revolution," he said. He said there is no doubt that climate change has become a priority for all, as it has become an existential threat that requires everyone to work quickly towards a carbon-free future. "In this regard, the UAE has announced its goal to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050. The UAE is preparing to participate in the COP27 Conference in Sharm El Sheikh, while preparing to host COP28 in 2023 to promote climate diplomacy and address climate changes." "We firmly believe that the challenges and threats facing the Arab region and the world can only be overcome by solidarity and joint cooperation at the regional and international levels, and by upholding tolerance, equality, moderation, flexibility and giving, and by involving all countries, small and large, in the historical march of humanity," said Sheikh Mohammed. \</doc>

By Belal Nawar Several Middle Eastern countries have developed their own 2030 visions to boost their economy and foster economic diversification instead of relying on just one segment. Those visions would also enable societies to enjoy high standards of living and experience a satisfying lifestyle that offers opportunities. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are then pure examples of Arab nations that are scrambling to develop projects and initiatives that would strengthen their economies and enable greater economic diversification. UAE To reduce reliance on the oil sector, the UAE announced a long-term plan for the transformation of the emirate's economy. The metaverse is then a crucial aspect of the UAE's economy as the country announced its Metaverse Strategy last May, which aims to turn Dubai into one of the world's top 10 metaverse economies as well as a global hub for the metaverse community. The UAE has shown that it is willing to stake money in the high-risk field of innovative technology. Even Emirati leaders believe that the tech industry will eventually replace the oil industry as the nation works to diversify its economy, according to the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. The Metaverse sector is then predicted to boost production and efficiency, enhance safety, and create new jobs which are all in line with the UAE's Vision 2030. There's even one of the UAE's early private-sector metaverse projects called 2117. This project got named after the dream of Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid to colonize Mars a century from now. Saudi Arabia Read More: Transaction Rejected: New ATM Withdrawal Regulations Egyptians... The 2030 Vision, which outlines the kingdom's aspirations to diversify its economy, continues to include NEOM as one of its focal projects. It will consist of smart cities and towns, ports, business districts, research facilities, sports and entertainment venues, and tourism attractions. However, the plans also provide for a network of airports, one of which would be international. The first, located in Sharma's northern region and known as Neom Bay Airport, began offering regular flights for NEOM personnel and investors last year. Therefore, in keeping with the Kingdom's 2030 strategy, the NEOM project aims to diversify the Saudi economy. Egypt Let's not forget Egypt's energy diversification plan known as the 2035 Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy which is in with the country's vision for 2030. Yes, it's sustainability that's the main focus, and that's why no wonder Egypt was chosen to host COP27 . There are two projects that are definitely worth mentioning; the first one is the "National program for converting street lighting to LED energy-saving lighting systems," and the second is the "Cairo Bike Project." The Cairo bike project aims to be a signature project added to the mix of solutions to diversify transport options in Cairo. The concept of bike-sharing, which primarily targets youth, is to provide a network of publicly available bicycles that can be safely used between stations using an app and with reasonable pricing and various subscription packages. On the other hand, the National Program for converting street lighting to LED energy-saving lighting systems aims to reduce climate change by implementing energy-efficient LED-based street lighting and reducing energy consumption in lighting which helps the Public Electricity Company to manage peak demand. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 2nd November, 2022 (WAM) -- A local newspaper has commended the Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy agreement signed yesterday in Abu Dhabi between the UAE and the US to invest $100 billion to produce 100 gigawatts of clean energy globally by 2035, saying "it is opening a new chapter in energy security and climate action". "The two countries also agreed to invest in ways to manage carbon and methane emissions, as well as the development of nuclear technology and the decarbonisation of the industrial and transport sectors," The National said in an editorial on Wednesday. This is a significant milestone as the world adjusts to new energy demands, the paper said. "Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global energy market looked very different. With vast supplies buoyed by America's shale gas boom and fast-evolving technology in renewable energy, cheap fuel was a given. In too many ways, in fact, it was taken for granted." Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Managing Director and Group CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), told conference participants on Tuesday that the world will lose up to 5 million barrels per day of oil each year from current supplies if investment comes to a halt. "This," Dr Al Jaber said, "would make the shocks we have experienced this year feel like a minor tremor." New investment in oil and gas is no longer as easy as it once was, given the worldwide push towards decarbonisation. But it is necessary all the same, and it can be done in a way that does not forsake the global effort to contain climate change. "Energy security," Dr. Al Jaber noted, "is the foundation of all progress - economic, social and climate progress." In his remarks, he emphasised the need for "maximum energy" alongside "minimum emissions". In this respect, oil-producing nations can show leadership. ADNOC, for instance, has already connected its operations to nuclear and solar power, and is in the process of electrifying its offshore operations to cut their carbon footprint in half. It is also redoubling its efforts to bring down its levels of methane intensity, though it already has "one of the lowest levels in the world". Yesterday's partnership with the US is another step in the right direction. At the same time, hydrocarbon producers are by no means the only factor in the equation to combat climate change. The lead-up to the Cop27 climate summit due to begin in Egypt next week has seen a host of countries in the developed world revisit and update their emissions targets for the next decade. Few of them, independent analysis has found, are on track to achieving them. The Abu Dhabi-based daily concluded by saying, "Balancing the world's growing energy demands with its urgent fight against climate change is a complex challenge that requires not only boldness, but realism. In a year when these issues are very much at the forefront of the global consciousness, ADIPEC's role in navigating that challenge cannot be overstated." \</doc>

'There is no more time for negotiations. All decisions have been taken, so it is time to implement': UN official in UAE "We are limiting temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and we are already between 1.1-1.2 degrees and every fraction of a degree increase in temperature translates into a loss of life and livelihood around the world. It is not an easy task to do what we need to do but we have to continue our efforts and raise ambitions at all levels. We are meeting in extremely troubled times and highly complex environment and seeing developments being backtracked in many areas," said Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary, UNFCCC Secretariat Assistant Secretary General, United Nations. "It is a huge urgency and targets and signs are absolutely clear that we must stop pumping greenhouse gases into the sky by nearly half by 2030. Every day passes by and we are not taking decisive action, we are backtracking in every aspect of development. Only a sustainable future is renewable where we are able to use resources in a responsible and sustainable manner," Sarmad said at the World Green Economy Summit 2022, which is being held along with the 24th edition of the Water, Energy, Technology and Environment Exhibition (Wetex) 2022 and Dubai Solar Show at Dubai World Trade Centre. "We must end our habits and intensity of using fossil fuel and a life that we have accustomed to. The good news is solutions are there. Renewable energy provides a good alternative to businesses, societies and governments. The question is how we capitalise on that," the UN executive told the delegates and attendees at the two-day summit. "To reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050, there are sectoral actions that need to be taken across the board and it demands a systemic and fundamental change in economic production and consumption of resources that is inclusive and just that can be sustained across future generation and protect our planet." He said the current lifestyle models are no longer sustainable and there is writing clearly on the wall. "Businesses and societies that don't take action (to curb climate change), they will be the Kodak of the future," he said. Sarmad stressed that there is a need to make sure that the climate change conference COP27 to be held in Egypt later this year is an implementation COP. "There is no more time for negotiations. All decisions have been taken, so it is time to implement. It is urgency, every fraction of a degree counts and every loss of life counts. We have a responsibility to reverse this climate change threat. We need to work collaboratively," he added. \</doc>

By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- Covid-19 wreaks havoc with the biggest iPhone production hub in the world; forcing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to warn about holiday season shipments. China's exports fall for the first time in two and a half years as the war in Ukraine and the end of the pandemic hit demand in western markets. Facebook (NASDAQ:META) owner Meta Platforms is set to lay off thousands of staff in an effort to restore profitability. Stocks are set to build on their post-payroll gains on Friday. And there's trouble in crypto-land as Binance takes aim at rival FTX. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 7th November. 1. Apple warns on holiday shipments as Covid disrupts iPhone factory in China Apple confirmed that it will ship fewer iPhones than expected in the key holiday quarter, owing to a Covid-19 outbreak that has badly disrupted operations at contractor FoxConn's biggest assembly plant for the iPhone in Zhengzhou. Reports from Zhengzhou have depicted a chaotic scene, with thousands of workers either quarantined or hastily relocated to other plants. "We now expect lower. . .shipments than we previously anticipated and customers will experience longer wait times to receive their new products," the company warned in a statement at the weekend. The news is a stark contrast with the rumors of an impending liberalization of China's Covid-Zero policy, which continue to push local markets higher. Real-time data also point to an increasing economic slowdown as key export markets in North America and Europe struggle with high inflation. Chinese exports fell in year-on-year terms for the first time in over two years in October, according to data released on Monday. 2. Meta set to announce huge layoffs Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, is expected to join the list of big tech companies making big job cuts this week, The Wall Street Journal reported. The absolute number of layoffs could dwarf those seen at Twitter last week in absolute terms, given that Meta employs over 10 times Twitter's workforce. However, Zuckerberg is not expected to lay off half of the workforce as Elon Musk did last week. Various reports have suggested that Twitter will face legal action \- especially outside the U.S. \- for what appears to have been a flagrant breach of labor law in several jurisdictions. Meta stock rose 3.4% in premarket on hopes that the measures will restore its shrinking profit margins. 3. U.S. stocks set to open higher as labor market report encourages Fed hopes; FanDuel ruling in focus U.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, building on the gains they made in response to the labor market report on Friday. The report had added to evidence of a slowdown in hiring and in wage growth that analysts said brought the end of Federal Reserve policy tightening a little closer. By 06:00 ET (11:00 GMT), Dow Jones futures were up 165 points, or 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were up broadly in parallel. The three main cash indices had all risen by between 1.2% and 1.4% on Friday. Aside from Big Tech, the stocks likely to be in focus later include Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), which is moving past last week's agreement to draw a line under the opioids scandal with a deal to buy Summit Health for around $9 billion including debt, according to the WSJ. Also in focus will be Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) and U.K.-based gambling group Flutter Entertainment (LON:FLTRF), after an arbitration tribunal ruled that Rupert Murdoch's group would have to pay $4.1 billion to exercise its option on an 18.6% stake in its FanDuel unit. 4. Binance pulls liquidity from FTX in bust-up over FTT Crypto stress is back. FTX's native token FTT slumped 15% over the weekend after Binance, its biggest rival and sometime backer, said it will pull all of its remaining funds from the group, a process that Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao said will likely take several months. Zhao said the move wasn't hostile but also carped that "we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs." The move followed a Coindesk report last week that hinted that Alameda Research, a hedge fund affiliated to FTX, had taken a massive long position in FTT to support its value as of June. Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX owner Sam Bankman-Fried dismissed the report as misleading. 5. Oil shrugs as COP-27 begins Crude oil prices were broadly flat after pushing higher for most of last week in hopes of China's Covid-Zero policy being relaxed. By 06:20 ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.2% at $92.47 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 0.1% at $98.48 a barrel. The market has appeared untroubled by the COP-27 climate conference, which has kicked off against a backdrop of a sharp rebound in carbon dioxide emissions this year. The world economy has had to resort increasingly to coal to fill a supply gap left by the suspension of Russian gas shipments to Europe and by droughts that have badly hit hydropower output from China to France and Latin America.

ABU DHABI, 31st October, 2022 (WAM) -- Masdar's Women in Sustainability, Environment and Renewable Energy (WiSER) platform today launched a global campaign, "I Am WiSER," to raise support for women at the forefront of efforts to tackle climate change and encourage world leaders to press forward with initiatives to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. The campaign urges policymakers, heads of industry, and individuals to take the #IAmWiSER pledge to champion women as agents of sustainable change, in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) 5 and 7, which aim to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls," and "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all," respectively. Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO of Masdar, said, "Masdar has long recognised the pivotal role women must play in building a sustainable future. Through #IAmWiSER, we are proud to invite our partners around the world to join us in ensuring women have an equal voice in our collective clean energy transition." Dr. Lamya Fawwaz, Masdar Executive Director of Brand and Strategic Initiatives, and WiSER Programme Director, said, "WiSER recognises, inspires and empowers women to become leaders and change agents in driving sustainable development for all. The campaign will enable us to reach a broader audience and provide a clear call for action for women and those who support them worldwide. We look forward to translating these pledges from policymakers, thought leaders, business experts and engaged individuals around the world into concrete progress." Globally, women and girls experience the greatest impacts of climate change, which amplifies existing gender inequalities and poses unique threats to their livelihoods, health, and safety, according to UN Women. Commenting on the campaign, Palt said, "#IAmWiSER is about celebrating the achievements of women who have worked tirelessly to build a more sustainable future for their communities and our planet. It is also, just as importantly, about inspiring and empowering future generations to follow in their footsteps.

It's fair to say the relationship between advertising and sustainability is a complex one with accusations of the industry encouraging overconsumption on one hand and &lsquo;greenwashing' on the other &ndash; thus often masking the industry's potential to be a positive force for change. The basic premise of advertising is designed around the consumer promise of buying something to solve our emotional, relationship or existential problems &ndash; an approach that is fuelling a materialistic attitude to the detriment of our natural resources and alleviating the rising climate issues. Fossil fuel companies are also seen to be allocating billions each year to marketing and advertising campaigns that seek to rebrand their corporate identity as &lsquo;climate-friendly', according to a recent renewable energy report. The need for transparent marketing, however, extends far beyond the energy sector, as all brands are under increasing pressure to adapt to climate pressure. Most Gen Z consumers believe companies have a responsibility to make the world a better place &ndash; and they want to see action. A typical online ad campaign emits a staggering 5.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide &ndash; which is more than double what an average person emits in a year. Sustainability lies at the core of our agenda at the ABG, and it is the perfect time to start engaging with creatives and marketing professionals, given that COP27 and COP28 will be held in the region (Egypt and UAE). We are already working closely with the WFA's Planet Pledge, and intend to expand our relationship, and work with member organisations to bring this thinking to the forefront of our priorities. It is vital all ABG members partake in driving more sustainable marketing that will contribute towards the delivery of the &lsquo;triple bottom line' &ndash; social, environmental and financial. Google is developing sustainability workshops that address the value chain, around the &lsquo;care, do, impact' framework, while &lsquo;The Unilever compass' is designed to drive sustainable and responsible growth. At Omnicom Media Group, we're committed to reducing the energy use per person by 20 per cent and increasing the use of electricity from renewable sources globally by 2023. Advertising has a major role to play in shifting consumers' attitudes and values towards choosing sustainable products and caring for the environment through campaigns. Meanwhile, the climate challenges are placing more focus on environment, sustainability and governance (ESG) metrics by the day. With reporting and ratings structures continuing to evolve, advertisers and clients need to embrace transparency in their campaigns and take an active lead on sustainability by supporting environmental and social changes. How can you do more? How can you get involved? The ABG will be hosting a speakers' session to bring the experts on this topic and talk to our member companies about what we should do. Stay tuned. \</doc>

Alexis Lecanuet, Senior Managing Director at Accenture, praises the young nation while elaborating on the IT major's aggressive net-zero goals In October 2020, Accenture, a Fortune Global 500 company specializing in information technology (IT) and consulting, announced new sustainability commitments, including industry-leading net-zero emissions goals and a newly created leadership role. Alexis Lecanuet, Senior Managing Director at Accenture, recently elaborated on its ambitious journey to net zero in the backdrop of the COP-27 summit at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt during an exclusive interaction with Khaleej Times. He said, "The global pace of sustainability and the corporate net zero goals is gaining momentum. We've published a report, Accelerating global companies toward net zero by 2050. Every year we measure how many companies set that goal. We reached 34% this year, up from 27% last year. Data shows that only 7% of the companies are on track to deliver their goal. But roughly 80% of them need to double their pace to achieve the goal that they had set for themselves." He spoke about decarbonization efforts via digitisation. "If a sustainability plan needs to be put in place, data holds the key. Migrations to the public cloud can reduce CO2 emissions by 59 million tons annually, equating to taking 22 million cars off the road. Besides, there is the digital twin, which has a huge potential in saving carbon emissions," he said. Lecanuet outlined Accenture's sustainability vision for the UAE next year. "We're blessed to live in a country like the UAE with an ambitious sustainability vision. We're serving in the UAE, what we call the national champion. Altogether, 85% of our businesses are made with national champions in every key industry, such as banking, telcos, energy, etc. We try to support them into a holistic transformation journey, what we call a 360-degree value creation," he added. Accenture is "aggressively looking to become zero e-waste by 2025". Lecanuet cited Accenture's chairperson and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Julie Sweet, who is the proponent of the "sustainability-is-the-new-digital" mantra. "Renewables are a way that each industry has to embark upon to translate sustainability initiatives into a net-zero reality," he added. And, Accenture has put its best foot forward on the sustainability front. HYPERLINK mailto:joydeep@khaleejtimes.com joydeep@khaleejtimes.com \</doc>

There are two topics we have specifically focused on in this issue: e-commerce and ESG. That's environment, social and governance, and all that goes along with those pillars. Both e-commerce and ESG have been pushed up brands' agendas by the pandemic and its aftermath. E-commerce has been on the rise for several years now, but it got a shot in the arm when we all got shut in the house and had to live off deliveries. Cash on arival used to be more prevalent in this region than elsewhere, but fear of contagion made online and contactless payments the safe option. It's e-commerce season now. Black Friday will soon be with us. And white Friday. And Cyber Monday, Singles Day, National Day, Christmas and more. All those festivals of buying - traditional or newly coined - mean e-tills will ring. The region has great mobile phone penetration, high disposable income (in the GCC at least) and a penchant for social media. It also has a tradition of making smaller purchases at local shops alongside large weekly grocery shops at supermarkets, so it is ripe for q-commerce as well as s-commerce. E-commerce technology is coming on in leaps and bounds, and I've tried out a lot of extended-reality experiences in the last year. I tried on glasses virtually and wasn't shocked when they arrived. And I've experimented enough with Snap's latest augmented reality try-ons to know that a bright pink Balenciaga puffer jacket is just not my look. It will be interesting to see what happens as shopping develops in the metaverse. How will purchases travel across platforms? If I buy a pair of shoes in real life and get a virtual pair with them, will I be able to wear them everywhere online or only on certain metaverse platforms? What if they look better on my Decentraland avatar than my Roblox feet? We are all likely to spend more time in the metaverse, no matter where we sit on the style spectrum, as we hide in virtual reality from the mess we have made to the real world's environment. The topic of climate change is heating up almost as fast as the planet, and more companies are focusing more on their environmental creds than ever before. They are also looking at where they stand on social and governance issues such as treatment of women, historical ties to colonialism and equality in the workplace. The Covid-19 pandemic, it seems, made the world focus on all these issues more, and brands are following their customers' leads. They are flaunting their commitment to Purpose with a capital P, and some are doing it better than others. Some fall back to greenwashing or virtue-signalling, but the fact they are trying is a step in the right direction. Agencies, meanwhile, are quickly offering their services to help brands capitalise on their consciences better. Many have gone so far as to open practices specifically dedicated to ESG. Apco, Havas, Asda£ BCW and Do Epic are among the shops that have dedicated ESG divisions, and some of their specialists are writing in this issue. The international climate conference COP27 is about to take place in Egypt, and next year COP28 will come to the UAE. Middle East governments are also making moves towards net-zero carbon goals. The region has traditionally not been seen as environmentally friendly, and has suffered image issues around social and governance too. But it has a young population, it has money and it has ambition. The Middle East has a story to tell about ESG, just as much as the brands that call the region home or operate here with pride, and the time is right for the media, marketing and advertising industry to help tell those stories. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 5th October, 2022 (WAM) - Energy security is essential for social, economic and climate progress and the responsibility of the energy industry in maintaining energy security has never been clearer, according to Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Managing Director and Group CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). Speaking at the Energy Intelligence Forum in London, Dr. Al Jaber said "Market sentiment does not reflect the real underlying fundamentals, tight spare capacity and long-term demand growth. Therefore, policies aimed at pulling the plug on the current energy system, before we have built the new one are misguided." He added for economic progress to be maintained, substantial investment is required in hydrocarbons, the energy source the world will rely on well into the future. "We have seen that all progress starts and ends with energy security. And, as the world's energy leaders, our responsibility in maintaining that energy security has never been more evident," Dr. Al Jaber said. "Yes, we must all commit to mitigating the impact of global energy supplies, but let's keep our focus on capturing carbon, not cancelling production. Let's hold back emissions, not progress." He explained that partnership with the energy sector is critical to a successful energy transition. He noted that the energy transition represents the most complex, capital-intensive project in human history and that no one has more experience delivering these kinds of projects than the energy industry. "As COP27 He added that the UAE is keen to work with partners to mitigate the impact of hydrocarbons on the climate and build on its expertise as a responsible and reliable regional leader in low and no-carbon energy. ADNOC, he explained, is investing in greater production capacity of its signature crude, Murban, that has half the carbon intensity of the industry average and tripling its Liquiefied Natural Gas (LNG) capacity to over 15 million tonnes per annum, supported by a 9.6 million tonnes per annum LNG production and shipping terminal in the Emirate of Fujairah. ADNOC is also using advanced technologies and renewable solar and nuclear energy to reduce the carbon intensity of its oil and gas by a further 25% before the end of the decade, while putting in place the building blocks for the hydrogen value chain, as well as expanding the use of carbon capture and storage. As last year's recipient of the Energy Intelligence Energy Executive of the Year Award, Dr. Al Jaber presented the 2022 award to Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, Qatar's Minister of State for Energy Affairs and President and CEO of Qatar Energy. In his remarks, Dr. Al Jaber praised Al-Kaabi's role in expanding and modernising Qatar's natural gas sector. At the same time, he said that Al-Kaabi had been a leader when it comes to sustainable, responsible production, setting in motion the decarbonisation of Qatar's LNG supply chain and promoting solar power. \</doc>

Saudi Arabia has cut oil exports sharply this month as the kingdom delivers on an OPEC+ agreement to shore up global crude markets. Saudi shipments were down by about 430,000 barrels a day, or roughly 6%, by mid-November compared with the previous month, according to data from energy analytics firm Kpler Ltd. An even bigger slump of 676,000 barrels a day was observed by another consultant, Vortexa Ltd. The kingdom, which leads the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is fully committed to the agreement struck last month between the group and its allies, according to an official who asked not to be identified. Saudi cuts oil supply "Saudi Arabia is cutting a lot, going down for a second straight month," said Viktor Katona, an analyst at Kpler in Vienna. US President Joe Biden was critical of Riyadh and its partners last month, saying the hefty 2 milllion barrel-a-day cut would endanger the global economy and aid fellow OPEC+ member Russia in its war in Ukraine, though oil-market trends have since given the decision some vindication. Crude prices have retreated about 4% this week to near $90 a barrel amid a fragile backdrop for demand. Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman defended the cutbacks last week at the COP27 climate talks in Egypt, saying they were needed to offset extreme economic uncertainties. He said the group would remain "cautious." The kingdom has often sought to lead OPEC+ by example, swiftly delivering its pledged curbs, or even exceeding them, to encourage other members to follow. Exports from OPEC's 13 members are down "very significantly in the first half of November, by more than 1 million barrels a day," said Daniel Gerber, chief executive officer of tanker-tracker Petro-Logistics SA in Geneva. While an uptick is likely in the second half of the month, flows are on track for an average monthly drop of 1 million a day - roughly equivalent to the group's full pledged reduction, according to the firm, which has monitored tanker traffic for four decades. Among Saudi Arabia's OPEC counterparts in the Middle East, signs of cuts were more mixed, though shipping data for the first half of the month can give a fragmentary picture, prone to distortion if cargo loadings fall just inside or outside the date range. Iraq showed a drop of 308,000 barrels a day, or about 9%, in shipments in the first two weeks of November and Kuwait's flows appeared broadly flat, but exports from the UAE rose by 379,000 barrels a day, or roughly 12%, according to Kpler. Shipments from the UAE are usually concentrated at the beginning of the month and subside later in the period, Bloomberg tanker-tracking indicates. The country's Energy Ministry and state-run producer Adnoc didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Abu Dhabi has in the past been more eager to deploy the new production capacity it's invested in than curtail supplies, triggering a dispute last year that almost splintered the OPEC+ alliance. Some OPEC+ delegates have privately said that Abu Dhabi didn't initially support the group's cutbacks, though others have disputed the claim, and UAE Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said last month that the decision was the right one. The full 23-nation OPEC+ alliance will meet to consider production policy for early 2023 on Dec. 4 in Vienna.

ABU DHABI, 1st August, 2022 (WAM) -- Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, Founder and CEO of Alliances for Global Sustainability, today met with key figures at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) to discuss collaborative efforts in the advancement of climate change research. During the visit, Sheikha Shamma visited the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, established by the LSE in 2008 with the aim of bringing together international experts across finance, geography, international development, and political economy to tackle climate change. An accomplished business leader, philanthropist and published author, Sheikha Shamma has founded multiple organisations that are accelerating the sustainability agenda in the Middle East. She has played an integral role in developing national climate action strategies, building a circular economy in the UAE, and forging pathways to gender balanced boards. Sheikha Shamma participated in high-level exploratory discussions with Lord Nicholas Stern, Chairman of the Grantham Research Institute; Bob Ward, Policy and Communications Director, Josh Burke, Senior Policy Fellow, and Viktor Roezer, Research Fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, which focused on how her extensive work in the field of sustainability and the environment could align with the work of the Institute, and contribute to shaping global climate change policies moving forward. All parties emphasised the importance of strategic collaboration in mobilising financing for sustainability initiatives from across the public and private sector, and the critical role that the upcoming UN Climate Change Conferences ( COP27 and COP28), being hosted in Egypt later this year and in the UAE in 2023, are set to play. It was agreed that COP28, in particular, would be a global stocktaking opportunity for governments to evaluate progress in delivering on their Net-Zero promises. The meeting concluded with a mutual commitment to developing a framework that will catalyse the growth of energy saving and climate tech projects in the UK and the UAE. Sheikha Shamma commented, "The climate crisis poses an irreversible threat to our planet and it is imperative that we seek new avenues to manage and mitigate the effects as much as possible through mutual collaboration. It was an honour to be invited to visit the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and witness, first-hand, the incredible work being done to identify and implement long-term solutions in tackling climate change. I look forward to continuing these discussions and welcoming the LSE team to the Middle East for the upcoming COP conferences." Bob Ward, Policy and Communications Director at the Grantham Research Institute, said, "It was a great pleasure to meet Sheikha Shamma and to hear about her plans to promote more investment in sustainability. She is clearly very passionate about her work. We look forward to exploring potential areas of collaboration and support." \</doc>

It's destination GCC for corporate top guns from Western and East European countries, with the region seeing over 32 percent jump in CXO level \- C-suite executives \- hiring this year till date, leadership search firms said. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are seeing the maximum inflow of leadership role executives within GCC from the Western markets Growing apprehensions over business slowdown in major economies in the face of rising inflation, coupled with persisting geopolitical tensions in the CIS region, is driving the large-scale movement of top level talent from companies across sectors in the West to the GCC region. Alongside, Middle East-based renewable and energy sectors are also attracting leadership level talents from the West in numbers, with the ongoing COP27 in Egypt and next year's COP28 in Abu Dhabi acting as catalysts. "Hiring at leadership levels has seen a record high in 2022 year till date. We have witnessed a 32 percent growth over CXO level hiring as against the same period in 2021," Amarjeet Dutta, Partner at global leadership search and consultancy EMA Partners Middle East, told Arabian Business. "The global economic slowdown, coupled with the war situation in the CIS region, has led to significant import of high quality talent into the GCC from these regions," Dutta said. Industry insiders said the current surge in high-end talent movement to GCC is expected to continue into the near future as well, driven by the twin-tailwinds of massive expansions and diversifications of companies across sectors in the region and strong government support for corporate growth. Incubation of near-shore centers and service delivery centers in Egypt and Jordan to feed into global markets will also be an important consideration to witness movement of leadership talent to the GCC region from other markets, they said. "GCC is emerging as one of the best places to be [for corporate leaders] in the current uncertain economic climate. High oil prices, favorable policy making for new sectors and public sector spending has boosted the local environment, while also steadily attracting international companies to set up bases," Sandeep Ganediwalla, Dubai-based managing partner at RedSeer Strategic Consultants, a global consultancy for digital services, told Arabian Business. "Besides, the superior connectivity of this region, along with lower time zone differences between East and West, also mean that the regional headquarters out of GCC can manage Asia, Europe and Africa," he said. "The sharp vision and ambitions for growth of the region by some of the governments will be another major factor aiding the key leadership hiring momentum in GCC," he said. Dutta said aside from top talent movement from the western countries and Eastern Europe to the region, large multinationals in GCC have also created talent fungibility and mobility options for their top executives to ensure that high potential talent is retained to support their ambitious growth plans. Several regional and local conglomerates, on the other hand, have also grown significantly through the inorganic route, necessitating the requirement for induction of fresh leadership talent for new business initiatives and also to support turning around existing businesses. Industry insiders said the trend is true across sectors and industries such as emerging, conglomerates, traditional and digital organisations.

The Oxford Economics and SAP study found key challenges emerging where companies could focus to improve their sustainability results in order to move into the environmental leaders category As world leaders gather for COP27 in Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh this week, the new SAP Wave 2 global sustainability survey built on recent collaborative research with Oxford Economics, found that more than 60 percent of business leaders recognized that sustainability has a moderate or strong effect on their long-term competitiveness and profitability. In addition, customer demand as a sustainability motivator has increased sevenfold in 2022 over the inaugural 2021 survey. Based on data collected from 6,669 business leaders across 29 industries and 40 countries from regions including the Middle East, the survey found 75 percent of business leaders polled said they would either increase or maintain their current levels of investment. Of those planning to increase investments, 80 percent were intending to boost spending by more than 10 percent. Sergio Maccotta, Senior Vice President, Middle East South at SAP, commented, &ldquo;The survey found an impressive shift in the importance afforded to sustainability strategies in terms of both perceived value and investment. For example, almost 90 percent of businesses reported that sustainability informs their business decisions. Moreover, despite persistent global supply chain disruptions, labour shortages, and inflation, the percentage of businesses investing in the environment for the first time has increased fivefold since 2021.&rdquo; Despite these and other positive findings, the survey indicated that data quality appears to be a challenge for many businesses. Although respondents in 2022 were more likely to be satisfied with their environmental sustainability data than they were last year, there is still a long way to go. Only 23 percent of businesses are completely satisfied with their data, the rest point to gaps in the sources, quality, and scope of their data as their top dissatisfactions. Looking to the future, Maccotta said that businesses that are facing challenges or growing pains in their sustainability efforts can seek inspiration from the strategies used by environmental leaders. The Oxford Economics and SAP study found key challenges emerging where companies could focus to improve their sustainability results in order to move into the environmental leaders category. Efforts to address those concerns fall into five core areas: Begin with executive sponsorship: Sustainability efforts should start with setting an explicit plan that is communicated and emphasized throughout the organization. Drive clear, consistent communications: While sustainability efforts begin at the top, the vision must be turned into action by employees. Connecting key teams with clear goals is important to push greater sustainability performance. Integrate processes, technologies and data: Most businesses have not embedded sustainability into their core strategies, leading to disconnected technologies that double count, prevent strategic planning and leave financial and nonfinancial information disconnected. Unifying these assets provides visibility into progress and performance. Extend sustainable practices to customers, partners and suppliers: Energy providers are a key component of sustainability practices, but more than one third of respondents in the Oxford Economics-SAP study did not view using sustainable energy providers as critical to their carbon-reduction goals (36%). They also did not impose the same requirements on their partners that they put on themselves. Sustainability is a team sport that requires participation across the supply chain. Understand that data is critical: Capturing and analyzing data provides insight into resources and efficiency. It enables the organization to measure outcomes and raises the flag when improvements are needed. This key component is an area ripe for innovation across industries.

At the core of that understanding must be recognition among richer countries - whose industrialization and economic growth are largely responsible for causing the climate crisis - that poorer countries' development goals are non-negotiable AFP By 2050, a quarter of the world's population will be African, and their energy and development requirements are increasing faster than anywhere else in the world. It is increasingly clear that treating Africa and the developing world as genuine partners is a prerequisite for making effective action on climate change a reality. In my experience, leaders of developing countries are as committed to combating climate change as any leader in the developed world. But they also face urgent domestic tasks such as industrializing their economies, transforming their agriculture sectors to feed rapidly growing populations, and providing jobs for their young people. They want to pursue these goals in ways that are consistent with the world coming together to stop climate change. But they cannot be expected to do so at the expense of their own economic development. Moreover, the extent to which they can decarbonize or "leapfrog" the need for fossil fuels will be determined by both the decisions they take domestically and the support - financial, technological, and in terms of opening up global markets - they receive from developed countries. What is required - and what I believe could come to be seen as the lasting legacy of COP27 - is a new consensus between developed countries and the developing world. At the core of that understanding must be recognition among richer countries - whose industrialization and economic growth are largely responsible for causing the climate crisis - that poorer countries' development goals are non-negotiable. Their people's aspirations are legitimate, and they deserve our support in pursuing them. The first pillar of this new consensus involves richer countries working with countries in the developing world to formulate bespoke national energy-transition plans that are technically possible, financially viable, and politically acceptable. Such tailor-made energy solutions will enable low- and middle-income countries to pursue their higher development goals. Second, we need both developed and developing countries to undertake the necessary reforms to get investment flowing into sound and sustainable energy projects. Developed countries should make good on their financial pledges, being upfront about the terms on which they are offered. For their part, developing countries need to develop stronger systems of governance to make sure any financing is well used, with the aim of creating a pipeline of investible projects. Third, as with every other complex policy problem today, leaders around the world need to lean in to tech. Across all major economic sectors, technology has the potential to accelerate emissions reduction and provide developing countries with a path to sustainable economic development. Hydrogen, digital-optimization technologies, bio-fuels, carbon capture - all hold great promise. They need to be scaled up, and fast. Much more also needs to be done to create the markets that can deliver these technologies at scale. For example, Africa boasts 60% of the world's best solar resources but has only 1% of installed solar PV capacity. Comprehensive energy-transition plans can help to address this shocking discrepancy. Building a new consensus will not be completed at a single COP summit. But vital, perhaps decisive, steps can be taken in Egypt this month, before the baton is handed to the United Arab Emirates, where world leaders will gather for COP28 in a year's time. - The writer is a former prime minister of the UK Load-Date: \~November 9, 2022 \</doc>

SHARM EL SHEIKH, 8th November, 2022 (WAM) -- An effective strategy for tackling global warming cannot be successful without governments taking into account the important role of trade in meeting climate goals, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of WTO, said on 8 November. She was speaking at a high-level event with world leaders during the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to mark the launch of the WTO's World Trade Report, which this year focuses on climate change and international trade. The Director-General noted that the World Trade Report maps out pathways for governments on how to use trade to support national action plans - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - for tackling climate change. Each party to the UN's 2015 Paris Agreement, which sets the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C, is required to establish an NDC and update it every five years. "There is one big missing issue in what we need to do to fight climate change, and that is the absence of trade and trade policies in the nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans," she said. "We cannot afford to leave trade and WTO behind" in this effort. "The reason we're here to launch this report is because we want to make that point, and to offer specific recommendations and some actions that countries can take and fold into the revision of their plans. The Director-General was joined at the event by International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados, and French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Catherine Colonna. Alok Sharma, President of the 2021 COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, moderated the event. The World Trade Report indicates trade actions that can help countries meet the challenge of moving to net-zero emissions by mid-century and harnessing trade as a force multiplier for climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. Examples of such trade actions include opening up trade in environmental goods and services, improving cooperation on carbon measurement and verification, and transforming the WTO's Aid-for-Trade initiative into an investment programme that expands opportunities for sustainable trade in less affluent nations. International cooperation on trade-related climate policy, such as carbon pricing and decarbonization standards, can also minimize trade frictions and investor uncertainty arising from unilateral climate actions, which may in turn impose disproportionate costs on firms and governments in developing countries. The WTO can play a valuable role as a venue for transparency and potential harmonization of such measures, the report notes. The Director-General noted the important role of financing in helping developing countries address the challenges of climate change and urged rich nations to meet their commitment to jointly provide USD 100 billion annually to support climate action in these countries. Coupled with the financing and trade action should be support for investment, the DG said. She noted the WTO's Aid for Trade programme, which seeks to mobilize resources to address the supply-side and trade-related infrastructure obstacles identified by developing and least-developed countries. She noted that USD 48.7 billion was disbursed last year for such support, of which 31 per cent was allocated for climate-related actions. "This is something we can work on, to push more of that towards climate-related goals," she declared. The Director-General also noted that the WTO is working with the IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other organizations on a global carbon pricing framework. The WTO is examining how to work in criteria that takes into account the amount countries pollute and national income levels so that members accounting for a small share of global carbon emissions will find such a framework more acceptable. \</doc>

Reem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy delivers country's address at UN General Assembly session Wam The UAE has renewed its demand to end Iran's occupation of the country's three islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Musa. This came as Reem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy, Minister of State for International Cooperation, addressed the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. "History and international law bear testimony to the UAE's sovereignty over the three islands. We will never stop our legitimate claim to these islands, either through direct negotiation or through the International Court of Justice," she said. She also stressed the UAE's "firm position" calling for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on June 4, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital in accordance with agreed international references. "We also welcome the statement of the Prime Minister of Israel from this podium regarding support for a two-state solution," she added. The UAE is looking forward to advancing political endeavours in the region and overcoming obstacles on the path to peace. "However, this should be accompanied by efforts to strengthen international rejection of interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries. This meddling in Arab affairs undermines all efforts aimed at resolving conflicts and drives extremism and terrorism in a blatant violation of the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the region's countries," said Al Hashemy. She called for a firm international position that rejects terrorism in all its forms. The world has witnessed a rise in the flow of weapons to conflict regions and in the number of individuals of different ethnic backgrounds embracing terrorism. "This situation further escalates when terrorists use missiles and drones to launch cross-border attacks, reflecting the evolving nature of terrorism." These developments require preventing areas of conflict from becoming a safe haven for terrorists while at the same time modernising "our strategies" constantly. "This threat has manifested through the vicious and aggressive attacks launched by the terrorist Houthi militias earlier this year on the capital of my country, Abu Dhabi, as well as on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This came at a time when other terrorist groups such as Daesh, Al Qaeda, and Al Shabab are seeking to develop their capabilities and re-organise their ranks in a way that poses a direct threat to the gains attained through international cooperation in the war on terrorism," she said. The minister referred to the devastation caused by floods, heat waves, and droughts, "all of which intensify humanitarian crises and security threats, especially in regions most vulnerable to climate change". She called for Investing in renewable energy, which means investing in economic resources, international peace and security. "In this regard, we must leverage opportunities to forge practical, logical, and thoughtful solutions to the climate crisis. The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UNFCCC, which will be held in the Arab Republic of Egypt in November, is a prime opportunity in this regard. As we urge all Member States to actively participate in this session, the UAE is preparing to host COP28 next year. We are working to build partnerships, ensure inclusiveness, and focus on areas that will achieve meaningful outcomes." \</doc>

By Thomas Pinn Downtown Cairo is changing. Following a widespread beautification campaign to restore some of Downtown Cairo's most iconic and historical streets, the neighborhood is also undergoing an ambitious plan to make the area more bicycle-friendly. Hoping to make jumping on a bike to do your daily commute or to meet your friends a whole lot more convenient and safer, the local government in collaboration with UN-Habitat is on the verge of launching a bicycle-sharing scheme called Cairo Bike and a network of bicycle lanes. At just one Egyptian pound an hour, the bicycle-sharing scheme is aiming to create a cheaper and healthier alternative to your daily commute. However, this project is not limited to Downtown Cairo and is set to soon expand to Garden City, Zamalek, and other neighboring areas in the near future, with later ambitions to expand throughout the entire city. In the run-up to Egypt hosting the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference, more commonly known as COP27 , the project is being touted not just as a way to make cycling easier and safer, but as an important of the country's green transition. Despite the project's focus on cycling, it is also hoped that the project will have a positive impact on traffic and pollution in the area overall as more people ditch their cars or taxis in favor of a bicycle. For many, the words Cairo and cycling don't go together and Cairo Bike has a long uphill struggle to change perceptions and introduce cycling as a mainstream mode of transport to Egypt's capital. But regardless, the introduction of the nation's first large-scale bicycle sharing scheme and proper network of bicycle lanes may mark an important step towards a greener and cleaner Cairo. While the first phase of the project was officially launched several days ago, unfortunately as of Oct.23 the first phase of the initiative is not yet up and running. However, after looking around some of the bicycle stations and talking to some of the workers, we were told that they expect to be operational in the coming days. While the project will eventually run autonomously through a mobile phone application, you can register on their website and then pick up one of their smart cards 48 hours afterward if you want to jump on one of the bicycles in its early stages. Testament to the interest of Cairenes in the project and indicative of its potential success, I could barely talk to any of the workers at the bicycle stations without being interrupted every minute by keen young Egyptians asking about how they could rent one of the bicycles, frustrated that the scheme wasn't yet up and running. Despite the slow and bumpy start to Cairo Bike, the amount of infrastructure already built for the program gives every indication that the Cairo Governorate is serious about the project. While not yet equipped with any of the gadgetry for when the bike-sharing system launches as a fully autonomous system accessed via a mobile application, many of the bike stations are encouragingly large. Pointing towards the project as actually being understood as a practical solution to Cairene traffic, some of the stations have spaces for up to 30 bicycles. On top of this, Downtown Cairo seems to be awash with these stations on almost street and every turn, with a total of 25 stations and 250 bicycles in Downtown and more to come in Garden City, Zamalek, and other surrounding areas. Considering that every bike in these stands potentially means one less car on the road or taking over the sidewalks, Cairo Bike has the potential to have a tangible impact on Downtown's notorious traffic. Read More: Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Announces The Launch Of Green... However, having bikes that can be easily and cheaply rented by the public is just one part of the initiative to introduce cycling as a means of transport in Cairo. After Cairo Governorate and UN-Habitat discussed the idea of cycle lanes in Downtown Cairo for several years and conducted a few experimental studies, two kilometers of cycle lanes almost popped up overnight on several streets throughout Downtown Cairo. These cycle lanes, however, are more than just narrow strips painted on the sides of a few roads, they're generously sized lanes properly demarcated with rubber partitions to stop cars from taking over the space. Potentially learning from a similar initiative in 2015 that saw some newly painted cycle lines between Maadi, Nasr City, and New Cairo that unfortunately become parking spots in a matter of hours, the use of rubber blocks as partitions in Downtown Cairo should prevent this from happening again. Another promising aspect of the Cairo Bike is that it is being operated in coordination with bicycle-sharing experts Donkey Republic. Donkey Republic is a Danish company that operates in 70 countries across the globe with a total of 16,000 bikes and it is expected that eventually, Cairo Bike will run as seamlessly as it does in other countries with the option of year-long subscriptions a choice of pedal-powered and electric-assisted bicycles. For those who drive often through Downtown Cairo and are all too familiar with the traffic that can bring the area to a standstill, the thought of cycling lanes taking away precious space on the road may be a cause for concern. However, studies in cities across the world have actually shown that taking away road space in congested cities for cycle lanes actually more often than not reduces congestion and speeds up travel time for everyone. For example, in New York's Columbus Avenue in the traffic jam-plagued Manhattan, a controversial and ambitious project that took away road space for protected cycle lines actually reduced travel time for cars by 35%. Cities with old and cramped streets like Paris and London have similarly increasingly begun to rely on the creation of cycle lanes and the promotion of cycling culture as a way to reduce congestion and travel time. Although studies have consistently shown the turn towards cycling as a win-win situation for both cyclists and drivers, opposition to these initiatives always happens and Cairo will be no different. Egyptian organizations like Tabdeel, who have been promoting cycling throughout the country, have long maintained that Cairo would benefit as a whole from more people jumping on their bicycles just as much as other international capitals like London or Paris. Tabdeel co-founder Heba Attia Mousa told Scoop Empire that "If we dedicated a lane to bikes, it can carry 6500-7500 people per hour versus a car lane that carries only 600-1600 people per hour depending on the speed limit and traffic conditions. Knowing how congested Cairo streets are, isn't it time to think differently?" Attia went on to state how "From our research on cycling in Egypt, we know that when appropriately implemented, bike sharing provides an excellent service to the local community. It has all the positives of cycling plus the added element of providing cycling as a public mobility service. The new bike-sharing in downtown actually sends a clear message. Cycling is a mode of mobility and it is available publicly at an affordable price." Cairo Bike is having a shaky start, but there is every reason to be optimistic that this may be the first step in making Cairo a bicycle-friendly city. With the local governorate putting its money where its mouth is, Cairo Bike seems to be getting the support it needs and there has been an impressive amount of decent bicycle lanes created in such a short time, but the question is whether enough Cairenes are going to ditch their cars and give cycling to work a go.

DUBAI, 8th November, 2022 (WAM) - The industry's brightest minds, disruptive thinkers, most exciting innovators, and advisors from Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)-focused construction businesses will gather at The Big 5, at the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) from 5-8 December. Taking place on day three of the event (7 December), the inaugural Global Construction Impact Summit will help push a coordinated approach to meet local and global emission and waste reduction targets. "According to the recent WGBC Beyond Buildings Report, the macro urban built environment is responsible for 75% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, with buildings alone accounting for 37%" said Ben Greenish, Senior Vice-President of Construction at dmg events, organizer of The Big 5. "The industry must demonstrate a willingness to make changes if we are to meet the World Green Building Council's (WGBC) targets for the sector which include achieving at least 40 percent less embodied carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving 100 percent net zero emissions by 2050. By driving the shift from high-emission products for example to near-zero emission products, the industry can take a significant step forward." Greenish added, "The sustainability spotlight on the Middle East and Africa is shining brighter than ever courtesy of the next two editions of COP taking place in the region. As world leaders meet in Egypt this week for COP27 , ahead of the UAE hosting COP28 next year, it is critical that the construction sector does its part to help both nations realise their commitments on net-zero ambitions. The Global Construction Impact Summit will emerge as a green pathway for the regional industry, which has the chance to demonstrate international leadership by highlighting commitment to national net-zero visions." Discussion topics throughout the day will include how to advance net zero throughout the industry, ESG leadership in construction, the acceleration of change by scaling up solutions and collaboration, achieving zero waste through substitute materials use, and ESG metrics reporting - all focused on applications for the construction industry. "Having the opportunity to bring the Race to Zero campaign to the upcoming Global Construction Impact Summit is both exciting and timely. Our campaign, backed by the United Nations, is in full swing, but lacking representation from the UAE. We need to continue to drive action and ambition in the region as we look ahead to COP 28 in Dubai," said Bex Porter, Built Environment Lead, Climate Champions Team. "We are rallying non-state actors - including companies, cities, regions, financial and educational institutions - to take rigorous and immediate action to halve global emissions by 2030 and deliver a healthier, fairer zero-carbon world in time. In joining the Race to Zero, non-state actors can drive the ambition loop to show policymakers that the sector is stepping up to the needed transformation. On behalf of the team, we look forward to updating the industry on how we are progressing through our plan and hope to find partners to help us deliver our goals." Covering several pressing topics, speakers, delegates, and partners committed to integrating sustainability and net zero into their core businesses will attend and look for collaboration on how the construction ecosystem will support the region's ambitious net-zero targets. This year, 17 awards judged by an independent and international panel of experts will be presented at a ceremony taking place at Dubai World Trade Centre on December 5. Other 'of the year' Awards categories include Sustainable Construction Organisation, Sustainability Leader, Sustainability Champion, Sustainable Construction Project, and Sustainable Initiative. To date, The Big 5 2022 has confirmed more than 2,000 exhibitors from 60 countries and 20 national pavilions. The event is expected to attract upwards of 55,000 visitors. F \</doc>

"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not closing down, rather powering forward," said Reem Al Hashimy, the UAE Minister of State for International Cooperation and Director General Expo 2020 Dubai - during her final speech at the 170th Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) General Assembly in June. The minister was referring to the vast world expo site in the south of Dubai - where a new futuristic city, Expo City Dubai is about to open in October. Expo City Dubai's official opening date: The official opening is slated on October 1, but two pavilions - Mobility and Sustainability pavilions - will start accepting visitors from September 1. Expo City Dubai's ticket price: Unlike during the six-month event, Expo City Dubai will not have an entrance fee, but individual attractions within will have their own ticketing system. Tickets to enter the pavilions are priced at AED50 per person. A new attraction, called Garden in the Sky, will also open on September 1, with tickets costing AED30 per person. Officials are preparing to announce details of an "attraction pass," allowing visitors to access a variety of destinations without buying individual tickets. The future-proof district renamed as Expo City Dubai: Mega events, such as world expos, have always been criticised for a lack of legacy planning, with governments literally going bankrupt and ending up wasting huge swathes of land post-event. Dubai, which hosted the world expo from October 2021 to March 2022, was quick to respond to these inevitable concerns - announcing from the outset an ambitious legacy plan that will transform the event venue into a mix-used future-proof district. Although plans have changed from the initial legacy announcements, much of the initial strategy remained - Expo 2020 Dubai will soon become a new city, with retail offerings, office spaces, and entertainment venues, ultimately renamed as Expo City Dubai. As part of Expo City Dubai's 'clean and green' initiative, cars will not be allowed across the site, and "soft mobility" options will be provided, including the use of buggies, scooters, and bicycles. The city will also not allow single-use plastic within its premises. The buildings will follow international standards of sustainability to reduce water and energy consumption. Businesses who want to set up within the new city will also enjoy benefits of a free zone ecosystem. Major firms have already expressed desire to set up shop at the site, including DP World and Siemens. Other prospective tenants can visit the city's website to learn more about applying for a space at Expo City Dubai, where they are given access to a fully 5G-enabled environment, with officials saying it will be the biggest city of such kind in the world. Here's everything you need to know about Expo City Dubai:80 percent of Expo-built infrastructure to be retained for Expo City Dubai Expo City Dubai: Which pavilions will remain? What firms will be hosted? Reem Al Hashimy to continue work as CEO of Expo City Dubai Expo City Dubai to host DP World, Siemens, Terminus Group as anchor tenants in new freezone UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed picks Expo City Dubai as venue for 2023 COP28 summit Expo City Dubai boosts real estate demand in the area 80 percent of Expo-built infrastructure to be retained for Expo City Dubai Officials have recently confirmed that the site's flagship pavilions, as well as some of its entertainment and technology offerings will still be at the new city. These include the Al Wasl Plaza, the Garden in the Sky observation tower and the Surreal water feature. Alif, the site's mobility pavilion and Terra, its sustainability pavilion will live on as "interactive educational experiences." Later this year, the opportunity pavilion will become the Expo 2020 Dubai Museum - a new attraction that will "highlight the history and impact of World Expos and celebrate the success of the six-month event." Other existing infrastructure that will stay include the falcon-inspired UAE pavilion, Saudi Arabia's award-winning pavilion, the woman's pavilion, and the vision pavilion. Negotiations are also ongoing for some country pavilions to continue operating in the new city - including reworked versions from Luxembourg, Australia, Pakistan, India, Morocco and Egypt. Dubai Exhibition Centre, the site's main conference destination, will also remain. BACK TO THE MAIN MENUExpo City Dubai: Which pavilions will remain? What firms will be hosted? Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, unveiled the legacy plan of Expo 2020 Dubai: Expo City Dubai in June - which will be a smart and futuristic destination for business and innovation, driven by sustainability, innovation, education, and entertainment. Set to open in October 2022, Expo City Dubai - which is part of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan - will build on the momentum and resounding success of the six-month World Expo to create a car-free, environmentally-friendly, tech-enabled city of the future. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid said: "After the historical success of Expo 2020 Dubai, which was visited by more than 24 million visitors, and which left an indelible mark in the 170-year history of World Expositions, today, we announce the transformation of the exhibition site into Expo City Dubai, a city that represents the most beautiful ambitions of Dubai. "Expo City Dubai will be an environmentally-friendly city, one friendly to families, to the economy, and to future generations. A city connected to a port and two airports, and also to beautiful memories in the hearts and minds of millions of people." A sustainable home for business headquarters, startups, and SMEs - Offering a wealth of opportunities for businesses that meet its sustainable targets, Expo City Dubai is already attracting interest from a large number of commercial tenants. It will soon become the new headquarters of DP World, Siemens, and Terminus Group, as well as startups and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Expo City Dubai will be free of single-use plastic and retain 80 percent of the infrastructure and buildings that have been constructed, including 123 LEED-certified buildings, epitomising the highest levels of sustainable design, construction and operations. It will also be the first WELL-certified community in the region, demonstrating the built environment's positive impact on health and wellness. Which pavilions and attractions will remain open at Expo City Dubai? Opening 1 October 2022, Expo City Dubai will feature a number of Expo 2020 Dubai's flagship pavilions, entertainment and technology offerings, while also carrying forward the event's magic, energy and excitement. "This new city will be home to an extraordinary new museum, a world-class exhibition centre, and the headquarters of cutting edge and fast-growing companies. It will continue to host the pavilions of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt, and others. The Dubai Ruler added: "It will be a city that embodies the dreams of every city, and one which continues to bring joy to our children, our families, and all those we love." With an array of diverse attractions, the comprehensive city will feature offices, leisure facilities, food and entertainment venues, sports facilities and a mall. What to expect at the transformed Expo City Dubai? Later this year, the Opportunity Pavilion will become the Expo 2020 Dubai Museum - a new addition highlighting the history and impact of World Expos and celebrating the success of the six-month event. Other attractions set to stay include the Woman's Pavilion, which features female change-makers across the world, and the Vision Pavilion, honouring the vision of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid. Visitors will also be able to explore the falcon-inspired UAE Pavilion and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Pavilion. Details of several other country pavilions - including reworked versions of Luxembourg, Australia, Pakistan, India, Morocco and Egypt will be announced in the coming months. BACK TO THE MAIN MENUReem Al Hashimy to continue work as CEO of Expo City Dubai Emirati politician Reem Al Hashimy, the face of the Expo 2020 Dubai that closed down early this year, will continue her work as chief executive officer of the new Dubai city. Al Hashimy, who also serves as the UAE's Minister of State for International Cooperation, led the country's bid to host the world expo, and eventually became the managing director of Expo 2020 Dubai Bureau. Earlier this year, the expo organisers unveiled some details of its plans to turn the vast site in south Dubai into the emirate's newest business district. Emirati Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum on Friday appointed Al Hashemy to the role. He also appointed Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum as chairman of the new Expo City Dubai Authority. BACK TO THE MAIN MENUExpo City Dubai to host DP World, Siemens, Terminus Group as anchor tenants in new freezone Key firms including DP World, Siemens, and Terminus Group are confirmed to be the first £nchor tenants' in Expo City Dubai, a new freezone destination that utilises the vast site of the world expo event that ended in March. Both firms were major partners of the six-month Expo event - and senior official Ahmed Al Khatib confirmed the two companies are already fitting out their spaces in the city that is set to open in September this year. The plan was revealed at a press briefing in Dubai Exhibition Centre, one of Expo's legacy buildings in June, where senior officials of Expo 2020 Dubai discussed some details of its plans to repurpose the destination - "welcome to the next chapter," flashed on screen. According to Al Khatib, other businesses have already expressed their interest of setting up in Dubai's newest freezone, adding they have a "careful selection" process to ensure future tenants are aligned with the values of the city. "We are encouraging tenants focused on innovation, technology, education, and healthcare," the Expo official said. The Expo officials said some country pavilions will stay at the site, including those of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, India, Morocco, Luxembourg, and Australia. Further details on the new content of the destinations will be revealed closer to the reopening in September, they said. There will be no entrance fees to the city itself, but the officials said some of the individual destinations will not be free of charge. Major Expo buildings including the Al Wasl Plaza, the Garden in the Sky observation tower, and the waterfall feature will remain - with the iconic dome set to host cultural and entertainment events in the future. Instead, "tenants will be able to take advantage of soft mobility," which Al Khatib said is an ongoing conversation to plan how people will move within the city. Soft mobility could mean the use of buggies, scooters, and bicycles, he explained. Much emphasis has been given on utilising green technology to run the city. According to the officials, the site is already home to more than 120 Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) certified buildings, which is the most widely used green building rating system in the world. The city will also retain its installation of Siemen's MindSphere, the tech giant's platform that uses smart metering and sensors to monitor energy consumption and efficiency to power, light, water, and climate conditioning systems. The site is also reimagining its parking options - with the massive parking spaces to be used for off-plan projects for the next phase of the grand transition. There will be new parking spaces closer to the actual site, the officials said. BACK TO THE MAIN MENUUAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed picks Expo City Dubai as venue for 2023 COP28 summit UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has picked Expo City Dubai as the host venue for the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28), which will be held in November 2023. The directive underlines the venue's unique proposition as a state-of-the-art destination, which already successfully hosted the world for the six-month Expo 2020 Dubai event. Both Expo 2020 and COP28 share similar objectives: achieving sustainability and promoting international action as essential steps towards facing global challenges. COP28 focuses on a number of key pillars, including: the implementation of climate commitments and pledges; inclusion; working together to take concrete action, identifying solutions that contribute to overcoming challenges, and seizing opportunities to ensure a sustainable future for present and future generations The selection of Expo City Dubai as a venue for COP28 builds on the Expo 2020 legacy and message of "Connecting Minds, Creating the Future", and affirms commitment to the themes of sustainability, opportunity, and mobility. It also offers the UAE the opportunity to showcase its advanced and sustainable infrastructure, in line with the nation's vision for COP28, the state-run news agency, Wam, reported. The conference is expected to host more than 45,000 participants per day, including heads of state, government officials, international industry leaders, private sector representatives, academicians, experts, and representatives of civil society organisations. The new city, announced earlier this week by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, will be a global hub for innovation and creativity. The UAE is the permanent host country for the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the first country in the region to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, and the first in the region to commit to an economy-wide reduction in emissions. In addition, the UAE has also established itself as a world-class destination for hosting high-level international events focusing on climate action and sustainable development. Over the past 15 years, the UAE has emerged as a regional leader in renewable and clean energy investments, both domestically and internationally. It invested $50 billion in clean energy and has recently announced its plans to invest more than $50 billion over the next decade in additional projects, including hydrogen and ammonia. The UAE operates three of the world's largest and lowest-cost solar plants and has invested in renewable energy projects in 70 countries. These investments include more than $1 billion in grants and loans to 27 island countries that are resource-stressed and particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The UAE leverages effective and innovative climate action as a key driver to building a new, low-emissions economic growth model, underpinned by sustainability, and one that will create meaningful employment opportunities in new sectors thereby driving the ambitions of the UAE, the region, and the world. COP28 represents a moment of vital significance as the world seeks to maximise progress since the Paris Agreement. The conference will witness a critical stocktaking moment for climate action under the Paris Agreement, in addition to defining future Nationally Determined Contributions. With Egypt hosting COP27 in November 2022, the UAE is committed to working closely with the host government to accelerate global progress in climate action and adapting to the repercussions of climate change. BACK TO THE MAIN MENUExpo City Dubai boosts real estate demand in the area Real estate developer Dubai South Properties has announced a massive residential community development along Expo Road. Called "South Bay," the new community will have 800 villas and townhouses, as well as more than 200 waterfront mansions, the company said in a statement. "With the Expo site now transforming into Expo City Dubai by October and based on the huge demand for premium properties in the area, this project will be an ideal option for those seeking quality living with world-class amenities at competitive prices," a spokesman from the Dubai developer said. The community takes advantage of the Dubai government's ambition for the massive world expo site - which is set to become the emirate's newest business district called the Expo City Dubai. It will open by October this year. The new development will feature a 1-kilometre crystal lagoon, and more than 3-kilometres of a waterfront promenade, according to the developer. There will be a mix of three-, four-, and five-bedroom townhouses and semi-detached villas. The waterfront mansions will feature five-, six-, and seven-bedroom standalone villas with a built-up area of up to 13,000 square feet. Sales will begin in October, the developer said, but interested investors can already register their interest. The new development happens on the back of positive predictions about the UAE's wider real estate market, which has been recovering from the blows of the Covid-19 pandemic. Demand for properties have reportedly increased in recent months, especially as the government rolls out progressive visa regulations that would allow foreign investors to obtain long-term residency in the UAE.

GENEVA,1st December, 2022 (WAM) -- Most of the globe was drier than normal in 2021, with "cascading effects on economies, ecosystems and our daily lives", the UN World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said. According to the agency's first report on global water resources, areas that were unusually dry included South America's Rio de la Plata area, where a persistent drought has affected the region since 2019. In Africa, major rivers such as the Niger, Volta, Nile and Congo had below-average water flow in 2021. The same trend was observed in rivers in parts of Russia, West Siberia and in Central Asia. On the other hand, there were above-normal river volumes in some North American basins, the North Amazon and South Africa, as well as in China's Amur river basin, and northern India. In Africa, rivers such as the Niger, Volta, Nile and Congo had below-normal discharge in 2021, along with parts of Russia, West Siberia and in Central Asia. WMO said that 3.6 billion people have inadequate access to water at least one month per year and that this is expected to increase to more than five billion by 2050. The impacts of climate change are often felt through water - more intense and frequent droughts, more extreme flooding, more erratic seasonal rainfall and accelerated melting of glaciers - with cascading effects on economies, ecosystems and all aspects of our daily lives", said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. "And yet, there is insufficient understanding of changes in the distribution, quantity, and quality of freshwater resources". The State of Global Water Resources report "aims to fill that knowledge gap and provide a concise overview of water availability in different parts of the world", he added. "This will inform climate adaptation and mitigation investments as well as the United Nations campaign to provide universal access in the next five years to early warnings of hazards such as floods and droughts". The recent UN climate change conference, COP27 , in Egypt, urged governments to further integrate water into adaptation efforts, the first-time water has been referenced in a COP outcome document in recognition of its critical importance, noted WMO. The first edition of the report looks at streamflow - the volume of water flowing through a river channel at any given time - and also assesses terrestrial water storage - in other words, all water on the land surface and sub-surface and the cryosphere (frozen water). The report highlights a basic problem: a lack of accessible verified hydrological data. WMO's Unified Data Policy seeks to accelerate the availability and sharing of hydrological data, including river discharge and transboundary river basins information. Aside from river flow variations, overall terrestrial water storage was classified as below normal on the west coast of the United States, in central South America and Patagonia, North Africa and Madagascar, Central Asia and the Middle East, Pakistan and North India. It was above normal in Central Africa, northern South America - specifically the Amazon Basin - and northern China. "Overall the negative trends are stronger than the positive ones", warned WMO, with several hotspots emerging including Patagonia, the Ganges and Indus headwaters, as well as the southwestern US. The cryosphere - namely glaciers, snow cover, ice caps and, where present, permafrost - is the world's biggest natural reservoir of freshwater. "Changes to cryosphere water resources affect food security, human health, ecosystem integrity and maintenance, and lead to significant impacts on economic and social development", said WMO, sometimes causing river flooding and flash floods due to glacier lake outbursts. With rising temperatures, the annual glacier run-off typically increases at first, until a turning point, often called "peak water", is reached, upon which run-off declines. The long-term projections of glacier run-off and the timing of peak water, are key inputs to long-term adaptation decisions, WMO added. \</doc>

BALI, 30th August, 2022 (WAM) -- The inaugural Investment Forum organised by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is set to take place in Bali from 31st August to 1st September, 2022. Co-hosted by Indonesia on the margin of its G20 Presidency Energy Transition Ministerial Meeting, the Forum aims to mobilise energy transition investment, ease access to finance and accelerate renewable energy projects in the Southeast Asian region. A significant scale-up of financing is critical to meet net zero commitments in the region by mid-century. In the short-term, the aspiration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to achieve a 35 percent renewable share in electricity capacity by 2025 looks within reach. IRENA's World Energy Transitions Outlook shows that over $US24 trillion of global investment must be redirected from fossil fuels to energy transition technologies by mid-century to achieve a climate-safe 1.5 C. In Southeast Asia, renewable power, grids and transition-related power technologies and infrastructure alone require over $US five trillion by 2050 corresponding to two-thirds of total energy investment needed. By covering 65 percent of its final energy demand with renewables, ASEAN can reduce three-quarters of its CO2 emissions in 2050 compared to current policies, and in the process save energy costs of $US200 billion cumulatively by 2050. Jobs in the renewable sector would grow from around 1.3 million today to over five million by 2050. Ahead of the Forum, Indonesian Energy Minister and G20 President Arifin Tasrif said, "Now is the right time to accelerate energy transitions by boosting clean energy investment. This decade is the decade of action, to achieve SDGs target and accelerate a just energy transition. Post-pandemic economic recovery and instability in the energy market are serious challenges faced by all countries. Global and regional cooperation is becoming more and more needed to push for collaboration for investment in the renewable energy sector and clean energy implementation. I hope this forum could bring different sides and together realise a just energy transition." Francesco la Camera, Director-General of IRENA, added, "The speed of the global energy transition depends on progress made in Southeast Asia. Unlocking the region's renewable potential through investment will be a make-or-break in the fight against climate change. Indonesia's G20 priority to promote renewables for a sustainable recovery is the right way forward and sends a strong signal ahead of COP27 . I hope this Forum contributes to the region's just transition efforts to decouple energy demand and decarbonisation from economic growth with real tangible socio-economic benefits for people and local communities." By bringing together decision makers and leaders from governments, industry, project developers and investors from Southeast Asia, the Investment Forum creates enabling frameworks for investment, pipelines of bankable projects and facilitate access to finance. The Forum addresses policies and barriers to investment, the de-risking of projects and mobilising of capital. Regional and sub-regional investment forums are a key element in the Agency's strategy to support the mobilisation of investments in energy transitions with concrete impact on the ground. The next Investment Forum focuses on West Africa and will take place in Abuja, Nigeria before the end of the year. \</doc>

By Thomas Pinn In Egypt over a century ago, amid the then mostly rural Cairo suburb of Maadi, the world's first solar power plant was built in 1913. In a world of coal and hard manual labour, the sun miraculously powered an engine and effortlessly pumped the Nile's water to thirsty crops and parched soil. Impressed and stunned onlookers were invited to the grand unveiling. It was a glimpse of a utopian future of endless, free and clean energy, quickly soon forgotten, but now deserving of our attention as time runs out in the face of catastrophic global warming. An American inventor, and by all means eccentric for his time, by the name of Frank Shuman along with his Sun Shine Power Company chose Egypt for its famed all-year-long sun to test out this potentially world-changing invention. Several large 62 meter long concave mirrors stretched along an adjustable metal structure to follow the sun from morning to evening, focussed the baking sun into long glass tubes filled with water. The unforgiving sun boiled the water, whose steam aggressively powered an approximately 60-70 horsepower engine with around 88 kilowatts of power. This impressive amount of power, roughly equivalent to the soviet-era Lada Riva car still seen on Egyptian streets today, pumped out 60,000 gallons of water per hour from the Nile and distributed it to the surrounding water-hungry cotton fields. The solar power plant ran continuously for two years, even in the winter months, and was a clear sign that harnessing the power of the sun to power our energy needs could work not just in theory, but also in practice. In the New York Times on July 2nd, 1916, Shuman proudly proclaimed 'We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted, the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the sun'. He even had the colossal, if not outlandish, plan of building an enormous solar power plant in the middle of the Sahara Desert able to singularly meet the world's power needs. However, the utopian potential of Frank Shuman's solar experiment should not distract away from its relationship to the British Empire, according to historian Annalise J.K. DeVries, who spoke with Scoop Empire. Annalise J.K. DeVries, who is the author of the recently published Maadi: The Making And Unmaking Of A Cairo Suburb, 1878-1962 and is currently writing a book on Maadi's experiment with solar power, emphasised that in addition to Egypt's boundless sun, it also provided Shuman the opportunity to 'market his sun engine to the British Empire', which had both the money for investment and sunny colonial territories to implement his extensive vision. How we should remember Frank Shuman's ground-breaking solar power experiment in Maadi is complicated. On this point, DeVries told us that, 'While Maadi can be celebrated as an early site of solar energy innovation, part of the reason for that legacy was Maadi's proximity to British imperial authorities'. DeVries further elaborated to us that, 'Shuman's vision for solar power relied on maintaining the British Empire's authority in Egypt and throughout the Middle East and South Asia, so he did not necessarily envision solar power as something that would empower Egyptians'. Fascinated by the story, I headed out to track down the site of where this world-changing experiment had taken place on Maadi's Street 101, amusing myself with fantasies of finding the solar mirrors still standing somehow in the midst of the now busy area of Maadi facing the corniche. Expectedly, all I found was a carpark and a confused attendant bewildered by my questions as to whether this was the place that had hosted the first solar power plant over a century ago. Apart from a few mentions on the internet and an art piece by the Swiss duo Christina Hemauer and Roman Keller on Maadi's contribution to a future sustainable world that can avoid the worst effects of climate change, little currently records this important, but complicated, moment of history; however, Annalise J.K. DeVries's upcoming book seems set to put Egypt on the map in the history of renewable energy. Read More: Saudi Arabia Implements New Technologies In Anticipation For 2022 Hajj Shuman had grasped at the future all the way back in 1913, but with the tragedy of World War One putting further research to a halt and the the introduction of oil as the driver of the world economy, 'Shuman, his sun engine, and their connection to Maadi have largely been forgotten', according to DeVries. However, as the dangerous implications of climate change and our contribution towards it became clear, the world has again taken a look at the potential of solar power to power our energry-hungry world. And so too has the world increasingly looked towards Africa and the Middle East, as did Shuman over a hundred years ago, to harness its unparalleled sun and vast swathes of desert. As part of Egypt Vision 2030 and the country's desire to position itself as a leader in renewable energy, Egypt has recently jumped into action and is building on what Frank Schumen started all the way back in 1913, but this time in the interests of Egyptians. After a much-criticised slow to start to renewables, Egypt now plans to produce at least 20% of its energy through renewable sources like solar and wind by 2022, and has made significant strides towards this, notably with the Benban Solar Park. In the Western Desert, roughly 40 kilometres from Aswan is the colossal Benban Solar Park, measuring 37 square kilometres and powering over 1000,000 homes with a staggering total capacity of 1.5 gigawatts. The project in Benban is reducing carbon dioxide emissions by at least 1.9 million tons a year and makes up 3% of Egypt's total energy production. Benban is the fourth largest solar power plant in the world and the largest in Africa, and has been presented as a model to follow not just in Egypt, but across the region. With total foreign direct investment in renewable energy projects in Egypt amounting to 3.5 billion US dollars in 2021, roughly double the year previous, the turn towards solar and wind power in Egypt looks promising. The Egyptian solar power company KarmSolar told us that the 'solar industry in Egypt is currently very much a competitive, growing market, with limitless ideas and innovations constantly emerging'. KarmSolar also highlighted that the Egyptian renewables industry is receiving an additional push and attention due the United Nation's 2022 Climate Change Conference, known commonly as COP27 , set to happen in Egypt's Sharm el-Shiekh this coming November, and are hopeful that solar will constitute 'one of the main components of the energy mix that will allow Egypt to fulfil its strategy of becoming the energy hub for the region'. The world still has a long way to go and are way behind on meeting targets to limit the worst effects of climate change. Looking back at Frank Shuman's ground-breaking solar power experiment in Cairo's Maadi in 1913, we get an glimpse into the utopian enthusiasm surrounding the early days of solar power, but also too, a reminder that we should reimagine Shuman's selective vision to instead benefit the peoples of all nations.

Held in the context of the EU Climate Diplomacy Weeks 2022 and ahead of COP27 , the webinar brought together around 100 European and Gulf policymakers, representatives of the private sector, including industrial and building energy-users, architects, engineers, smart technology providers, as well as researchers and academics. The event aimed at fostering closer EU-GCC ties on climate change and inspire real action through best practice exchange and untapped opportunities for EU-GCC partnerships. The experts addressed the current debate around climate change, the challenges of energy efficiency in the building sector as well as the required strategies, policies and regulations to enable energy efficiency. Furthermore, they discussed investment and finance, business models within the energy efficiency sector, and the need for sustainable growth and development at local and global levels. The experts also put forward actionable solutions to tackle issues such as low energy efficiency, chronic dependence on fuel subsidies, and the active role that clean energy can play to target more sustainable, efficient and cost-effective methods for using energy. The event called for collective action through quick, cross-sectoral and human-centred interventions as energy efficiency will play a vital role in the energy transition as one of the key drivers for net-decarbonisation. Investments in energy efficiency will foster sustainable growth, which, in the short term, will be critical for recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, while ensuring greater energy security. Speaking ahead of the webinar, Andrea Matteo Fontana, EU Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, said, "The EU is fully engaged in climate action globally and has set the ambitious goal of becoming the world's first climate neutral continent by 2050. To this end, we have set legally binding targets for ourselves (including intermediary targets for 2030); which require all public and private sector stakeholders to work together. Maximising energy efficiency in the building sector is an important pillar of the green energy transition, and we look forward to working with our Emirati and Gulf partners to drive together the decarbonisation agenda forward". Dr. Mohamed Al Rashidi, Director of Energy, Secretariat General of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), said, "The GCC countries are embarking on a clean energy transition pathway, which targets more sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective methods for using energy. We are witnessing a real change happening in the region, with exciting visions and ambitious projects launched. This creates an attractive environment for the GCC and EU entities to be partners in this endeavour". Silvia Crescimbeni, Policy Officer at DG CLIMA of the European Commission, added, 'Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation. With the right policies and investments, we can revert the challenge into an opportunity to create healthier, more sustainable and more resilient growth models. Scaling up investments in energy efficiency and savings can help us advance towards our net-zero targets, while creating new jobs and economic opportunities.' Energy efficiency and renewable energy, represent one of the main pillars for any green energy transition. Both policies can provide over 90% of the energy-related CO2 emission reductions that are required, using technologies that are safe, reliable, affordable, and widely available. Energy efficiency in buildings plays an essential role. Energy efficiency measures and technologies offer solutions suited for small, medium, and large-scale applications that can be implemented in different sectors of the economy such as buildings and industry. In addition, energy efficiency provides significant co-benefits in terms of job and SMEs creation, revenue generation, interaction with research and innovation, increasing competitiveness and an improvement of companies' corporate images. In May 2022, the European Union introduced its Joint Communication on a Strategic Partnership with the Gulf, aiming to broaden and deepen the EU's cooperation with the Gulf Cooperation Council and its Member States. The Communication presents concrete proposals to strengthen cooperation on energy, green transition and climate change, trade and economic diversification, regional stability and global security, humanitarian and development challenges, and closer people-to-people contacts. \</doc>

By Belal Nawar Many Middle Eastern nations are attempting to diversify their economies since doing so makes their economies more resilient, particularly when that one source of revenue comes from non-renewable resources like the oil industry. This is crucial as economic diversification enables the development of a desirable, prosperous environment and raises the standard of its institutions and people's lives. In order to achieve this, several Arab nations are now stepping up their efforts, with their national visions reflecting a shared desire to expand their tourism sectors. According to the National News, nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are expanding the hospitality industry as they dominated the construction region in the area with 39,070 and 32,373 hotel rooms. This is in light of the FIFA World Cup being staged in Qatar, which would, in turn, promise a flourishing business for UAE hotels in the final quarter of 2022; where thousands of fans flood to the Gulf nation because there is a lack of accommodations in the host country. Due to significant bookings for Nov. and Dec, prominent local and foreign hotel chains in the UAE anticipate operating at a close capacity throughout the four-week football competition. Latest tourism projects Back in March 2021, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid launched a new project by the name "Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan" to create a sustainable future and reinforce Dubai as a global destination for citizens, residents, and visitors over the next 20 years. This Master Plan intends to boost the tourism and hospitality sector as it aims to make a significant 400 percent increase in land, which is dedicated to public beaches. Similarly, there will be a 134 percent increase in space allotted for tourism and hospitality. Another notable initiative is that 60 percent of Dubai's land area will be covered by nature reserves. According to a recent study by international real estate consultancy Knight Frank, Saudi Arabia also expects to deliver 310,000 finished hotel rooms in the kingdom by 2030 as part of ambitions to boost its hospitality business for domestic and international tourism. For example, The Red Sea Project is the world's most ambitious and exciting tourism and hospitality project backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund. The project will see Saudi Arabia create the Red Sea International Airport, a waste management facility, a coastal village, and numerous hotel destinations. This type of project is what the kingdom hopes to aid the nation to unlock new opportunities in the tourism sector along with creating new economic and educational opportunities for the younger generation. Read More: Lebanon's Labor Ministry Launches Platform For Job Opportunities... Let's not forget about Egypt as the nation holds strong plans for tourism in the upcoming years as hotel occupancy during the first half of 2022 was 52.6 million nights, a 63.6 percent increase compared to 32.2 million nights in the first half of 2021, as the Business Standard suggests. Sustainability is also a big part of Egypt as the country prepares to host COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh from Nov. 6-18. Taking that into consideration, on May 2022, Egypt's Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad, and Minister of Tourism & Antiquities Khaled el-Enany, launched the "Towards Green Development of the Tourism Sector" project. It is the first project of its kind in Egypt and aims to improve the performance and sustainability of tourism in line with Egypt's 2030 strategy. With the expansion of tourism, Forbes Middle East suggested that Cairo International Airport, Jeddah Airport, Dubai International (DXB), and Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport were among the top 10 operating on high-density routes within the Middle East. But what does that mean to the tourism sector in these countries? Well, there is undoubtedly a shift in focus to the Middle East, which reflects the slower pace of travel recovery across Asia since COVID-19. Forbes however emphasized the fact that the projects of Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt in conjunction with their Vision 2030 goals will see air traffic grow substantially in the next decade. \</doc>

BALI, 14th November, 2022 (WAM) - Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, Minister of State for Foreign Trade, delivered the UAE speech at the B20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, to detail how the nation continues to work to mobilise international efforts to stimulate trade and investment flows around the world, in order to help the global economy overcome current and future challenges. The economy of the future, he said, will be based on knowledge and innovation, as well as investments in clean and renewable energy projects and the development of agricultural technology and advanced technology. This will enable emerging markets and developing countries to achieve Sustainable Development Goals and strengthen the momentum for the recovery of the global economy. The keynote speech was delivered during the B20 Summit held on 13th-14th November in Bali, Indonesia, which this year focuses on investing in carbon neutrality and energy transition, and the use of advanced technology to reduce emissions and maintain sustainable growth rates for the global economy. Dr. Al Zeyoudi said, "The B20 Summit provides a vital platform for ministers and government officials from around the world to connect directly with private sector institutions. It is important to listen to their insights and experiences in order to inform the frameworks, programs and priorities that will shape the global economy over the coming year and beyond. This year's summit is particularly important because it combines the need to confront the threat of a global economic recession with the growing demand for development. Growth must be sustainable, fair and inclusive, and this requires immediate action and innovative thinking." In the speech, entitled "Driving Global Partnership to Accelerate Energy Transition", the Minister of State for Foreign Trade focused on the UAE's leading role in financing and facilitating renewable and clean energy solutions locally, regionally and globally. In this regard, he praised the historic agreement in November between the UAE and the United States of America to accelerate the progress of energy transition through the allocation of US$100 billion to clean energy projects by 2035. Dr. Al Zeyoudi also referred to other mega projects such as the world's largest floating solar power plant located in Indonesia, and the 10 GW onshore wind power plant to be built in Egypt following an Emirati-Egyptian agreement announced during the COP27 conference currently taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh. He said such investments represent "smart and sustainable long-term strategies that will generate opportunities, stimulate growth and provide mutual advantages in the future - economically and environmentally". In a related context, Dr. Al Zeyoudi participated in a number of other important forums and round tables during the Summit. He was a guest of honour at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance Summit, a special session that coincides with the B20 Summit that brought together more than 300 global business leaders from the industrial, financial and development sectors. Focusing on the topic of carbon neutrality, the Minister delivered a speech on the potential catalytic impact of the transition to clean and renewable energy and stressed the efforts of the UAE's leadership in the production of solar, wind and hydrogen energy. He also participated in the Milken Institute Roundtable to discuss the progress made by the newly established International Sustainability Standards Board on the development of global standards for the preparation of ESG reports, and how developing countries can contribute to the delivery of more representative models. On the sidelines of the Summit, members of the national delegation and representatives of the UAE government and private companies held a number of meetings with representatives of international companies and business organisations participating at B20. They discussed investment opportunities and prospects for cooperation in economic sectors of common interest.

A new study by Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation (APICORP) in collaboration with 30% Club, The American University in Cairo (AUC) and Arabian Business has revealed that the inclusion for female representation in organisations is essential to meet net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. "Our study reiterates the crucial importance of increasing the representation of women in boardrooms in driving corporate performance along with accelerating capabilities to fight against climate change. With COP 27 and 28 taking place in the MENA region, it is important that all stakeholders collaborate and formulate policies that encourage diversity," APICORP director of corporate communications and outreach Raeda Al Sarayreh said. "Despite commendable initiatives around gender diversity in the MENA region, industry data suggests that over $575 billion is lost annually due to legal and social barriers that exist for women's access to jobs and they are often excluded from many high-level government and corporate discussions on climate related issues," the study said. According to the study, female investors and policymakers on the corporate and public level are twice as likely to consider ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) investing when compared to men. As per the study, women, girls and marginalised communities are significantly impacted by climate change. Due to this, they must be involved in the "design and implementation of climate response actions to ensure the equal sharing of benefits." The UAE government taken conscious steps to promote gender equality and access of women to leadership roles. As of now, about 53 percent of the UAE's total workforce include women, with two-third government jobs held by women. Additionally, in the government, a third of the portfolios are with women. "Diverse perspectives and ways of thinking are necessary to face the complexity and instability of the current world. We need all talents and not only half of the population to succeed in the fight towards a sustainable economy," ENGIE chief executive officer Catherine MacGregor said. The same sentiment echoed in American University in Cairo's associate dean executive education, and founder of the Women on Boards Observatory Dr. Ghada Howaidy, who said: "Diversity is important because it means that we would look at issues such as ESG with a different perspective. A diverse boardroom would be better equipped to face challenges thrown by climate change or other risks." According to the study, "networking groups are playing an inspiring role in empowering women and encouraging them to have a vision for their success. Similarly offering women access to mentorship programs can help pave their path towards career growth." "We believe in identifying the need for mentorship and in having female mentors to help accelerate the personal and professional development of our young female workforce," founder of 30% Club MENA and chief executive officer of Lazard Asset Management GCC Farah Foustok said.

DUBAI, 7th November, 2022 (WAM) -- A report released by the World Government Summit (WGS) Organisation focuses on introducing working Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to address the harmful effects of climate change in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), African, and East Asian countries. The research - done in partnership with advisory firm PwC - pointed to the "moral duty" of local and global legislators to provide a resilient future for the next generation, given the unprecedented crisis of natural environment ecosystems in coastal areas, including mangroves, coral and oyster reefs, and seagrass meadows. Launched in conjunction with the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), held in the Arab Republic of Egypt, the "Frontiers of Change: How Nature-Based Solutions in Coastal Areas can Help Address Global Crises" report examines how coastal ecosystems provide a wide range of benefits for our planet and humankind. Through a series of case studies led by governments in East Asia, Africa and the GCC, the research makes the case for how NbS offer a unique, low-tech and cost-effective opportunity to tackle current and future global crises. The report also explains that If implemented cohesively and in an integrated manner, NbS can address multiple overlapping challenges simultaneously, as they can help mitigate climate change, reverse biodiversity loss, help prevent future pandemics and support economic development. "By putting in place the right policies and enabling conditions, governments can play a crucial role in unleashing the potential of these solutions," the report added. The paper calls on Governments to prioritise NbS as a way to tackle key global crises, integrating them into national development planning across government departments, not just environment ministries, and considering economic development through an NbS lense. Furthermore, a fundamental reset of how governments value the natural environment is required to recalibrate national spending priorities, and the full value of ecosystem services should be calculated to allow transparent cost comparisons between NbS and traditional approaches. Additionally, the report highlighted that regional and international collaboration is mandatory, especially as ecosystems often cross-national boundaries, and are affected by both public and private sector actions. "NbS are an important means for governments to meet their international obligations, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris Climate Accord), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They also offer the private sector regeneration opportunities to help address their moral and corporate social responsibilities, and to be held accountable on some of their ESG obligations." Mohamed Yousef Al Sharhan, Deputy Managing Director of WGS Organisation, stressed that the Summit consolidated its global scientific status as an integrated government knowledge platform, keen on promoting collaboration with think-tanks and global institutions to enhance the use of advanced technology and future sciences in building a new framework for developing global communities. Al Sharhan noted that launching the report is part of Summit's efforts to enable governments to foresee challenges in various sectors and design proactive solutions, thus contributing to enhancing their readiness for the future, while developing effective strategies aiming to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change and balance between economic growth and environmental stability, while actively participate in the development of new initiatives and programs that provide a whole-of-society opportunity model integrated for the future growth. Andrew Thurley, Senior Director of Economics and Sustainability, PwC Middle East, said, "Increasingly, and thankfully, environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are at the top of both public and private-sector agendas. As the momentum behind ESG as a force for positive and lasting change continues to grow, we will see a growing demand for NbS initiatives, both from policy-makers and capital markets. Governments and the private sector should work together to implement and scale up a green recovery. The solutions can address social and economic distress in the short-term, drive economic, humanitarian and environmental recovery in the medium-term and ultimately build a more robust and sustainable foundation to weather global crises in the future." The report also presents practical checklists for the national governments to consider. "First, encourage partnerships among government, businesses, NGOs and local communities to find common goals that can be delivered by projects. Second, invest in research to gather data about the value provided by NbS and promote knowledge sharing, and finally, ensure local community engagement as a critical part of the process," the report explained. \</doc>

Moving to a green Middle East can usher in a new model of growth for the region, says Crescent Enterprises, a UAE-based conglomerate that invests in energy evolution. Its CEO Badr Jafar was part of a World Economic Forum (WEF) dialogue in Davos on the collaborative action Middle East leaders must take to navigate between their net-zero ambitions and socioeconomic realities. "A green, resilient, inclusive approach to development can usher in a new model of growth for MENA, creating jobs while delivering the benefits of climate resilience, decarbonization, cleaner air and water, healthier oceans, and sustainable food and agricultural system," he added. The WEF session, titled Transitioning to a Green Middle East, comes at a critical time with the next two United Nations Climate Change Conferences, COP27 and COP28, both set to be hosted in the region, by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, respectively. MENA is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions, with the destructive impact of climate change becoming increasingly evident in the shape of droughts, water scarcity, and elevated pollution levels. Despite this, the region is regarded as well-positioned to become a leader in renewable energy and in green and blue hydrogen. While oil and gas will continue to play a significant role in the regional energy landscape, the region has witnessed the promising emergence of a new, more circular economy. "Regional leaders are at a crucial crossroads as they foster more sustainable economies, while addressing the implications of the energy transition," said Crescent Enterprises in a statement. In the past 3 years, the company has invested over $300 million (AED1.1 trillion) across the world in sustainable investments. It has also been active in the transition to sustainable transport in the region through its shipping and logistics subsidiaries, and co-launched a UAE-based sustainable transport company, ION, aimed at creating a zero-emissions transport infrastructure in the region. The UAE has invested $40bn in clean energy over the past fifteen years, with plans to invest an additional $160bn in renewable energy over the next three decades on the road to net zero. The UAE's Minister of Economy, Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri, said: "Energy security is a high priority. And it's something we need to really understand. The fragmentation that's happening globally, and energy supplies, will really affect the aspects of energy going forward. With that, the UAE has a long-term plan." The creation of the company Masdar, the implementation of solar panels, global projects helping the world to diverse their energy supply, have all shown the UAE's investment in future energy security. "The UAE's Net Zero Pledge and related strategy of going net-zero by 2050 is a great example of a practical and conducive policy that relies on a mix of renewables, natural gas, hydrogen, and nuclear in order to ensure affordable, accessible and acceptable energy is available to meet the growing demands of industry and our population," added Jafar.

With the COP27 (Conference of the Parties) climate change summit having drawn to a close, all eyes are on the MENA region as the world commits to combatting climate change. With the UAE gearing up to host COP28 a year from now in November 2023, marking a further global stocktake of climate progress since the Paris Agreement, the nation is focused on delivering its target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This promise, under the UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative, will make the Emirates the first Middle East and North Africa (MENA) nation to be carbon-neutral. As a global challenge that requires global solutions, the fight against climate change continues to intensify. With science showing that climate change is moving faster than we are, the 12-day conference will seek to amplify global efforts and reinforce collective actions as the world aims to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGS) of ensuring that \' no one is left behind'. The vision of a carbon-neutral future Across the world, governments have set ambitious plans and established carbon neutrality targets in line with the Paris Agreement, whilst building new strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as solutions to build resilience to the impacts. In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, governments are incorporating targets towards net zero within their country visions. In line with the UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative, the UAE will host COP28 in November 2023 at Expo City, the legacy district of the six-month Expo 2020, which shares similar objectives to the conference \- achieving sustainability and delivering international action as essential steps towards facing global challenges. Sign up for our free newsletterSign upThe role of the transport and logistics industry in enabling positive change One significant contributor to greenhouse gas output is the transportation and logistics industry, which accounts for almost a quarter (24 percent) of global CO2 emissions. Yet whilst companies within this sector have a significant role to play in driving economic growth, it is a challenging sector to decarbonise, particularly for developed countries, many of which are firmly locked into high-carbon infrastructures and lifestyles. As economies and populations grow, so does the demand for goods and the desire to travel. With a high reliance on certain modes of transport that produce higher carbon emissions, such as road trucks and air transport, exploring other methods of transport can help drive positive change. As an example, companies transporting goods for long distances through road trucks, could switch to trains, with one fully loaded train being equivalent to taking 300 trucks off the road, producing lower CO2 emissions to transport the same tonnage. The rail network that is leading the charge in the UAE A transportation and logistics project making a positive impact in the sector is Etihad Rail, one of the largest infrastructure projects in the UAE and in the GCC region \- providing a state-of-the-art passenger and cargo railway network that will transform the face of the UAE logistics sector. Putting sustainability at the forefront, Etihad Rail is building a comprehensive infrastructure and transportation ecosystem that will improve the efficiency of freight movement and provide integrated transportation and logistics solutions across the UAE and wider region, thus reducing the carbon footprint of freight and supporting the UAE's sustainability targets. In fact, the rail network can contribute to an overall reduction in CO2 by 21 precent per year in 2050, while reducing pollution, lowering fuel and maintenance costs, and increasing road safety and security. Aligned with the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017\- 2050 and the Abu Dhabi Transportation Mobility Management Strategy, Etihad Rail is focused on strengthening and supporting the UAE's economic, social and environmental development, and supporting the UAE's commitment to achieving the UNSDGs and contributing towards the UAE's NetZero 2050 strategic initiative. The journey to Net Zero With the climate crisis impacting the world in a myriad of ways, everyone across the world \- from nations to business leaders, to individuals \- is seeking ways to reduce carbon emissions. Small steps can lead to big changes, but practical solutions need to be implemented now. As one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, the transport and logistics industry has a huge role to play, and projects such as Etihad Rail are leading this change. As we countdown to COP28 in the UAE next year, public and private sectors must unite to play a vital role in reducing emissions, whilst implementing robust policies which support long-term sustainable development goals and ensure a seamless transition to net zero. Only then will practical solutions be implemented which mitigate the impacts of climate change, but also unlock new opportunities to transform the fortunes of future generations and guaranteeing that no one is left behind.

DUBAI, 13th September, 2022 (WAM) -- The UAE Climate Council, headed by Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, discussed priorities on the country's climate agenda at its first meeting since its establishment, held at the headquarters of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE). Almheiri said the current acceleration and exacerbation of the impacts of climate change around the world requires strengthening cooperation and scaling up action to achieve net zero. "Owing to the forward-looking vision of its wise leadership, the UAE is leading on this front with its Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative." "Through creating a joint framework that keeps pace with the directions of the country's leadership, the Council seeks to align efforts of government entities and increase the participation of the private sector in our drive to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reach climate neutrality. This will help us build a sustainable future, enhance the status and competitiveness of the UAE, and support the country in meeting its voluntary commitments to the Paris Agreement," she added. As the first order of business, the Council members received a brief on the progress of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, launched in October 2021. They explored the mechanism for developing an implementation strategy for the initiative, including a status quo assessment of emissions and their sources, the legislative framework required to achieve its goals, evaluation of potential climate change challenges and relevant mitigation measures, and aligning national emission reduction plans with sustainable economic growth. The attendees also examined the initiatives launched by MoCCAE to boost the involvement of the private sector in achieving net zero, including the National Dialogue for Climate Ambition \- a series of stakeholder assemblies targeting priority sectors, such as industry, cement, transport, and waste, to foster sectoral climate efforts \- and the UAE Climate-Responsible Companies Pledge, which aims to advance emission reduction nationwide. The next item on the agenda was an overview of the updated version of the UAE's second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, which raises the country's climate ambition and GHG emission reduction target. Moreover, the members discussed the UAE's participation in the 27th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) that will be hosted by Egypt in November 2022. The UAE Cabinet, headed by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, approved the establishment of the UAE Climate Council in May 2022. The Council is mandated to recommend and align federal and local strategies, promote joint projects with the private sector, propose public and sectoral plans and projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, develop and oversee the implementation of the National Strategy for Net Zero 2050, review and update the UAE's NDC, and report on the country's contribution to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. In addition, it is tasked with highlighting the UAE's climate action, facilitating participation in international conferences and other events, and driving scientific research in relevant fields. The new council comprises eight representatives of federal government entities, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation; Ministry of Economy; Ministry of Industry and Advanced Technology; and Ministry of Education; as well as the Office of the UAE's Special Envoy for Climate Change and the General Civil Aviation Authority. Seven members are from local government entities, namely, the Environment Agency \- Abu Dhabi; the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy; Environment and Protected Areas Authority in Sharjah; Ajman Municipality and Planning Department; Umm Al Quwain Municipality; the Environmental Protection and Development Authority in Ras Al Khaimah; and the Fujairah Environment Authority. Several private sector representatives were selected for the council membership according to special criteria for developing the GHG inventory issued by the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure for the sectors that contribute to carbon emissions and in line with the global methodology of the sectors that is used in the GHG inventory reports and the size of their impact. These include Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC); Emirates Global Aluminium; Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA); and Union Cement Company. \</doc>

(Image: source/xliii/12/images/Signing Ceremony (1).jpg) Saudi mining giant Ma£den has signed an agreement with Gulf Cryo, the regional leader in managing the carbon full circular value chain - from capture to utilisation - with a view to setting up a carbon capture plant in the kingdom. As per the deal, Gulf Cryo will construct and operate the mega carbon dioxide capturing plant within Ma£den's integrated phosphate complex at Ras Al Khair for a 20-year period, said the company. The partnership aims at reducing the carbon emission of the national mining company while providing a clean carbon dioxide (CO2) source to be used in industrial gases applications in the kingdom, creating a domestic circular carbon economy which increases the domestic value creation, fully supporting the plan to localise industries as per Saudi Vision 2030. The captured CO2 will be distributed by Gulf Cryo, partly to International Maritime Industries (IMI), Saudi's giant maritime yard, and the rest will be used in industrial applications such as EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) and water desalination, as well as in other industries such as food and beverage (F&B) and agriculture. The long-term agreement was signed by Engineer Hassan Al Ali, Executive Vice President Phosphate of Ma£den, and Engineer Abdulsalam Al Mazro, Vice Chairman of Gulf Cryo, in the presence of Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, at the Saudi Green Initiative Forum, which took place on the sidelines of COP 27 in Egypt. The agreement is considered the biggest carbon project for the merchant market targeting CO2 utilisation in the region, recovering as much as 300,000 tonnes per year of CO2 emissions that will be reutilised in various applications, said Gulf Cryo. Ma£den CEO Robert Wilt said: "As the largest multi-commodity mining and metals company in the Middle East, this agreement with Gulf Cryo marks a milestone in our journey to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and become Saudi Arabia's national mining champion. "It is testament to our commitment to fulfil the objectives of the Saudi Green Initiative, in line with our goal to be a role model for sustainable operations in the kingdom. Carbon capture will further strengthen Ma£den's position as major global supplier of blue ammonia, a low carbon approach to ammonia production." Gulf Cryo Chairman Amer Huneidi said: "It is with great pleasure that we sign this partnership with Ma£den. We will provide the necessary solutions and expertise to support Ma£den's sustainability strategy. On the strategic deal, Al Mazro said: "Investing in decarbonisation solutions in the kingdom is part of Gulf Cryo's strategy. We are delighted to work with Ma£den to lower their carbon emissions. Ma£den is a significant driver behind the kingdom's economy, and their agile ability to balance between the economic and environmental fronts is an example of a successful sustainable economy. "Additionally, we are vigorous in creating a circular carbon economy in which we capture and reuse the recovered CO2 within the kingdom itself. This circularity has direct results not only on the environment and the kingdom's localisation plan, but also on shifting mindsets and setting an example for young talents on the importance of changing how we operate in this world to preserve it." The first phase is planned to be operational by 2024 and both parties will explore further expansion of the project, he added.  \</doc>

A partnership between material specialist Partanna Bahamas and the Government of the Bahamas will see the development of what's billed as the world's first carbon-negative housing development. The partnership was announced by the Honourable Philip Davis, KC, Prime Minister of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas, at COP27 . The new venture will help to ease the housing shortages that the Bahamas is currently facing, as the country continues to rebuild after the devastation caused by Hurricane Dorian, in 2019. Partanna Bahamas is on track to deliver the first 30 units in 2023, the statement explained. In October 2022, the DMCC launched sustainability projects to decarbonise the JLT District in Dubai. Honourable Philip Davis, KC, Prime Minister of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas Rick Fox, Founder of Partanna Bahamas added, "Extreme weather events in our region are only getting worse, leaving a trail of destruction behind them. This year, Hurricane Ian took too many homes and lives. What will 2023 and 2024 bring, if we don't start to address the climate crisis in earnest? Technology can turn the tide, and at Partanna we have developed a solution that can change how the world builds." According to the statement, Partanna's carbon-absorbing brine technology was co-developed in the US by entrepreneur and three-time NBA champion Rick Fox, and his business partner, architect Sam Marshall. As a Bahamian citizen, Fox is said to have realised the potential impact it could deliver for countries on the frontline of climate change, and founded Partanna Bahamas with the intention of building affordable, hurricane-resilient homes throughout the region. In October 2022, the UNEP cautioned that the lack of progress leaves the world hurtling towards a temperature rise far above the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2C, and preferably 1.5C. Rick Fox, Founder of Partanna Bahamas Cement production accounts for 9% of all global carbon emissions. Partanna is an alternative building material that not only avoids significant carbon emissions in the manufacturing process, but also sucks CO2 from the atmosphere \- in much the same way that a tree does. This makes Partanna materials carbon-negative over their lifecycle, the statement explained. Partanna Bahamas noted that each 1,250sqft Partanna home will contribute a negligible amount of CO2 during its manufacturing process \- compared to a standard cement home of the same size, which typically emits 70.2t. Every 1,250sqft Partanna home will remove 22.5t of CO2 after production, making it fully carbon negative within the product's lifecycle, the firm said. The material is said to be made from natural and recycled ingredients including steel slag and waste brine from the desalination industry, enabling desalination plants to harvest more fresh water per liter processed without discarding brine back into the ocean. It requires no resins or plastics in its manufacturing and contains no Portland cement. The firm said that Partanna cures quicker and is stronger in the face of the elements. In November 2022, JLL issued a whitepaper outlining ways to decarbonise Egypt's built environment. Homes made with Partanna are hurricane- and corrosion-resistant, making them ideal for residents of climate-vulnerable areas like the Bahamas and other small island developing states (SIDS). This attribute means homes built of Partanna in the Bahamas can be insured, providing even further potential to reshape the Bahamian economy, the statement outlined. Partanna's building material has now been listed by non-profit Verra, the world's largest carbon credits certifier, for its verified ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere and generate tradable carbon credits. The revenues generated from the credits will fund various social impact initiatives \- including down payment contributions for low-income families, making home ownership more accessible, the firm explained. Fox added, "Partanna is extremely excited to partner with the Government of the Bahamas to provide safe, affordable housing to thousands of Bahamians." The parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in October, and manufacturing efforts are already underway. The development project will provide at least 1,000 direct and indirect jobs for Bahamians over its duration. Partanna will also provide training in the new skillsets required to establish the Bahamas as the global center of a new sustainable building materials industry, the statement concluded. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 1st November, 2022 (WAM) -- ADIPEC 2022, the world's largest and most inclusive international energy platform, introduced a dedicated Decarbonisation Zone this year to facilitate meaningful and inclusive dialogue and collaboration to tackle energy security, affordability, and sustainability. During the conference session entitled &lsquo;Decarbonising the downstream and petrochemical sectors: an ecosystem of change for downstream players', Vimal Kapur, President and COO, Honeywell said, "To advance the energy transition, what we've done in the last 100 years has to be done four times faster. "For this to happen, the three important levers are technology, collaboration and government policy. We've seen that when these elements come together, decarbonising projects, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are implemented quickly. There are several other similar opportunities like emissions monitoring and carbon capture that require a broader collaborative approach." Some of the best minds from energy markets around the world are gathered in Abu Dhabi to address the most pressing energy and climate challenges we face today. At the ADIPEC Opening Ceremony yesterday, Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Managing Director and Group CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), called for "maximum energy, minimum emissions" and stressed that "the world needs all the energy solutions it can get: oil, gas, solar, wind, nuclear, and hydrogen". Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, highlighted the importance of diversifying energy sources, as well as reducing emissions, when discussing the ongoing work that the UAE is doing to achieve Net Zero by 2050. The decarbonisation of global energy production is central to achieving Net Zero by 2050. The introduction of the dedicated Decarbonisation Zone and Conference at ADIPEC 2022 reflects this and provides a platform for global experts to share their insights into the most innovative strategies and technologies. Speakers specialising in methane reduction urged the industry to take urgent action. During the Decarbonisation Conference titled &lsquo;Operational mitigation action to reduce leakages', Frigyes Lestak, CEO of Flare2Valve, said, "We're working to solve flaring urgently. There is 140 bcm (billion cubic metres) flaring per day. This would be enough to heat 50 million homes per year. Many flare reduction products are economical. You don't need new technology. Don't hesitate, act now. We don't have a few more years." To speed up the industry's emissions reduction, Peter Harding, Founder & CEO of Kelvin, said, "Be brave. It's about the willingness to try change that may not work perfectly and put it in a place that's safe and can create improvement." Harding said technology that focuses on root cause analysis of methane leaks can result in a 10-20 per cent increase in production, while reducing methane emissions &ndash; making certain technology economically compelling. Such technology also empowers engineers to have more impact." The zone includes a forum for leaders in the energy ecosystem to discuss low-carbon technologies, and to showcase the essential role that the oil and gas sector is playing in accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy. Christopher Hudson, President of dmg events, organisers of ADIPEC 2022, said, "The energy industry has an urgent need for collaboration on solutions that will decarbonise the sector. This is taking shape at ADIPEC this year through discussions on strategies, technologies, innovation, supply chain and more. With leaders, policymakers, developers and suppliers across the value chain present at ADIPEC, I'm confident about the outcome of workable solutions to propel the energy transition and a sustainable future." Bart Cornelissen, Energy, Resources & Industrials Leader at Deloitte, said, "The Middle East is playing a pioneering role in the energy transition, as it possesses a built-in advantage and a head start in this journey. Major projects are taking place in the region to produce blue as well as green hydrogen, and the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are becoming major blue hydrogen and ammonia exporters by leveraging their existing midstream and downstream infrastructure." "As oil and gas companies continue to pledge support to net-zero goals, their needs continue to grow when it comes to figuring out new means to get there. We are present today at ADIPEC as part of our ongoing efforts to support these companies through this highly complex transition, sharing best practices that enable them to seize opportunities and navigate risks as they go through this transition," he added. Under the theme of &lsquo;The Future of Energy: Secure, Affordable and Sustainable' the leading global energy event takes place the week before COP27 in Egypt, and as the UAE prepares to host COP28. ADIPEC is enabling the global energy industry to reframe the energy transition debate, to ensure it is realistic, inclusive and equitable, as well as pro-climate and pro-growth. \</doc>

DUBAI, 7th November, 2022 (WAM) -- Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, DP World Chairman and Group CEO, announced the company intends to invest up to US$500 million to cut CO2 emissions from its operations by nearly 700,000 tonnes over the next five years. The announcement was made as Bin Sulayem addressed delegates by video at the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP 27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. He also reinforced DP World's commitment to sustainability by taking on the Green Shipping Challenge (GSC). Launched earlier this year by US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Change John Kerry and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\'f8re, the challenge encourages countries, ports, companies, and other actors in the shipping value chain to come forward with concrete announcements to further ocean-based climate actions. "Global trade has been an enormous force for good, keeping our world connected and lifting millions out of poverty over the last few decades. But this growth is not without consequences - from the scale of energy required to make, move and use goods to the resource intensity of logistics and the challenges economic growth can bring. As a leading enabler of global trade, we have the tools, ingenuity and drive to lead a step change in logistics," Bin Sulayem said. The planned reduction in carbon emissions by nearly 700,000 tonnes represents a 20 percent cut from 2021 levels. DP World's plans include replacing its global fleet of assets from diesel to electric, investing in renewable power and exploring alternative fuels. "Our World, Our Future' is our sustainability strategy, one that is designed to deliver responsible operations. We have already committed to becoming a carbon neutral enterprise by 2040 and net zero carbon enterprise by 2050. We will work with our global partners to develop an action plan to advance the goals of the GSC and encourage industry players to devise plans to address climate change," Bin Sulayem added. "We're doing this through three main pillars of activity; the electrification of our ports and terminals equipment, investment into renewable energy and through research and development projects that will look into alternative fuels, vessels and vehicles across our portfolio. "Our ports and terminals business is making steady progress, by following the strategy of maximising efficiency, equipment electrification, supply of renewable electricity, low carbon fuels and carbon compensation," he explained. In January, DP World entered a strategic partnership with the M\'e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\'f8ller Centre for Zero Carbon Shipping, an independent, not-for-profit organisation, undertaking intensive research and development to find practical ways to decarbonise the global maritime trade industry. "Decarbonising the maritime industry requires the complete rewiring of the entire system, imagining new supply chains and structures. It is a huge undertaking, but one that we are ready to venture into. We bring extensive expertise in integrated logistics and infrastructure, and deep understanding of the complexity faced by the industry, having grown from a local port operator in Jebel Ali to an end-to-end supply chain solutions provider, moving around 10 percent of global cargo", Bin Sulayem added. The global decarbonisation strategy aims to first reduce absolute emissions as much as possible, then focus on replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy resources, and finally purchase offsets for the hard to abate remaining emissions for the 2040 carbon-neutral target. Complementing technology driven solutions such as replacing vehicles and fuels, DP World is also working with local communities where it operates to establish carbon offset schemes, and carbon sinks such as mangrove forests. \</doc>

By Binsal Abdulkader ABU DHABI, 7th September, 2022 (WAM) -- Israel and the UAE are celebrating the second anniversary of the Abraham Accords signed in September 2020, which established diplomatic relations between both countries, on the backdrop of a host of bilateral deals, high-level visits and increasing trade and tourism, according to a top Israeli diplomat. "I arrived here ten and half months ago [as the first Israeli Ambassador to the UAE] and [since then] we had two visits of our President, two visits of our Prime Minister, around 20 visits of our ministers to the UAE. We signed 20 agreements, including the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)," Amir Hayek, who took charge as the envoy in October 2021, told the Emirates News Agency (WAM). 450,000 Israeli tourists in UAE in two years "We are seeing great results. We can be proud of the results in trade, tourism, and investments; and we are just at the beginning," he affirmed in an exclusive interview at the Israeli Embassy in Abu Dhabi. Revealing that an estimated 450,000 Israeli tourists visited the UAE during the past two years, Hayek asserted that tourism is one of the most important tools in bilateral relations as it strengthens the people-to-people ties. "We are talking about G to G [government-to-government] and B-to-B [business-to-business] links. We need to concentrate on P-to-P [people-to- people] ties that will bring the most important ingredients of the relations," the ambassador said. This will help people know each other's culture and it is the natural way for people to work together, he suggested. New relation as a marathon Describing the Israel-UAE interactions as a marathon, the diplomat said, "I think that it is like a baby, already two years old, and he can speak three languages and run a marathon. I will say it again and again, this is a marathon. It is not a 200-metre sprint. We came to build solid ground, solid relations, bring results and we have to be very, very successful." Hayek expressed his hope that such a success will attract other countries in the region "to come to the table" [Abraham Accords]. The US-brokered deal between the UAE and Israel on 15th September 2020 has already paved the way for Israel establishing diplomatic relations with three more Arab nations - Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. The Abraham Accords represents "a state of mind" of cooperation and of a new Middle East that offers a better future for children in the region, the envoy emphasised. Expo 2020, I2U2 The Expo 2020 Dubai helped further consolidate the bilateral ties, the ambassador said. "Expo was a magnet that brought many people to Dubai. And when they came, they saw not only Expo, they saw the UAE also. The Expo sold the power of the UAE, the beauty of the UAE and the tolerance of the UAE for us Israelis. I would like to congratulate the Emirati leadership, the Emirati management of Expo, which was one of the greatest events I ever saw." Talking about the I2U2 Group comprising of the UAE, the U.S., India and Israel, which launched two important projects on food corridor and green energy, Hayek said it is just the beginning. "We have a long list and we will do it. Because the economy will move it." The economic feasibility of such projects and determination of the leadership of the four nations will "push them forward," he added. Climate tech cooperation On the bilateral cooperation in global and regional climate action in the wake of two upcoming global events - COP27 [the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)] in Cairo in November 2022, and COP 28 in the UAE in 2023, the envoy said industries in both countries can work together to check climate change. "I am telling everyone in Israel that the UAE would like to cooperate with Israeli companies under the headline of impact. When I am talking about impact, I am talking about all the industries that can have an impact here in the UAE. They can have impact in the region and all over all over the world. One of them is environment." He explained that the bilateral cooperation in food-tech, agrotechnology, renewable energy, water, education, health, especially telemedicine, can make the world better. "We will cooperate for that." \</doc>

DUBAI, 28th September, 2022 (WAM) -- Under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy (DSCE) and Honorary President of the Emirates Energy Award (EEA), inaugurated the 8th edition of the World Green Economy Summit (WGES) today. The two-day event is organised by Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO), and the DSCE at the Dubai World Trade Centre. A large number of ministers, officials, and experts from around the world are taking part in the summit. Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD & CEO of DEWA and Chairman of WGEO, delivered the keynote speech at the summit. "This year, we organise the 8th edition of the World Green Economy Summit under the wise leadership of President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan who said in 2015, 'There will be a time, 50 years from now, when we load the last barrel of oil aboard a ship. If our investment today is right, I think \- dear brothers and sisters \- we will celebrate that moment'. This summit also supports the wise vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid to launch the 'Green Economy for Sustainable Development' strategy to build a green economy in the UAE under the theme 'A Green Economy for Sustainable Development'. The World Green Economy Summit is held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed and his directives to expand dialogue and promote concerted efforts to develop solutions for a better and more sustainable future for us and for generations to come. Held under the theme of 'Climate Action Leadership through Collaboration: The Roadmap to Net-Zero,' the World Green Economy Summit this year will explore opportunities for collaboration and exchange of knowledge and expertise among stakeholders, international and regional organisations, as well as public and private sectors, with the goal of promoting the transition towards a green economy. The theme reflects the need for international cooperation to combat climate challenges which affect the entire world," Al Tayer said, in his keynote speech. Al Tayer said that the world has witnessed major crises across all sectors due to climate change, which has caused natural disasters in various regions worldwide. Last month, Europe experienced its worst drought in at least 500 years, shrinking water levels in key rivers. This negatively impacted trade across rivers and canals, which contributes around $80 billion to the Eurozone economy. Just recently, one third of Pakistan was completely and deeply flooded with rainwater binging widespread destruction and misery. According to the World Health Organisation, water scarcity impacts 40 percent of the world's population, and as many as 700 million people are at risk of being displaced due to drought by 2030. The Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2022 indicates that climate change will impact water quality and availability. Globally, 800 million to three billion people are projected to experience chronic water scarcity due to droughts at 2 C warming. "Although climate change is the defining crisis of our time, yet we are not powerless in the face of this global threat. The UAE has been leading global efforts in tackling climate change and has always pioneered efforts to address global challenges and promote quality investments in the green economy. Selecting the UAE to host the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) underlines the world's recognition of the UAE's efforts and its effective role in combating climate change. Last year, the UAE announced the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative, with investments of more than AED600 billion in clean and renewable energy until 2050. This makes it the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to launch such an initiative. The announcement comes as the pinnacle of the UAE's efforts and journey in climate action over the past three decades since it acceded to the UNFCCC in 1995. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed also launched the Dubai Net Zero Carbon Emissions Strategy 2050 to drive sustainability, innovation, and transformation towards a sustainable green economy, as well as provide 100 percent of the energy production capacity from clean energy sources by 2050," Al Tayer added. Al Tayer explained that Dubai has succeeded in reducing carbon emissions by 21 percent in 2021, exceeding the target set in the Dubai Carbon Abatement Strategy 2021, which aimed to reduce carbon emissions by 16 percent by 2021. Al Tayer noted that the UAE hosts specialised international institutions in the green economy, such as the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi and the WGEO in Dubai, among other leading organisations. The UAE consistently supports global efforts to address climate change by announcing effective solutions that enable low-carbon sectors, as well as leading projects that support the country's future strategies and aspirations, such as Masdar City in Abu Dhabi and the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. Last March, the UAE Government, represented by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, the WGEO, and DEWA, hosted the first-ever MENA Climate Week. The event achieved remarkable success and attracted over 15,000 participants from 40 countries worldwide and 500 global speakers and experts. The event was organised in collaboration with the UNFCCC and other international partners. "The solutions necessary to reach net zero in the future are within our reach, but we are running a race against time. Guided by the vision and directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed, green hydrogen has become one of the key enablers to achieving Dubai's plan to reach net zero by 2050. In this regard, DEWA is developing a strategy and roadmap for green hydrogen in cooperation with international consultants. The 8th WGEO Summit focuses on four key pillars of the green economy: Energy, Finance, Food Security, and Youth. In the Energy pillar, we will look into solutions to enhance energy efficiency and decarbonise the energy systems. The finance pillar will focus on attracting and encouraging green investments. In the Food Security pillar, the Summit will examine approaches and methodologies to build resilience and sustainability into value chains to meet the growing challenges in this area. The fourth pillar will highlight the need to support and empower the youth who are the driving force of sustainable development and positive change in order to prepare the next generation of climate action leaders," Al Tayer added. Al Tayer emphasised that given the vital role young people play in the effective implementation of climate action, the World Green Economy Summit is hosting the Regional Youth Conference, which brings together which brings together MENA youth to discuss their priorities. This precedes the World Youth Conference that will be held in conjunction with COP27 in November in Egypt, as well as the UAE's preparations to host COP28 next year in Expo City Dubai. "Over the years, the World Green Economy Organisation has mobilised global efforts to promote joint action to combat climate change. In cooperation with the UNFCCC, WGEO established the Regional Cooperation Centre for the Middle East and North Africa in Dubai, which provides technical support to stakeholders to increase investments in technologies, solutions and partnerships to reach a carbon-neutral economy," Al Tayer continued. Al Tayer also thanked Sheikh Ahmed for inaugurating the Summit. During the Summit's official opening ceremony, Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, CEO of Alliances For Global Sustainability, delivered the UAE Representative in a video message, while Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary, UNFCCC, delivered the International Representative speech. The first day also featured a panel session titled "Implementing the Paris Agreement: Building a MENA climate action legacy". Dr. Muawieh Khalid Radaideh, Minister of Environment in Jordan; Kavydass Ramano, Minister of Environment, Solid Waste Management and Climate Change in Mauritius; Dr. Dena Assaf, Resident Coordinator, UN Resident Coordinator in the UAE; James Grabert, Director, Mitigation Division, UNFCCC, and Hana Al Hashimi, Chief Climate Negotiator, Office of the UAE Special Envoy for Climate Change, took part in the session, which was moderated by John Defterios, Professor of Business, NYU Abu Dhabi and World Economic Forum Energy Fellow. The panellists discussed topics related to climate action in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the significance of hosting COP27 in Egypt later this year and COP28 in the UAE next year. Sheikh Ahmed honoured winners of the 4th cycle of the award. EEA is organised by the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, under the theme "Inspiring Innovation for Sustainable Energy". Saeed Al Tayer, and Ahmed Al Muhairbi were present. The ceremony was also attended by officials from the government and private sectors as well as experts in renewable and clean energy.

Nearly two-thirds (60%) of businesses in the UAEand Saudi Arabia do not have a framework governing their environment, social, and governance (ESG) standards, and around half of those who do are not sure their employees fully understand it. These were the top findings of an exclusive study of 200 decision-makers in the two countries commissioned by ASDA'A BCWto mark the launch OnePoint5, its new ESG advisory dedicated to the MENA region. The name OnePoint5 is inspired by the world's most important sustainability goal &ndash; limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. OnePoint5 aims to strengthen the voice of the MENA region on ESG issues while helping clients to adopt more sustainable business practices. The new advisory arrives as Egypt prepares to host the UN Climate Change Conference, COP27 , in November, to be followed by COP28 in the UAE in 2023. Out of the 200 opinion elites interviewed, 41% said their business already had an ESG framework in place, while a third (33%) said they were developing one. A quarter (26%) admitted their company had no ESG policy. Underscoring the need for raised awareness of the benefits of ESG standards, over half (52%) of respondents who said their company had introduced an ESG framework said they did not fully understand it. Sunil John, President MENA of BCW and Founder of ASDA'A BCW, said the research indicated that the Middle East's business community had work to do to meet the high expectations of their governments on sustainability best practices. Developing a strong ESG proposition "OnePoint5 can help client develop a strong ESG proposition to deliver greater value for their shareholders and stakeholders," said John. "The specialist advisory will be led by Stephen Worsley, Senior Vice President at ASDA'A BCW [pictured]. A communications professional with more than 25 years of experience, he has advised clients in the sustainability and energy sectors, including Masdar, Total, Zayed Sustainability Prize, Engie, and First Solar." OnePoint5 offers four key services: Advice & counsel to client decision-makers to ensure sustainability thinking is central to their business planning and disclosure; auditing and gap analysis to understand a client's sustainability impacts; designing operational plans to help integrate best practices; and communications strategies and plans to help clients inform and motivate employees and internal stakeholders, as well as amplify external stakeholder awareness of their sustainability commitments. Bridging the 'say-do' gap "The gap between awareness of the acute need to advance sustainable development and action on the ground by much of the business community needs closing," added John. "Consultancies like OnePoint5 can help clients address this so-called 'say-do' gapby combining the skills of experienced communicators with the technical abilities of sustainability specialists." He said,"The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and several other countries in MENA have pledged to go Net Zero and are enacting a wave of reforms aimed at raising the bar for transparency, good governance, and sustainability &ndash; that is not to mention the massive infrastructure projects being undertaken, from The Line in Saudi Arabia to Expo 2020 in Dubai, the most sustainable Expo ever staged and the planned venue for COP28 next year. The message is clear: all of us need to raise our game." Climate change already impacting Middle East businesses The survey further revealed that Middle East businesses need to pick up the pace on climate action, with about two-thirds (61%) of decision-makers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia saying that global warming was already having an impact on the way their business operates. While governance standards also show room for improvement, 40% of businesses in the two countries claim to have robust policies to combat bribery, corruption, and unethical behavior. Forty-six%of respondents in the UAE and 43%in Saudi Arabia said they had a whistle-blower policy in place to expose corruption. The survey was conducted by PSB Middle East, the wholly-owned data and analytics subsidiary of ASDA'A BCW, from May 22 to 29, 2022. The interview sample, comprising decision-makers directly involved in ESG affairs, was evenly split between Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

ABU DHABI, 29th August, 2022 (WAM) -- Around the world, the indiscriminate effects of climate change and erratic weather events have been sharply felt over the years. The past few months have been particularly significant. Over the summer, these events have continued to take a devastating, if unequal, toll on human lives, commented a local newspaper. "Countries with very different climatic conditions and topographies are bearing a similar burden: the damage control caused by extensive weather-related destruction," The National said in an editorial on Monday. Dealing with flooding in six states, Sudan has had to declare a state of emergency. According to the UN, the floods have affected 136,000 people, killing 89 people and injuring 40. Drone footage shows villages partially submerged in water. Like many other parts of the world, last year too, Sudan saw similar tragic scenes. Given the regularity of such weather events, be it wild fires or storms, it would seem prudent that individual countries boost their climate preparedness. Stronger infrastructure built to cope with extraordinary weather events can be a critical to save lives and curtail damage. For the moment, however, responding with the required urgency, the UAE has dispatched aid to both the stricken nations that need supplies. President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ordered humanitarian aid worth AED25 million to be delivered to Sudan and 30 tonnes and 10,000 tents have already been sent, which will be followed by more as a humanitarian air bridge has been declared by the UAE. And like with Sudan, Sheikh Mohamed has ordered 3,000 tonnes of food supplies and other humanitarian aid to be delivered to Pakistan. The daily continued, "The trauma such devastation causes has no easy fix. Indeed, where lives are lost, families are left asunder and often permanently scarred. But despite the magnitude of trauma, rescue operations are greatly benefitted when wealthier nations step up to help nations in need. It is the only appropriate moral response. It was a widely-applauded point made last year at the UN General Assembly by the Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley, who in her speech advocated strongly for assistance to developing countries vulnerable to climate change. "In any affected part of the world, aid parcels of food and medical supplies are a lifeline to people whose homes have been washed away and who, in many cases, are effectively without shelter until the airplanes of aid arrive with the crucial cargo of tents. "The gravity of the situation in Pakistan's Sindh province is encapsulated in its rising death toll, which has reached 1,033, due to the breached water levels of the Indus River, Pakistan's longest and most important river. In just the past 24 hours, 119 people in Pakistan have lost their lives and 33 million people \- almost 15 per cent of they country's population \- have been affected." As unavoidable as natural calamities are, the images of people struggling to cope with the aftermath of such events should lead countries to not only meet their climate targets \- as is likely to be reiterated at the climate summit Cop27 in Egypt in November \- but also to allocate more resources to bolster disaster management strategies. This would help countries, no matter in which hemisphere, to be better positioned to effectively respond to inevitable climate disasters. "Floods and fires cannot in themselves be prevented. But in a planet growing warmer, the cost of countries being inadequately prepared could, in the years to come, be too high a price to pay," the Abu Dhabi-based daily concluded. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 7th September, 2022 (WAM) -- Khalifa Shaheen Al Marar, Minister of State, headed the UAE delegation to the 158th regular session of the Arab League Council at the ministerial level. He also participated in the consultative meeting of Arab Foreign Ministers, which was held yesterday prior to the session. During the meeting, attendees discussed coordinating positions with regards to issues on the agenda, in addition to decisions concerning joint Arab action on the political, economic, social, legal, human rights, financial, and administrative levels. On the sidelines of the session, Al Marar also participated in the meeting of the Arab Ministerial Committee on Iranian interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries. This committee is chaired by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with the membership of the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States. He also participated in the Arab Ministerial Committee meeting on Turkish intervention in the internal affairs of Arab countries, chaired by the Arab Republic of Egypt, with the UAE, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of Bahrain, and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States serving as members. Moreover, Al Marar participated in the Arab Ministerial Committee meeting on halting Israeli measures in occupied Jerusalem, chaired by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, with the UAE as the representative Arab member of the Security Council and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Palestine, the State of Qatar, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and the Kingdom of Morocco participating as members, and the Republic of Tunisia serving as chair of the Arab Summit. In a speech delivered during the meeting, Al Marar thanked Secretary-General of the Arab League Ahmed Aboul Gheit and member states for holding a memorial for the late Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He stressed that the UAE, under the leadership of President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, would pursue the approach established by the country's founders in internal and external policies and relations with other countries. Al Marar noted the speech by President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan addressed to the people of the UAE on 13th July, remarking that His Highness has reaffirmed the principles of rational leadership by emphasising that "we extend a hand of friendship" to all countries that share the values ??of peaceful coexistence and mutual respect in order to achieve progress and prosperity. The UAE has built its relations with other countries on solid foundations of goodwill, credibility, and cooperation and will continue to establish strategic partnerships with various countries. Furthermore, he referred to the part in the speech of His Highness where he said that the UAE would continue to support peace and stability regionally and globally while assisting other countries and advocating for cooperation in service of humankind. Al Marar pointed out that in light of increasing turmoil, tension, and polarisation in the global arena, the UAE shares the international community's concern over the impact on peace, security, and stability at the regional and international levels. He continued by stating that it is necessary to reaffirm the UAE's belief in the importance of adhering to international law, the United Nations Charter, multilateral action, respect for the principle of peaceful resolution of international disputes, respect for the sovereignty and independence of states and non-interference in their internal affairs, and that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve crises and dialogue and negotiations are an indispensable tool to solve regional and international conflicts. Al Marar explained that global uncertainty and tension have compounded the unprecedented challenges facing Arab countries, thereby requiring increased collective action, coordination, and cooperation to resolve regional crises and restore optimism to the Arab peoples in order to secure a better future based on an agenda of peace, stability, development, and prosperity. He stressed that recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, regional and global food insecurity, climate change and water scarcity, efforts to strengthen security and stability, and the fight against extremism and terrorism require joint Arab action and innovative solutions. Al Marar remarked that it is necessary to acknowledge the progress of Arab countries in facing these challenges. The Industrial Partnership for Sustainable Economic Development agreement between the UAE, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and Arab Republic of Egypt constitutes a model for joint Arab action in addressing developmental requirements and the impact of the pandemic. Moreover, the leaders' meeting at the El Alamein Summit reflects Arab coordination and consultation to overcome challenges to stability and development in the Arab world. "Having two Arab countries host the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 and COP28) demonstrates Arab countries' contributions to advancing the international agenda in climate change mitigation. The Arab Republic of Egypt deserves support and coordination for the success of its efforts to host COP27 in November this year in Sharm El-Sheikh. Similarly, we look forward to the support and participation of our Arab brothers in the success of UAE efforts to host COP28 in 2023 in order to make further progress and achieve our aspirations as well as those of the international community in addressing climate change," he added. Al Marar stressed that these are prominent examples of Arab action that encourage additional progress. He added that global tensions should not let countries forget the importance of strengthening joint Arab action to push for political solutions to ongoing crises in the Arab world. In this regard, Al Marar renewed the UAE's call for Iran to constructively respond to repeated initiatives and calls for a peaceful solution to the issue of the three occupied Emirati islands, the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa, through direct negotiations or by resorting to the International Court of Justice. Furthermore, he reiterated the UAE's firm position in supporting the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 4th June, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital in accordance with resolutions and principles of international legitimacy, the Arab Peace Initiative, and the two-state solution. He also called for support for all regional and international efforts to advance the peace process in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. Al Marar affirmed the UAE's support for efforts by Egypt and Jordan to reach a resolution that meets the aspirations of the Palestinian people and overcome challenges to stability and peace while avoiding escalation, tension, violence, and confrontation and preventing unilateral measures. He also stressed the need to respect the custodial role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan over the holy sites and endowments in accordance with international law and the historical situation at hand, and not to compromise the authority of the Jerusalem Endowment Administration and Al Aqsa Mosque. Moreover, Al Marar welcomed the formation of the Presidential Leadership Council, which was agreed upon by the Yemenis, and the continuation of the truce while stressing the pivotal role of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the importance of achieving a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire and entering into a political process that leads to a permanent political solution to the Yemeni crisis. He also underscored support for the efforts of the United Nations and its envoy to Yemen and other efforts aimed at securing a political solution in Yemen. Al Marar continued by calling on the international community to support adherence to the truce and exert pressure on the terrorist Houthi militias to abide by the truce's terms to achieve peace and end the suffering of the Yemeni people. Concerning the Syrian crisis, Al Marar underscored the importance of securing an active Arab role in efforts to reach a political solution, helping Syria return to the Arab fold, and rejecting regional interference in the country. With regards to the Libyan issue, he noted that the UAE condemned recent armed violence in Libya in August and called for preserving the safety of civilians, government headquarters, and property. The UAE urged the renunciation of division, the restoration of calm and serious dialogue, and the prioritisation of the national interest to restore security and stability in Libya. Al Marar also renewed the UAE's position calling for a solution to the conflict through a political process led and owned by Libyans. He also noted the UAE's full support for all that preserves the security, stability, and unity of Libya and achieves the aspirations of its people for development, stability, and prosperity. Al Marar stated that in light of recent developments in Iraq, the UAE affirms its solidarity with it in facing challenges. The UAE aspires for a stable and prosperous Iraq, supports all that achieves its security, stability, territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence, and calls for non-interference in its internal affairs. Regarding Sudan, he noted that the UAE is following developments in Sudan and stressed the importance of all parties continuing to engage in dialogue to reach a common understanding that will advance the transitional phase. Al Marar also expressed the UAE's sincere condolences, solidarity, and sympathy to Sudan as a result of the floods and rains that swept across large swaths of the country, stressing the UAE's confidence in Sudan's ability to overcome these challenges. Concerning Somalia, Al Marar stated that the UAE congratulates Somalia on the formation of the new government, wishing the Somali people success in achieving prosperity. He emphasised the UAE's consistent approach to working towards achieving peace, spreading tolerance, moderation and coexistence among peoples, rejecting violence, extremism, and hatred, prioritising dialogue, reason, diplomacy, and political solutions between countries, focusing on the human dimension, building bridges of communication and understanding, and emphasising the need for Arab and regional coordination to achieve a stable region and prosperous future. Al Marar also stated that in light of the UAE's keenness to address challenges facing the Arab world, and extending from the UAE's belief in the importance of cultural diversity in enriching human civilisation, developing nations, and building bridges of communication between peoples, the UAE affirms that the family is the backbone of societies and must be protected in order to advance society. In this vein, the UAE called on Arab countries to preserve the institution of the family and marriage. Al Marar concluded by expressing his appreciation for efforts by participants to make the session a success in the spirit of joint Arab action and overcome regional challenges to achieve security, stability, and prosperity for the Arab peoples. \</doc>

The Middle East is at an incredible inflection point. Across the sectors of sustainability and technology, the region is moving powerfully forward as a global leader. The region's progress in both sectors has been demonstrated through how the Middle East is in the world's spotlight across a range of global events. Whether it was EXPO 2020 hosted in Dubai, COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, and COP 28 due to be hosted in the UAE - in just under a year's time. Each of these events address the pressing topics of our time of how we can create a sustainable future for the whole world. Northern Ireland's long established expertise across engineering is allowing companies locally to recycle waste effectively. Niche technology from the region is also finding its way into the Middle East under different verticals, for example STATSports, a global leader in GPS Sports performance analysis system works with the Qatar national football team, Aspire Academy, and Qatar Stars League first division clubs. Enabling sustainable progress for the region Efficient waste handling is key to achieving sustainability goals. The total volume of waste generated in the Middle East stands at around 120 million tons per annum, with less than 10% of municipal solid waste (MSW) being recycled. This is a major concern, as existing landfilling strategies will not suffice to handle the increase, resulting in a need for adopting alternate mechanisms to deal with waste. The region is making inroads and moving towards integrated waste management with an emphasis on waste-to-value methods such as recycling and waste-to-energy coming to the forefront. A number of companies from Northern Ireland are providing their engineering expertise to collaborate and deliver solutions supporting the region's construction sector in recycling materials and meeting long-standing environmental commitments. In Saudi Arabia, the Red Sea Global partnered with Kiverco, who developed a turnkey waste processing solution that will recycle up to 95% of incoming waste from the construction within the Red Sea Development, making it available for further use. The facility will recycle 150,000 tonnes of construction material per year - that's around six times the weight of the Statue of Liberty. The waste will then be either recycled into new products, or used as fuel to produce electricity at the nearby waste-to-energy site. The plant will be used for years to come to support sustainable development by the Red Sea. Edge Innovate has proven experience of shredding tyres in the Middle East, with a fleet of customised shredders installed in Oman, with each shredder processing up to 500 tyres per hour. Finally, CDE Global is the leading provider of wet processing solutions within the waste recycling sector. Every year, CDE equipment diverts over 20 million tonnes of construction, demolition and excavation waste from landfill by transforming that waste into valuable construction materials. CDE is engineering sustainable solutions for a range of sectors such as construction & demolition waste, excavation waste, contaminated soils, road sweepings, trommel fines at sites across the Middle East.

Beyond cybersecurity, Northern Ireland's technology companies are working across the Middle East to support the growth of tech companies. Yellow swDesign, a Northern Ireland design agency, have successfully delivered immersive virtual reality experiences that present a completely re-imagined vision of engaging audiences with tourism and retail opportunities. Joule Group, which provides specialist fire safety engineering, have developed and integrated a fire safety inspection app for entities including the logistics company GAC, ensuring their warehouses are properly secured against disaster. The firm also created a computational understanding of the stadiums' infrastructure, both in designing smoke prevention systems and in evacuation modelling for a number of FIFA World Cup stadia. And finally, SLA Digital, who connect mobile operators and merchants for carrier billing, generating additional revenue for both parties while reducing costs. SLA Digital recently signed a partnership agreement with Etisalat to enable customers to access more digital content. This is just a small picture of the level of expertise that Northern Ireland firms bring across the sustainability and technology ecosystems. Yet, one of the Middle East's continued strengths is its spirit of partnership with companies from across the world to solve major challenges. Northern Ireland shares that same spirit: a resolute belief that, through partnership and collaboration, we can forge incredible and innovative solutions to our major global challenges.

Mita SrinivasanConnect With Me10X PeoplePublished: 27 Sep 2022According to recent findings from 3M's 2022 State of Science Index survey, 91 percent of the respondents in the UAE believe there is a need for more skilled trade workers. State of Science Index survey is an annual study that surveys the general populations of 17 countries and tracks the public image of science revealing trend lines over time as to how much people trust, respect and value science and the role it plays in their lives. The UAE recognizes that skilled trade provides value according to recent findings from 3M's 2022 State of Science Index survey. The survey stated that while 81 percent respect skilled workers, they would not pursue a trade career themselves. The survey which explores global attitudes toward science is now in its fifth year. While 91 percent of the respondents in the UAE believe that the workforce needs more skilled workers, such as plumbers, electricians, and carpenters, there is a lack of understanding when it comes to the opportunities on offer for those that take up a skilled trade. Addressing this understanding is critical with the ongoing skills shortage hampering employers across the UAE. It is not as clear cut as there being less economic incentive - 82 percent of respondents in the UAE believe they would earn the same in a trade as in a career requiring a university degree, although this is significantly above the 71 percent global average. The reservation to take up a trade seems to correlate to a widespread misunderstanding of the progression of a trade career, and how the digital skills required in other industries come into play. 92 percent believe that digital skills will help them grow in their career. It is clear that technology is a core component of the skilled trade sector. Tradespeople are required to embrace digital solutions for monitoring, implementing and performing remote maintenance on a daily basis. With the growing need for skilled workers in the UAE, the government has launched several economic initiatives to boost the country's competitiveness including investing in technology. With the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) approaching, there is an increasing need for corporate entities to shift gears on their ESG strategy and prioritize the well-being of employees and the community. To address the need for more skilled tradespeople in society, 3M has committed to creating 5 million unique STEM and skilled trade roles globally, through its Skilled Trades partnerships. This also includes 'reverse mentoring', which sees Gen Z workers help to upskill older employees on digital competencies. To continue growing the respect and attraction of skilled trades jobs, training schemes must put STEM at the heart of this sector The 3M State of Science Index is an annual study conducted for 3M by a global research firm. It surveys the general populations of 17 countries. Now in its fifth year, the survey tracks the public image of science revealing trend lines over time as to how much people trust, respect and value science and the role it plays in their lives. \</doc>

Despite around half of B2B marketing leaders globally saying their budgets have been impacted in some way due to current economic conditions, the majority (76%) remains optimistic about their marketing strategy over the next sixmonths, according to a new study from LinkedIn. When looking at the UAE and KSA markets, the focus on brand building is top of mind for over two-thirds (70% and 62% respectively) of senior B2B marketers, who say they will maintain or increase spending in this area in the next six months. The most cited reasons are that B2B marketers believe a strong brand supports long-term sales (54%) and helps brands stay on top of mind for buyers (41%). Over a third (35%) say it helps them to attract talent. Even more so, 73% of senior marketing leaders in the UAE and KSA are confident that companies that have maintained or increased their marketing spend recover faster following periods of economic uncertainty. LinkedIn's global B2B Marketer Sentiment study, which surveyed 1,700+ B2B marketing leaders from across the world, finds that the picture of optimism is uneven, with B2B marketers in India feeling the most optimistic about their strategies (94%), followed by Saudi Arabia (92%) and the UAE (91%); whilst only 56% of marketers in the UK and 50% of marketers in Germany felt positive about their plans. Businesses in the UAE and KSA have shown resilience in business performance amidst a backdrop of global uncertainty. While local businesses have faced challenges, it has also prompted them to factor in new considerations for the future such as integrating sustainability, technology, and data privacy into their respective marketing strategies. Incorporating sustainability into wider B2B brand strategies With COP27 When asked about campaign objectives in the next six months, the top priority for B2B marketers in the UAE is showcasing that the brands they represent are serious about sustainability (51%), followed closely by showing customers that these brands are helping out in that domain (50%). In a similar vein, marketers in Saudi Arabia also said sustainability is a priority (47%), followed closely by nurturing customer relationships (44%). B2B marketers navigate data privacy and technology The research study strongly suggests that B2B marketers are keen to focus on elements that directly support each country's broader economic ambition, especially as the UAE and KSA strive to become the next global digital hubs. Diana Daou, Head of LinkedIn Marketing Solutions MENA, said in a statement,"Despite economic headwinds, it's inspiring to see B2B marketers in the UAE and KSA remain optimistic about their strategies as they navigate uncertainty. Pausing ad spend can seem like a cost-saving measure, but savvy marketers know that linking their strategy to national visions and broader goals can lead to more success in the long term. In fact, recovering from a drop in memorability can be far more costly, whereas focusing efforts on brand building can be fruitful, especially as competitors pull back. The biggest opportunity for B2B marketers right now across the region is to invest in customer and internal stakeholder relationships, followed by rethinking the brand story, which is crucial to maintain relevance and secure future budgets. There is also a strong need to incorporate sustainability-driven marketing campaigns as this topic becomes more prevalent in the region." LinkedIn's advice for B2B marketers navigating uncertainty In times of uncertainty, B2B brands can optimize on recency, not frequency - by building a strategy that steadily maintains brand presence. Advertising consistently helps to avoid memory corrosion and keeps your brand front of mind when buyers are back in market and the need for your product or service eventually arises. With B2B brands looking to do more with less, creativity is the #1 most sought-after skill currently which can help marketers unlock new opportunities. LinkedIn's Creativity Playbook offers best practices, expert advice, and top tips to empower brands and agencies to do their best work. With proving marketing effectiveness a top priority for B2B marketers, mastering the language of return on investment (ROI) and translating it to business stakeholders is key. Marketers need to hone the ability to express the long-term value of their activity in financial terms and demonstrate the impact it is having on the business. \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 11th October, 2022 (WAM) -- The Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) today announced that it is partnering with Siemens Energy AG to accelerate the journey to net zero in the UAE and globally. Under the partnership, Siemens Energy will receive support to set up its Middle East Innovation Centre in Abu Dhabi, as part of ADIO's AED 2 billion (US$545 million) Innovation Programme that creates growth opportunities for businesses in the emirate. The partnership agreement was signed by Abdulla Abdul Aziz Al Shamsi, Acting Director-General of ADIO, and Dietmar Siersdorfer, Managing Director of Siemens Energy Middle East. The ceremony comes on the back of German Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit to the UAE on 25th September, during which he witnessed the signing of the New Energy Security and Industry Accelerator agreement that will accelerate projects between the UAE and Germany in energy security, decarbonisation and climate action. Siemens Energy chose Abu Dhabi for its Middle East Innovation Centre because of the emirate's efforts to decarbonise the economy, become a global hub for green energy and grow the knowledge ecosystem. The Innovation Centre will contribute to the UAE's goals of generating 50GW of renewable energy by 2050 and becoming a global energy centre of excellence. The Innovation Centre in Abu Dhabi is one of only four globally that Siemens Energy has created, with the other locations in Orlando in the United States, Shenzhen in China and Berlin in Germany. It will leverage the company's expertise in developing sustainable, reliable and affordable clean energy technologies. It will also act as an incubator for new startups and technologies, bringing together customers, industrial partners, academia and research centres to accelerate the commercialisation of innovative solutions driving the energy transition. The Abu Dhabi Innovation Centre will be headed by Siemens Energy Chief Technology Officer, Middle East, Dr-Ing. Fahad Alyafei with a goal of not only developing innovative new technologies to accelerate the journey to net zero, but also enriching the economy through Emiratisation, job creation, skills and knowledge transfer, to develop the next generation of innovative researchers. Al Shamsi said, "As the UAE makes strides toward our net-zero goal, we are prioritising the development of pioneering technologies to meet the demand for sustainable energy. The partnership between ADIO and Siemens Energy will enrich the energy technology ecosystem with the introduction of new ideas and solutions that open pathways for the global energy transition. ADIO will continue to partner with innovation-driven companies in high-impact sectors to help them reach the next stage of their growth." ADIO's Innovation Programme will provide financial and non-financial incentives to Siemens Energy to establish its new Middle East Customer Innovation Centre in Abu Dhabi. The centre furthers the company's mission to meet the growing global demand for sustainable energy by facilitating pioneering ideas and technologies that can be added to Siemens Energy's existing products and services across the entire energy value chain. The Innovation Centre will primarily focus on developing circular carbon economies and technologies incorporating digital decarbonisation solutions, green fuels, fuel cells and electrification of heat and industrial processes. A host of intellectual property is expected to be developed, along with an aim to facilitate six industry partnerships and four Abu Dhabi university research partnerships by 2025. In addition to supporting knowledge transfer and developing new commercial solutions, the centre will strengthen specialised skillsets and create 75 high-skilled jobs in Abu Dhabi by 2025. Siemens Energy will also offer at least six internships annually to students from Abu Dhabi universities, of which 50% of the interns will be Emiratis. For his part, Siersdorfer said, "To accelerate decarbonisation and reach net zero faster, we need to leverage partnership and innovation. As one of four globally, this Siemens Energy Innovation Centre in Abu Dhabi, in collaboration with ADIO, will enable us to leverage the rich industrial ecosystem in Abu Dhabi, and work with startups, academia as well as public and private companies to develop and commercialise new technologies that will make a meaningful impact on carbon reduction." Siemens Energy views Abu Dhabi as a long-term strategic partner given the emirate's accessible critical assets including low-cost and reliable renewable energy, existing petrochemical infrastructure and the presence of critical non-oil logistical and heavy industries. The partnership contributes to the achievement of the UAE's net-zero goals by driving the energy transition and helping Abu Dhabi entities achieve their decarbonisation targets. The launch of the Innovation Centre not only aligns with the goals of 2022's COP27 in Egypt but supports the vision for 2023's COP28 in the UAE, which aims to increase global climate action, while maximising the economic benefits both regionally and globally. ADIO's Innovation Programme supports high-growth companies and helps them tap into sizeable business and growth opportunities in Abu Dhabi. The programme has allocated AED 1.3 billion to support more than 40 innovative companies from around the world since its 2020 launch. \</doc>

In early 2021, optimism was in order with 74% of employers expecting business activity to increase, leading to a boost in recruitment. Have these prospects materialized in 2022 for you? They have been slower than expected. We had also felt a business kickstart was due to arrive back into the market and [from] Q3 onwards, we have seen the [number] of new business requests steadily increase. That new business growth will drive recruitment needs. Do you believe that the Great Resignation predicted in 2020 finally materialized in our industry in the GCC? Iwould call it an evaluation of life! I think a lot of people realized post Covid that they needed to reevaluate what they were doing professionally and, importantly, personally, and this did see a percentage of people changing course. What are the main drivers behind employees&rsquo; decisions to change jobs or accept a new job offer? These vary significantly across personal life stages and professional opportunities that arise. I think that career development is a main driver professionally, as it is in global markets. Have salaries increased in your organization in 2022 and, if so, do you expect this trend to continue in 2023? Not significantly. We monitor average livingcosts as well as market rates to help us set salaryguidelines. Currently, we are monitoring the energy costs that are affecting inflation, and review yearly. This relates to travel and living cost support. We also try to leverage discountswhere relevant for staff, within our office environment. Some studies show that salaries have been increasing more abroad than in the GCC. How does this impact recruitment and retention? Any remuneration must reflect the living costs of the country you are in and the growth of the market you are in. What are the main changes that you are implementing in compensation schemes to attract/retain employees, if any? We have a standard approach to compensation in line with most other companies. Yes, most companies are now following work-from-office policies [and] we have a work-from-office policy now in place. Our business relies partly on human interaction to help spark thecreativity we provide. We state this clearly during any recruitment process, and retention has remainedfor 99% of staff. Has your headcount increased in 2022 so far and do you expect this trend to continue in 2023? No. Our headcount has been and always will be related to our clients&rsquo; needs. Business comes and sometimes, the reality is that business goes. Our headcount reflects that. Which roles are you most looking for in the GCC? Yes. The new UAE labor law requires contracts to be fixed, and hence we have complied ahead of time. The freelance market is more buoyant and fits with the changing nature of our clients&rsquo; businesses, where we see an increase in project-based work. How have the new labor laws in the UAE transformed the way you approach employment? In KSA, boosted by Saudi Vision 2030, in terms of women employment in particular? We have always been a diversity-cognizant employer,and this covers both gender and nationality. It is something we pride ourselves on and will continue to develop with our staff. How has the new, longer weekend in the UAE impacted the workforce and performance? This was a great initiative by the UAE government and has helped us provide better flexibility to staff. And that can only increase performance. Has the role of HR teams transformed and even been strengthened by the recent crisis? The HR team has actually been overwhelmed in recent times, with the amount of process management related to Covid; changes in client business requirements; and also, with the [number] of contract turnovers related to freelance projects. This has resulted more in an all-hands-on approach to managing the workload but I&rsquo;m happy to say there is light in that tunnel and we are developing the team to cope. What innovations do you see in our industry in hiring, retention, employee development, and remuneration/reward systems? Innovation needs to come within culture-build initiatives. A happy place to work means a happy place to be, and this helps drive hiring. Development needs to come through mentoring and training, and post Covid, this is now coming back online with staff. It is critical we are on the curve &ndash; hopefully ahead of the curve &ndash; when it comes to creativity, media, and data management. What other trends are you identifying for 2023? The good news is the region will host COP27 and COP28, and important discussions on sustainability and the future of energy will take place. This will drive a narrative for the region and for the world, and we will see business develop accordingly. This article was published inCommunicate'slatest issue. \</doc>

Natural gas usage in Western Europe fell 22 per cent in October from the same month a year earlier, according to data from Energy Scan. Residential and business-related gas usage fell by an even steeper 33 per cent Europe might have the reputation for loving and creating luxury, but it is proving it can tough it out if need be. Despite dropping temperatures, residents of the region have joined government efforts to keep the heating off in the face of potentially fearsome energy prices. As a result, wholesale prices plummeted as a glut from eager suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) hit the market. While a mild autumn helped and much remains to be seen, Europe's response to the energy crisis has surprised critics. Many are wondering if the crisis has established a new paradigm that will supercharge conservation efforts and the long-term battle against climate change - or simply drive efforts to find more carbon-based fuels. Faced with a diminished supply of natural gas from Russia related to the Ukraine conflict, governments across Europe decided to keep the heat off in public buildings until December 1 and asked consumers to do the same. When the heating is switched on, they want to limit the thermostat setting to 19 C. Huge shipments of LNG - so great has been the response that full massive tankers are lined up at sea queuing to offload - and brimming storage facilities are now easing concerns over gas rationing or truly disastrous prices. Anecdotal reports say gas prices to residential users appear to have about doubled over the low traditional rate, allaying fears publicized early in the fall over a potential price rise of five times or greater. Julien Hoarau, head of analysis at Energy Scan, a firm that monitors usage for the energy industry, told the press that there are "emerging signs of behavioural change regarding heating usage" resulting in "strong bearish pressure on spot gas prices across Europe and strengthened ability for the continent to balance its gas system this winter". Natural gas usage in Western Europe fell 22 per cent in October from the same month a year earlier, according to data from Energy Scan. Residential and business-related gas usage fell by an even steeper 33 per cent. In just 200 days Germany will have completed construction of its first import terminal for LNG, at Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea, easing fears that Europe's largest economy could face gas rationing this winter. Earlier this year, it chartered five floating storage units, with the first LNG tankers due to dock early next year. "Germany can be fast and advance infrastructure projects with great determination when the federal and regional governments, together with the project participants, all pull together," said German Economy Minister Robert Habeck. Italy also moved in record time to approve a controversial new LNG terminal in the port of Piombino in Tuscany. With little domestic gas production and a ban on nuclear power, Italy is heavily reliant on imports. Before the Ukraine war, Russia supplied nearly 40 percent of its total energy. Italian energy giant Eni is roaming far afield in search of new supplies, particularly in Africa. It hailed what it called a major achievement as the first shipment of LNG left the Mozambique Coral Sul gas field it has developed. One of the world's poorest nations, Mozambique ended a decade-long wait to sell gas extracted from the large offshore field as President Filipe Nyusi announced the first shipment in a statement this week. The developments come at a poignant time - world leaders have gathered for a G20 summit in Indonesia and the COP27 climate summit now underway in Egypt - as the planet clearly feels the impact of severe weather and lower food production due to global warming. Just when industrialized nations should be accelerating funding for the transition to renewable energy, vast funds are being invested in carbon-based infrastructure. While sharply lower energy use in Europe should in theory reduce greenhouse gas emissions, environmentalists worry that once new facilities for LNG are in place, governments and energy companies will say those need to remain in use to justify the effort and expense. With its famed island of Bali hosting the G20, Indonesia basked in the spotlight and some attention to its energy mix as EU and other leaders announced that the so-called Just Energy Transition Partnership would mobilize an initial $20 billion in public and private financing over a three-to-five-year period to reduce greenhouse gases. Yet the country is still planning to build new coal-fired power plants and a new LNG gas terminal in Bali itself. Europe, the biggest driver of the present demand for more fossil fuels, will need to do more than lavish money on new facilities and hoarding energy supplies purchased at high rates. European peoples have shown their grit and determination by conserving energy and now governments need to show theirs by redoubling efforts in sustainable solutions. European industry also faces an enormous challenge to remain competitive with energy-rich America and labor-abundant Asia. The new "cold war" could indeed be the quiet, steadfast determination to maintain Europe's quality of life and industrial leadership along with its humane, enlightened policies. - Jon Van Housen and Mariella Radaelli are international veteran journalists based in Italy \</doc>

The World Green Economy Summit in Dubai hosted the Regional Conference of Youth (RCOY) MENA 2022. More than 150 young people from across the region took part in the conference, in addition to 30 speakers who are experts, specialists and VIPs. HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD&CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Chairman of the Green Economy Organization (WGEO), delivered the opening speech of the conference. Original Press Release: Sept. 29 -- Dubai Electricity & Water Authority issued the following news release: The World Green Economy Summit in Dubai hosted the Regional Conference of Youth (RCOY) MENA 2022. More than 150 young people from across the region took part in the conference, in addition to 30 speakers who are experts, specialists and VIPs. The two-day conference discussed a range of topics related to the skill development of young people in global climate policies, empowering them, and making their voices heard in climate action policies. HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD&CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Chairman of the Green Economy Organization (WGEO), delivered the opening speech of the conference. RCOY was co-hosted by WGEO and Act Sustainable, in collaboration with the Arab Youth Center, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Youth Non-Governmental Organizations (YOUNGO). In his keynote speech, Al Tayer said that the Regional Conference for Youth MENA 2022 organised in the UAE constitutes a milestone in engaging and encouraging youth in the global climate action agenda and working toward a greener and more sustainable economy. It provides an opportunity for the younger generation to contribute to national and regional climate policymaking and climate negotiations. This is significant, as the younger generations will have to live with the consequences of climate change. So, youth must be engaged in policymaking and preparation as future leaders, championing a sustainable green economy across the globe. "We at WGEO, are dedicated to facilitating the transition to a green economy on a global scale, but this will require cooperation and partnerships from all of us, particularly our younger generation. In this endeavour, we have brought together young people and future leaders from 22 different nations of the MENA region this year, under one roof, to build new coalitions, networks and deepen their sustainability knowledge. This conference provides a platform for capacity building and policy training, to prepare young people for their participation in the UN Climate Change Conference of Youth (COY) and Conference Of Parties (COP). The Regional Conference is designed to develop a network among MENA youth to prepare and train the Arab and North African youth to host and lead the COP27 /COY17, which will be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in 2022. RCOY is a global platform to enhance their engagement of stakeholders in the multilateral process," said Al Tayer. "For us in the UAE, leading the way in adopting green economy concepts and methods within the context of sustainable development and climate change resilience is crucial. We, as a nation, have set out on a path to being a global hub and an example of how a green economy can achieve economic viability while protecting the environment for future generations. This vision of the UAE leadership to achieve a sustainable green economy can be seen in our national policies. I would like to extend a warm invitation to world youth leaders to join us on this journey as we work to improve the future for us and the next generations. We must support effective green economic solutions that meet our economic and environmental needs as well as the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals," Al Tayer added. "The World Green Economy Organization is here to contribute to steering this transition and facilitate the collaboration between policymakers, young people and other stakeholders. We trust that the MENA region has strong potential to provide effective solutions that will help many countries mitigate and adapt to climate change and achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. But for this, the young generation from the region will have to play a significant role in policy making to foster a green sustainable economy. The UAE is dedicated to bringing about a green economy. And it will continue to support international gatherings like this in its capacity, bringing young people together to create a platform to foster a green economy and sustainable development. I hope today, in this gathering, we will take another leap forward and accelerate towards a sustainable global green economy," concluded Al Tayer. Regional COYs and Local COYs are organised prior to the Global COY (GCOY), which is the largest and most important youth conference related to the multilateral UN climate processes. The conferences are aimed at localising the climate conversation and gathering inputs from the ground, which are then incorporated into national and regional climate policies, thereby paving the way for climate negotiations.

By Ghalia Taman In the fashion world, many Arab designers are hitching a ride on the Slow Movement train, one that seeks to increase the world's appreciation of the value of our planet and its resources by slowing things down. Ever since the pandemic, a time when life took a literal pause as people cooped up in their homes and became hyper-aware of global news, from that came a heightened need for change, one that is laced with a push for sustainability and eco-branding. Today, fashion brands all over the region are taking part in this new narrative. With COP27 just around the corner, an event all about climate change and sustainability, we thought to spark a new conversation by taking a look at a select few brands that have embraced green fashion with ingenuity, creativity, and wit. Kicking off in 2018, the Arab luxury fashion brand Abadia was the brainchild of Saudi designer Shahd AlShehail, a woman with a passion for weaving the Kingdom's rich local heritage within the global modern fashion scene. The Arab identity is such an intrinsic element of AlShehail's work especially as the designer fully relies on local production from Arab artisans operating from her tailor house in Lebanon. Other than celebrating her culture and Arab identity, the designer is also an advocate for sustainable fashion. She makes it a priority that the creation and design process behind every piece of clothing is both ethical and eco-friendly. By relying on leftover fabric, recycled polyester as well as faux leather, the brand maintains its sustainable approach. They take it a step further by also repurposing any fabric leftover from the design process into toys as well as packaging. The creative mind behind Reemami, a modern UAE-based womenswear brand is Reema Al Banna, a Palestinian designer who turned her love for fashion into a full-ledged clothing brand back in 2010. The main aesthetic of Reemami is of fresh modernity that combines styles from the East and West. Clashes of color, patterns, and unique shapes bring out the essence of the designer's work as she always likes to experiment and play around with what is possible when it comes to fashion. The brand is not just quirky and fun, it also immerses itself in serious and important narratives, the biggest being that of sustainability. Reemami applies an eco-friendly approach to all its creations whether its zero waste policy which includes repurposing leftover fabric into headbands and other kinds of products or its minimal approach to production, creating new collections in small batches and only when they are ordered by customers. As the designer continues her path towards slower eco-friendly fashion, she hopes to see more factories applying the same minimal style of production she is currently promoting in her business. Read More: A Guide To Dressing Up As Your Favorite Iconic Arab Celebrity For This... Back in 2016, the two Kuwaiti designers, Yasmine and Muneera brought their powerful minds together and co-founded Maya Eco, a clothing brand all about functionality, practicality, and comfort. The designers wanted their collections to be the kind that can accompany every woman on her daily journey whether it be lounging on the couch or running a few errands. By 2020, the brand expanded beyond womenswear branching out to also include menswear and kidswear as part of their fashion clientele. Known to be slow and sustainable, Maya Eco follows ethical and eco-friendly practices when it comes to bringing its designs to life. From the very start, the brand always relied on its local factory headquartered in Egypt to churn out its latest collections. The factory would be home to local artisans who would apply slow fashion techniques including slow stitching to push for sustainable fashion. Also, by only releasing its collection during certain seasons, the brand is taking on the same minimal style of production as Reemami and other green fashion brands. Founded in 2017, the fashion brand named after its founder, Roni Helou, is all about unique androgynous collections that mix and play around with patterns. With many of their collections, it always feels like they are purposely stitching together various fabrics that you wouldn't usually combine in one outfit. At other times, the brand completely shatters fashion norms like how they have made an enormous puffer scarf out of parachute fabric. Roni Helou is also a proactive promoter of eco-friendly practices as well as a voice and platform that advocates for animal and human rights. All its material is sourced from vintage, leftover fabric coming from factories and old shops rather than relying on the purchase of newly imported fabrics. Everything is also locally sourced by Arab artisans and tailors in Lebanon who put their creativity and passion into each piece. An advocate and lover of Egypt's rich heritage, the brand known as Maison Farah Wali, considered the brainchild of a designer of the same name opened its doors in 2018. The brand relies on experimental and modern techniques to bring its collections to life and always had the goal of customizing its clothes for each of its customers as a way to celebrate the uniqueness of each individual. When it comes to sustainability, the brand pushes for slow fashion by ensuring that all its collections are made by hand using recycled fabric and sustainable ink. Each piece is made with a passion that can easily be seen through the unique, intricate design and quality of each collection. \</doc>

Exclusive research conducted to mark the launch of OnePoint5, ASDA'A BCW's new ESG advisory dedicated to the Mena region. Sunil John, President - Mena of BCW and Founder of ASDA'A BCW. Nearly two-thirds (60 per cent) of businesses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia do not have a framework governing their environment, social and governance (ESG) standards, and around half of those who do are not sure their employees fully understand it. These were the top findings of an exclusive study of 200 decision makers in the two countries commissioned by ASDA'A BCW, the region's leading integrated communications agency, to mark the launch OnePoint5, its new ESG advisory dedicated to the Middle East and North Africa (Mena). Its name is inspired by the world's most important sustainability goal - limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. OnePoint5 aims to strengthen the voice of the Mena region on ESG issues while helping clients to adopt more sustainable business practices. The new advisory arrives as Egypt prepares to host the UN Climate Change Conference, COP27 , in November, to be followed by COP28 in the UAE in 2023. Out of the 200 opinion elites interviewed, 41 per cent said their business already had an ESG framework in place, while a third (33 per cent) said they were developing one. A quarter (26 per cent) admitted their company had no ESG policy. Underscoring the need for raised awareness of the benefits of ESG standards, over half (52 per cent) of respondents who said their company had introduced an ESG framework said they did not fully understand it. Sunil John, President - Mena of BCW and Founder of ASDA'A BCW, said the research indicated that the Middle East's business community had work to do to meet the high expectations of their governments on sustainability best practice. "OnePoint5 can help client develop a strong ESG proposition to deliver greater value for their shareholders and stakeholders," said John. "The specialist advisory will be led by Stephen Worsley, Senior Vice President at ASDA'A BCW. A communications professional with more than 25 years' experience, he has advised clients in the sustainability and energy sectors, including Masdar, Total, Zayed Sustainability Prize, Engie and First Solar." OnePoint5 offers four key services: Advice & counsel to client decision makers to ensure sustainability thinking is central to their business planning and disclosure; auditing and gap analysis to understand a client's sustainability impacts; designing operational plans to help integrate best practices; and communications strategies and plans to help clients inform and motivate employees and internal stakeholders, as well as amplify external stakeholder awareness of their sustainability commitments. "The gap between awareness of the acute need to advance sustainable development and action on the ground by much of the business community needs closing," added John. "Consultancies like OnePoint5 can help clients address this so-called &lsquo;say-do' gap, by combining the skills of experienced communicators with the technical abilities of sustainability specialists." He said: "The UAE, Saudi Arabia and several other countries in Mena have pledged to go Net Zero and are enacting a wave of reforms aimed at raising the bar for transparency, good governance and sustainability - that is not to mention the massive infrastructure projects being undertaken, from The Line in Saudi Arabia to Expo 2020 in Dubai, the most sustainable Expo ever staged and the planned venue for COP28 next year. The message is clear: all of us need to raise our game." The survey further revealed that Middle East businesses need to pick up the pace on climate action, with about two-thirds (61 per cent) of decision makers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia saying that global warming was already having an impact on the way their business operates. While governance standards also show room for improvement, 40 per cent of businesses in the two countries claim to have robust policies to combat bribery, corruption and unethical behaviour. Forty-six per cent of respondents in the UAE and 43 per cent in Saudi Arabia said they had a whistle-blower policy in place to expose corruption. The survey was conducted by PSB Middle East, the wholly owned data and analytics subsidiary of ASDA'A BCW, from May 22 to 29, 2022. The interview sample, comprising decision makers directly involved in ESG affairs, was evenly split between Saudi Arabia and the UAE. &mdash; HYPERLINK mailto:business@khaleejtimes.com business@khaleejtimes.com \</doc>

By Ghalia Taman Sitting at a restaurant, enjoying a juicy kofta or a fresh fattoush salad, one would not think of the journey each ingredient took before arriving on one's plate. When it comes to the world of sustainability, it's a whole other ball game wherein that journey takes on newfound importance; giving rise to Farm to Table concepts. The main idea behind any farm-to-table initiative is that any food served in a restaurant or cafe would come directly from a local farm rather than a market or store selling imported ingredients. The movement wants to promote the idea that the food we eat should come from our own land and with good reason. Not only is it healthier and more inclusive of the region's local biodiversity but as local food will travel a shorter distance to get to the restaurant or even the customer's home, that means less fuel and emissions are released in the process. Across the region, the initiative has been garnering a lot of popularity as more farm-to-table restaurants and cafes have been popping up. With COP27 The story behind Egypt's organic local farm is named after its founder Sara-K. Hannig Nour is one that stems from a passion for tapping into and reviving the rich potential of the country's fertile land and soil. Hannig Nour wanted to do farming right so after the 2011 revolution, she took a small piece of land that belonged to her husband's family and began her journey of organic agriculture. With a team of farmers and engineers, over the years, Hannig Nour was able to plant and harvest everything from organic mangoes, grapes, and peaches to a wide variety of vegetables in her 972-acre farm, all pesticide and chemical free. The entire enterprise grew from there wherein they initially started off by selling their produce in small markets and today the Hannig Nour's passion project has become a full-fledged company. Its local ingredients are not only delivered to restaurants but also to some of Egypt's best hotels as well as customers' homes. Taking their farm-to-table approach a step further, they now have their very own well-loved product, their weekly box which gets delivered to each customer's home. Each box would be filled with hand-picked seasonal vegetables, fruits, and herbs and also include recipes and tips on how to use each fresh ingredient. To further spread and push for sustainable farming, every now and then, customers would be invited to the farm to take part in a wide range of activities like picnics and seasonal harvests. Read More: An Arab Spin On Mouthwatering Halloween Party Snacks Founded in 2021 by Humaid Saeed Khalifa Humaid Alremethi and Chef Jessica Queitsch, Farm2Table is the UAE-based food-to-table concept where each of its food items is sourced from the couple's family-owned organic farm. With Farm2Table all its produce isn't just locally sourced but also falls under the strict guidelines of what makes a food item organic including them being free from vaccinations, chemicals, and injectable hormones. The initiative came into formation during Dubai's Expo 2020 wherein some of its locally sourced produce was showcased at Alif Cafe which was part of the Mobility Pavilion at Expo 2020. As the cafe will serve organic food items sourced from local farms, the founders of Farm2Table decided to go for a menu that would alternate or be changed based on what's in season. Every dish is developed and made by Chef Jessica in an effort to entice a conversation about sustainability and to teach people about the journey each ingredient takes before arriving on their plate. Beyond Expo 2020, Farm2Table also conducts several educational workshops about everything related to sustainability, food security, and organic farming as well as offering consulting services that extend to helping customers with their own gardens and how to promote soil and plant health. Taking the concept of farm to table and giving it an entirely new fresh twist is Lebanon's From the Villages, a passion project stemming from several young Lebanese graduates including Sari Hawa that started in 2020. Along the outskirts of Lebanon are a few fertile villages including Deir Mimas that produce a lot of rich food products. The issue is that they do not have access to a market in order to sell their harvested goods. To turn this hurdle into an opportunity, the graduates tapped into their ingenuity and innovation and created an online platform that will be used to sell all the fresh produce that is sourced from these villages. Starting off, they created the website and added a few items to the platform. The project only grew from there as today it expanded to become a platform that offers customers access to twenty-five product categories including dairies, jams, and olives. Considered an environmentally friendly project, From The Villages is continuing to make locally produced food that is made by farmers and artisans in several villages scattered in the South of Lebanon. With a country like Lebanon that imports most of its food items, such an initiative is a great way to instead shift the focus towards alternative methods of food sourcing by promoting local agriculture and sustainability at large.

ABU DHABI, 28th October, 2022 (WAM) -- In the context of the EU Climate Diplomacy Weeks 2022 and ahead of COP27 , the European Union Delegation to the UAE, in collaboration with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), organised a high-level panel discussion titled "Solar power for a more democratic access to power". The event presented policy and business success stories from EU Member States and other IRENA Members, shedding light on the huge potential of solar energy in leading the way towards decarbonisation of energy systems and helping to achieve climate neutrality around the world. The event brought together around 40 IRENA Delegates, energy experts, diplomats, as well as business representatives from different regions on the margins of the 24th IRENA Council in Abu Dhabi, which offers an opportunity to build on their strong partnership and continued cooperation to support the development of renewable energy globally. In her opening remarks, Dr. Rabia Ferroukhi, Director of the Knowledge, Policy and Finance Centre at IRENA, said, "Solar PV will expand quickly in the coming decades. IRENA's 1.5 C scenario estimates that solar PV capacity will increase seven-fold by 2030 (to nearly 5 200 GW). However, a successful transition hinges on collaborative efforts with a global dimension, requiring deep, active and informed participation. How we produce energy is only one element of the transition, but we need to go beyond the power sector to truly harness and accelerate the energy transition. A holistic policy approach is required to address the interactions across the different systemic layers: power, energy, economy, social and Earth." Andrea Matteo Fontana, Ambassador of the European Union to the UAE, stated, "There is a huge potential for solar power in speeding up the energy transition. Solar is a democratic and accessible source of energy that can be rapidly deployed. The EU plans to double its solar energy production in the next five years. A very essential part of the EU's efforts is also to support our partners worldwide with their energy transition - especially in Africa." Ji &iacute; Slav&iacute;k, Ambassador of the Czech Republic to the UAE, added, "The importance of solar energy has also been highlighted in the EU Energy Performance Directive, which introduces an obligation to ensure that buildings are solar-ready. The Czech Presidency of the Council of the EU together with the EU Member States reached consensus on this Directive on Tuesday. The final text will now be negotiated with the European Parliament." Ignacio Asenjo, Solar Energy Policy Officer and the European Commission, commented, "The European Union has placed solar energy at the centre of its energy transition. Solar gives citizens the possibility to generate their own renewable electricity and reduce their electricity bills. They can do so individually and collectively, including through energy communities. The EU is eager to share its model of energy transition with countries around the world." Helaina Matza, Director of Energy Department, US State Department, noted, "The U.S. is committed to supporting the energy transition at home and abroad. The Inflation Reduction Act is a historic investment in our clean energy future, which has far-reaching implications to boost innovation and decrease cost of deployment globally."  ygimantas Vai i nas, Former Minister of Energy of Lithuania, Policy Director at European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), Member of the Board of BOD Group, highlighted, "ESMC emphasizes the critical importance of the photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing as the downstream and upstream markets of solar PV are closely interlinked. It is important to secure appropriate global raw materials partnerships to ensure functioning PV manufacturing value chains for the successful deployment of solar PV." Karel De Winter, Floating Solar Director, Adviser to the Chairman, Phelan Energy Group, affirmed, "Since we are under time pressure and the goals set are high, we need to think out of the box and look at quick wins. Coupling (Floating) Solar PV with existing Hydro Power Plant infrastructure is a no brainer as it basically turns the reservoir into a clean storage battery and increases the capacity factor of the dam. Plus the electrical grid connection infrastructure is already in place. Floating systems can be build faster than ground mount and does not use valuable land, while preventing evaporation countering droughts. Note it is a utility scale so you build in bigger steps and achieve capacity targets faster." Dries Acke, Policy Director, Solar Power Europe, stressed, "Solar power is the best technology to connect citizens to the energy transition while strengthening democratic values across society, both in rural and urban environments. This merits attention and support from policymakers, for example by means of tailored support schemes or loans from financial institutions. Distribution system operators should also embrace and enable local renewable projects." The European Union has adopted an EU solar energy strategy, which identifies remaining barriers and challenges in the solar energy sector and outlines initiatives to overcome them and accelerate the deployment of solar technologies. The EU solar energy strategy proposed under the REPowerEU plan aims to make solar energy a cornerstone of the EU energy system. EU measures to boost solar energy include making the installation of solar panels on the rooftops of new buildings obligatory within a specific time frame, streamlining permitting procedures for renewable energy projects, improving the skills base in the solar sector and boosting the EU's capacity to manufacture photovoltaic panels. Boosting renewable energy is also an important part of the European Green Deal in the context of the green transition towards climate neutrality. Solar energy is affordable, clean and has been the fastest-growing energy source in the last decade. It can be used for electricity and heating, while also helping reduce EU dependency on energy imports by replacing them with domestic production. \</doc>

DP World will invest $500m to cut CO2 emissions said its chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem. The DP World Chairman and Group CEO, says the company intends to cut CO2 emissions from its operations by nearly 700,000 tonnes over the next five years. The announcement was made as Bin Sulayem addressed delegates by video COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. DP World takes on Green Shipping Challenge He also reinforced DP World's commitment to sustainability by taking on the Green Shipping Challenge. Launched earlier this year by US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Change John Kerry and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St&oslash;re, the challenge encourages countries, ports, companies, and other actors in the shipping value chain to come forward with concrete announcements to further ocean-based climate actions. &ldquo;Global trade has been an enormous force for good, keeping our world connected and lifting millions out of poverty over the past few decades. But this growth is not without consequences &ndash; from the scale of energy required to make, move and use goods to the resource intensity of logistics and the challenges economic growth can bring,&rdquo;Bin Sulayem said. &ldquo;As a leading enabler of global trade, we have the tools, ingenuity and drive to lead a step change in logistics,&rdquo; Bin Sulayem said. The planned reduction in carbon emissions by nearly 700,000 tonnes represents a 20 percent cut from 2021 levels. DP World's plans include replacing its global fleet of assets from diesel to electric, investing in renewable power and exploring alternative fuels. &ldquo;Our World, Our Future' is our sustainability strategy, one that is designed to deliver responsible operations. We have already committed to becoming a carbon neutral enterprise by 2040 and net zero carbon enterprise by 2050. &ldquo;We will work with our global partners to develop an action plan to advance the goals of the GSC and encourage industry players to devise plans to address climate change,&rdquo; Bin Sulayem added. &ldquo;We're doing this through three main pillars of activity; the electrification of our ports and terminals equipment, investment into renewable energy and through research and development projects that will look into alternative fuels, vessels and vehicles across our portfolio. &ldquo;Our ports and terminals business is making steady progress, by following the strategy of maximising efficiency, equipment electrification, supply of renewable electricity, low carbon fuels and carbon compensation,&rdquo; he explained. In January, DP World entered a strategic partnership with the M&aelig;rsk Mc-Kinney M&oslash;ller Centre for Zero Carbon Shipping, an independent, not-for-profit organisation, undertaking intensive research and development to find practical ways to decarbonise the global maritime trade industry. &ldquo;Decarbonising the maritime industry requires the complete rewiring of the entire system, imagining new supply chains and structures. It is a huge undertaking, but one that we are ready to venture into. The global decarbonisation strategy aims to first reduce absolute emissions as much as possible, then focus on replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy resources, and finally purchase offsets for the hard to abate remaining emissions for the 2040 carbon-neutral target. Complementing technology driven solutions such as replacing vehicles and fuels, DP World is also working with local communities where it operates to establish carbon offset schemes, and carbon sinks such as mangrove forests. Last month Arabian Business reported that DP World delivered growth and efficiency in handling worldwide cargo when it announced a nine-month volume growth of 2.5 percent, almost 127 percent better than the industry average. The Dubai-based logistic giant announce that it handled 59.6 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) across its global portfolio of container terminals in the first nine months of 2022, with gross container volumes increasing by 2.0 percent year-on-year on a reported basis and up 2.5 percent on a like-for-like basis. Bin Sulayem said: &ldquo;We report another robust set of throughput figures with nine-month volume growth of 2.5 percent, which is once again ahead of industry growth of 1.1 percent.

By Thomas Pinn The United Arab Emirates is notorious for its hard workers and demanding jobs, making the time you get off work all the more important. So, with the Emirates just announcing the dates of all the public holidays you can look forward to in 2023, we thought we'd list the days you get off and give you some ideas of where you could go to get the most out of your well-earned holiday. From New Year's Day onwards, you've got 14 days of public holidays spread across the year to look forward to and hundreds of great destinations to explore just a short flight out of the Emirates. Although subject to change, depending on lunar observations, it seems like Eid Al-Fitr is giving you a very long weekend from Thursday to Sunday, which should be more than enough time to go somewhere interesting. Weather-wise, April may still be a bit cold and rainy in Europe, but Egypt's seaside town of Dahab may have just the weather you're looking for. Not too hot, not too cold, Dahab in April is the perfect place to swim, snorkel, and gauge on great food without the worry of getting blasted by the sun. The four-day break also gives you enough time to take a trip to the incredible Blue Hole and Ras Abu Gallum National Park or the colored canyons just outside Nuweiba. For the more adventurous, hiking up St. Catherine to watch the sun rise over the mountains of Sinai is an unforgettable experience not to be missed. With the airport at Sharm El-Sheikh a short distance away from Dahab, and direct flights from the UAE cheap and quick, Dahab may be the perfect place to go to for Eid Al-Fitr to get the most out of your long weekend. Like Eid Al-Fitr, the dates of Arafat Day and Eid Al-Adha are similarly subject to change depending on lunar observations, but it looks like you're getting almost a whole week off when including the weekend. Starting most likely on a Tuesday, this big public holiday ends on a Friday and is then followed by a weekend. A whole week off because of public holidays is rare, so you should take the opportunity and take a long break somewhere further afield. With the summer in the Emirates starting to get into full swing, it may be worth heading somewhere a little cooler to escape the heat, and with direct flights from Dubai, Barcelona may be a great option to consider for those itching to travel to Europe and make the most out of this week-long holiday. June is a great time to go to Barcelona and experience all the city has to offer. From incredible museums, art galleries, and even better food, there's plenty to do in this city. But with a week-long trip, why not travel around Catalonia and Spain a little bit more? Granada, which is home to the incredible Alhambra Palace built during the Emirate of Granada, is a perfect two-day trip to do from Barcelona. Likewise, the picturesque town of Seville is a great place to relax and soak up the country's intoxicating atmosphere. Falling awkwardly in the middle of the week on a Wednesday in the summer heat of July, it may be tempting just to relax and stay at home. But we at Scoop Empire ain't got no time to be sitting around and there's plenty to do with just a day off. But, if you really want to escape the heat in UAE style, there are many freezing ways of doing it. Read More: Heading to COP27 Unlike the Islamic New Year, however, the Prophet Muhammed's birthday is at the beginning of winter, so you can enjoy some outside activities in the Emirates and make the most out of the cooler weather. The Jubail Mangrove Park is a hidden gem just outside of Abu Dhabi that everyone talks about going to but rarely does. But it's certainly worth the short drive with an incredible and unique ecosystem to explore via elevated walkways and an array of fish and birdlife to look out for. For something different, Jubail Mangrove Park is the perfect UAE winter staycation to do with friends and family, or maybe that special somebody. Starting on a Thursday and ending on a Sunday, the celebrations should give you a nice long holiday to take advantage of. With winter in Europe in full swing, why not head to Kenya for a safari? With incredible weather all year round, Kenya is great in December and a four-day holiday is a perfect amount of time to fly in, head on safari, and head back to the Emirates in time for work on Monday morning. With numerous companies offering the whole package, from pick-ups from the airport, hotels, safari, and everything else you need for a short four-day trip, a safari trip may be a lot more hassle-free than you thought. For something different and memorable, a safari in Kenya may be the perfect long-weekend trip from the Emirates. WE SAID THIS: Don't Miss...

The WEF hosted the expert dialogue titled &ldquo;Transitioning to a green Middle East,&rdquo; on the collaborative action Middle East leaders must take to navigate between net-zero ambitions and socioeconomic realities. Minister of Economy of the UAE Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri; Minister of Economy and Planning of Saudi Arabia Faisal Alibrahim; chief executive officer (CEO) of Crescent Enterprises, Badr Jafar; CEO of Qatar Financial Centre Yousuf Mohamed Al Jaida; and associate professor of Molecular Biology at Sultan Qaboos University Lamya Al Haj, attending the session at WEF in Davos. &mdash; Supplied photo The UAE has invested over $40 billion in clean energy over the last 15 years, with plans to invest $160 billion in clean and renewable energy sources over the next 30 years on the road to net-zero, speakers at an experts&rsquo; dialogue session told participants at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The WEF hosted the expert dialogue titled &ldquo;Transitioning to a green Middle East,&rdquo; on the collaborative action Middle East leaders must take to navigate between net-zero ambitions and socioeconomic realities. COP27 and COP28, both set to be hosted in the region, by Egypt and the UAE, respectively. The session convened leaders in government and business to share their insights on the path to a more resilient and sustainable future. Participants included Minister of Economy of the UAE Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri; Minister of Economy and Planning of Saudi Arabia Faisal Alibrahim; chief executive officer (CEO) of Crescent Enterprises, Badr Jafar; CEO of Qatar Financial Centre Yousuf Mohamed Al Jaida; and associate professor of Molecular Biology at Sultan Qaboos University Lamya Al Haj. Session participants underscored a shared sentiment that mobilising climate action in the region will require a localised, multi-stakeholder approach. Optimistically, government, business, and civil society-led initiatives are on the rise in the region, with a notable growth in the capital, time, and talent invested in the infrastructure needed to progress. &ldquo;Energy security is a high priority. And it&rsquo;s something we need to really understand. The fragmentation that&rsquo;s happening globally, and energy supplies, will really affect the aspects of energy going forward. With that, the UAE has a long-term plan,&rdquo; remarked Minister Al Marri. &ldquo;The creation of the company Masdar, the implementation of solar panels, and global projects helping the world to diversify their energy supply, all show the UAE&rsquo;s investment in future energy security. The investment in diversifying energy aspects is important and vital for any future development of the region,&rdquo; said Al Marri. Badr Jafar of Crescent Enterprises cited the UAE&rsquo;s landmark Net Zero Pledge and related strategy of going net-zero by 2050 as a great example of the practical and conducive policy. &ldquo;This is all achievable with smart energy policy, as opposed to politicised rhetoric. The UAE&rsquo;s Net Zero Pledge and related strategy of going net-zero by 2050 is a great example of a practical and conducive policy that relies on a mix of renewables, natural gas, hydrogen, and nuclear in order to ensure affordable, accessible and acceptable energy is available to meet the growing demands of industry and our population,&rdquo; said Jafar. &ldquo;A green, resilient, inclusive approach to development can usher in a new model of growth for Mena, creating jobs while delivering the benefits of climate resilience, decarbonisation, cleaner air and water, healthier oceans, and sustainable food and agricultural systems,&rdquo; he added. Experts pointed out that the Middle East and North Africa is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions, with the destructive impact of climate change becoming increasingly evident in the shape of droughts, water scarcity, and elevated pollution levels. &ldquo;Despite this, the region is regarded as well-positioned to become a leader in renewable energy and in green and blue hydrogen. And while oil and gas will continue to play a significant role in the regional energy landscape, the region has witnessed the promising emergence of a new, more circular economy. Regional leaders are at a crucial crossroads as they foster more sustainable economies, while addressing the implications of the energy transition,&rdquo; experts said at the session. &mdash; HYPERLINK mailto:issacjohn@khaleejtimes.com issacjohn@khaleejtimes.com \</doc>

By Thomas Pinn On top of the headquarters of the Arab League in downtown Cairo, is the organisation's green flag that has overlooked the busy streets below for 58 years. However, while the Arab League's flag may be green, its nations' economies certainly aren't, with Arab nations making up four of the top ten producers of oil and five out of ten of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases per capita. The discovery of oil has historically been seen as a blessing to the region, bringing immense wealth to the originally poor and undeveloped Gulf region and providing important revenues to prop-up cash-strapped governments in more populous Arab nations. However, this blessing is now increasingly being seen as a curse, as we start to see the very real effects of climate change and the transition to a green economy by nations that have historically relied on oil revenues is proving itself to be a difficult jump. With Egypt set to host COP27 , the world's leading and most important forum to discuss and plan the global green transition, and with the United Arab Emirates also pencilled in to host COP28 the following year, the Arab world is attempting to take centre stage in these global efforts. Although late of the block, the Arab region has undertaken some encouraging steps in recent years, but the colossal challenges faced by the region in its own green transition and the increasing difficulties faced by the direct consequences of climate change itself may signal a rocky transition to a green economy to come. On March 3, 1938, the first oil well was dug in Saudi Arabia. Soon it was realised that Saudi Arabia was sitting on top of the largest oil reserve in the world and that many other Arab nations similarly sat upon immense reserves of this new wonder fuel. Beginning in the early 1950s and reaching a frantic pace in the 1970s, oil production in Saudi Arabia and the wider region expanded at breakneck speed. As the fuel both metaphorically and literally of the world's post-World War Two economic expansion, the region found itself with new-found wealth and influence. Countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Bahrain quickly went from mostly poor and undeveloped city states with few urban clusters under the thumb of British imperial influence, to having some of the most impressive rates of growth in the world and national currencies rated as the world's strongest. Countries like Saudi Arabia also found their fortunes change, as skyscrapers grew out of originally flat deserts. Additionally, as the head of OPEC, Saudi Arabia was able to build international political power and influence, most notably demonstrated with the 1973 oil embargo in protest of international support for Israel, which shook Western economies to their core. According to the World Bank, revenue from oil as a percent of GDP, known as oil rents, in 2022 amounted for 32.2% of Iraq's economy, 31.6% of Kuwait's economy, 21.1% of Libya's 19.4% of Oman's economy, and 17.7% of Saudi Arabia's economy. While the percentage of GDP from oil has actually reduced significantly in several Arab nations, reliance on oil has still remained a determining factor on their respective economies. Further, many economists allege that these great streams of income from oil production have resulted in a paradoxical resource curse that has prevented these countries from developing more diverse economies. While many argue that oil revenue can provide the huge amounts of funds needed for countries to embark on a green transition, reshaping an economy away from a reliance on both oil consumption and production comes with its own unique difficulties and complications. As the science became impossible to ignore, and the direct link between human emissions and climate change irrefutable, the Arab world, despite its historical reliance on oil has been in recent years responsive to the need for a green transition. Across the Arab world, solar, wind, and other renewable energy projects have sprung up over the last ten years, and as the technology has become both scalable and economic, we have started to see large-scale projects with the ability to make tangible step forwards in the region's green transition. Other initiatives have also sprung up to make our cities more sustainable by the introduction of greener transport networks, recycling programs, and innovative ways of growing crops. By 2030, Saudi Arabia plans to source 50% of its total energy from renewables, the UAE is set to procure 44% of energy through renewables, while Egypt is working towards having 42% of its energy sourced from renewables by 2035. However, while these efforts have been welcomed, climate change activists warned that the green energy transition is too slow across the board and even the International Energy Agency has urged governments to speed up their efforts and make more ambitious targets. Solar Power The Arab world doesn't conjure up images of a green transition like Costa Rica, with its 99% renewable energy, or European leaders in the green transition like Denmark. However, it was in Egypt that the world's first solar power plant was built, all the way back in 1913, and with large-scale green energy projects across the region being announced, the Arab world may be able to regain this mantle. If you put aside the great efforts of China and India, who's enormous populations and industrial capacity have enabled quite spectacular green energy projects, the Arab region is home to the world's three largest solar power plants in terms of capacity. The Benban Solar Park just outside of Egypt's Aswan is currently the world's fourth largest solar power plant and Africa's largest. The United Arab Emirates also has two enormous solar power plants, the Noor Abu Dhabi and the Mohamed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, that provide a significant proportion of the energy needs of the country. Pretty much every Arab nation in North Africa and Western Asia have several solar power plants, and many have large-scale solar projects underway or planned that aim to be the world's largest Wind Power Despite the region's abundance of sun, many countries in the Arab world have built large wind farms to produce green energy. Currently, the largest wind farm in the Arab world is Egypt's Zafarana Wind Farm on the coast of the Red Sea, which has a capacity of 545 megawatts. However, Saudi Arabia and Egypt both have plans to build the region's largest wind power plant, and the wind power industry has seen a boom in the region. Sustainable Cities Read More: The City of the Future: All You Need To Know About Saudi Arabia's NEOM Much of the headlines surrounding ambitious plans by Arab countries to build new cities, like Saudi Arabia's ambitious NEOM, revolve around plans to make these cities carbon neutral. Through the use of renewable energy, public transport, and efficient recycling programs, it is hoped that these cities can be a blueprint for a more sustainable future. Existing cities have also made efforts to be more sustainable, as large public transport projects and the introduction of infrastructure for electric vehicles. Some efforts have also been made to restructure cities to promote the use of walking and cycling and break the strong car culture that exists in many Arab Nations. The Battle Against Plastic and Trash With Abu Dhabi banning the use of single plastics along with Egypt's Red Sea Governorate, plastic has also been getting the attention it deserves. With Sharjah set to join the Abu Dhabi in 2024, and other places around the Arab world mulling over the idea, many have welcomed this move. While plastics have long posed a real problem to the region, many civil society led groups from Morocco to Oman and everywhere in between have been organising litter pick ups and advocating to stop people littering in the first place. Many countries have also seen recycling initiatives, both by states and civil society groups, to reuse plastic, glass, and metal and even turn garbage into beautiful objects by local craftspeople. Energy Needs of Hot Climates Unlike many areas of the world with cooler climates, the need for air conditioning in many Arab nations has seen countries in the region listed as some of the world's highest consumers of energy per capita. Hot climates have also played a part in promoting a car culture in the Arab world, as an otherwise small and enjoyable walk is made almost unbearable in the summer heat. Also, with many recent urban developments in the Middle East following the model laid out by American suburbia, the region also faces the issue of buildings that do not do well in the heat and need air conditioning, as opposed to traditional Arab settlements that rely on density, small streets, multi-family blocks to create a cool microclimate. Considering that in the short-term it would be impossible to do away with air conditioning and cars in the region and that small fixes that are possible in cooler countries are not possible, making modern Arab cities more sustainable presents a much harder challenge than say London or Paris. Growing Populations Unlike the slowly growing population of Europe, Arab nations have seen booming populations over the last decades, with little signs of slowing down. With increasing populations comes an increased need for energy, which presents a serious problem for countries trying to transition to a green energy. As much as many nations in the region are serious about challenging climate change and transitioning to a green economy, they are also serious about providing decent healthcare, education and other important functions of the state. With growing populations stretching a government's wallet even further, there is considerable less cash to throw around for green energy projects and increased need for cheap energy. The Economic Reliance on Oil While non-oil based economies see the green transition as a challenge in terms of the money it costs to transform an economy, oil-producing nations also face the consequence that this transition will get rid if the country's biggest source of revenue. For example, the heavily oil-dependant economy of Iraq would see over 30% of its economy disappear if it successfully made the transition. Necessarily for any oil-dependant to make the necessary change, the need to diversify the economy and provide an economic safety net is immense. The Cost of Transition While the countries of the Gulf may have little worry about the green transition in terms of financing, having benefitted from vast oil revenues for decades. Other Arab nations like Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and especially much poorer nations like Yemen face an almost impossible challenge due to insufficient funds to fund the immense changes needed. The green transition presents not just an expensive project, but also missed years of development funded by cheap polluting fuels, which the Global North has benefitted from since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Egyptian officials have indicated that they want to use COP27 , which they are hosting at Sharm el-Sheikh, to address this issue. It has been proposed that richer nations that had the chance to develop with the aid of polluting fuels in the past, should financially support nations in the Global South in their green transitions in the name of fairness. With the discovery of oil having given the Arab world great riches and with Arab nations' economies being so intertwined with oil production, it was worried that the region would be a stubborn roadblock in the globe's transition to a green transition. However, while concerns still remain about oil-producing nations' commitment to make the drastic changes needed, the efforts across the Arab world to engage with the global transition to a green economy have even surprised critics. The world and the Arab world in particular, are at the beginning of a long and difficult transition, and while many have congratulated the significant steps, critics warn that there is still a long way to go.

Four-day Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition Conference held under the patronage of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan Maximum energy with minimum emissions can ensure global energy security, an Emirati minister said during the 38th edition of the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition Conference (ADIPEC) 2022. Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology noted that the conference comes at a &ldquo;pivotal&rdquo; moment. &ldquo;The solutions we agree on and the commitments we will make help shape the future of our world because today, more than ever, energy is everybody's top priority,&rdquo; he said during the opening ceremony. &ldquo;Global supply chains continue to be fragile, geopolitics are now more complex, fragmented and polarised than ever, inflation is rising, and interest rates are pushing up the cost of borrowing and investing,&rdquo; said the Managing Director and Group CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). The four-day conference is held under the patronage of the UAE President, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Facing an unpredictable future and looming threats of a global recession, Dr Al Jaber consulted the UAE President to decide whether to dwell on the challenges or focus on the opportunities in his opening remarks. &ldquo;A few days ago, as I was briefing and updating our President, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, I asked for his advice. His response was reassuring. He told me: 'We cannot ignore the realities on the ground. We need to face them. We don't shy away from challenges. We address them by adopting a positive mindset and by working out solutions with like-minded partners.' And then he added: 'And remember, pursuing progress is in our DNA.'&rdquo; Dr Al Jaber noted his message was one of &ldquo;realism and also optimism&rdquo; and noted that now is not the time to point out that long-term under-investment in oil and gas has made a difficult situation even worse as &ldquo;the data is clear&rdquo;. &ldquo;If we zero out hydrocarbon investment due to natural decline, we would lose five million barrels per day of oil each year from current supplies. This would make the shocks we have experienced this year feel like a minor tremor. If this year has taught us anything, it taught us that energy security is the foundation of all progress - economic, social and climate progress.&rdquo; Dr Al Jaber noted that the solutions the world needs are also &ldquo;major opportunities&rdquo; for everyone. &ldquo;Our world is on its way to being home to 9.7 billion people by 2050; to meet their needs, the world will have to produce 30 per cent more energy than today. And as we meet that need, we will be helping to bring electricity to almost 800 million people who don't have it today. We will also be helping to transform the lives of the 2.6 billion people who have no access to clean cooking and heating fuels.&rdquo; The minister said that the world needs all the solutions it can get. &ldquo;It is not oil and gas, or solar, not wind or nuclear, or hydrogen. It is oil and gas and solar, and wind and nuclear, and hydrogen. It is all of the above, plus the clean energies yet to be discovered, commercialised and deployed. The world needs maximum energy, minimum emissions. This is why our leadership decided to be a first mover in renewable energy, over 16 years ago by launching Masdar. It's why we were the first country in the region to deploy nuclear power. And it is why ADNOC is making today's energy cleaner while investing in the clean energies of tomorrow.&rdquo; Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Presidential Court, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Member of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council, Chairman of Abu Dhabi Executive Office and Chairman of the Executive Committee of ADNOC's board of directors, ministers, senior government officials and chief executives from the global energy industry were present during the opening ceremony. &ldquo;At ADNOC, we have connected our operations to zero carbon nuclear and solar power. We are electrifying our offshore operations to cut their carbon footprint in half. And we are pressing down harder and harder on our methane intensity, even though we already have one of the lowest levels in the world. Maximum energy, minimum emissions.&rdquo; Dr Al Jaber underlined that moving forward, technology will be one of the greatest enablers of the oil and gas industry and this is an area where the industry can amplify and accelerate its impact. &ldquo;Take carbon capture and storage. It is one technology we can take to scale, not just in our industry but across all industries. And then there is hydrogen. Just a few days ago, I saw the first shipment of ammonia arrive from the UAE to Hamburg Germany. It felt like a historic moment. It was a first step in creating a hydrogen value chain and an important step in taking yet another opportunity for our industry.&rdquo; Dr Al Jaber said global efforts should focus on a new, bold, realistic and pragmatic pathway that benefits humanity, the climate and the economy, with the 27th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) meeting in Sharm El Sheikh next week and as the UAE prepares to host the 28th UN Climate Change Conference (COP28). &ldquo;We need to hold back emissions, not progress. The world is looking for solutions and I believe the energy industry can unite a divided world in finding them. I believe that the future is forged by those who make the first move. So today, I extend an open invitation to all our partners and friends around the world. Let's make that move together and forge that future.&rdquo; \</doc>

She emphasised that the youth of today want content that is relevant to the obstacles they face, such as mental health, unemployment and the climate crisis File photo The media should be able to intellectually challenge and thoughtfully provoke people, especially the youth, with their content, said a top minister during the opening day of the Global Media Congress in Abu Dhabi. More focus should be given to issues like climate change, she added, and not on generating traffic from clickbait headlines. "I'm a mother of two children. And I can't help but think of how their future will be directly influenced by all of you - by your company's choices and policies, by the algorithms you empower, by the NFTs you sell, by the decisions you make and will make in the future, by the world that you will create - more than they will be influenced by their education, more than they will be influenced by their peers, or any of my savvy parenting techniques," Shamma bint Suhail Faris Al Mazrui, UAE Minister of State for Youth Affairs, said in an impassioned address before hundreds of heads, experts and journalists from media houses across the world. "I want to be able to trust that you will all make decisions in their best interests, as well as the best interests of the 3 billion young people under the age of 30 living today," she said during her keynote speech at Adnec. Al Mazrui hoped for a standard of media that is sustainable, truthful, trustworthy, tolerant and thoughtful. "We want to make sure that when our kids are left alone with a screen, or a virtual reality set, they will be fed thoughtful ideas, good manners and values, and be able to develop an authentic identity of their own. I want to make sure that they're not going to grow up used to violence through shooting games, or scrolling aimlessly down a feed of celebrity gossip, or waste their life feeling disconnected from their own community values, and disconnected from the most pressing issues of this world and their generation." Yes, content is king, but... The minister noted that editors and journalists have stereotyped the youth as an audience seeking to be entertained and offered content, which doesn't "have public interest at heart." Providing insight into a survey conducted as part of a study, Al Mazrui said that the expectations the youth have from the media are quite different to what has been perceived by editors. "Surprisingly, perhaps, even though young people [are] extremely aware of all the technological offerings of AI, Metaverse, and NFTs, ticktockification, their answers didn't include much about these, or any kind of enhanced immersive experience. Young people's answers were loud and clear. Content is king. Yes, they wanted it to be enjoyable but they wanted to be entertained differently. "They want to be intellectually challenged. They want to be thoughtfully provoked. They want to be able to learn new skills and gain new insights from the media. They want to be able to answer life's most pressing questions. They want to be able to find meaning through finding solutions to their society and their generation's problems. And they want a media from which they can borrow real life experiences and risk-free rehearsals of life without going through it. They don't want an algorithm that confirms what they already believe. They certainly, from the study, don't want a news feed that is full of images of the Fashion Police, while the world is going through famine, floods, and wars. They want trustworthy information." Al Mazrui underlined that the youth want a type of media that is relevant in content and style for their generation's aspirations, obstacles and complexities, such as mental health, unemployment and climate crisis. More focus needed on climate change Returning after her participation at COP27 in Egypt, Al Mazrui said young people there were upset with the media's lack of interest in climate change stories. "How can we talk about [the] future of the media if the future of the planet is on the line? And we are not bold enough to feature it as the most critical story every single day? I know the gossip news on fashion fields or celebrity divorce, or even flashy, ambiguous clickbait, which somehow skip the facts and the fact checking process, can bring more clicks, more likes, more shares, and more profits for you all in the short term. But what kind of [a] future can we imagine if our young people end up aimless, depressed, disconnected with mental health issues and jobless? What kind of economy can thrive? What kind of social cohesion can we rely on? What kind of legacy are we leaving behind for those who count on our oral intelligence?", the minister asked. Al Mazrui then left her audience with some inspiring words. "I find it terrifying that an otherwise healthy, educated young person can change the trajectory of their future just by watching the wrong YouTube media, [or] following the wrong Twitter handle. But we're not giving up this fight. I'm sorry. You all are more powerful than you think. Media is in everything we do; it's the lens [through which] we perceive our world and what is true, and what is worth it. And what is questionable is all through you. Media is in our habits. Our news bulletin, it's with our cup of coffee. It's our food for thought. It's our self-talk. It's our collective consciousness, and our very intimate personal narrative that we seek through your screens through your filters." The minister added that the media can get together to focus more on climate as the UAE is set to host COP28 next year. She urged participants to let their imaginations run wild during the conference. "If you come up with a ground-breaking and novel idea, you will see it materialising in the UAE sooner than you realise." \</doc>

ABU DHABI, 17th November, 2022 (WAM) - The first-ever R.A.C.E (Regulation, Awareness, Collaboration, Ecosystem) sustainable finance summit was launched along with its theme partners Authority of Social contribution (Ma£n) today during the Abu Dhabi Finance Week hosted by Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), a leading international financial centre based in UAE's capital emirate. The conference focussed on addressing a wide range of topics including financing the net zero transition, climate regulation/frameworks and sustainable capital markets through keynote deliveries by prominent figures and panel discussions. The event also examined some of the key outcomes from COP27 that took place in Egypt earlier this month and outlined expectations for COP28 which is due to be hosted in UAE next year. With global corporations, governments, and nations increasingly responding to the need of the hour, environmental, social and governance policies are high on the agenda. In line with growing international and national initiatives, ADGM has placed ESG at the forefront of its strategy with sustainable finance playing a key role in achieving the objectives that aim at preserving the UAE's economy and environment for future generations. Against this context, ADFW is a carbon-neutral event and platform. ADGM is collaborating with AirCarbon Exchange (ACX) to obtain its carbon neutrality status through an offsetting programme. This is done by purchasing carbon credits from a project that works to reduce or absorb carbon emissions. The R.A.C.E summit witnessed exemplary initiatives at the level of Carbon exchange with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Al Jubail Island and ADGM. Committed to offsetting its carbon emissions, ADGM has pledged to plant 15,000 mangrove trees, thereby contributing towards Al Jubail Island's objective of planting 1 million new mangroves on the island. This initiative is in line with the UAE's national agenda to plant 100 million mangrove trees by 2030 and is part of Jubail Island's plan to plant one million mangrove trees within the next 10 years, whereby Jubail has concluded a number of partnerships with companies and government entities in the capital. Commenting on the partnership, Mahmoud Dandashly, Chief Business Officer at Jubail Island, said: "We are proud to welcome ADGM in our journey towards providing a sustainable future for all. This collaboration will support Jubail Island's mission in creating sustainable communities in the heart of Abu Dhabi through a series of educational and social initiatives. The support we have received from our various partners since announcing our commitment to increasing the capital's green urban space has shown that all of our different sectors and business activities, have one shared goal; that is creating a positive impact in our community. With the support of our partners, and under the direction of our leadership, we are committed to solidifying Abu Dhabi's position as an eco-friendly destination." Reinforcing its ongoing commitment and dedication to sustainability and sustainable finance, ADGM has launched several initiatives over the years, among which is the Abu Dhabi Sustainable Finance Declaration. With new signatories joining hands year-on-year, driven by a vision and motive to jointly bolster UAE's sustainable footprint and economy, the Declaration currently stands at 80 prominent signatories like the Central Bank of UAE, Ministry Of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE), Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED), and Mubadala among others. Younis Haji Al Khoori, Undersecretary of Ministry of Finance, said "The Ministry of Finance is keen to take an active role in enabling the UAE's various national strategies aimed at building an effective sustainable finance model and boosting long-term financial sustainability. Accordingly, the Ministry of Finance is a leading member of the UAE Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG), which has been established to support the development of sustainable finance in the UAE and facilitate regulatory cooperation amongst the UAE regulators. The Ministry of Finance is also working with the G20 counterparts to advance the work on the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap." He also stated that the UAE plays a major role worldwide in combating climate change, and the country will invest approximately AED 600bn into clean and renewable energy by 2050, to ensure balance between economic needs and environmental goals. He also mentioned that the UAE is actively promoting investments into CO2 emission reductions and supporting efforts towards achieving a net-zero economy, while leveraging the positive effects of the relatively higher prices globally to strengthen future readiness and reap the economic benefits of the green transition. Moreover, The Sustainable Fintech Alliance, a core working group of the MENA Fintech Association (MFTA), launched the 'Sustainability Fintech Report' today during ADFW. The report highlights how imperative it is that Fintechs are encouraged to institutionalize sustainable principles as early as possible in their journey, providing practical examples on how to do that, thus inspiring others to do the same. It also focuses on the positive impact of ESG on brand value and P&L and includes members' contributions to the Sustainable Fintech Leadership Programme. Given the importance of ESG across the globe, ADGM Academy, the knowledge arm of ADGM, is committed to contributing to the economic development of the UAE by providing qualifications that improve the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as of the local community and society at large. ADGMA, through their partner LIBF, is offering the ESG programme to different levels of professional groups to foster the economic development of the UAE. Emmanuel Givanakis, CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at ADGM ,said, "At ADGM, we see our role as not only a centre of finance, but as a key participant in the transition to net zero by 2050, by creating both the environment and regulatory platform in sustainable finance that will support public and private sectors as they endeavour to close the green financing gap. It will importantly facilitate issuers and investment vehicles to raise capital to finance projects and activities that will expedite the transition to net zero, and provide investors the ability to allocate capital to those products and services which a robust regulatory framework provides, including trust in the green credentials of those projects." \</doc>

Several crises push number of hungry people around the globe to 345 million The world is at risk of yet another year of record hunger as the global food crisis continues to drive yet more people into worsening levels of acute food insecurity, warns the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in call for urgent action to address the root causes of today's crisis ahead of World Food Day, on October 16. The global food crisis is a confluence of competing crises &ndash; caused by climate shocks, conflict, and economic pressures &ndash; that has pushed the number of hungry people around the world from 282 million to 345 million in just the first months of 2022. WFP scaled up food assistance targets to reach a record 153 million people in 2022, and by mid-year, had already delivered assistance to 111.2 million people. "We are facing an unprecedented global food crisis and all signs suggest we have not yet seen the worst. For the last three years hunger numbers have repeatedly hit new peaks. Let me be clear: things can and will get worse unless there is a large-scale and coordinated effort to address the root causes of this crisis. We cannot have another year of record hunger," said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, said: "The crises and challenges facing our world today put the health and lives of millions of people at stake without distinguishing between developed and developing countries. What we are witnessing is an accelerating aggravation of the consequences of climate change, conflict and unrest in many regions, which has directly affected the availability of food and the resilience and continuity of supply chains, threatening everyone with the impact of food insecurity." She added: "This situation calls for all of us to join forces and fast-track our efforts to enhance food security and availability through initiatives and programs that take into account the requirements of environmental and climate action at the same time." She noted that on a local level, the UAE has adopted the National Food Security Strategy that aims to strengthen the country's food security. Globally, in addition to helping many countries address hunger and food scarcity, it launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) in partnership with the US, which aims to raise investments worth US$8 billion in sustainable and climate-smart agrifood systems based on modern technologies. WFP and humanitarian partners are holding back famine in five countries &ndash; Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. Too often it is conflict that drives the most vulnerable into catastrophic hunger, with communications disrupted, humanitarian access restricted, and communities displaced. The conflict in Ukraine has also disrupted global trade pushing up transport costs and lead times while leaving farmers lacking access to the agricultural inputs they need. The knock-on effect on upcoming harvests will reverberate around the world. Climate shocks are increasing in frequency and intensity, leaving those affected no time to recover between disasters. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in particular is one of the worst-hit by the climate crisis as it is highly susceptible to climate shocks and stressors such as prolonged heatwaves, drought, wildfires, flooding, erratic rainfall, and landslides. The MENA region is also warming at twice the global average exacerbating pressure on resources in the food systems cycle affecting approximately 40 million people in the region. Mageed Yahia, WFP Representative to the GCC said: "We are working closely with our strategic partners in the GCC, who thanks to their support we managed to avert famine in Yemen and continues to provide lifesaving assistance. We count on their continued support especially during this year of unprecedented needs to alleviate the sufferings of millions of people who are bearing the brunt of the impact of conflicts and climate shocks in different parts of the world." Anticipatory action must be at the core of the humanitarian response to protect the most vulnerable from these shocks &ndash; and a core part of the agenda at the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) next month in Egypt. Meanwhile, governments' ability to respond is constrained by their own economic woes &ndash; currency depreciation, inflation, debt distress &ndash; as the threat of global recession also mounts. This will see an increasing number of people unable to afford food and needing humanitarian support to meet their basic needs. WFP's operational plan for 2022 is the agency's most ambitious ever. It prioritises action to prevent millions of people from dying of hunger while working to stabilise &ndash; and, where possible, build &ndash; resilient national food systems and supply chains. With the cost of delivering assistance rising and lead times increasing, WFP continues to diversify its supplier base, including boosting local and regional procurement: so far in 2022, 47 per cent of the food WFP has purchased is from countries where we operate &ndash; a value of US$ 1.2 billion. WFP has also expanded the use of cash-based transfers to deliver food assistance in the most efficient and cost-effective way in the face of these rising costs. Cash transfers now represent 35 percent of our emergency food assistance. WFP has secured $655 million in contributions and service provision agreements from international financial institutions to support national social protection systems. Similar efforts are underway to expand innovative climate financing partnerships. WFP continues to support governments with supply chain services, such as the procurement and transport of food commodities to replenish national grain reserves to support national safety net programmes. While these efforts provide succour to some of the severely vulnerable, it is against a challenging global backdrop in which the number of acutely hungry people continues to increase requiring a concerted global action for peace, economic stability and continued humanitarian support to ensure food security around the world. \</doc>

Esri is the global market leader in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and location intelligence. According to Richard Budden, Deputy General Manager for the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia at Esri, innovations in location intelligence help global leaders in the public and private sectors to understand climate change, realise the impact on society and the environement, and plan preventive actions. According to NASA, climate change is a "broad range of global phenomena" that includes warming temperatures, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. The list includes a wide range of executive's dossier of unwelcome events: increased incidence of drought, more-devastating storms, resource scarcity, and flooding in cities worldwide. Scientists say adverse effects will intensify in the decades ahead unless governments and businesses take sustained action. The vast majority of global leaders consider climate change a megatrend that will transform their businesses. Forward-thinking leaders, in both public and private sectors, are taking steps to ensure that their businesses will endure. But many global executives struggle to plan for climate change for lack of data or tools to grasp the problems they will face. Smart maps show executives the impact of climate change Increasingly, business leaders are considering the impacts of climate change to ensure they are prepared to respond in appropriate ways. Esri's GIS technology enables understanding and insight to be gained through smart maps, dashboards and geo-enabled applications, helping leaders with decision making. "Our life's work here at Esri is to balance human-made systems with the natural world. It's the reason we make GIS technology and support our customers and partners in applying GIS to solve the world's problems. We recognise the seriousness of the climate crisis, and we know full well that technology will be a crucial part of the solutions." Says Esri President Jack Dangermond. Fighting climate change with GIS and location intelligence Organisations across the globe are applying GIS and location intelligence in the fight against climate change. City of Prague: Climate resilience with GIS In 2015, the city of Prague published a four-year plan with the aim of enhancing long-term resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. With many paved spaces and built-up areas, the city had been experiencing an increasing number of heat wave events caused by currents of hot air moving from Africa into Europe. To meet the objectives of their plan, officials from the city's Institute of Planning and Development (IPR Prague) are leveraging GIS technology to enable them to understand where and how to react to climate challenges. Through one initiative they have integrated information from environmental sensors with health and demographic data, to help identify segments of the population that are at increased risk from high temperatures. IPR Prague are also using GIS to guide climate mitigation strategies through analysis of 3D models of the city's microclimates. This helps in understanding potential impacts before any large investment of time and money is made. With a vision to make Prague completely carbon neutral by 2050, the team plans to collaborate with other city agencies and also include their data in their models, to provide location intelligence into a range of applications. One idea is to model indoor spaces and study energy consumption and cooling of building interiors. For project details, watch this video: Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency: Protecting biodiversity The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) are responsible for managing and protecting biodiversity in nature reserves across Egypt. They are using GIS as the foundation of a digital environmental monitoring system that assists in understanding the effects of enviromment hazards and the potential impact of climate change on biodiversity. Smart geo-enabled mobile applications streamline the capture of data in the field, which is then visualised and analysed together with other spatial datasets and environmental indicators in an interactive dashboard. Data on frequency and density of vegetation, mammals and birds species is monitored. Remote sensing techniques are used to model potential climate risks and impacts on the environment. Geospatial programme for agriculture in Africa Extreme weather events linked to climate change are threatening food and water security across the globe. Africa, already struggling with low agricultural production and heavily degraded soils, is disproportionally affected by climate change. More than 40 African states have revised their national climate plans to make them more ambitious and add greater commitments to climate adaptation and mitigation. Flooding, sea level rises, increase in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns all directly affect the agricultural landscape. Through the newly launched Geospatial Program for Agriculture in Africa, Esri is enabling government agencies on the continent to implement a geospatial foundation for increased monitoring and understanding of the changing local conditions in relation to many factors compounded by climate change. GIS capabilities for extracting water balance and vegetation health indicators from imagery together with data from field survey apps and IoT devices allows for near-realtime monitoring of water, soil and crop conditions throughout the growing season. Having this data in the hands of decision makers at the right time is crucial for fast decision support and intervention. Machine learning models can leverage a combination of historic, current and forecasted data to enable governments to predict changes in crop suitability across the region as well as plan for the agricultural landscape of the future. Enabling forecasting and having access to predictive models are critical to ensure sustainable agriculture development and improve food security worldwide. A sustainable future "Esri is committed to building a sustainable future and providing GIS technology that governments and businesses can rely on to understand the impacts of climate change to take positive action" says Richard Budden. Esri will be participating in the United Nations COP27 Climate Change Conference in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt in November.

GENEVA, 15th October, 2022 (WAM) -- From devastating floods in Pakistan, to wildfires in Siberia, the effects of the climate emergency are being felt across the world, and the United Nations (UN) is calling for more investment now, to help nations to adapt to an increasingly unstable environment. All nations need to make major cuts to fossil fuel emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy, if we are to have any chance of achieving the aim of reducing global temperatures to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, said the UN report. This continues to be the message from the UN but, with so many countries suffering as a result of more frequent extreme weather events, that are threatening food security and global stability, more urgent measures need to be taken, to help countries to adapt to an increasingly hostile planet. The report went on to detail five tried and tested ways that can enable nations to become more resilient, in the face of climate change. 1- Early warning systems Research shows that a 24-hour warning of an oncoming heatwave or storm can reduce the subsequent damage by 30 percent. Early warning systems that provide climate forecasts are one of the most cost-effective adaptation measures, yielding around nine dollars of total benefits for every dollar invested. With timely warnings, people can take early action by blocking up doors with sandbags to anticipate floods, stockpiling resources or, in some extreme cases, evacuating from their homes. In Bangladesh, for example, even as climate change becomes more severe, the number of deaths from cyclones has fallen by 100-fold over the past 40 years, due mainly to improved early warnings. But today, one-third of the global population is still not adequately covered by early warning systems. And while efforts have focused mainly on storms, floods and droughts, other hazards like heatwaves and wildfires will need to be better integrated as they become more common and intense. Earlier this year, the UN Secretary-General tasked the World Meteorological Organisation to lead the development of an action plan to ensure every person in the world is covered by early warnings within the next five years. The plan will be presented at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) next month. 2- Ecosystem Restoration The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and partners in 2021 triggered a global movement to restore the world's ecosystems. This global restoration effort will not only absorb carbon but also increase 'ecosystem services' to defend the world from its most devastating impacts. In cities, restoring urban forests cools the air and reduces heatwaves. On a normal sunny day, a single tree provides a cooling effect equivalent to two domestic air conditioners running for 24 hours. On coasts, mangrove forests provide natural sea defences from storm surges by reducing the height and strength of the sea waves. Moreover, protecting mangroves is 1,000 times less expensive per kilometre than building seawalls. In high altitudes, re-greening mountain slopes protects communities from climate-induced landslides and avalanches. For example, on Anjouan Island in Comoros, deforestation was drying up the ground and turning forests into deserts. With support from UNEP, a project has set out to plant 1.4 million trees over four years to hold back erosion and retain water and nutrients in the soil. 3- Climate-resilient infrastructure Climate-resilient infrastructure refers to assets and systems such as roads, bridges, and power lines that can withstand shocks from extreme climate impacts. Infrastructure is responsible for 88 percent of the forecasted costs of adapting to climate change. A World Bank report finds that climate-resilient infrastructure investments in low and middle-income countries could produce roughly US$4.2 trillion in total benefits, around four dollars for each dollar invested. The reasoning is simple. More resilient infrastructure assets pay for themselves as their life-cycle is extended and their services are more reliable. Tools for encouraging investments in climate-resilient infrastructure include regulatory standards like building codes, spatial planning frameworks such as vulnerability maps, and a strong communication drive to ensure the private sector is aware of climate risks, projections and uncertainties. 4- Water supplies and security The story of climate change is, in many ways, a story about water, whether it is floods, droughts, rising sea levels, or even wildfires. By 2030, one-in-two people are expected to face severe water shortages. Investing in more efficient irrigation will be crucial, as agriculture accounts for 70 percent of all global freshwater withdrawals. In urban centres, roughly 100-120 billion cubic metres of water could be saved globally by 2030 by reducing leaks. Governments are being encouraged to develop holistic water management plans, known as Integrated Water Resource Management, that take into account the entire water cycle: from source to distribution, treatment, reuse and return to the environment. Research shows that investments in rainwater harvesting systems need to be sustained to make them more widely available. In Bagamoyo town, Tanzania, for instance, rising sea levels and drought from declining rainfall were causing wells to dry up and become salty. With no other options, children from the local Kingani School had to drink salt water, leading to headaches, ulcers, and low school attendance. With support from UNEP, the government began constructing a rainwater harvesting system involving rooftop guttering and a series of large tanks for storing water. Diseases soon began to fall, and the children returned to school. 5- Long-term planning Climate adaptation solutions are more effective if integrated into long-term strategies and policies. National Adaptation Plans are a crucial governance mechanism for countries to plan for the future and strategically prioritise adaptation needs. A key part of these plans is to examine climate scenarios decades into the future and combine these with vulnerability assessments for different sectors. These can assist in planning and guiding government decisions on investment, regulatory and fiscal framework changes and raising public awareness. Around 70 countries have developed a National Adaptation Plan, but this number is growing rapidly. UNEP is currently supporting 20 Member States in developing their plans, which can also be used to improve adaptation elements in Nationally Determined Contributions - a central part of the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

Events of global magnitude are usually very few and far between, which makes it incredibly unusual for the world to be grappling at the same time with both the fall-out of a pandemic of a scale not seen for a hundred years and war in Europe that impacts not just the people of Ukraine but the countries and people who rely on its grain or Russia's oil. These two events are redefining everything from the geopolitical landscape to the way people communicate and view society. According to the GWI News Study 2022, over 80% of people say that keeping up with breaking news is important to them. And no wonder - it's understandable that people are closely following the news as we live through a period of seismic change. Furthermore, we know that the engagement of CNN's global audience during such times is particularly high as our audience comprises not just citizens of the world but people of influence in business, governments, those with high net worth, and people who shape opinions. These people need credible news to inform their professional lives, with the same GWI News Study finding that CNN is the top-rated news brand amongst these audiences when it comes to their preference of where to go for breaking news. Such a scenario does, however, pose a serious question for brands and nations that want to communicate with the world: how can they advertise, tell their stories and reach consumers and customers in an authentic way that makes them part of a global conversation during a period of change and uncertainty? Having worked at CNN for over a decade, I am well versed in balancing some of these needs, helping clients understand our brand safety technologies, and counseling them on when - and when not - to run campaigns during a busy news agenda. In contrast to the past, many marketers have re-evaluated how they communicate during times like this. Their thinking is largely driven by a shift in consumer behavior as people want to see brands stand for something. Take sustainability, for instance - a recent study conducted for CNN by BVA/BDRC found that 83% of CNN's audience advocate for brands that implement sustainable practices that have a positive impact on society and the environment. Taking that a step further, the same study found that 85% of our audience are interested in making investment decisions that include sustainability credentials. A good example of an innovative and relevant campaign that taps into the conversation and audience interest around sustainability is the Egyptian Ministry of International Co-operation's Building Forward: Stories from Egypt campaign. Our team has worked closely with the MOIC led by H.E. Rania Al Mashat to develop a campaign that uses branded content fact files to tell the story of Egypt's collaboration with bilateral and multilateral development partners and international financial institutions in its push towards an inclusive, digital and green economy. Key themes of sustainable development and bilateral cooperation are so important to the rest of the world right now, and consequently are resonating strongly with our audience. We are delighted with the success of the campaign, particularly as Egypt is taking center stage in these discussions as the country prepares to host Cop27 . I was also pleased to see one of our region's logistics players GWC begin a multi-platform campaign with us earlier this year. The Life, Delivered campaign showcases GWC's role in providing intricate planning and robust infrastructure for logistics across various sectors - from the cold chain, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, and fine art, to mega-events such as the FIFA World Cup. Again, working with our creative studio, the branded content campaign focuses on people and places to illustrate the impact the GWC has in the world. At a time when our audience is seeing first-hand what happens when distribution and trade routes are disrupted, these campaigns about what makes a robust supply chain couldn't be more relevant. These campaigns from MOIC, DP World, and GWC are prime examples of how brands can be part of this global conversation, and - because their messages are so relevant to the wider news agenda - their stories actually resonate even more with our audiences during this time. We may be living in uncertain times when many accepted norms are being challenged, but brave, relevant, and creative advertising campaigns will always have the power to drive conversation and have an impact, particularly when they take place within a trusted and global news environment. \</doc>

A consortium led by ACWA Power has announced the signing of a project agreement to develop a 1.1GW wind project in Egypt, at an investment value of $1.5bn. The consortium, comprising of ACWA Power and Hassan Allam Holding, will work together during the development phase to complete the site studies and secure the financing of the facility. According to a statement, the wind project is the largest single contracted wind farm in the Middle East region, and is one of the largest onshore wind farms in the world. It is located the Gulf of Suez and Gabal el Zeit area. The project will be designed to use state-of-art wind turbines with blade heights of up to 220m, which helps in achieving the best use of the designated land plots in the most efficient way. When complete, the project will mitigate the impact of 2.4mn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year and provide electricity to 1,080,000 households, it continued. "This milestone wind project falls within the framework of the Egyptian government's strategy to diversify its energy sources and leverage the country's rich natural resources, especially in renewable energy. The Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy is taking concrete actions to ensure the resilience of our energy strategy, because of the escalating changes that the world is witnessing, which aim to increase the contribution of renewable energy to up to 42% by 2035," said Dr. Mohamed Shaker El-Markabi, Egypt's Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy. He added the 1.1GW wind project confirms Egypt's commitment in spearheading the use of renewable energy sources to reduce the impact of carbon emissions produced by conventional energy sources, as Egypt gears up to host the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP 27 ) in November 2022. The project is a leading example of the Egyptian government's efforts to increase the participation of the private sector in implementing green energy projects in Egypt as well as attracting investments from international, Arab and local companies into the country, the minister said. "We are honoured to contribute to the strengthening ties of Saudi Arabia, our home, and Egypt via this milestone wind project, and extend our sincerest gratitude to the leaders of both countries in entrusting their faith in our abilities to realise their renewable energy mandates," said Mohammad Abunayyan, ACWA Power Chairman. "With sustainable development at the top of the agenda for both states, progress cannot be made without concerted efforts in expanding infrastructure that is underpinned by renewables. This wind project demonstrates a commitment to realising a greener tomorrow, despite global economic volatility, and we look forward to working with like-minded partners for a positive future,"\~ he added. This is ACWA Power's third project and first wind farm in Egypt, after the 120MW Ben Ban solar independent power projects in the Aswan region and the 200MW Kom Ombo solar plant. Hassan Allam Utilities, the investment and development arm for Hassan Allam Holding, currently operates a 50MW solar plant in Benban solar park cementing its position as one of Egypt's leading green energy producers. The 1.1GW wind project is forecasted to reach financial close by the third quarter of 2024. The plant will be commercially operational by the end of 2026. "The project marks an important milestone in Egypt's plans to decarbonise the energy sector and meet its targets under the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). We are proud to be part of this flagship project and look forward to a fruitful partnership," said Dalia Wahba, Deputy CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Hassan Allam Utilities. "Egypt has embarked on a serious economic reform programme sending a clear invitation to the private sector to support in building a greener and brighter future. As a group, Hassan Allam Holding is committed to be a positive contributor to the environment. We are adopting sustainability principles and expanding our investments into large scale green energy projects," she concluded. In March 2022, Acwa Power broke ground on a 100MW wind facility in Uzbekistan, following which it inked a deal to develop a 700MW solar project in Saudi Arabia. In June, it inked a PPA with SPPC for $107mn solar PV plant. \</doc>

It is impossible to ignore the reality that sustainable development is gaining urgency around the world. Powered largely by the abundance of new and easily accessible data, advocates for the most pressing global issues of our time can now be found on all seven continents. However, whilst last November's UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow firmed up the global commitment to accelerate climate action during this decade, a topic for debate now is whether this action will be adequate in limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels. As we look ahead to the upcoming COP27 meeting in Egypt later this year, the answer to that question increasingly appears to be "no." As UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres said in his COP26 wrap-up message: "It is time to go into emergency mode  or our chance of reaching net-zero will itself be zero." As we come to grips with the severity of this message and many others from scientists and policy makers around the world, we have had ample time to reflect on the fundamental strategies in place for promoting sustainable development in our own lives. In a nutshell: We need to do more, without further delay, and consumers must be part of that solution. This means that local government and business leaders must work together to deliver an engaging consumer proposition, making them active players who are empowered to take the positive actions needed to facilitate meaningful change. The public want to hold governments and businesses accountable for achieving these changes; we must enable them to be part of that process with the right frameworks. Technology to engage the public in climate action A powerful yet rudimentary part of the solution is to continually engage the public, particularly young people, to help accelerate the Net Zero transition. Technology, leveraged and propagated by the major digital platforms in use, would be the key partner to major cities in activating this engagement. Imagine if every business (or even every building) had a five-star sustainability rating published prominently for consumers to see - similar to a standard review rating - when hailing a ride, booking a hotel room, ordering a home delivery service, or entering a destination on a map. It's already happening in a piecemeal fashion, but what if we could scale it up? Consumers can then "vote with their money" and choose the more sustainable alternatives, thereby enabling them to play a part in combating climate change by holding businesses accountable. The impact of such massive action cannot be underestimated. Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world, said in a mid-2021 interview that unsustainable companies would eventually find themselves starved of capital. In a similar manner, I would also argue that talent are already voting with their time and effort to work for more sustainable companies, and consumers are doing the same with their purchases. Consider the positive impact achieved by nutritional labelling on food packaging and health warnings on cigarette boxes as effective case studies for how swiftly behavioural changes can be accomplished with clearly targeted, appropriate strategies. If big tech and big cities cooperate to make the sustainability impact of our daily choices more transparent, the effect can be amplified across all publics. Empowering civil society's voice The idea of an engaging consumer proposition on sustainability begins with business leaders, government officials, and major digital platforms worldwide collaborating to provide channels and mechanisms that allow consumer-driven change to happen. The voice of civil society can help us achieve sustainability and climate goals through higher demand for sustainable products, climate transparency, and economic circularity. With almost a quarter (23 percent) of consumers saying they are buying more sustainable products today (vs 2019), we are at a tipping point for continued transformation as civil society is increasingly leading calls for more ambitious climate action. As business leaders, our responsibility is to promote this social transformation and facilitate the required platforms and channels to encourage better decision making by our consumers. Finding collaborative solutions We cannot deny that issues of sustainable development are notoriously complex - and I speak from direct experience. The pursuit of sustainability is multi-faceted and incorporates a combination of commitments as part of a comprehensive, integrated strategy. It requires a dedication to transparency on these issues and enthusiasm to engage with local communities in this pursuit. The fundamental belief must be that businesses of all sizes - especially the largest ones - can make similar commitments while continuing to prosper. We are certain that the future well-being of our planet depends on the choices we make today, and not a moment later. recognising our collective roles in our societies and broader economies, and our shared responsibility towards the planet and our generations' future, we invite businesses (especially technology platforms) and cities (through their local governments) to collaborate on engaging consumer propositions for sustainability and turn them actionable plans. Taking concrete action now would demonstrate that our region can take a leading role in securing the future survival and prosperity of the human race.

WCA's 2022 Annual Conference and Exhibition will take place in person, September 25 to September 28, 2022 in Dubai at Emirates Towers. PTI The World Cement Association (WCA) and A&sup3;&Co have developed a roadmap, specifically aimed at helping cement producers in the Mena region to decarbonise. Companies that follow the practical steps outlined in the roadmap can expect to achieve reductions of up to half their current emissions, Ian Riley, CEO, WCA told Khaleej Times in an exclusive interview. "Key steps focus on operational excellence, increasing the use of supplementary cementitious products, fuel switching to use more waste and biomass, and improving energy efficiency through a range of possible measures including waste heat recovery (WHR), cooler retrofits, process fan optimisation and so on," said Riley. Helping cement companies in the region to progress their decarbonisation journey represents a significant opportunity to make a meaningful difference to global carbon emissions, and is a major focus for the WCA, particularly ahead of COP 27 and COP 28. WCA's 2022 Annual Conference and Exhibition will take place in person, September 25 to September 28, 2022 in Dubai at Emirates Towers.The delegates will be able to see examples of one of the most prominent sustainable cities in the region. Riley shared three technologies that can have a significant impact on carbon emissions for cement companies, and can reduce costs at the same time. First, using waste heat to generate electrical energy (waste heat recovery or WHR) is a well-established technology and earns a return based on electrical power savings, so is an easy win for most companies. The one caveat is that for countries where electrical power is subsidised, such as Egypt, there is less of an economic case for investing in WHR, though from an environmental standpoint it is still worthwhile. Second, increase the use of supplementary cementitious products (SCM) in place of clinker, which is one of the main ingredients in conventional cement but has a very high, and hard to abate, carbon footprint due to its manufacturing process. The most commonly used SCMs are by-products of other industrial processes, like fly ash from burning coal and blast furnace slag, though these materials are in short supply in the Mena region. However, there are alternatives such as calcined clay and natural pozzolans which are in more plentiful supply. New technologies are making both of these materials more effective than before. Third, substituting coal with other fuels can substantially reduce emissions. Many alternative fuels such as municipal and agricultural waste can be burned in cement kilns and have substantially lower carbon emissions, so this is an area of real potential where local municipalities can help encourage adoption. "To have the greatest impact on cement industry decarbonisation, and to succeed in implementing some of the most important changes does require participation right the way along the supply chain to make the most of the available carbon savings," said Riley. The construction industry has a vital role to play. For example, on many building projects, fewer types of concrete are often used in order to simplify logistics. But this results in over-specifying, and using larger amounts of concrete with higher carbon footprint than is necessary. "If developers and construction firms issue tenders that prioritise low-carbon construction, we will naturally start to see more low-carbon concrete being used where possible, instead of defaulting to the conventional and higher-carbon alternative," adds Riley. The WCA &mdash; founded in 2016 &mdash; is the original international cement association representing and promoting the interests of the global cement industry worldwide. WCA connects members across the world and provides practical help to improve competitiveness and sustainability. The majority of its members are cement producers, ranging from some of the world&rsquo;s largest companies to smaller manufacturers, however, it also represents members from across the wider value chain, including technology, engineering and equipment suppliers. WCA supports a sustainable cement industry, encouraging technical development and innovation by its members to work towards the goal of decarbonisation, in line with the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement. "It is also essential that the construction industry accepts new products, such as those with lower clinker, and does not insist on using high clinker products. Governments have a key role to play here in ensuring appropriate standards exist, and are updated to reflect technological developments," said Riley, who joined the WCA in 2019, contributing to WCA&rsquo;s key mission of sustainability, innovation and internationalisation and facing the challenges of creating a sustainable cement industry. Riley has a wealth of international experience, having worked across the cement industry in Europe, America and Asia; most recently in China where he spent the last ten years as Country Head for LafargeHolcim. He actively works with the cement industry which considers ways of reducing GHG emissions so as to achieve the full decarbonisation by 2050 and accelerate the response to climate change.

JeffreyBeyer, managing director of Zest Associates, a UAE-based sustainability consultancy Money matters &ndash; and we need a lot of it to address climate change. The challenge is not whether we have the technologies to solve climate change &ndash; we mostly do. Energy efficiency solutions, renewables, electric vehicles and climate-smart agriculture are all well-understood and relatively easy to deploy. The question is how to mobilise the $4tn per year needed to reach net zero, or the $7tn required annually to achieve the United Nation&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which include both environmental and social objectives. In the Arab world, about $230bn per year is needed to achieve the SDGs. Most of this investment will come from the private sector. But governments in the Middle East have big levers they can pull to mobilise this finance and channel it towards sustainability projects. Financial markets are also innovating to unlock it. ALL EYES ON THE MIDDLE EAST The next two UN climate change con- ferences will be held in Egypt ( COP27 in November) and the UAE (COP28 in 2023), bringing the Middle East&rsquo;s climate credentials under intense global scrutiny. The annual summit&rsquo;s focus has shifted from simply setting carbon reduction targets to actually implementing them. Governments must show how their pledges are translating into actions that unlock green investments. The recent study I co-authored, Financing a Green Transition in the Middle East, published by the Mohammed bin Rashid School of Government and funded by HSBC, looks at 14 tools to accelerate green finance in Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These include enablers that shape the investment environment, like green taxonomies, financing strategies, and disclosures around climate and nature risks. They also include specific instruments that de-risk investments and  crowd in private sector finance, like guarantees, loans and green bonds, or sukuk. Three opportunities stand out: harnessing high public spending, leveraging huge sovereign wealth funds, and capitalising on the strength and ubiquity of state-owned enterprises. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MIDDLE EAST The first capitalises on the countries&rsquo; high govern- ment spending as a percentage of GDP, averaging 20 per cent versus a global average of 17 per cent, and reaching a high of 28 per cent in Saudi Arabia. Green procurement creates demand at scale for sustainable products and services, which boosts their availabil- ity and lowers their price, making them more accessible to businesses. Govern- ments can also multiply their influence by requiring private sector partners to apply sustainability criteria to their supply chains. The second is size and scope of sovereign wealth funds. Of the eight countries studied, seven have sovereign wealth funds worth a total of over $3tn, and Iraq has plans to create one. Sovereign wealth funds like the UAE&rsquo;s ADIA, Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund, the Kuwait Investment Authority and Qatar Investment Authority have a mandate to deliver both financial and social returns on investment. Governments across the region can set investment criteria to ensure this huge capital endowment is used to finance a green transition whilst deprioritising investments that exacerbate climate change. The third is the prominence of state-owned enterprises. They represent both a big chunk of the countries&rsquo; economies and an outsized proportion of their national greenhouse gas emissions. Governments that own oil and gas companies, heavy industries and airlines can instruct these companies to invest in energy efficiency, low carbon fuels and innovation. HELPING POLLUTERS ALONG THE JOURNEY It&rsquo;s not easy or cheap, however, to transform a high- emissions business. Such companies cannot simply be left out of the conversation or told to shut down to achieve national climate change targets. They need to be part of the solution. And they need investment to finance their transition to a low carbon future. Jeffrey Beyer  Sustainability-linked loans and bonds are relatively new instruments that help companies raise money at a lower interest, providing they set and achieve meaningful sustainability targets. They differ from sustainability loans and bonds (without the  linked ) because the capital can be used for anything, so long as the company achieves its targets. Missing the targets results in a penalty. Sustainability-linked loans and bonds are becoming hugely popular, increasing in value by three and ten times respectively year-on-year, to nearly $800bn in 2021. They even surpassed the $522bn green bond market in 2021. But sustainability-linked instruments come with risks.  Meaningful targets may not be science- based. Having &lsquo;sustainability&rsquo; in the name could lead to greenwashing.  Linked instruments do not guarantee additionality, i.e., that sustainability improvements would not have happened otherwise. To be effective, four things should change. Sustainability should be disaggregated into its constituent parts, with a special focus on greenhouse gas emissions. Meaningful climate targets should align with the Paris Agreement and be scrutinised by credible entities such as the Science-Based Targets Initiative. Penalties for missing the target should be high and therefore motivating. To avoid greenwashing, governments should develop harmonised guidance to govern this new asset class, just as the Green Taxonomy guides investments in the EU. SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY Climate change is both an existential threat and the  greatest commercial opportunity of our time , said former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. Blackrock&rsquo;s CEO Larry Fink agrees, while warning that countries and companies that do not invest in the opportunity  risk being left behind [and] risk losing jobs, even as other places gain them . At a time when trillions of dollars are needed to tackle climate change, government action and innovative financial tools will prove vital. The Middle East can use its special position to seize the opportunity and invest in a sustainable transition, creating jobs and ensuring continued prosperity in the future low carbon global economy.  SUSTAINABILITY-LINKED LOANS AND BONDS ARE RELATIVELY NEW INSTRUMENTS THAT HELP COMPANIES RAISE MONEY AT A LOWER INTEREST, PROVIDING THEY SET AND ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS  \</doc>

By Binsal Abdulkader ABU DHABI, 23rd August, 2022 (WAM) -- About 140,000 annual two-way tourist traffic between Spain and the UAE, presence of the region's second largest Spanish community in the Emirates, a shared history and culture, and growing political ties have brought the two countries closer, a top Spanish diplomat told the Emirates News Agency (WAM) "Our human relationships are solid, because there is a mutual attraction anchored on perceptions about shared history and culture with the Arab world. The Spanish community in the UAE is one of our greatest assets more than 10,000 nationals make the second largest expatriate community in the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] and Asia regions, after the one in Morocco," said I?igo de Palacio Espa?a, the Spanish Ambassador to the UAE. "They enjoy a hospitable setting, and their children grow in a fascinating multicultural environment. They are delighted to live here," he said in an exclusive interview with WAM at the Spanish Embassy in Abu Dhabi. The envoy has found a natural attraction towards the shared history and culture that link the image of ancient Al-Andalus with the UAE. Al-Andalus, also called Muslim Spain, Muslim kingdom that occupied much of the Iberian Peninsula from 711 CE until the collapse of the Spanish Umayyad dynasty in the early 11th century. "I believe that, besides all the cultural manifestations that we might present together, we are still to conceive together of a big project that might highlight this shared past, which is to be seen across Spain. Emirati visitors are amazed to see these cultural manifestations, World Heritage sites of UNESCO, so well preserved and appreciated." Tourism helps boosts ties Tourism has enormous potential for the development of the bilateral relations; and post-COVID relaxation in travel restrictions has helped recover the tourist traffic, he pointed out "We are practically back to the figures of 120,000 UAE tourists in Spain every year. The Spanish visa exemption for Emiratis is clearly a great facilitator for UAE tourists," Espa?a explained. Around 20,000 visitors from Spain used to visit the UAE before the pandemic and they started coming back increasingly thanks to the excellent air connectivity offered by Etihad and Emirates Airlines, he said. Valuable insights of UAE leadership "On current affairs, we value the insights and views of the UAE, whose leadership has given ample proof of experience and a constructive approach to regional and world issues. Our relations are well consolidated, as proven by the joint communique that was approved during the visit of our head of government, Pedro S?nchez, on 2nd February this year," the diplomat said. The Expo 2020 Dubai has represented a wonderful opportunity for both countries to delineate the bilateral agenda, thanks to the fruitful visits of S?nchez, six cabinet ministers, various presidents of autonomous communities and more than a dozen other delegations representing the most varied groups of interest, Espa?a noted. Spain aims at further developing mutual investment relations, economic and trade ties, cooperation in health, energy and climate action, security and the fight against crime, cybersecurity, education, and sharing experiences in good governance in the public sector, among others, he explained. Joint efforts for successful COP28 "We aim at working together with a view to ensuring a successful outcome for the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Abu Dhabi in 2023, when Spain will hold the Presidency of the European Union," the ambassador underscored. In that context, Spain has committed to mobilise the necessary climate diplomacy to galvanise global efforts to ensure that the results of COP28 in UAE provide appropriate inputs to increase the ambition of Parties' nationally determined contributions. "We want to show leadership together with EU members and institutions to contribute to UAE's success during COP28," Espa?a stressed. As climate action is a most relevant issue, both countries stress the urgent need to step up global climate change ambition to limit global warming to 1.5?C, especially considering the outcome of COP26 in Glasgow. "We look forward to the outcome of COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh in November this year and to preparing for COP28 in Abu Dhabi in 2023," he said. Quantum computer project highlights educational ties Spain values the ongoing cooperation through the UAE's Technological Innovation Institute (TII) in the project to build the first quantum computer in the country, the ambassador said. It is the best expression of joint potential in innovative, cutting-edge technologies, and their future impact on areas such as precision medicine, smart technologies, and artificial intelligence etc., he added. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UAE Ministry of Education for cooperation in higher education and scientific research helps make direct links between institutions of both countries. It also supports joint research, exchanges and programmes, sharing information on national legislation and the standards for the licencing of institutions and for the adoption of their educational programmes to provide mutual recognition of scientific degrees, academic titles and diplomas of higher education, the diplomat noted. Organised community Elaborating on the Spanish community in the UAE, Espa?a said they are in various professional sectors, working with Spanish and foreign companies, in universities and the UAE public administration. There are doctors, owners of SMEs, lawyers, employees in the hospitality, finance and many varied sectors. The Spanish Residents Council (CRE) is an independent body, elected directly by the Spanish community, which helps ensure adequate communication among them and cater for their needs. The Spanish Business Council is a vibrant institution. The Association of Spanish Professors in the UAE has more than one hundred members, and the Spanish Association of Scientists and Researchers in the UAE has over eighty members, the envoy said. \</doc>

Imagine having one of the biggest days of your career ruined by two environmental activists shouting slogans and waving a homemade banner. Such was the fate of Liz Truss, whose maiden speech as British prime minister to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham in October was sabotaged by two members of Greenpeace UK, protesting what they saw as government backsliding on everything from environmental protection to workers' rights. In their own way, Ami McCarthy and Rebecca Newsom were emulating the rebelliousness of 19-year-old Swedish activist and global climate icon Greta Thunberg, who famously lambasted the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, aka COP26, as an exercise in 'blah, blah, blah'. But, as our research at Asda£ BCW shows, social and environmental activism is no longer confined to society's margins and rowdy post-Millennials, or Gen Y-ers, to be more precise, in the case of Mses McCarthy and Newsom. Awareness of the need for more urgent action on climate change is now a mainstream phenomenon, and an area of common ground between young people and older generations. The Middle East is no exception to this trend. While unemployment and rising living costs remain their primary concerns, nearly three-quarters of Arab youth across the region say that climate change is now affecting their everyday lives, up from about two-thirds who said this in 2021. And half say they are now likely to boycott a brand that damages the environment, rising to a staggering two-thirds of young GCC nationals. Arab youth cite inflation, unemployment, the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories, government corruption and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic as the main obstacles facing the region. This is to be expected in a region that has lived through the Arab Spring, the rise and fall of Islamist extremism and the massive disruption to the tourism sector, an economic lifeline for many Arab nations, caused by the pandemic. However, unlike their peers a decade ago, who were relatively indifferent to environmental issues, today's Arab youth are no longer prepared to sit on the sidelines of the climate debate. This year, more than eight in 10 across the Arab world, and more than 90 per cent of GCC youth, say their government should be doing more to promote sustainable development. A third say the region should be doing even more than other countries. Contrary to the prevailing narrative that developed nations should accept most of the burden of climate action, less than a fifth say that Middle East nations should be doing less than other countries. Arab youth also have a clear idea of what constitutes a modern successful company, according to our study. Nearly two-thirds of those polled said that a model business today prioritises its social and environmental impact above making money. Less than a third of GCC youth, and 40 per cent of youth in North Africa and the Levant, said that it should put profits first. Significantly, these sentiments appear to be finding their way into the boardroom. In a separate study of 200 opinion elites in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, conducted by our dedicated ESG advisory OnePoint5 in May, more than a third of decision- makers in the UAE and 43 per cent in Saudi Arabia said their business already had a policy in place for environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. And more than a third of respondents overall said their company was developing one. About half of opinion elites in the two countries say that their company consistently acts against employees guilty of unethical behaviour, while 46 per cent of decision makers in the UAE and 43 per cent in Saudi Arabia say they have a whistle-blower policy in place to encourage ESG compliance. While it would be wrong to conclude that businesses must now pursue a sustainability agenda at the expense of shareholders, our research further reinforces the long-held view of communicators that successful companies are those that clearly articulate their purpose over and above financial returns. It also shows that there is both an operational and an awareness gap to fill. Companies need help designing sustainability frameworks, as well as support communicating internally and externally how these policies complement their long-term operational objectives. Hence the establishment of OnePoint5 earlier this year. Two-thirds of opinion elites in Saudi Arabia and the UAE say their company currently lacks an ESG framework. More than half of those who say their company has already adopted one confess they don't fully understand it. For example, while 57 per cent of the Bahraini youth we polled said they knew their country had pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2060, 40 per cent said they weren't aware of the target. A full 61 per cent of Emirati youth said they knew their leadership had announced the Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative, but nearly a third said they weren't sure their country had set an emissions-free goal. Notwithstanding the bold pledges of today's government and business leaders, it will ultimately fall to young people to chart a course towards a more sustainable future. Proactive, meaningful engagement on this issue by all stakeholders will therefore be essential to maintain trust, a quantity in short supply in some countries on the evidence of the Greenpeace UK protest at the Conservative party conference. COP27 in Egypt and next year's climate change conference in the UAE will seek to further integrate young people in climate action dialogues. The Environment Agency Abu Dhabi will shortly survey 10,000 young people aged 15 to 29 across all seven UAE emirates on the most pressing environmental issues and the implications of climate change, an initiative to be applauded. The outcome of such engagement is that young people become part of the solution to our environmental and social challenges, not the gatecrashers at the party. According to the Asda£ BCW Arab Youth Survey, a full81 per cent of GCC youth say they are confident in their government's ability to tackle climate change, compared with 51 per cent across the entire region who say they are not confident. When the UAE takes the baton from Egypt in preparation for COP28 next November, it will be hoping to build on the high level of trust on climate action it has hitherto enjoyed among its youth. And it will rightfully expect all stakeholders to play their part. 'A FULL 81 PER CENT OF GCC YOUTH SAY THEY ARE CONFIDENT IN THEIR GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE.' \</doc>

The marketing sector faced a whole new set of challenges with the surging impact of the pandemic and technology's evolution. The pandemic took spending behaviour to its lowest simply because all marketing budgets were slashed and brands and advertisers were trying to manoeuvre the new normal, like everyone else. Events and advertising were heavily affected by cancellations and indefinite postponements, travel bans and the raging economic impact of the pandemic. The whole of the industry had to be completely refocused. This in turn created an opportunity for technology to disrupt even the most traditional markets, with purchasing patterns rapidly shifting to e-commerce platforms. Adapting to the new trends, advertisers significantly increased digital spending, making performance marketing shine as a great media tool, with higher cost on the cost-per- click (CPC) and conversion. As major economies in the MENA region have shifted their focus to building non-oil-focused ecosystems and diversified revenue streams to bring other industries to the forefront, the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) industry has seen unprecedented growth as it has far-reaching impacts on its adjoining sectors and GDP, not only hospitality. Major Middle Eastern economies, led by the UAE (particularly Dubai) have built a great infrastructure to host and support mega-scale events, exhibitions, and conferences. Saudi has also made huge investments by hosting major global events in Riyadh like the 2020 G20 Riyadh summit and the MDL Beast Festival. This year the focus will be on Qatar, as the country gears up to host one of the biggest sports tournaments in the world, the Football World Cup 2022. As fans from across the world travel to watch their favourite teams compete, and major events take place on the periphery of the World Cup, the economy of the country will most definitely flourish with the influx of tourists and surge in demand for the hospitality sector. Egypt on the other hand has been making strides of its own in the sector, with its new MICE strategy and is gearing up to bring the world to Egypt for the next UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ), slated for November this year. The hybrid approach seems to be the motto of our generation of marketers. With media planning taking the lead to split budgets between offline and online media to events being planned with physical and virtual touchpoints, strategies have evolved to include every new media channel, various audience segments, static and interactive branding elements, and consumer engagement activations, all tied together with brand messaging. For example, at Entourage, we have worked with multiple countries to devise marketing strategies to promote tourism, highlight all the important sectors of the country and bring in investment. Promoting countries is the most challenging marketing job there is. Promoting countries not just for tourism, but for business and investment, and actually witnessing the intangible impact of the success of the campaign on the development and progress of the country itself. With multiple avenues that need to be marketed and messaging that needs to justify every aspect, it requires in-depth knowledge of geography, history, culture, traditions, population demographics, agriculture and industry and everything you can imagine. With countries, the most important task is to align the marketing strategy with the overall country strategy and develop a bank of content and media to drive the narrative through the right marketing channels, using the right mix of storytelling and immaculate creativity and to always remain true to authenticity. As destination marketing campaigns involve multiple different clusters of audiences and different geographies, media planning and budgeting are as crucial as producing the creative campaign itself. But once you have a successful campaign, the results percolate down to all sectors. This is where I feel our next biggest opportunity is. The other side of an opportunity is always a threat or a challenge. As volatile as our industry may be, it has proven to be resilient and agile in the face of instability. The threat of financial recessions and the possibility of another global contagion creating havoc in our lives is very real. With more than two decades in the business, I am certain, we will come out on the winning side of any challenge.

In recognition of the role ESG plays in driving long-term value creation,Red Havas launched a unique initiative - 'Red Impact,' integrating the global network's environmental, social, and corporate governance expertise and capabilities all under one roof. A recent report from Deloitte, explains how brands and advertisers need to make sure that their audit committees are developing ESG strategies with an in-depth understanding of the interconnectedness across all the three pillars - "environmental, social, and governance." The launch of Red Impact comes at a time when the demand for purpose-driven strategic communications is on the rise. It brings together a team of specialists from across the agency's micro-network. Building on its recognition at the Cannes Lions, the global network continues to explore the cause and purpose of curating meaningful campaigns. Communicate sat down with the Global CEO of Red Havas, James Wright,and Mathilde Montel, Senior Director of Corporate Communications at Red Havas Middle East to unveil the thought behind the launch along with the approach that they are aiming at taking with this initiative. The 3Ps Wright believes that there is no better time than now, for brands and advertisers to push for an ESG strategy. "There's been a real seminal moment for ESG to be taken even more seriously. And I think this largely comes down to three P's." In image above: James Wright, Global CEO, Red Havas "Second 'P' stands for politics. Political polarization has heavily been occupying the headlines recently, Wright sights the latest developments from the US elections and the Russia-Ukraine war. "People have been voicing their ideologies, raising their concerns, and putting pressure on organizations to take a position on these ongoing debates," added Wright. Protests being the last have also added to the impact according to Wright. "There's been a lot of protests around equal justice, climate change, employee rights, and conditions," he said. "What was interesting amid all this was that there was a lot of confusion caused by authorities and governments across the world. Brands, on the other hand, were surfacing and passing on consistent messages to the people. We saw billboards in Times Square lit up with simple messages from numerous brands asking people to wear their masks, and maintain social distancing. More awareness was raised through social media - people pushed content through Instagram and Facebook. So, whilst all the three P's are separate from each other, they all come together at an intersection. These I believe form the foundation to our call to launch Red Impact," explained Wright. Global VS. Regional aspirations for ESG The team at Red Havas defines this initiative as horizontal as compared to vertical. "Red Impact cuts through all industries across all different markets," said Wright. Discussing the ESG initiative's regional reach, Montel, who will also be leading the operations for this in the MENA region explained, " We've definitely seen an increasing demand in the number of briefs that we received from clients or prospects of their ESG approach from across the MENA region. We also see a lot more demand coming from our existing clients on more strategic thinking to have a global approach to contributing to building purpose-led communities. This ties back to the region's pledges to net zero carbon emissions. We know that the UAE has made pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 2050, and KSA by 2060. Oman is actively working on it as well." In image above: Mathilde Montel, Corporate Communications Officer, Red Havas Middle East "With governments shifting their focus towards clean energy, comes also the demand for that kind of expertise, and that's where we see the opportunity to tap into the network with professionals from across the globe coming together under the Red Impact to help our clients get that upper hand and directly become a part of the change," she further added. Red Havas is tapping into different dimensions of ESG, by directly working withL'Or\'e9al, which has an active partnership with UNESCO's Foundation for Women and Science. Red Havas under its portfolio of ESG has actively been working for Nakheel to help them expand their horizons into marine conservation. GWI's recent reports and surveys find how both Millennials and Gen Z are changing the narrative of becoming "eco-warriors," which is easily becoming one of the top-level priorities. Building on this insight, Montel adds, " COP27 this year is going to be hosted in Egypt, and Dubai is scheduled to bring COP28 here next year, and there is no time better than now for us to push brands to take action. This initiative helps us become very proactive in the way that we approach our clients. ESG is something that all businesses are looking into now. But, we help them become the thought-leaders in the field." Emotional connection is the holy grail "The holy grail for all brands is an emotional connection," explains Wright. He discusses how emotions help brands and organizations build a reputation and a long-term relationship with their consumers, "Whether it be a stakeholder, employee, or a consumer, they tend to become loyal to entities, whose values they believe in. Moreover, the bar has been raised immensely by organizations that take a stand and speak up. The rules are not the same as they were 10 or 20 years ago, sustainability, work culture, and social responsibility are factors that are taken into serious consideration today. Therefore, brands and marketers that have a purpose, will be better positioned for success in the future. I believe in humanity and I believe that humans will eventually make the best decisions for their communities, which is why I'm obsessed with the issue of corporate purpose and ensuring that brands stand for something that's just more than a badge," concluded Wright. \</doc>

CAIRO, 8th October, 2022 (WAM) -- Egypt's Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad stressed that protecting migratory birds and biodiversity is one of the global and regional environmental challenges that Egypt is keen to address during the UN Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP27 ). The conference aims to document relations and mutual understanding between the energy sector and nature conservation organisations along the African-Eurasian migration path in order to strengthen the relationship, understanding, and partnership between nature conservation, especially birds and energy infrastructure along the migration path. Fouad invited attendees to the climate conference and called on them to create global momentum on the importance of protecting the environment and biological diversity from the effects of climate change during the Cop27 in Egypt and the Cop28 in the United Arab Emirates. \</doc>

The task now is to generate ideas and form networks and coalitions, with a focus on building resilience The international institutions, norms, and practices that we continue to rely on are increasingly being eclipsed by geopolitics. Whatever their rhetoric, China, Russia, and the United States have lost faith in global institutions, withholding their support whenever it suits their interests. While the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, and major players from the Global South continue to support multilateralism, global governance cannot really be sustained without the participation of the world's largest economies and military powers. Making matters worse, the world is facing at least eight systemic challenges simultaneously. As former Canadian central bank governor Stephen Poloz explains in his book The Next Age of Uncertainty, "when multiple long-term forces are acting together on the economy through time, and interacting with one another as well, the economy itself can behave erratically and appear unstable." Under these conditions, predictions and conventional policy tools stop working. The first major challenge is Russia's war in Ukraine, which shows no end in sight (notwithstanding the Ukrainian armed forces' recent gains). The tit-for-tat weaponization of economic linkages has generated a huge global energy shock that will aggravate deeper social and political crises in Europe and around the world this fall. While the G7, Australia, and South Korea have taken steps to freeze Russia out of the global dollar system and interbank messaging network (SWIFT), Global South powers have not joined the sanctions regime, leaving the G20 split on this issue. Second, despite the Biden administration's recent legislative breakthroughs, US democracy is in deep crisis. Most decision-making remains crippled by legislative gridlock and an activist Supreme Court, and extremism is on the rise. In a recent book, the international relations scholar Barbara F. Walter warns that many well-known indicators of impending civil war are flashing red in the US. A major survey published in November 2021 found that 30% of Republicans, and 18% of Americans overall, agree with the statement: "Because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country." Third, China is at a fork in the road. The 20th Party Congress this October almost certainly will solidify President Xi Jinping's rule and install key powerholders for the next five years or longer. We will then see whether the regime intends to double down on its nationalist mobilization and intensifying social control &ndash; including its economically disastrous "zero-Covid" policy, closed borders, and other restrictions. Will China entrench its new isolation, or will it take some steps back toward international connectivity and economic liberalization? The answer to that question will determine the answers to many others. As matters stand, the US and Chinese political trajectories are fuelling a confrontational spiral that cannot end well for either side. Fourth, after a period of remarkable unity in response to Russia's attack of Ukraine, the EU is entering an extraordinarily risky period of intertwined energy, economic, and social shocks. Italians seem poised to elect a right-wing nationalist government later this month; French governance is divided; and eastern member states remain vulnerable to Russian threats. Fifth, climate-related disasters are intensifying globally &ndash; and much earlier than expected. Across South Asia, the Pacific, China, Europe, Africa, and the Americas, heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and mega floods are disrupting lives, reducing food supplies (which were already endangered by Russia's war), and fragmenting societies. Sixth, there are still deep post-pandemic uncertainties with respect to supply chains, energy and food markets, and inflation. It is anyone's guess what global financial markets will do this fall, but talk of tighter financial conditions and recession is in the air. Seventh, these food, energy, climate, and economic shocks are likely to trigger social and democratic breakdown in many parts of the world, especially if the G20 cannot agree on safety-net measures such as debt relief. Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Ethiopia are already in the throes of political and socio-economic chaos. Finally, the coming months will stress test global-governance mechanisms like never before. All eyes will be on the November 15-16 G20 summit in Bali, the November 18-19 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Thailand, and the November 6-18 COP27 climate conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Sadly, it is hard to expect much from any of these gatherings. First, these interacting shocks must be faced with pragmatism, rather than ideology, recognising that a failure to act collectively will put the future of human civilisation itself at risk. Since we remain closely connected through technology, climate, travel, and the broader world economy, global governance through exclusive regional or ideological clubs simply will not suffice. Second, political leaders and policymakers must figure out how to match the kind of imagination that business and technology leaders have demonstrated in recent decades. There are huge untapped possibilities to be explored through alternative approaches to global and collective governance. These include new platforms like the Paris Peace Forum, Global Solutions Initiative, and Jeju Forum for Peace and Prosperity, which bring multiple actors together to incubate new models, or inter-regional groups such as the Alliance for Multilateralism. The G20 should initiate a taskforce on common long-term existential questions and mutual misperceptions. We urgently need a competitive, bottom-up search for new ideas. Third, large, systemically important players have a historic responsibility to contain their own military and security rivalries, and to support countries that face hardship as a result of the large powers' actions. In the past, we have found ways to defuse the threat of mutual insecurity through regular global meetings and platforms like the Stockholm Conference on Confidence- and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe; we must do so again today. As for all the other countries, companies, foundations, civil-society groups, and NGOs, the task now is to generate ideas and form networks and coalitions, with a focus on building resilience and developing anti-fragile systems. If the big players fail to do their part, our last chance may rest with these stakeholders in the middle. - Project Syndicate - Bertrand Badr\'e9 is a former managing director of the World Bank.

Original Press Release: Sept. 29 -- Dubai Electricity & Water Authority issued the following news release: The second day of the World Green Economy Summit (WGES) 2022 witnessed several panel discussions primarily focused on achieving net-zero and motivating youth to actively participate in climate action. The Summit was held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai and organised by Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO), and the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, in collaboration with various global organisations. A group of panel discussions were held on the second day of WGES, and prominent dignitaries and decision-makers from across the globe participated. The first session was titled 'Dubai's Carbon Abatement Strategy & Net-Zero Goal' in which H.E. Ahmed Buti Al Muhairbi, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Energy engaged in a fireside chat on Dubai's net zero strategy. Taher Diab, Director of Strategy & Planning at Dubai Supreme Council of Energy gave a presentation on Dubai's net zero strategy. John Defterios, Professor of Business, NYU Abu Dhabi & World Economic Forum Energy Fellow, moderated the session. Al Muhairbi highlighted the success in the private sector and spoke about the Council's participation through public-private partnership. He shed light on the IPP projects, with almost 5,000 projects to date. Al Muhairibi also pointed out that up to AED 40 billion has been invested in the renewable energy sector, with an additional AED 40 billion yet to be invested. He emphasised that renewable energy is the future, though the hydrocarbon and gas sector will continue to play an important role. He said that the key factor that will ensure effective clean energy security and supply, is a transition from conventional sources of energy to renewables. The next session was a fireside chat with H.E. Noor Alkhulaif, Minister of Sustainable Development, Bahrain, on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), moderated by Defterios. Alkhulaif focused on the work that has been undertaken in Bahrain to achieve the goal of a clean future. She said there were many measures to be taken and Bahrain has ensured integrated steps and collaboration between different ministries. She emphasised that the nation considers all sustainable development goals within its governments and ministries' framework and actions plan to ensure a combined approach. She highlighted that sustainability has been one of the three pillars in the Vision 2030, with the other two pillars being competitiveness and fairness. Ssustainability has changed its meaning since the last 15 to 20 years, which was before the initiation of the Vision 2030, when sustainability meant economic sustainability, which focused on growing the economy and ensuring citizen welfare with private sector as the driving force. With the promotion of the private sector, Bahrain witnessed the growth of the non-oil sector and in the recent times, the biggest non-oil sector is the financial services sector. A town hall debate titled 'How youth activism is moving the needle on climate change' was held in which speakers highlighted the importance of youth participation in tackling sustainability issues. Omnia El Omrani, President Youth Envoy, COP 27 ; Nisreen Elsaim, Chair of UN Secretary General's Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change; Aysha Mohammad AlRemeithi, Youth Council President & Deputy Manager, Innovation Ecosystem - Solar Innovation Centre, DEWA; and Ahmed Alrebati, Senior Environment Engineer - Projects & Studies, ENOC were the key speakers at the panel.

By Matthew\~Hurling, Government Programs Lead for Middle East & Africa, Mandiant Geopolitical summits, elections and sporting meets are some of the most visible events whether they're taking place on an international, national, or regional scale. They also present unique cyber security challenges for critical infrastructure and supply chains. From a summer of sporting events running through to the FIFA World Cup, as well as the G20 and COP27 summits this winter, no matter whether these last from a single day to multiple weeks or months, defending against cyber threats must be an important consideration for organisers and is no longer something that cannot be taken seriously nor left to the responsibility of other parties. Defending these kinds of societal events requires active defences backed up by the latest intelligence on potential attackers. Organisers need to have strategic security programs plus the right technical solutions in place to harden their security posture prior to an event and to support operations once it kicks off. Delivering resilient cyber capabilities in a compressed timeframe under intense public attention and scrutiny is a major challenge that requires focus and investment to properly plan and implement. There are three key phases to think about here, in the run up to and during a major event: Understand the environment: Prepare, harden and exercise Anticipate threats: Test, monitor and defend Survive attacks: Respond, contain and remediate This phase should take place before a major event, with the aim of proactively protecting and hardening the event's security posture. Do you know enough about the potential adversaries and have you prepared your people, processes and technologies in the right way? Some of the critical things to think through in the preparation phase include: Ensure you can monitor and investigate alerts, proactively hunt for attackers and contain and remediate threats Deploy endpoint and network detection technologies across the entire environment and multi-factor authentication across all accounts and external facing services Create alerts for emerging and currently exploited vulnerabilities as well as current and imminent threats based on the latest information about the threat landscape Monitor social media, blogs, forums, news sites and chat apps for threats, misinformation and disinformation campaigns Coordinate with relevant national agencies to obtain and contribute related intelligence. When it comes to hardening infrastructure, conduct compromise assessments and validate controls to check the security and integrity of the environment and the key data that needs protecting. Think about what all the different ways into that environment might be, and make sure to log and regularly scan all externally facing assets on the network. In the heat of the moment, you don't want to be struggling to think who should be involved, so make sure you've designated a crisis-response team and that you've got the right organisational, executive and communications support. Conduct a tabletop exercise to ensure that all participants understand their roles and responsibilities during an incident, and test backup procedures to ensure that critical data can be rapidly restored and critical business functions can remain available. Anticipate threats Once the major event has begun, and there will be an increased risk of destructive or disruptive cyber attacks. This is when you should go into an elevated active defence mode \- or 'shields up'. Key priorities will include continuously validating security controls and defending critical assets. It's all about inhibiting the access an adversary needs to leverage to achieve their goal. Testing is important again here \- whether that's ad-hoc penetration testing exercises on all externally facing assets, testing the internal team and technology's ability to detect, prevent and respond, or testing the incident response team's reaction times against real adversarial methods. Monitoring what's happening in real time is key in this phase: Establish a situation room to bring together operations, intelligence and external organisation information and communications Conduct enhanced hunting and monitoring for indicator-less behaviours; assume attacks are happening and technical controls have missed something Continuously validate security controls effectiveness against active attack behaviours. Restrict egress communications on critical systems. Ultimately, the focus should be on protecting critical assets \- what are your crown jewels and what might an adversary go after? Protect specific high-value infrastructure and network architecture to limit or remove adversary access to critical systems, and make sure you have offline backups in place to use if needed. Survive attacks By this stage, you've hopefully spent a long time prepping, building and testing defences, and now it's all about being ready to respond and providing continuity. During the major event, national, international and social media coverage often parallels real-time activity. Having extensive intelligence on existing and emerging threat actor tactics, techniques and procedures enables you to have an effective and efficient incident response. Effective incident and breach response extends beyond technical investigation, containment and recovery and includes executive communication and crisis management, such as legal, regulatory and public relations considerations. Doing this requires taking a potential adversary's view of the situation. Preparing for an incident from only one side, without invoking real-world experience and known data on threats, solves only half the equation. Following the major event, take time to detail successes, challenges and recommendations. We can always continue learning from similar events and try to share as much information as possible to avoid future similar circumstances. The cyber security challenges we face today are often too big to tackle alone and the necessary cyber defence operations maturity and capacity require significant, sustained focus and investment. These challenges become even more acute during major events. Protecting such events means having rapid and adaptable cyber defences under unique duress and pressure. A prepared and practiced cyber strategy and playbook helps ensure a favourable outcome not just for the hosts, but all participants, spectators, and those watching on from around the world. \</doc>

"Welcome to the post- pandemic, new hopeful era," concludes the latest Havas Middle East Prosumer Report, Generation Covid, which explores Gen Z's influential role in shaping the region's future and the role brands should play in adapting to changing expectations. This recent study decodes findings from the UAE and KSA with insights about post-pandemic mindsets of the next generation of 'Prosumers'. These are the consumers who are today's leading influencers and market drivers. Beyond their own economic impact, they are important as they influence brands' choices and the consumption behaviours of others. Key findings reveal that today's youth is dissatisfied with the direction of the world and they are committed to driving change on their own terms. Environmental sustainability is at the top of their agenda, and if the future doesn't inspire them they are ready and willing to tackle challenges despite the chaos and uncertainty that swirls around them. And how can we blame them? Globally, we still lack unity to move in the right direction, in a consolidated effort. Over the summer, United Nations members failed to establish a UN Ocean Treaty that would set rules for protecting marine life in international waters that cover half the planet. The failure to reach an agreement opens a debate over countries moving too slowly despite their commitments and pledges. Yet, the next generation is hopeful. They won't wait for the future; their future starts today, and they will drive change. They are already involved in environmental activism. The study reveals that one out of two UAE residents is personally engaged in some form of activism for the planet. In addition, 53 per cent of people in the UAE and 56 per cent in KSA want to work less and dedicate more time to causes that matter to the world. They are even personally ready to stop buying fast fashion (57 per cent in the UAE and 55 per cent in KSA). In conclusion, today's young consumers want to build a new world that suits their aspirations and that is guided by their moral compass. It feels like a daunting task, but they are not alone. Regionally, governments are taking sustainability much more seriously. The majority of GCC countries have announced their commitments to net-zero carbon emissions as part of their Vision plans, while we are at the cusp of COP 27 being held in Egypt, and of course the UAE next year. The Dubai Supreme Council of Energy recently announced the reduction of its carbon emissions by 21 per cent in 2021, a step in the right direction for the Dubai Carbon Abatement Strategy 2030, which aims to reduce 30 percent of carbon emissions by the end of 2030. Several other carbon emission reduction targets have been set ahead of 2060 as part of the wider net zero initiative by the UAE. In such challenging times, there is hope. But action is needed. As the older generation, what role do we play? Some say we have destroyed the world beyond repair - regardless, what isn't too broken for us to fix? Together, we can set a better foundation for the generations to come, starting with enabling Gen Z as much as we can. As communications specialists, it is our role to drive organisational change for our clients, reset their priorities and define their ESG agenda. Bearing in mind that businesses must adapt to changing customer expectations and behaviours, while keeping true to their identity and maintaining their credibility. Sometimes, this action is radical. A company that aligned its actions to its mission is Patagonia, whose founder Yvon Chouinard announced last month that he was giving away all the company's profits in perpetuity to 'save our home planet'. Already well established as a philanthropist, this announcement elevated his profile to that of an environmental corporate leader, as he stated: "If we have any hope of a thriving planet - much less a thriving business - 50 years from now, it is going to take all of us doing what we can with the resources we have. Earth is our only shareholder." Sometimes, this action is inspirational. To celebrate the UAE's 50th National Day, The National newspaper took a different stance to inspire the prosperous future of the nation. Addressing the environmental issue, Havas wanted to encourage readers to plant the seeds of the greener future by planting one tree that defies the desert - the ghaf tree. In collaboration with the 'Give a Ghaf' planting programme, we createdThe Ghaf Paper, the newspaper that can be planted to grow into a ghaf tree, made entirely of plantable paper, ghaf tree seeds and vegetable oil for ink. Through this collaborative initiative, hundreds of trees were planted and will be sharing their roots on the prosperous land of the UAE for years to come, resulting in commercial impact for The National too. Sometimes, this action is incremental. With the global campaign Run for the Oceans, Adidas is continuing its commitment to urgently address the threatening levels of marine plastic pollution in the oceans. Last year, Adidas and Nakheel installed a floating walkway on the waters at The Pointe at Palm Jumeirah, with educational touchpoints positioned along it to raise awareness and end plastic waste pollution Change starts with the organisational and personal examples we set. As an agency, we recently launched Red Impact globally, which I helped launch in the Middle East. It is a new offering that brings together Red Havas's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) expertise and capabilities from across the world. And as I write this article, I'm gearing up for a clean-up dive to support #PalmWithoutPlastic, an initiative by Nakheel in collaboration with Nemo Diving Centre to clean our Dubai beaches. We can expect to see many more of these activities in the coming months, when divers of all ages can participate for free by picking up plastic and protecting marine life. Welcome to the post-pandemic, new hopeful era. 'THE STUDY REVEALS THAT ONE OUT OF TWO UAE RESIDENTS IS PERSONALLY ENGAGED IN SOME FORM OF ACTIVISM FOR THE PLANET.' \</doc>

DUBAI, 25th September, 2022 (WAM) -- The world is at a crucial turning point where, if meaningful action is not aggressively pursued, climate change will have devastating consequences for the survival of the planet and the human race. Though concrete steps have been taken in the last few years to combat these adverse effects, this challenge requires expanded initiatives, strengthening international cooperation, and accelerating the pace of climate action. Experts estimate a 400% increase in the frequency of destructive weather events in the last seven years alone. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities continue to rise, which according to the UN, are now at their highest levels in history. This situation has exacerbated climatic conditions that have affected the entire planet, especially the poorest and most vulnerable communities. "Climate change has affected the entire world. It poses massive challenges for all countries. Any rise in emissions in one part of the world affects everyone else on the planet. Thus, an international collaborative effort needs to be in place that will develop solutions and coordinate significant action on the ground to ensure all countries move towards a low-carbon economy," said Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD & CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Chairman of the World Green Economy Organization (WGEO). "Held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the World Green Economy Summit (WGES) is organised by Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, the World Green Economy Organization, and the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy. WGES, established eight years ago, provides a strategic platform for developing effective and proactive plans to combat climate change and promote international cooperation," added Al Tayer. WGES will take place on 28-29 September at the Dubai World Trade Centre. "WGES is part of the UAE&rsquo;s contribution to the global community&rsquo;s collective effort to identify and develop sustainable initiatives to help the world transition into a green economy. It is also an important pillar of the UAE&rsquo;s preparations to host the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) in November 2023. Equally important, WGES reflects the UAE&rsquo;s effective and influential role in achieving sustainable, low-carbon economic growth and ensuring a better future for humanity," added Al Tayer. "What is currently needed is an international framework that will facilitate knowledge-sharing and cooperation to ensure that these solutions are scaled up to have a greater impact so that their intended benefits can be shared by the global community," continued Al Tayer. Many other innovative solutions have been developed and are currently being implemented across the globe to help countries transition into cleaner and more sustainable economies. "At the Summit, we will seek to define the path towards a community that is driven by renewable energy. We will involve all members of society, especially the youth, so they can contribute actively to delivering a more sustainable future," Al Tayer concluded. In an emphatic display of cooperation which underscored the urgency of addressing the critical challenges of climate change, countries from around the world adopted the Paris Agreement in 2015, calling on all signatory nations to work towards limiting the rise of global temperatures to below two degrees Celsius. At the COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries committed to a collective goal of mobilising $100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action in developing countries. The goal, formalised at COP16 in Cancun, was reiterated at COP21 in Paris, with the fund mobilisation deadline extended to 2025. In 2020, a report published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which tracks the progress of the global fund, shows that USD83.3 billion has so far been mobilised for climate change initiatives, with development assistance going largely to Asian and middle-income countries to finance various climate change programmes. In the UK, enacting the Climate Change Act several years ago has helped the country reduce its emissions and prepare for the impact of climate change, with legally binding emissions targets for 2050. Widely acclaimed, the Act assists the UK in delivering sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and their overall climate change initiatives. Meanwhile, in Australia, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was set up in 2012 to help scale up investment in clean energy projects, thereby contributing to the country&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy. The corporation is widely regarded to have helped overcome barriers to private investment in low-emission solutions and cleantech in Australia. UAE&rsquo;s contributions to climate change action In December 2020, the UAE submitted its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, with commitments that focus on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, the Emirates has pledged to reduce its GHG emissions by 23.5 per cent by 2030. By introducing new regulatory frameworks and formulating innovative solutions, the UAE is on track to achieving an absolute emission reduction of about 70 million tonnes in the next eight years. Towards this end, the country has recently established the Arab world&rsquo;s first commercial-scale carbon capture, use and storage network. This technology will help immensely with the realisation of the UAE&rsquo;s GHG emissions targets and ultimately in mitigating climate change. In addition, the UAE has invested over $40 billion in clean energy projects locally. Its clean power capacity, including solar and nuclear, is expected to reach 14 GW by 2030. DEWA has plans to invest AED 40 billion in capital expenditures in five years, including the expansion of renewable and clean energy projects, and the completion of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park phases. The Solar Park is the largest single-site solar park in the world, with a planned capacity of 5,000 megawatts when completed by 2030. Looking ahead, the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017-2050 has laid down the framework for the management of GHG emissions, climate change adaptation, private sector-driven innovative economic diversification as well as a commitment to implementing the principles of a circular economy that will benefit not just the UAE, but more importantly will have a far-reaching impact on the global fight against climate change. The UAE&rsquo;s commitment to fully supporting an accelerated transition towards a green economy will be reaffirmed at the WGES with the announcement of the 8th Dubai Declaration. A game-changing platform for global action At the Summit, global thought-leaders, government entities, big business and sustainable finance leaders will convene to share best practices and explore what a green and fair economy should look like in principle and practice. The event&rsquo;s agenda has been structured to focus on the following thematic pillars &ndash; Energy (Decarbonising Energy Networks), Finance (Mobilising Investment for Green Growth), Food Security (Building Resilience & Sustainability into Value Chains) and Youth (Empowering the Next Generation to Drive Positive Change). WGES will also highlight the Middle East region&rsquo;s efforts to shape the sustainability agenda by promoting effective adaption and mitigation strategies. The selection of Egypt and the UAE to host the COP27 and COP28 summits in 2022 and 2023 respectively, will kick-start 18 months of regional activity, placing the Arab world at the heart of global activities to promote climate action \</doc>

The project will catalyse US$100 billion in financing, investment, and other support and will deploy 100 gigawatts of clean energy globally. "The COP is a global political, economic, scientific and social platform to achieve commitments to reduce the impact of climate change through negotiations and to assess the progress in climate action," said Dr. Al Jaber. He added 27 Conferences of the Parties have been held so far, including COP21 which was a milestone moment that witnessed the landmark Paris Agreement. Dr. Al Jaber stressed that the UAE is committed to advancing climate action based on the outcomes of the past summits, including COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, which made significant progress in many areas, including the landmark agreement to establish a 'Loss and Damage Fund,' the launch of the Just Energy Transition in the Energy Sector work program and many others. He said that COP28, which will be hosted in the UAE in 2023 at Expo City Dubai, will be an important global event coinciding with the UAE National Day, adding that the event will welcome high-level participation, including over 140 heads of state and government leaders, over 80,000 delegates and more than 5,000 media professionals. He said the UAE has commenced preparations for hosting the event. A Higher Committee has been formed chaired by H.H. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, to supervise the preparations for COP28. Dr. Al Jaber said that COP28 is of particular significance as it marks the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake, a comprehensive assessment of the progress made in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Dr. Sultan Al Jaber said that hosting COP28 is a significant opportunity for the UAE to achieve political and economic benefits for the country, the region, and the world, including finding realistic, practical, and pragmatic solutions to accelerate the global energy transition. He highlighted the role of the UAE in building bridges to advance global efforts that will support the Global South and countries that are most vulnerable. Concluding his presentation, Dr. Al Jaber reiterated that the success of COP28 is a national responsibility and extended an open invitation to government and private sectors as well as all segments of society to come together in solidarity to host a successful and inclusive global event. He called on all parties to coordinate in this national event to ensure an exceptional and successful conference.

The RAK Energy Summit has concluded after two days of dialogue and discussion that brought together high-profile decision makers, speakers, and experts in the fields of energy sustainability and climate change from the UAE, the region and around the world. Held at the Al Hamra International Exhibition and Conference Centre, the RAK Energy Summit was held under the patronage of of HH Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, UAE Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, and ran from 4-5 October 2022. The summit featured panel discussions and debates about the future of energy sustainability and renewable energy, shedding light on local and international efforts to curb climate change and shape a better future. The session featured high-level speakers such as HE Sharif Al Olama, Undersecretary for Energy and Petroleum Affairs, UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, and HE Munther Mohammed bin Shekar Al Zaabi, Director General of Ras Al Khaimah Municipality. In July 2022, Siemens partnered with the American University of RAK to reduce carbon emissions. "The UAE is one of the leading countries in developing the clean energy sector, and a pioneer of modern methods to enhance the efficiency of the energy sector. Climate action in the UAE is based on three main axes: finance, technology and the environment. Hosting COP 28 represents an important and defining moment in the UAE's climate diplomacy, by organising a comprehensive and exceptional conference that can fully mobilise for international climate action," said the Undersecretary for Energy and Petroleum Affairs. A highlight of the first day was the presentation of the UAE Energy Management Leadership Awards for 2022 by the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure. Ras Al Khaimah Municipality was awarded first place, while ADNOC Onshore and ADNOC Offshore were awarded second and third places respectively. The award is based on an assessment conducted by the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure and the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) and recognises implementation of best practices in energy management. The second day was held in the presence\~ of Sheikha Amneh bint Saud Al Qasimi, Chairman of Ras Al Khaimah's Investment and Development Office, and included a speech by H.E. Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, where she said: "The focus of the RAK Energy Summit on energy efficiency and renewable energy as main topics of discussion is an important step towards enabling us to tackle the global climate change challenge \- the greatest threat to humankind. In August 2022, the first advisory board meeting for the RAK Energy Summit was held. "The summit underlines the necessity and urgency to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy sector \- one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the country. It is a platform for us to exchange expertise in advancing the clean energy transition in the UAE, and to make progress towards our national goals, embodied in the UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative. Through the initiative, we aim to engage all sectors and segments of the community in the effort to reduce and even eliminate carbon and ensure sustainable economic development." Held under the theme of "Creating and contributing to the energy efficiency and renewable energy goals of the future", the summit supports the RAK Energy Efficiency and Renewables Strategy 2040, the UAE's Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative and the country's preparations for both the UN COP 27 , taking place in Egypt next month, and the UN COP 28, which will take place in the UAE next year. RAK Energy Efficiency and Renewables Strategy targets 30% electricity savings, 20% water savings and 20% renewable energy in the generation mix by 2040. Munther Mohammed bin Shekar, Director General of Ras Al Khaimah Municipality, the host of the Summit, added: "We envision a Ras Al Khaimah where suppliers of efficient products and services find consumers looking to benefit from energy efficiency, where our youth develops and executes innovative solutions and where society is aware of its sustainability responsibilities. We have taken some important steps towards this in the summit, including the launch of our home energy services, the launch of an industrial energy audit initiative, and the launch of the SME edition of RAK Energy Innovation Competition, along with several other program announcements." In September 2022, ENEC announced that Unit 3 of the Barakah Nuclear Plant had been successfully started. Also, on Day 2 of the summit, Ras Al Khaimah Municipality launched a new industrial energy audit initiative to help local industries identify opportunities for energy efficiency and competitiveness. Future Architectural Glass, Eternity Technologies and Falcon Technologies, RAK Ceramics, RAK Rock/Stevin Rock, RAK Ports and Union Cement were the first companies to participate in the initiative by signing agreements with the Municipality at the Summit itself. The summit was supported by the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, the UAE Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), Masdar, and more than 10 government entities in Ras Al Khaimah. The second day of the Summit also saw RAK Courts, RAK Public Prosecution, RAK Civil Aviation, RAK Chamber of Commerce and the Ruler's Court of Ras Al Khaimah awarded certificates of compliance with ISO 50001:2018, for their efforts in implementing energy management systems. Later in September 2022, QatarEnergy and GE inked a deal to step up carbon capture in the energy sector. The agenda included other keynote contributions from government and industry leaders, and was sponsored by Siemens, Enova, EESL, EDF, Luceco, Sun Money, CleanMax, Pactive Solutions, Ledvance, Terraco, Netix and Teknoware. The summit was closed with a networking reception held by multiple Director Generals of Ras Al Khaimah Government entities and CEOs of state-owned enterprises in the Emirate, who met a number of representatives of the private sector attending the event. \</doc>

By Thomas Pinn At a certain level, we all sort of acknowledge the existential threat that climate change poses, but our steady and slow descent into a disastrous future makes the threat of climate change seem difficult to imagine and distant from our present. We've heard about the dangers of how a climate breakdown could cause crops to fail and rivers to dry up leading to starvation, climate refugees, and even war as freshwater becomes a contested resource, but a sense of urgency and real action taken by the world's nations is lacking. The Institute of Economics and Peace released a terrifying report predicting that climate change and natural disasters will have created 1.2 billion climate refugees by the year 2050 and lead to 250,000 deaths a year, many of which will come from the Arab world, which remains particularly vulnerable due to rising temperatures in an already hot climate, water shortages in an already water-starved region, and rising sea levels as the polar ice caps melt. To visualize the uncertain and worrying future we face, we took a look at the threat of rising sea levels in the Arab world using satellite and climatic data. Using Climate Central's coastal risk screening tool, we used the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Leading Consensus (2021) data for projections fifty years from now in 2070 according to our current trajectory of global warming to get an idea of the drastic ways the region will be changed by climate change. The projections and maps showing blue areas of sea sweeping over cities present a terrifying image of the future; however, the data used are the most commonly accepted predictions, and many scientists argue that we are actually facing an even greater rise of sea levels in the next few decades. While the aridest region will suffer from increasing shortages of freshwater for drinking and crops, much of the Arab world is also at risk of rising sea levels that may empty cities and render surrounding farmland useless as salt water poisons the soil. The IPCC has given stark warnings that cities in the region in just a matter of decades are set to become islands or be completely swamped by rising sea levels unless the nations of the world commit to taking drastic action. The city-states of the United Arab Emirates and Abu Dhabi in particular stand out as particularly vulnerable areas to rising sea levels, sitting just above the sea level. While the immense wealth of the UAE has been able to construct wonders of the modern world like the Burj Khalifa, it will not be enough to fully protect this city unless global action is taken. Around 85% of people in the UAE live along the coast and remain incredibly vulnerable to rising sea levels, which if left unaddressed by the global community could flood the entirety of all major cities in UAE that at their highest point sit only nine meters above the sea level. The effects of this are potentially catastrophic, pushing people out into the desert and destroying the UAE's economy. The National quoted Dr. Bergaoui, who spoke at the Arab Future Cities Summit in Dubai, stating that "the situation will only get worse if we do not start to take action to avoid depleting our resources and transforming the landscape of the world." However, accepting the inevitability of significant sea level rises; the summit also hosted numerous city planners and architects that were pushing for flood defenses and the relocation of neighborhoods so the city will be better prepared for what is to come. While the UAE may be better prepared than most countries in the world, the future still presents an existential threat to the nation as a whole. Many other Gulf nations like Bahrain, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia's coastal cities face a similarly catastrophic future, with sea level rises predicted to flood much of the coastline, destroying neighborhoods and pushing the nations into economic turmoil. Read More: Trash or Treasure? The Incredible Recycling Rates of Cairo's... Few cities have as worrisome a future as Basrah, with even some of the most optimistic climatic projections showing the city enveloped by the sea in just a matter of a few decades. On the flood plain of the Shat Al Arab river that opens up into the Arabian Gulf, Basrah is situated just above sea level in danger from both the incoming sea and flood waters flowing from northern Iraq. With a population of one and a half million, the exodus of Basra's residents adding to the already large number of internally displaced Iraqis throughout the country would amount to a humanitarian and food crisis that Iraq would struggle to overcome. Iraq as the world's fifth most vulnerable nation to climate change, however, faces threats from multiple directions. While salty waters are predicted to flood the south of the country around Basra, emptying cities, and killing the surrounding countryside's crops, north Iraq is facing drought due to the lack of fresh water from rain or the increasingly starved Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Even with just a 30 cm sea level rise, the Planetary Security Initiative has detailed how the sea would pollute almost all surrounding farmland with salt water throughout the region and cut off Basrah from the surrounding area. With Alexandria's population of only its most central districts accounting for over five million people and the surrounding areas reaching around eight million, the entire population of greater Alexandria is larger than the entire population of many European nations. Looking at sea level predictions only fifty years from now, the country is on track to become essentially an island surrounded by sea, potentially making the city uninhabitable for the most part. For comparison, the number of people in just the metropolitan center of Alexandria that could potentially be made climate refugees would amount to almost exactly the same amount of registered refugees from Syria across the world. Adding other climate refugees from the region and cities like Port Said that similarly face becoming islands in the near future, the looming climate refugee crisis is hard to overestimate. On top of a disastrous climate refugee crisis, rising sea levels in the Delta are also predicted to destroy a third of the area's agricultural output if the sea rises by just one meter. While the United Nation's most optimistic scenario predicts that by 2050 a million and a half people will be forced to flee Alexandria as a third of the city will be submerged underwater, considering the failure of world leaders to take real action on the climate, the reality may be worse. Alexandria is particularly vulnerable because not only are sea levels rising but because the city itself is sinking by around three millimeters a year due to the marshy terrain that the city is built on. While there have been heavy investments in flood defenses for the city and even plans to build a flood wall covering the whole of Egypt's northern shores, many experts worry that it will not be enough unless more serious global action to stop rising temperatures is taken. Unlike sudden disasters or threats that emerge and rally people to take action, climate change slowly creeps up on us, lulling us into a sense of security despite the monumental and disastrous effects that it will entail. However, with the vast majority of countries around the world failing to meet decarbonization targets and the world's leading climate scientists warning that attempts to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius will fail by 2050, the IPCC is warning of irreversible and catastrophic climate change unless the nations of the world agree to drastic climate commitments and keep to their promises. On our current trajectory, cities in the region like Alexandria and Abu Dhabi may become deserted islands while Basrah will be completely submerged, leading to millions of climate refugees and the destruction of precious farmland. With COP27 taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh and time quickly running out to prevent the worst effects of climate change, scientists and a growing number of world leaders are increasingly stressing that however distant the dangers of climate change may feel, the danger is real and the time to take actions is now.

By Thomas Pinn Buzzwords and terms like sustainable cities and the green transition have been thrown around and used ad nauseam in articles and conversations in the run-up to COP27 being hosted in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh, but what exactly do these terms mean? And is the vision of a green future for cities like Cairo in hotter climates and developing economies the same as cities like Paris with more moderate climates and developed economies? CLUSTER, a Cairo-based platform for urban research and design initiatives, has for over ten years been trying to find the answer through research and experimentation that puts the local community first. With that in mind, we sat down with CLUSTER's co-founder and architect Omar Nagati to learn more about their vision. At their office in Agouza, Nagati described the organization as an &ldquo;independent urban design and research platform that started over ten years ago with a group of architects, urbanists, and people that are working in the social sciences and arts that are interested in cities and the use of public space.&rdquo; However, unlike architecture firms that design whole new districts in desert cities or the allure of mega projects that want to demolish areas and start again, CLUSTER experiments with incremental and small changes in the existing city as a solution to wider problems. The conversation around the need for sustainable cities and the green transition in the public imagination paints an image of rolling green fields of grass and verdant greenery emerging out of cities. However, unlike a Google image search for the term 'sustainability', which reveals lush greenery and seedlings hatching out of moist soil, the future of sustainable cities and the green transition in Arab nations will need to be very different according to CLUSTER. Unlike other countries presented as examples to follow for a green transition, the Arab world has an incredibly hot climate that often decimates crops in places like Iraq and Syria. Likewise, the region has a serious issue of water scarcity in which 90% of children live in areas of high water stress and a lack of arable land, which in countries like Egypt only accounts for 4% of the country's total land mass. Considering this, the idea of green fields emerging out of the desert is the exact opposite of sustainability and the green Arab city of the future will necessarily be very different from cities in Europe and North America. However, while the future of sustainability in the Arab world may not be green fields, CLUSTER has been working on its own model of sustainability for Arab cities to be excited about that suits the economic, social, and environmental conditions while still promoting inclusive public spaces for all to enjoy. Explaining this disconnect with the image we have in our heads when we speak of a green transition and sustainability and the reality for places with hot climates and developing economies, Nagati described how &ldquo;Some of the international standards, including the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, are developed in a way that is based on the experience of mostly North America and Europe.&rdquo; Instead, what CLUSTER has been trying to do is &ldquo;to find a way to translate and integrate these very abstract principles on the ground, starting with how people area actually developing their own neighborhoods and to try to work with them to bring up a little bit towards this goal.&rdquo; For CLUSTER, creating a new model for sustainable Arab cities means looking to the past for ideas just as much as looking to the future with new and ingenuitive ideas. Nagati pointed to already existing ways that cities in the region have dealt with hot climates and run on a more sustainable basis in more traditional and also in newer informal neighborhoods. Pointing to how the future of green cities in the Arab world may look different in colder climates, Nagati discussed how &ldquo;our cities have historically been developed as a denser urban fabric, but using courtyards and narrow streets because shaded spaces generate natural ventilation systems between low pressure and high pressure. You can look at courtyards, backyards, backstreets, and the network of gaps through the fabric to develop an alternative way to address climate change&rdquo;. It is from these observations and others that CLUSTER is trying to piece together a new model for urban areas to deal with the increased temperatures that come with climate change through careful experimentation with local communities. Read More: Going Green: Arab Cities Setting Their Sight On Sustainable Projects Instead of large exposed areas of grass that need constant watering, Nagati pointed to the use of courtyards in Arab cities that historically have been able to provide a form of public space. The courtyard is an iconic part of Arab architecture that has seemed to almost completely disappear from modern urban planning in the region, despite the fact that it served a particular purpose in the Arab world's hot climates. By offering shade to both people and plants, courtyards provide a cooler microclimate for people and for plants to grow without the need for constant watering, but also a communal space that has historically been used just as much for socializing as for trade. With the need for green public spaces expressed as a priority by governments across the region, projects like Green Riyadh as part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 forgo the creation of public courtyards in favor of large parks. CLUSTER, however, conducted several projects throughout Cairo in which they reimagined alleyways as communal courtyards by planting trees suitable for the environment and proving to a seat. One of its projects in Downtown Cairo's Kodak Passageway beside the restaurant Eish & Malh and the Al-Adly synagogue has stood the test of time and remains a rare public space in central Cairo enjoyed by all. Often mistaken as simply an indicator of overpopulation and urban poverty, density in Arab cities also presents a form of city layout that developed over the centuries as a way to control temperatures and create more liveable environments, according to Nagati. The now much frowned upon narrow streets that make the historic urban centers of the Arab world and also newer informal settlements actually create much cooler microclimates and shaded routes so people can walk and cycle between places. Newer settlements in the desert, on the other hand, with wide streets and individual buildings spread out along vast areas make the car the only option to get around due to the sunny and exposed roads and long distances between places. Building on the idea of how dense urban areas can utilize shade and proximity to create more liveable and enjoyable neighborhoods, CLUSTER conducted several research projects and architectural interventions in informal areas. In one of these architectural interventions typical of CLUSTER, which similarly took inspiration from more traditional forms of Arab architecture, they experimented with large fabric covers to provide shade for a street market in an informal area of Cairo. While promoting a cooler microclimate, the project also had a great social value, claiming areas of the street as communal areas for people to gather. Following their philosophy of small-scale and affordable interventions to create more sustainable and liveable spaces, these architectural interventions are also presented as models for others to follow. However, more central to CLUSTER's philosophy is the importance of community engagement and an expanded idea of sustainability that includes economic and social factors. CLUSTER's programs and operations manager Youssra Zakaria emphasized that central to all of their project's success was the support and involvement of the local community in their projects. Looking back at which projects were successful and those that often fell into disrepair shortly after their implementation, Zakaria drew a clear line between those that were developed over a lengthy period with the local community and those that were created with less cooperation with the local community. Nagati similarly chimed in &ldquo;You can plant all the trees you want, but unless people have a sense of ownership and have brought into this idea, this idea is not sustainable.&rdquo; The future of sustainability and green cities in the Arab world will look different from much of the rest of the world, but it's a future nonetheless with exciting possibilities. Through CLUSTER's experiments in cities across the Arab world and Africa, we can get a glimpse of what this future may look like.

NEW YORK, 25th September 2022 (WAM) \- In her address at the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Reem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy, Minister of State for International Cooperation, stated that innovation is needed to strengthen the current world order and help crisis-affected countries play constructive roles in addressing global challenges. Below is the text of the UAE's address at UNGA 77: We are on the cusp of a new phase in the international order. In the UAE, we are determined for this phase to be guided by peace, recovery, and prosperity as part of a global order based on solid international relations. Through these ties, we can explore new paths for joint cooperation in the fields of economy, sustainable development, advanced technology, and research. This is the approach that my country is pursuing while implementing its foreign policy, an approach that governs our bilateral relations and our participation in international multilaterals. An approach that defines our current membership of the UN Security Council. We are aware of the magnitude of the grave challenges facing us today and the severe polarisation in the international system following the rise in crises and the emergence of new hotbeds of conflicts around the world. This is accompanied by a dangerous escalation in the activities of armed groups at a time when food and climate crises are afflicting peoples worldwide and threatening to undermine the gains of human civilisations. In addition, these threats have a severe impact on poor and developing countries and their ability to meet the needs of their peoples. While all these issues have raised questions about the effectiveness of the current international system, it has transpired that this very system, which was built on the ruins of World War II, has contributed to the enhancement of international security and stability to a large extent. Therefore, we must restore confidence in the international system and in the legitimacy of its institutions by enhancing its ability to address current crises and overcome the existential challenges of the 21st century. My country believes that we - the States present in this hall - have the ability to do so if we harness our capabilities to achieve a better future for our peoples. From this standpoint, I would like to articulate a number of issues that we should focus on in the coming period: Recent years have underscored the need to respect international law, especially the Charter of the United Nations, so that it can be applied consistently and without double or selective standards. This is a prerequisite in ensuring a stable and secure international order based on respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of all countries. In this context, we renew our demand to end Iran's occupation of the UAE's three islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Musa. History and international law bear testimony to the UAE's sovereignty over the three islands. We will never stop our legitimate claim to these islands, either through direct negotiation or through the International Court of Justice. All possible efforts should be made to overcome the state of inaction that has become the defining feature of the current international approach to crises. In turn, we must move forward in finding permanent, comprehensive, and just solutions to escalating armed conflicts around the world while addressing the repercussions resulting from global turmoil. Therefore, the next stage requires the adoption of innovative tools that enhance the effectiveness of our international system and helps crisis-affected countries and regions play a constructive role in addressing the challenges of our time. While the Arab world and African continent have suffered the majority of these crises in recent decades, we have learned difficult lessons about the need to prioritise diplomatic solutions, dialogue, and de-escalation and resolve tensions in order to avoid the emergence of new hotbeds of conflicts and extremism. Within this context, we have seen recent positive developments in our region to build bridges in resolving differences, building new partnerships based on cooperation in various fields, supporting important sectors such as health, education, and industry, and strengthening women's role in society. Furthermore, we emphasise our firm position calling for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the June 4th, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital in accordance with agreed international references. We also welcome the statement of the Prime Minister of Israel from this podium regarding support for a two-state solution. Here, we are looking forward to advancing political endeavors in our region and overcoming obstacles on the path to peace. However, this should be accompanied by efforts to strengthen international rejection of interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries. This meddling in Arab affairs undermines all efforts aimed at resolving conflicts and drives extremism and terrorism in a blatant violation of the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of the region's countries. In light of the increased frequency of crises, it has become necessary to promote the role of regional and international organisations through increased consultation to provide them with the required tools, resources, and expertise that enable them to respond effectively to current challenges. Regional organisations are more familiar with the local context and have the tools to support mediation. In this regard, we commend their efforts including those by the African Union, whose initiatives we have supported. As we all know, upholding international peace and security requires working towards a world free of weapons of mass destruction, especially in the Middle East and Korean Peninsula, while strengthening dialogue to defuse tensions and address regional and international concerns in this regard. It is not possible to discuss a secure and stable world order in the absence of a firm international position that rejects terrorism in all its forms. We must work towards a world order that is committed to holding the perpetrators and financiers of terrorism accountable. Recently, we have witnessed a rise in the flow of weapons to conflict regions and in the number of individuals of different ethnic backgrounds embracing terrorism. This is coupled with the emergence of terror groups with high combat and military capabilities and the return of fighters to their homeland without efficient mechanisms to control them. This situation further escalates when terrorists use missiles and drones to launch cross-border attacks, reflecting the evolving nature of terrorism. These developments require preventing areas of conflict from becoming a safe haven for terrorists while at the same time modernising our strategies constantly and adopting international regulations that prevent terrorists from acquiring advanced weapons and sophisticated technology. This threat has manifested through the vicious and aggressive attacks launched by the terrorist Houthi militias earlier this year on the capital of my country, Abu Dhabi, as well as on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This came at a time when other terrorist groups such as Daesh, Al Qaeda, and Al Shabab are seeking to develop their capabilities and re-organise their ranks in a way that poses a direct threat to the gains attained through international cooperation in the war on terrorism. As governments, we must represent the best model for our peoples in strengthening the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the face of escalating attempts to spread hate speech around the world. Given our shared destiny, we must recognise the necessity of forging joint action and harnessing all our capabilities to develop comprehensive solutions to current challenges, which are not confined to a specific country or region. There is no clearer example of this than the consequences of climate change. Many peoples of the world are exposed to devastating floods, heat waves, and droughts, all of which intensify humanitarian crises and security threats, especially in regions most vulnerable to climate change. The fate of our planet is at stake, compelling us to build partnerships and promote joint action while bolstering our commitment to supporting climate action by promoting renewable energy, proper financing, and assisting developing countries in enhancing resilience. Investing in renewable energy means investing in economic resources, international peace and security, and the future of coming generations. In this regard, we must leverage opportunities to forge practical, logical, and thoughtful solutions to the climate crisis. The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UNFCCC, which will be held in the Arab Republic of Egypt in November, is a prime opportunity in this regard. As we urge all Member States to actively participate in this session, the UAE is preparing to host COP28 next year. We are working to build partnerships, ensure inclusiveness, and focus on areas that will achieve meaningful outcomes. The focus on climate action will also alleviate the global food crisis. In this regard, the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate/AIM4C) that the UAE has launched jointly with the US seeks to improve food production and reduce global hunger. At the same time, we must intensify food assistance and ensure global food supplies while searching for practical ways to secure supply chains against the backdrop of current geopolitical unrest. Despite the seriousness of current challenges and the importance of addressing them, we must not lose sight of the need to anticipate the future and strengthen stability and prosperity. As such, the UAE is building a diversified knowledge-based economy guided by scientific and technological progress that allows peaceful and secure, stable communities to thrive. Now that two years have passed since the signing of the Abraham Accords, as well as other initiatives launched this year to enhance regional cooperation, development, and economic growth, we are witnessing notable progress in the Middle East that forms the basis of joint cooperation to address global challenges. Moreover, we believe that youth are the best engine to drive these efforts. In the face of crises, they have proven their ability to withstand challenges and innovate, including by working with their peers around the world to identify sustainable solutions to global issues. Therefore, we will continue to invest in their capabilities as future leaders. We also believe in the full participation of women in efforts to achieve social development and ensure their current and future stability. In conclusion, the UAE affirms that it will continue to forge ahead with its efforts at the humanitarian, diplomatic, and developmental levels to support peoples affected by crises and disasters, regardless of religious, ethnic, political, or cultural considerations. We will continue to work with our partners to build capacity among governments and peoples in various fields to serve the greater good of humanity. This is our path that will remain a beacon of hope and inspiration for our efforts in the international fora in which the UAE participates. Thank you, Mr. President." \</doc>

Saad Toma, General Manager, IBM Middle East & Africa, believes its new IBM Impact Framework has the ability to create a more sustainable, equitable and ethical future for society. In an exclusive interview with CNME, Toma spoke about their IBM SkillsBuild program, their decision to expand their offices in the UAE, its partnership with MBZUAI \- and its sustainability mission. We know that a major challenge facing IT companies globally is a shortage in terms of talent with many businesses struggling to acquire or find the right people needed to harness the power of disruptive new technologies that are required to thrive and survive in our new 'experience economy'. However, can you tell us more about how IBM is trying to resolve this issue with their IBM SkillsBuild program \- and broadly speaking what will this initiative entail? One of IBM's priorities in the region is empowering youth with the right new skills and preparing them for the way those technologies will shape the nature of work. Organizations will have to change their culture, processes, systems and applications, design different business models, and reskill the workforce to align with developing trends and stay in the game. We have made key investments to achieve this through our global commitment to provide 30 million people of all ages with new skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow by 2030. We have developed a clear roadmap with more than 170 new academic and industry partnerships to help us realize this mission. The commitment will also see us leverage IBM's existing programs and career-building platforms to expand access to education and in-demand technical roles. Moreover, our IBM SkillsBuild platform is a free, digital training program aimed at students, educators, and job seekers offering access to learning courses, resources, and support focused on reskilling or upskilling learning on core technology and workplace skills needed to succeed in the jobs of tomorrow. In the MEA region, we have been collaborating with universities extensively by providing access to educational resources made available by the platform. One of our latest efforts in this regard is the recently announced collaboration with Mohamed Bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) to advance AI research. We are also collaborating with Egypt's Ministry of Communications and IT to leverage SkillsBuild as part of their Digital Egypt Club Initiative to develop the skills of the Egyptian youth. Moreover, we have been focusing significant efforts on a variety of initiatives to develop the skills of Saudi youth. IBM has enjoyed a strong fiscal performance globally over the last two quarters, and that has resulted in the company investing in talent and office space. Can you tell us more about your expansion plans? Do you believe in a bid to retain strong 'company culture' that IBM needs to have people back in the office? At IBM, developing and maintaining a thriving company culture has always been part of our DNA. This is what primarily influenced our decision to invest and redesign our office space to provide more opportunities for cross-team collaborations, while enabling effective team and relationship-building between colleagues, partners, and clients. Throughout its history, IBM has made significant investments in the Middle East and Africa region. IBM is seen today as a strategic partner for governments and businesses on nationwide initiatives to integrate technologies that enhance citizen and government experiences in line with national agendas and leadership visions. Our strategy is taking hold with clients and partners, and our first quarter results are a solid foundation to build on this year. We are also investing in new working models for future talent. An example of this is our newly launched Client Engineering teams in the MEA region that empower co-creation and co-execution and work with local clients to fast-track new ideas in a matter of weeks, instead of months. Can you tell our readers more about the significance of your recent partnership with MBZUAI \- and IBM's commitment to the local talent ecosystem across the Gulf region, and how important is it that the UAE fosters a strong startup environment? Our collaboration with MBZUAI will see us bringing together some of the best minds from industry and academia to create, validate, and incubate solutions that use AI. Through targeted training and projects with the university, our researchers will work with MBZUAI faculty and students to develop solutions that advance AI development and accelerate the types of scientific breakthroughs that could unlock the potential of AI to help solve some of humanity's greatest challenges such as furthering the region's climate and sustainability goals, accelerating discoveries in healthcare, and much more. Meanwhile, the UAE government is investing substantially in the start-up ecosystem in the country. This ecosystem represents significant job creation potential and is already a significant factor in reducing the country's economic dependence on oil revenues. With the nation fully embracing the potential of digitization, we at IBM are committed to partnerships like those with MBZUAI and new approaches like Client Engineering to support tech startups in the region. Sustainability is a journey, and many have already committed to change. A University of Oxford analysis released in October 2021 found that\~a fifth of the 2,000 largest publicly listed companies\~in the world have committed to a net-zero strategy. Despite the many challenges in the world today, CEOs aren't taking their foot off the gas when it comes to sustainability, and more now rank it among their top priorities. According to a recent IBV study, more than half (52%) of CEOs in MEA regard increasing sustainability as one of the highest priorities for their organization in the next two to three years. In 2021, we at IBM announced a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 across all the countries in which we operate. Our commitment to the environment is evident in our products, including the new IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, which combines weather, climate, and operational data to measure and manage environmental performance.\~Last year we also partnered up with Amazon Web Services to help the oil & gas industry accelerate their energy transition. Can you provide us with a broader understanding of the new IBM Impact framework, and what are the key goals and objectives of this new initiative? Absolutely. IBM Impact is essentially a new framework we developed for our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) work. It reflects how we aspire to create a more sustainable, equitable, and ethical future. The framework comprises three pillars: Environmental Impact, Equitable Impact, and Ethical Impact. Behind these pillars, trust, transparency, and ethical leadership underpin our commitment to making a positive impact through our operations. Let's look at Environmental Impact as just one example. This single concept encompasses conserving natural resources, reducing pollution, and minimizing climate-related risks. It revolves around a goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. But we know we can't do all of this alone, which is why we are inviting our partners and customers in the MEA region and globally to join us in this journey. Especially as the Middle East plays host to COP 27 and COP 28, we feel frameworks like IBM Impact can serve as a north star for how organizations can make a lasting, positive impact. \</doc>

By Thomas Pinn Some of the lies we tell children to finish their plates run the gamut from "carrots make you see better" and "bananas make you smart" to "spinach makes you strong". However, are we as adults much better than our children that we love to bemoan as the pinnacle of food waste? Sadly not, as worldwide it is estimated by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization that 30% of the world's food never even reaches a plate, and yet somehow 828 million people, or 9.8 percent of the world's population, suffer from hunger, and 29.3% of the world's population are classed as moderately or severely food insecure. With an increase of 150 million people suffering from hunger since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem of world hunger is getting worse and the UN's hopes of abolishing world hunger by 2030 are becoming ever more distant, yet food waste had never been so high. Egypt, unfortunately, is no stranger to food waste with around 73 kilograms of food waste person, according to a 2018 study by the Barilla Center for Food and Nutrition. While this ranks Egypt as being in the unenviable situation of being the world's 16th worst waster of food, it pales in comparison to Saudi Arabia, which topped the list, and is behind other nations in the region like the United Arab Emirates and Palestine. At an incredible 427 kilograms of food waste per person annually, the rate of food waste in Saudi Arabia towers over Indonesia in second place with 300 kilograms, the US in third place with 277 kilograms, followed by Australia and the United Kingdom with 180 and 13.5 kilograms, respectively. However, while the rate of food waste in Saudi Arabia makes sense due to the nation's immense wealth and absolute reliance on imports, Egypt is framed very differently because of its large agricultural sector and proportion of the population below or around the poverty line that need much of this food that is being wasted. The 2021 Global Hunger Index ranked Egypt as having a moderate level of hunger with 5.5% of the total population suffering from undernourishment and 22.2% of children under the age of five having experienced stunted growth. Concerningly, even though Egypt's GDP between 2000 and 2021 increased from 99.84 billion to a staggering 404.14 billion, in the same period Egypt's rate of undernourishment actually increased from 5.2% to 5.5%. However, despite many Egyptians facing a lack of food, the country still ranks as one of the world's worst wasters of food. In 2022, the FAO released a statement detailing how about 50% of all fruit and vegetables in Egypt are wasted, along with 40% of fish and 30% of both milk and wheat. Seeing a link between food security and food waste, the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation and the Egyptian government have increasingly been focussing on the issue with the collaboration of government ministries, international and local NGOs, and the private sector. But why are there are empty plates and food left to rot in Egypt and what is behind this modern paradox? Unfortunately, there is no one simple answer to the question, nor is their one magic bullet solution to solve it all, but there are many things that can be done and that Egypt has been embarking upon in recent years. In 2018, the Egyptian Food Bank teamed up with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation and Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation to launch a food waste awareness campaign. Kicking off during Ramadan in 2018, a period ironically notorious for food waste in this period of fasting, the campaign featured celebrities giving their tips and tricks to avoid food waste. More recently, the Egyptian Food Bank also collaborated with the social media platform TikTok to run the #CookForGood initiative, which featured chefs and celebrities encouraging people in the Arab world to reuse leftovers and reduce food waste. The need to reduce food waste has taken on increasing importance for the Egyptian government in the face of COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and consumer inflation now standing at 15%. As food becomes more expensive and the country's potentially dangerous reliance on imports has been steadily revealed, one way to both reduce the cost of food and make Egypt less reliant on food imports is by reducing domestically produced food waste. Projections in regards to the ways in which climate change could have adverse and severe effects on food production have also played a part in pushing the government to take concrete action to bolster up food security. Likewise, Egypt's mounting water scarcity issues is also connected to food waste. Considering that Egypt has an annual water deficit of 7 billion cubic metres and the situation may become more desperate with the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and threat of climate change, reducing food waste means that less water will be needed to grow crops that may end up being thrown away. As an indication of the parliament's increasing awareness of the importance of the issue of food waste to both food security and food poverty, the Egyptian House of Representatives have been assessing a proposed law to regulate food waste. Presented by law maker Amira Saber, the proposed law imposes both incentives and fines for businesses and restaurants to encourage the redistribution of excess edible food and discourage food waste, respectively. Ranging from 100,000 to 500,000 EGP, these fines certainly indicate the importance that some lawmakers give to the issue of food waste; however, whether the bill passes and how it's amended is still yet to be decided. Unlike in nature where food rots away slowly on or near to the surface of the soil, in large rubbish dumps where organic waste undergoes a very different decomposition process, it produces methane, which is approximately 30 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide. To tackle this problem and also aid farmers in producing crops at greater rates, at lower cost, and without the need for chemical fertilisers, various organisations have popped up in Egypt that create compost from food waste. ECARU now process an impressive 500,000 tonnes of biomass a year and use it for compost and even animal feed and biofuels. Another pioneering company turning food waste into compost is Baramoda, which after beginning as a small start-up in Qena with already ambitious goals of producing 500 tonnes of compost annually, in a matter of months upped their production goals twenty-fold to 10,000 tonnes. Claiming that composting uses 30% less water, saves 20% of agricultural costs, and increases productivity by 15%, Baramoda reported how the organic alternative to chemical fertilisers soon become incredibly popular and sought after by farmers in the area. Read More: M ko: The Rich Journey Of The Egyptian Homegrown Artisanal Chocolatier As a more sustainable alternative to Talabat and elmenus that offers food at half the price of its competitors, Tekeya is a food delivery app that sells perfectly good excess food from restaurants. With the option to order a meal at 50% of its original price and the opportunity to buy a meal to then donate to a charity, Tekeya has understandably received a lot of media attention with its creative solution to both food waste and food poverty. Tekeya co-founder Menna Shahin told Reuters in an interview that, "The idea of the Tekeya Application is based on the idea of a triple win. When users order via Tekeya, they save money, 50 percent. Providers or restaurants who advertise on Tekeya make more profits. Charities on Tekeya get free meals. The idea is that we brought all these people together to contribute to reducing environmental pollution. With Tekeya, it's not me who reduces pollution, we created an entire community that reduces pollution with one click." Also, in 2018, a brother and sister duo, Farah and Omar Emara founded FreshSource, a tech start-up aimed at improving the efficiency and logistics of getting fresh produce from Egyptian farmers to businesses. Considering that a great amount of food is wasted due to improper transportation or simply that by the time a seller has been found, much of the food has gone off, linking farmers with businesses more directly and using data and technology can play an important role in both reducing food waste and putting more money in the pockets of Egyptian farmers. The Egyptian Food Bank now serves 12 million people across Egypt and has been a regional leader in showing the way forward in reducing food waste and tackling food poverty. Numerous restaurants, factories, and supermarkets have long-standing agreements with the Egyptian Food Bank to donate food nearing its sell by date and have made a significant impact in tackling food waste and feeding the hungry. The upcoming COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh also decided to get in on the action as the Egyptian Social Solidarity Ministry recently announced that a charity would be packaging up and distributing untouched food from the conference to the nation's poor. For many years, hotels have also been persuaded to reduce food waste by donating excess food. After the Egyptian Food Bank began the initiative with the Egyptian Hotels Association in 2006, hundreds of millions of meals have been donated, with an impressive 15.5 million meals in 2014 alone. Researchers at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University told CNBC that some of the reasons for food waste include "out-dated or bad agricultural practices, poor roads and infrastructure, including the lack of cold storage and refrigerated trucks". Mirroring this attention given to the infrastructure and processes related to production and distribution, as opposed to consumption, the Food and Agricultural Organization has partnered up with the Egyptian government to improve both how the farmers grow their crops and how it is then distributed. According to the FAO, "The project aims to reduce food loss and waste through a value chain development approach, focusing on the post-harvest, marketing and processing stages and promoting value chains that are better organized, have a reduced impact on the environment, more inclusive of smallholders, better able to generate added value, providing increased opportunities for rural off-farm and/or agro-industry employment". Throughout numerous interviews with Egyptian farmers by NGOs and the press, a common complaint raised is that prices often fall so low that it would actually cost them more to pick their produce than to let it rot. The nature of tomato and grape production lends itself to great fluctuations in crop and price, often leaving farmers short-changed, which gives little incentive to farmers to reduce food waste when it is actually financially harmful for them to do so. One way this has been addressed by the FAO working in collaboration with the government is through the creation of several sun drying facilities throughout the country. By selling their crops to these facilities, the farmers are able to make a profit and reduce food waste, while the facilities open up employment opportunities to local people, and the dried crops can then be sold later on in the year when the crop is out of season, providing more reliable year-round food security. With important and seasonally abundant crops in Egypt like tomatoes, grapes, and others being perfect candidates for sun drying, the FAO hopes that this project will help achieve both food security and the reduction of food waste.

The latest findings from KPMG reveal that sustainability reporting has grown steadily, with 79 percent of leading global companies providing sustainability reports In Singapore, sustainability reporting rate grew by 19 percent to 100 percent in 2022, up from 81 percent in 2020 for the country's top 100 companies. There has been marked improvements in companies reporting carbon reduction targets, but action remains too slow in key related areas, with less than half of companies currently recognising biodiversity loss as a risk Among the thousands of reports analysed, less than half of the world's largest companies are providing reporting on 'social' and 'governance' components of ESG SINGAPORE \- Media OutReach \- 18 October 2022 \- Singapore's top 100 companies[1] have outperformed the global average in sustainability reporting for six out of 12 indicators (see Table 1) in KPMG's 2022 Survey of Sustainability Reporting which surveys the largest 100 companies (termed as 'N100') in each of 58 countries or jurisdictions every two years, or 5,800 companies in total. These Singapore companies have also increased their sustainability reporting rate to 100 percent in 2022, up 19 percent compared to 2020 \- higher than the 2022 global average which is 79 percent. The Asia Pacific region leads with 89 percent of its companies undertaking sustainability reporting. This is followed by Europe (82 percent), the Americas (74 percent) and the Middle East and Africa (56 percent). Regional variations were observed in the contents of sustainability reporting, largely driven by top-of-mind concerns and regulatory differences. While North America (97 percent) and Western Europe (85 percent) emerged with the highest overall reporting rates, the Middle East (55 percent) and Asia Pacific region (30 percent) stand out on integrated reporting. Meanwhile, Latin America (50 percent) stands out on biodiversity reporting and Africa stands out on social and governance reporting (51 percent and 49 percent, respectively). Globally, there has been a steady and consistent increase in reporting from the N100. Ten years ago, around two-thirds of the N100 group of companies provided sustainability reports and the figure now stands at 79 percent. Meanwhile, the world's top 250 companies \- known as the G250 (the G250 sample comprises the top 250 companies by revenue based on the 2021 Fortune 500 ranking) \- are almost all providing some form of sustainability reporting, with 96 percent of this group reporting on sustainability or ESG matters. However, the findings reveal that there is still a disconnect between the urgency of addressing climate change and social equity, and the 'hard results' provided by businesses. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) remains the most dominant standard used around the world. Singapore is a leader in the uptake with 100 percent of its N100 companies reporting against GRI standards and 85 percent reporting against Singapore stock exchange guidelines. Specifically, Singapore companies have scored better than the global average for material topics identified, reporting of carbon reduction targets, the inclusion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) information in their annual reports, acknowledging climate change as a financial risk to business, and in terms of governance when it came to appointing a member of the board or leadership team to be responsible for sustainability as well as including sustainability within compensation. Cherine Fok, Partner, KPMG ESG, KPMG in Singapore said, "In this latest report, Singapore takes the lead for sustainability reporting globally. This is an encouraging indicator of progress and reflects the country's determination to consistently deliver on earlier climate commitments. Recent moves by the regulators to further refine and enforce reporting requirements were decisive, steering companies towards the adoption of best practice disclosures backed by strategic business planning and operational transformation. The regulations were complemented simultaneously by widespread capacity building efforts, and the introduction of a comprehensive series of initiatives that extended support to businesses as they grapple with the challenges pose by the net zero transition. These initiatives include revisions to carbon tax rates to better consider the gravity of the issue, new green policies and incentives to drive commercially scalable solutions and technology adoption that facilitated measurement, reporting and verification of sustainability disclosures. With the groundwork being laid, we can look forward to a deepening in the next phases of sustainability reporting, with more focus placed on complex aspects such as climate impact modelling, analysis of the socio-economic impacts arising from climate change, and a clearer link between sustainability performance and enterprise value."

Only 64 percent of G250 companies formally acknowledge that climate change is a risk to their business, and less than half of companies currently recognise biodiversity loss as a risk. Sustainability reporting through the ESG lens ESG disclosures continue to be overwhelmingly narrative-driven, rather than publishing quantitative or financial data regarding impacts. This is clearly an area of improvement for companies around the world. On a positive note, around three-quarters of reporting companies conducted materiality assessments and are disclosing material topics. John McCalla-Leacy, KPMG's Global Head of ESG, said: "Last year, scientists from the IPCC warned the world was on 'Code Red' for human driven global warming. It was followed by a number of commitments from political leaders at COP26. As we head towards COP27 , immediate action is now needed to avert human and environmental tragedies on an ever-increasing scale. "KPMG's 2022 Survey of Sustainability Reporting reveals regulation is making a difference. My view is that it is critical to provide guidance and direction to companies and help drive cultural change. Business leaders have accepted they have a responsibility and role to play in helping to slow and potentially avert the unfolding crisis. What's needed more than ever is globally consistent standards from governments and a collective effort from the world's major companies to report on all aspects of ESG, recognizing the clear links between the environment and wider social equality issues." Jennifer Shulman, report co-author and Global Lead for KPMG's Global ESG Advisory Hub, commented: "The COP26 summit offered the world a human face to the unfolding climate tragedy facing the planet. Representatives from some of the world's most remote and heavily impacted nations and territories were present to share their story. But, despite that growing recognition of the human side of ESG, our latest survey continues to highlight a real challenge facing the C Suite \- which is in how they demonstrate and reflect on their company's wider societal impact. "We should start to see some progress over the coming year as organizations like the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) roll out new global standards for reporting. But, companies shouldn't wait to be told. Leadership from the top is essential. The global pandemic and COP26 shone a light on the growing inequalities in society. Many major organizations are responding with proactive action that should be applauded. We're seeing far greater action on gender equality, pay equity and community impact assessments. It's time for organizations to be transparent in their reporting to highlight what they've achieved and hold themselves to account on areas where further progress is required." A call to action New ESG requirements are driving a different perspective and set of conversations in Boardrooms, driving business leaders to stretch their thinking and ensure that from the top down they are making strategic decisions that take climate and broader ESG considerations more into account. The KPMG report outlines the tangible ways businesses can invest in sustainability reporting: Understanding stakeholder expectations Incorporating materiality assessments into reporting Aligning reporting to mandatory or voluntary frameworks Investing in quality non-financial data management Understanding the impact of climate change and social issues on business The pressure on businesses to report on non-financial metrics is only expected to grow as regulations evolve. By acting now, companies can make informed choices to drive the change that is much needed to be a good corporate citizen in today's world.

About KPMG's Survey of Sustainability Reporting First published in 1993, this 2022 survey marks the twelfth edition, examining sustainability reporting trends around the world. Over the past two decades, sustainability reporting has been largely voluntary, so the purpose of this survey was to offer meaningful insights about how to improve levels of disclosure by business leaders, sustainability professionals, and company boards. Today, we are on the precipice of adopting mandatory and regulated sustainability reporting and the reporting landscape is poised to change drastically. The findings in this report reflect on the current state of reporting today, the gaps that should be filled to meet regulatory requirements and the overarching business strategy considerations that can allow companies to meet increasing regulatory expectations while still creating impact and generating value.

JEDDAH, 16th July, 2022 (WAM) -- The final statement of the "Jeddah Security and Development Summit", including the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Member States, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and the United States (US), has been issued, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. The final statement is as follows: "At the invitation of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Member States, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Republic of Iraq, and the United States of America held a joint summit in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 16th July, 2022, to underscore the historic partnership among their countries and to deepen their countries' joint cooperation in all fields. The leaders welcomed President Biden reiterating the importance the United States places on its decades-long strategic partnerships in the Middle East, affirming the United States' enduring commitment to the security and territorial defence of U.S. partners, and recognising the region's central role in connecting the Indo-Pacific to Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The leaders affirmed their joint vision towards a peaceful and prosperous region, stressing the importance of taking all necessary measures to preserve the region's security and stability, developing joint areas of cooperation and integration, collectively confronting common threats, and abiding by the principles of good neighborliness, mutual respect, and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. President Biden reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive Middle East peace. The leaders emphasised the need to bring about a just resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict on the basis of two-state solution, noting the importance of the Arab Initiative. They stressed the need to stop all unilateral measures that undermine the two-state solution, to preserve the historical status quo in Jerusalem and its holy sites, emphasising the crucial role of the Hashemite Custodianship in that regard. The leaders also stressed the importance of supporting the Palestinian economy and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). President Biden commended the important roles played by Jordan and Egypt, and the members of the GCC, and their support for the Palestinian people and institutions. The leaders renewed their commitment to enhance regional cooperation and integration, and build joint projects between their countries to achieve sustainable development and collectively address the climate challenge through accelerating climate ambition, supporting innovation and partnerships, including the Circular Carbon Economy Framework, and developing renewable sources of energy. In this context, the leaders commended the finalisation of the agreements to connect electrical grids between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, between the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iraq, and between Saudi Arabia and Jordan and Egypt, as well as connecting the electrical grids between Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq. The leaders commended the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative announced by the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. The leaders expressed their hope for positive contributions by all countries towards a successful COP 27 hosted by the Arab Republic of Egypt, COP28 which will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates, and the International Horticultural Expo 2023 to be hosted by the State of Qatar titled "Green Desert, Better Environment 2023-2024." The leaders affirmed the importance of achieving energy security and stabilising energy markets, while working on increasing investments in technologies and projects that aim to lower emissions and remove carbon, consistent with their national commitments. The leaders also noted the efforts by OPEC + that aim to stabilise oil markets in a manner that serves the interests of consumers and producers and supports economic growth, welcomed the decision by OPEC+ to increase production for the months of July and August, and commended Saudi Arabia for its leading role in achieving consensus among the members of OPEC+. The leaders renewed their support to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and the objective of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region. The leaders also renewed their call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and with countries in the region to keep the Arab Gulf region free from weapons of mass destruction, and to preserve security and stability regionally and globally. The leaders renewed their condemnation in the strongest terms of terrorism in all its forms and affirmed their commitment to strengthening regional and international efforts aimed at confronting terrorism and violent extremism, preventing the financing, arming, and recruitment of terrorist groups by all individuals and entities, and to confronting all activities that threaten regional security and stability. The leaders condemned, in the strongest terms, the terrorist acts impacting civilians, civilian infrastructure, and energy installations in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and commercial ships navigating critical international trade routes, in the Strait of Hormuz and Bab al Mandab, and affirmed the need to adhere to relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, including UNSCR 2624. The leaders expressed their full support for Iraq's sovereignty, security, and stability, its development and prosperity, and all of its efforts to combat terrorism. The leaders also welcomed Iraq's positive role in facilitating diplomacy and confidence-building among countries in the region. The leaders welcomed the truce in Yemen, as well as the establishment of the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) in Yemen, expressing their hope to achieve a political solution in line with the references of the GCC initiative, its implementation mechanism, the outcomes of the Yemeni comprehensive national dialogue, and UN Security Council resolutions, including UNSCR 2216. The leaders called on the Yemeni parties to seize this opportunity and engage immediately in direct negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations. The leaders also affirmed the importance of continuing to support the humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people, as well as provide economic and developmental support, while ensuring it reaches all areas of Yemen. The leaders stressed the need to intensify efforts to reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis, in a manner that preserves Syria's unity and sovereignty, and meets the aspirations of its people, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. The leaders stressed the importance of providing the necessary support to Syrian refugees and to the countries hosting them, and for humanitarian aid to reach all regions of Syria.

They noted recently-conducted parliamentary elections, enabled by the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and Internal Security Forces (ISF). With a view to upcoming presidential elections, they called on all Lebanese parties to respect the constitution and carry out the process in a timely manner. The leaders praised the efforts made by friends and partners of Lebanon that have renewed and strengthened the confidence and cooperation between Lebanon and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and that have supported the LAF and ISF in their efforts to maintain security in the country.

The leaders welcomed all friends of Lebanon to join this effort to ensure the safety and stability of Lebanon. The leaders emphasised the importance of the control of the government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory, including with reference to fulfilling the provisions of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the Taif Accord, and for it to exercise full sovereignty, so there will be no weapons without the consent of the government of Lebanon or authority other than that of the government of Lebanon. The leaders renewed their support for efforts to resolve the Libyan crisis in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions, including Resolutions 2570 and 2571, the need to hold presidential and parliamentary elections, in tandem, as soon as possible, and the departure of all foreign forces and mercenaries without delay.

<doc ID="COP27_UAE400" COP="COP27" country="UAE" date="December 6, 2022 Tuesday 6:30 AM EST"source="UAE Government News" >
Speech on the UAE's foreign policy delivered by H.E. Dr Anwar Gargash at the 2022 Abu Dhabi Strategic Debate: "The UAE has viewed the tragic situation in Ukraine from a principled position, aligned with international law, especially with regards to respect for national sovereignty. At the same time, we know that only a political agreement will resolve this conflict, so we have tried to help keep the door open for dialogue.It is vital, as we navigate our way through these turbulent times in global politics, that all countries take a measured approach, abide by international law, and invest seriously in seeking diplomatic solutions to political crises." Original Press Release: Dec. 6 -- Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Cooperation, Government of UAE issued the following news release: Excellencies, Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak with you today. I congratulate Dr Ebtesam Al Ketbi and the Emirates Policy Center for the continued success of this flagship event, but also for the interesting work produced by her think tank all year around. I would also like to take a moment to reflect on the passing earlier this year of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, may God rest his soul in peace. He led this nation through times of great change in the region and the wider world and despite all the turbulence around us, he succeeded in steering the UAE down a path of continuity, stability, prosperity and tolerance. The people of this country, and I personally, will always be grateful for his leadership.  Ladies and Gentlemen, It is hard to believe this is already the ninth time I have spoken at this conference. It would be impossible to try to sum up the extraordinary achievements of the UAE over the period since I gave my first speech in 2014, but there is certainly plenty that I would never have imagined back then. Sending the first Emirati mission into space, hosting the World Expo, welcoming the Catholic Pope to the Arabian Peninsula for the first time, agreeing the Abrahamic Accords, being chosen to host COP28, and the UAE's very robust but compassionate response to the Covid-19 pandemic - these are just some examples of the way this country continues to surprise even those of us who call it home. What makes these accomplishments even more remarkable, is that they have been achieved against a very difficult international backdrop. And sadly, this year has seen new and yet all-too-familiar challenges in that regard. At the global level, the war in Ukraine, the deepening polarization between great powers, and the tendency towards a binary 'us and them' approach to international relations, shows that while much has changed, much has stayed the same. The UAE has viewed the tragic situation in Ukraine from a principled position, aligned with international law, especially with regards to respect for national sovereignty. At the same time, we know that only a political agreement will resolve this conflict, so we have tried to help keep the door open for dialogue. It is vital, as we navigate our way through these turbulent times in global politics, that all countries take a measured approach, abide by international law, and invest seriously in seeking diplomatic solutions to political crises. If we fail to do this, the fallout will be devastating, and it will not be contained to one or two countries; it will affect all of us. The UAE is at the forefront of adopting this approach. In recent years we have stepped up our focus on building bridges and strengthening economic and people-to-people ties with other countries in our region. This includes countries that we have serious political disagreements with. By doing this, we hope to build platforms for dialogue and progress on more difficult issues. And we have been taking a similar approach with our seat on the UN Security Council. We have promoted dialogue on issues where members disagree, encouraged cooperation in areas where members have shared interests, and when necessary, taken a firm stand to reinforce the principles of the UN Charter. So, with this context in mind, I would like to focus my remarks today on what the UAE's approach to foreign policy will be under the leadership of the President, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Our foreign policy will be guided by eight core principles. The first is that the primary goal of our foreign policy must be to promote the prosperity and security of the UAE through an approach that blends our national values and our national interests. In my experience, our values and interests are usually mutually reinforcing. For example, promoting women's rights and tolerance, or providing humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable, help to create both a more prosperous and a more stable region. So, the more we can do to promote these values across the region, the better it will be for our security and our prosperity. It is also the UAE's values that are part of the motivation for people from around the world to choose to live, work and invest here, thereby boosting our prosperity. And it is why other countries choose to partner with us on various initiatives. They understand that the UAE is a progressive, open and tolerant oasis in a challenging region. And Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed is clear that both our values and our interests dictate that we should work in collaboration with countries around the world on shared challenges, like climate change, disease elimination, or water and food security, as well as on multilateral projects that connect the economies of this region and that will ensure shared prosperity for the region's people. However, as a medium-sized power, we also need to be pragmatic: for the sake of dialogue and progress, we sometimes need to engage with people we find distasteful; we will often choose quiet diplomacy over outspoken criticism; and we will occasionally have to make difficult compromises on certain files in order to advance cooperation on other important issues. The second principle is that our foreign policy must be resolutely focused on supporting our long-term economic prosperity. It is truly a remarkable achievement that the UAE's GDP is now heading towards half a trillion dollars. But now is not the time to rest on our laurels. At the heart of the UAE's Centennial Plan for 2071 is a commitment to build a diversified knowledge economy. For this, we need to open markets for both outward and inward trade and investment. And we need to make ourselves ever-more attractive as a destination for global talent and capital. Our foreign policy has a vital role to play in this. Through our bilateral relations, our diplomats can negotiate economic agreements that give our airlines, our businesses and our citizens access to other countries, and help UAE investors to navigate their way in new markets. Emirati diplomats can also raise awareness among foreign investors of the opportunities for investment in the UAE, especially in sectors where this will help us to develop our knowledge economy. We must also reinforce the UAE's soft power, which helps to make it the destination of choice in the region for entrepreneurs, businesses, and investors. And as we look to the future, we will continue to strengthen our relations with the leading economies of tomorrow - from Indonesia to Nigeria, and from Vietnam to Mexico. We must also ensure that in an increasingly multipolar world, and with rising tensions between great powers, we do not allow a rise in economic protectionism. The UAE will always champion an open global trading system. Everyone will end up worse off if we close international markets. The UAE knows better than most that security and political concerns between countries can sometimes make bilateral relations difficult. But economic ties can exist separately from those concerns. This also applies to the international trade in food. We saw during the pandemic how important it is to diversify our sources of food imports and how our diplomatic relations with key food-producing countries helped to maintain open supplies of key staples. It will be an ongoing priority for the UAE's foreign policy to promote our food security. The third principle is that we must invest in our country's security and autonomy through a multilayered approach. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed understands that we are more secure because we do not rely on just one pillar for our security. A central pillar of our approach is to have an effective defense capability of our own. We are proud of the professionalism and caliber of our military. We have witnessed how important it has been on various occasions, including when terrorists attacked our country earlier this year. But for us to develop this capacity for self-defense, we also need security partners who can help us develop the right capabilities. On top of this, we need to maintain cooperation with countries in the Gulf and the wider region through sustained diplomatic efforts that are targeted at promoting regional stability and security. Beyond this regional layer, we look to partner with world powers that can play a constructive role, both in providing direct security support for the UAE but also in working together to promote regional stability and contain threats. Our primary strategic security relationship remains unequivocally with the United States. This partnership of two sovereign nations has been close and mutually beneficial for decades, and we continue to value it greatly. Yet it is vital that we find a way to ensure that we can rely on this relationship for decades to come, through clear, codified and unambivalent commitments. We also welcome constructive and collaborative engagement from other world powers on promoting security and stability in the region. This multi-layered approach is not only key to our national security but by avoiding complete dependence on just one or two other countries, it also ensures we retain our autonomy as a sovereign nation. But the success of this approach depends on maintaining a diversity of strategic relationships, so that places foreign policy and diplomacy at the heart of our approach to national security. It also requires that we sustain this diplomatic collaboration by building economic relationships with all countries in the world, whether large or small. The fourth principle is that we must maintain balanced and diversified strategic and economic relations in the evolving world order. We know that over the coming decades we will increasingly live in a multi-polar world, but it is not in our interest for that to become an increasingly divided world. We are convinced that we are better off in an open international order, built on independent sovereign nations, with an open trading system, in which we retain the ability to work together to tackle shared global challenges. The UAE has no interest in 'choosing sides' between great powers. Indeed, it is a central principle for Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed that we will not under any circumstances sacrifice our sovereignty to another country. And we will play our modest part in facilitating the evolution of a peaceful and cooperative world order. This includes supporting constructive approaches to the evolution of global institutions, to strengthen both their legitimacy and effectiveness. It also means working diligently to serve as a conduit for greater cooperation between East and West on issues of mutual interest, ranging from tackling climate change to combating extremism. The fifth principle is that we should seek to support and strengthen the voice of moderation in this region. So many of the region's challenges will be easier to resolve if we can tackle the closed-minded, reactionary, extremist ideas that still influence too many people and societies in the region. We must promote a culture of tolerance, openness and women's empowerment. One that welcomes modernity and rationality; that does not see them as in opposition to Islam but as very much aligned with Muslim values. The UAE will remain resolutely opposed to extremist ideologies and to those who use violence to achieve their political goals. And we will promote alternative visions of society in this region - not least through our own example. The Abrahamic Family House will soon open in Abu Dhabi, in which a mosque, a church and a synagogue will stand side by side. A physical manifestation of our spirit of tolerance, if ever there was one. And we will continue to strengthen our cooperation with countries in the region that are not driven by ideological perspectives, but that instead pursue pragmatic reform agendas and are committed to policies designed to promote stability and sustainable development across the region. The sixth principle is that we will seek to deescalate conflicts and tensions in the region and beyond, by supporting political resolutions. This region has suffered for too long from conflicts and disputes, both within and between states. It has led to insecurity, humanitarian catastrophe, and economic devastation, and to a near-constant sense of troubleshooting in foreign policy. We absolutely must find a way to deescalate these tensions and instead focus our collective attention on meeting the needs and aspirations of the people of this region. I am not nave. I know from painful experience that we cannot simply wish these tensions away. The divisions are often real and deep-seated. And sometimes there are too many parties who have a self-interest in perpetuating the status quo, however harmful that is to their fellow citizens. Nevertheless, wherever possible we will choose dialogue over division. We will deal diplomatically with all parties, and we will seek to forge areas of consensus. We will also offer our hand of friendship to help others to resolve their disputes. Our country has a long tradition of facilitating the resolution of disputes between countries, dating back to the late Sheikh Zayed. Indeed, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed has shown on various occasions that when he sees an opportunity, he is ready to take calculated risks to pursue visionary peace initiatives and open up diplomatic avenues. These stretch targets are an important element in understanding UAE foreign policy under his leadership, and will continue to guide what I see as an innovative and daring approach to diplomacy. So, through the close and trusted relations that our leadership develops with other leaders and governments, we hope that on occasion we can make a contribution to easing tensions in the region and beyond. The seventh principle is that we should work hard to avoid power vacuums in the region. We have seen time and again over the last decade that these vacuums are magnets for instability. Extremists thrive in them, and states seek to exploit these lawless areas through proxies, which in turn causes others to act to prevent that happening, thus generating endless cycles of conflict. And we know from tragic experience that the greatest victims of vacuums are the ordinary people who live in them. But of course, preventing their emergence is easier said than done. Part of the long-term solution is to support better, more inclusive governance, and a stronger focus on meeting people's economic aspirations. There is no magic wand that can deliver this. But the UAE can do more to share our experience in governance and economic policy with other governments and we can strengthen economic relations to provide greater opportunity for people in other countries. We can also do more through multilateral and bilateral diplomacy to help prevent and calm emerging crises in the region. And where power vacuums do emerge, we need to move quickly to provide diplomatic support for rapid political resolution and consensus-based transitional arrangements that maintain stability. The final principle is that we should continue to increase our engagement with international organisations, to advance our strategic and economic position and address common challenges. There are a range of global challenges that risk undermining our security and prosperity and that we can only tackle through cooperation with the international community. The UAE is committed to work with every country in the world, large or small, both politically and economically, in order to build the international unity needed to tackle these priorities and to ensure that the regional voice on these issues is heard. We knew this already, but the Covid-19 pandemic drove home this message for all of us. Whether it is preventing pandemics, maintaining global financial stability, combating extremist ideologies, tackling pollution of the oceans, or addressing global food insecurity, they are all challenges that do not respect national borders. It is inevitable that our foreign policy must primarily serve the interests of the people of the UAE. But the people of the UAE have always cared about the wellbeing of others beyond our borders, so this compassion must be reflected in our foreign policy. And we know that through cooperation on shared challenges, everyone is better off. There can be no doubt that one of the most difficult, urgent and important challenges facing the world today is climate change. This is a prime example of an issue on which countries come to the table with different interests and perspectives, yet we are all affected by it, and we know we need to address the problem together. Failing to respect one another's point of view will not deliver solutions. Dialogue, innovation, collaboration, and a commitment to practical solutions must drive our efforts. I congratulate our Egyptian friends for the effective leadership they have been providing at COP27 over the last week. The UAE is honoured to be hosting COP28 next year and is committed to using the opportunity to accelerate global efforts to tackle climate change. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have learned through experience that foreign policy is not an exact science. The way these principles are applied will depend on the circumstances. But they are derived from our values and interests, as well as from our accumulated experience, and as such, they provide a useful guide to our approach. We are under no illusion that we are entering a period of calmer waters. The region and the world remain embroiled in conflict and dispute. But by applying a principled yet pragmatic approach to foreign policy, I am confident we will be able to navigate a calmer and more stable route forward for this great country of ours.

'Influence', the dictionary tells us, is defined as "the capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or behaviour of someone or something, or the effect itself". In recent years, Arabian Business has published our Arab Power List, which this year felt like it needed a reboot, an update for the more nuanced world we find ourselves in, especially post-Covid. So this year, we unveil our Most Influential Arabs 2022 edition, which showcases just some of the individuals across the Arab world who are making a difference in the world. This year too, we've endeavoured to return to our roots, our DNA, with more business figures than ever, and perhaps fewer celebrities featured - those that make the list are successful entrepreneurs and brands in their own right. Of course, it's important to state, that this isn't an exhaustive list, no edition could capture in one snapshot the entirety of inspirational and influential Arabs working hard to make their mark. For every individual featured there are countless others who could, and perhaps should, have been featured. Instead, this is a curated look at individuals who are influencing, either overtly or subtly, the region. There are public sector figures, there are CEOs, founders and presidents, educationalists and financiers, healthcare leaders and entrepreneurs. Some names will be familiar, others will be new, but we hope you find this snapshot informative and inspiring.

Al-Sowailim continues to lead the effort of corporate responsibility, looking to make a difference not only at EY, but as a decision-maker in the GCC corporate world. Could you share a short reaction to how your industry and business performed in 2021 - 2022? The industry has certainly bounced back since 2020; we are now beyond navigating challenges and have been pinpointing new opportunities across the MENA region, predominantly in the GCC. The consultancy market in particular, experienced a return to growth in 2021, with KSA and the UAE seeing the most activity. The need for advisory and transaction services grew across all industries, most notably in cybersecurity, TMT, and the public sector, as organisations looked to implement digital transformations while managing risk. With countries across the GCC slowly emerging from lockdown procedures at the end of 2020, the demand for strategy support in the entertainment and leisure sector increased in 2021. Governments helped ease the transition back to public engagements with events such as EXPO 2020 in the UAE and the Formula 1 race in KSA. Overall, there has been a noticeable shift in approach from short-term planning back to medium and long-term planning. We are still in the midst of 2022, but barring any global or regional shake-ups, it can be expected that the momentum will continue until the end of the year. What is your outlook for the industry and its clients for the year ahead? For our clients across consultancy, strategy and transactions, tax, and assurance, the focus will remain on accelerating digitisation and innovation as well as launching new transformation programs. In addition, as governments look to streamline their processes while also integrating global standards, we will see an increased effort in aligning compliance solutions - particularly in the financial services sector. Clients are also making a concerted effort to implement ESG practices within their organisations and track nonfinancial metrics. At the moment, most companies in the region are measuring impact to add value as that compliance requirements are still minimal. But as governments continue to announce sustainability efforts, those who have been deliberate in their own activities will find themselves ahead of the curve. With COP27 and COP28 both taking place in the MENA region, we can expect to see more boardrooms discuss sustainability KPIs as a necessity rather than an option.

Could you share a short reaction to how your industry and business has performed in 2021-22? We are in a post-pandemic environment where we are seeing not only recovery but also significant growth. Our advisory business grew by 40 percent, primarily due to the addition of a number of solutions and capabilities. With the introduction of corporate tax in the UAE and VAT in Oman, KPMG's Tax practice has been a frontrunner in advising clients. Quality continues to be our number one priority and our Audit practice has had a marquee year with iconic wins. This growth is a testament to the fact that we continue to remain the most trusted and trustworthy firm for our clients. By continuing to partner with businesses and government entities, KPMG has achieved revenue growth, year on year. We aim to be the employer of choice for our people, and the 16.2 percent rise in employee numbers reflects that. We are proud of our Emiratisation efforts with the number of Emiratis joining us increasing by 35.6 percent. The industry as a whole has seen growth over 2021-2022, reflecting the confidence of the leadership as well as clients. What is your outlook for the industry for the year ahead? GCC economies have seen a relatively solid start to 2022 with strong growth in business activity and new work in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. However, it's natural that market uncertainty and the increase in inflation could have an opposing impact on the global economy and pose key concerns in the future. We know that flexible working is paving the way for the future and employers realise that the workplace is changing. Many companies are aligning priorities with a stronger emphasis on diversity, inclusion, and sustainability. These measures need to be areas of necessity for companies going forward but are also putting intense hiring pressure for recruiters especially during the current search for talent. The wide-spread social reforms in the UAE last year have led the country to attract new talent, a globally aligned stock market, digital infrastructure capabilities and greater economic competitiveness overall. It is likely we will see this translating into new social and digital innovations, a reshaping of the post-pandemic economy, and ranking the UAE higher on the "Ease of Doing Business" metric.

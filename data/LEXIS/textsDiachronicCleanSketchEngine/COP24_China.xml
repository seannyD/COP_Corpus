The annual United Nations Climate Change conference opened on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, with the goal of finalizing the implementation guidelines for the Paris agreement. However, 13 parties in the agreement have yet to ratify the landmark accord. As of Saturday, 184 of the 197 parties in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change had ratified the Paris agreement, Michal Kurtyka, president of the 24th Conference of the Parties to UNFCCC, or COP24 , said at the first plenary session. COP24 news release said negotiations on the implementation guidelines were launched six months after the UN climate conference in the French capital in late 2015. COP24 was set as the deadline to finish negotiations. "I congratulate these parties and encourage other parties to ratify the Paris agreement as soon as possible," Kurtyka said. The Paris agreement was accepted by almost every country in the world at the 2015 conference, and it was entered into force on Nov 4, 2016. It aims to tackle climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions and setting a global target of keeping the average temperature rise no higher than 2 C above preindustrial levels. In addition to negotiations for the implementation guidelines, COP24 will conclude the yearlong Talanoa Dialogue led by the presidency of COP23. The news release said it is the first international conversation of its kind to assess progress toward the goals of the Paris agreement, including the goal of limiting global temperature increases. It also stated that capacity building for climate action will receive a significant boost at COP24 . About 35 events will be held at a capacity building hub, which will cover topics such as implementing national climate plans, mainstreaming gender into climate policy and action at all levels, and utilizing the knowledge of indigenous people. \</doc>

GABORONE, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- President of Botswana, Mokgweetsi Masisi will join other world leaders in Katowice, Poland for the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). According to a press release issued on Thursday by the Ministry of International Affairs and Cooperation in Botswana, Masisi will leave for Poland on Dec. 1 to attend the event that will run from Dec. 2 to 5. COP24 "To achieve this, the conference will strive to agree on the Paris Rule book, which will demonstrate political will and commitment on the part of the parties, to embark on an effective work plan. This will engender a collective effort towards realizing the ambitions of the UNFCCC beyond 2020," said the release. Alongside the COP24 meeting, there will also be a High-Level Summit emanating from the Talanoa Dialogue, during which heads of state and government are expected to sign the declaration recognizing the need for a low carbon economy as enshrined in the Paris Agreement. The Talanoa Dialogue is a process designed to help countries implement and enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions by 2020. It was launched at COP 23 under the presidency of the Republic of Fiji and is a year-long process. Like many other nations, Botswana is already feeling the adverse impact of climate change across various sectors of the economy through, among others, extreme weather events, substantial reductions in surface water resources, accelerated desertification in sensitive arid zones and greater threats to health, biodiversity and agricultural production.

Participants attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, December 3 (XINHUA) Negotiators from nearly 200 countries on December 15 agreed on the implementation guidelines, or a common rulebook, of the landmark Paris Agreement after two weeks of intensive talks, though observers warn of grave challenges still ahead to tame climate change. The 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) stretched beyond its originally planned closing time of December 14 evening and ran deep into December 15 in the southern Polish city of Katowice. The COP24 has been deemed the most important climate meeting since 2015 when the Paris Agreement was produced with the goal of capping global warming at two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while pursuing the even tougher goal of limiting it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Observers say that, with the guidelines adopted, countries can now work on the national systems needed for implementing the Paris Agreement starting from 2020. Similar efforts will be made at the international level. A thousand little leaps forward The conference burst into cheers and applause when Michal Kurtyka, President of the COP24 and State Secretary of Poland's Ministry of Energy, finally emerged on December 15 night to announce the outcome of the talks. "This was not an easy task. It was hard and daunting, but we pushed it through," he said. "Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together." The agreed "Katowice Climate Package" includes guidelines on how countries should provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that maps out their respective domestic climate actions. The rulebook spells out mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries. The package also includes guidelines related to the process for establishing new targets on financial support from 2025 onwards. The new targets are a follow-on from the current target of mobilizing $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries. The guidelines also cover the development and transfer of technology to developing countries to help them rise to climate challenges. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), hailed the achievement at the Katowice conference. "Katowice has shown once more the resilience of the Paris Agreement -- our solid roadmap for climate action," she said. Divisions remain While the adoption of the guidelines is a landmark, negotiators delayed decisions on a few key issues until next year in an effort to eventually produce a deal. Among these issues is how to create a functioning carbon credit market. The funding of a World Bank pledge of $200 billion by developed countries over five years to help developing countries cut emissions also remains a major concern. The developed countries had pledged to collectively mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries combat and better adapt to climate challenges but observers say the actual funding provided by the developed countries falls far behind the goal. The final text adopted by the conference also falls short of endorsing a report by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) about the devastating effects of even 1.5 Celsius degrees of global warming which requires specific reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Instead, the final statement merely welcomes the "timely completion" of the IPCC report and shuns a stance on its conclusions. "No one is entirely happy with this rulebook, but it is an important step," said Christiana Figueres, former Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC. "The foundations of the rules are still the Paris Agreement, which remains as strong as ever," she added. China plays "fundamental role" Delegates at the COP24 said China has been at the forefront of the challenging negotiations, working hard with various parties to untangle some of the key points of contention. Kurtyka, President of the COP24 , told Xinhua in an interview that China has been playing a "fundamental role" in pushing for a concrete outcome. The world's largest developing country has adopted effective measures to tackle climate change, stepping forward as an example for other countries amid divisions and uncertainties, said Kurtyka. Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna told the press that "the role China plays around the negotiating table can't be underestimated." Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative for climate change, told Xinhua that the Chinese delegation put in enormous efforts during the talks and made important contributions to the outcome of the conference. Observers say China, now on the track of green, low-carbon and renewable development with its effective climate policies, holds extra sway in the negotiations. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore also hailed China's leadership in tackling climate change, saying that China is "one of the few countries on track to meet its Paris commitment." Thanks to increased investment in green energy, China's carbon intensity, or the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of output, had declined by 46 percent by 2017 from 2005, meeting ahead of schedule its target a 40-45 percent drop by 2020, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The country is also well positioned to meet its target of carbon dioxide emissions peaking by 2030, and even accomplishing that sooner than planned, according to Xie. Challenges ahead Climate activists say the Katowice rulebook is only a first step, as good policies and strong enforcement by governments are the key to securing climate goals. Even though many countries have significantly improved their renewable energy regulations since 2010, there are still significant barriers to global progress on sustainable energy, said a latest World Bank report. RISE 2018, the World Bank report that maps global progress on sustainable energy policies by measuring policy progress in 133 countries, said policies to decarbonize heating and transportation, which account for 80 percent of global energy use, continue to be overlooked. To limit global warming to the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5 degree Celsius, carbo dioxide emissions would have to decline by 50 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by around 2050, according to researchers at the University of East Anglia and the Global Carbon Project. Kurtyka, President of the COP24 , called for further solid actions to tackle pressing climate challenge to secure a better world for the future generations.

UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres headed back on Tuesday to the UN climate change conference in Katowice, Poland in a bid to reach a "positive outcome" in face of division on a final document. Guterres, who was attending the conference on a global migration compact, "will do all that he can to encourage the member states in Katowice to move towards a positive outcome," Farhan Haq, UN deputy spokesman, told reporters here at a regular briefing. The UN chief "has made very clear in his earlier visit to Katowice last week what we really need to do is accelerate the progress in dealing with climate change because we have been moving too slowly as far as the data and the events all around us show," said the spokesman. "He is going to try to help encourage a greater degree of cooperation and seriousness and we hope and expect that the member states and the presidency of COP 24 will be able to move ahead," Haq said. The Katowice meeting, from Dec. 2-14, is the 24th Conference of Parties to the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Guterres attended the opening session and left for other UN meetings, including the Morocco meeting on the migration compact. The Katowice meeting has witnessed Russia and the United States -- among other states -- voicing opposition to draft text to be included in the final outcome document. The United States last year pulled out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Enditem \</doc>

"It is so decided," said Michal Kurtyka, conference president and Poland's environmental envoy, in announcing the passing of the Paris Agreement rulebook at 9:58 pm local time on Saturday at the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland. The final plenary had been delayed by almost 30 hours because the involved parties could not come to an agreement on issues, including transparency and the carbon market.The newly-adopted guidelines emphasize urgency in lifting climate actions to ensure all countries make the biggest efforts in confronting climate change. "The approval of the Paris Agreement Work Programme at COP24 in Katowice is the foundation for a new process in climate action," UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, who was also in Katowice, wrote on Twitter. "Ambition will be at the center of the Climate Summit I am convening in September. It's time to show strengthened ambition to defeat climate change.""We are driven by a sense of responsibility for present and future generations that will succeed us," Kurtyka said at the final plenary.Li Shuo, a Greenpeace consultant, told the Global Times after the conference that the rulebook will be the "map" toward the "destination" of the Paris Agreement's goals. "The rulebook came with difficulties, and it provides support to confronting climate change. It also proves that though the disputes caused by the geopolitics remain, a powerful guidebook is still possible."Meanwhile, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said that "in Katowice, China provided support in keeping the spirit of Paris alive and has shown its commitment to the climate multilateralism process."These talks also showed China's increasing role as the principal broker between developed and developing countries, she said. \</doc>

Thousands of environmentalists march in center Katowice to the venue of COP24 , calling on immediate action on climate change on Saturday. Photos: Shan Jie/GT In response to the US abdication of its global environmental responsibility, China will step up to the plate based on its capability, development and national conditions, China's senior climate change official said on Saturday at Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland.US President Donald Trump last year announced that the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. In 2014, former US president Barack Obama pledged the US would contribute $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund to help the poorest countries in the world on combating climate change. In response to some voices calling on China to make up the funding shortfall after the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, Li Gao, director-general of the department of climate change at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, noted that the responsibility should rest more with other developed countries. Historically speaking, climate change was caused by the unlimited emissions of developed countries since the Industrial Revolution, he said, "Therefore those countries should take on more responsibilities," Li said. He reaffirmed that China would implement the Paris Agreement based on the principle of common but different responsibilities and respective capabilities.China's carbon dioxide emissions per person are much lower than that of the US, Li noted.China has also been helping developing countries tackle climate change by supplying low-carbon devices and supporting projects that reduce emissions, he said.For many developing countries, the most significant issue was to ensure basic needs including electricity, Li said." COP24 in Katowice is a remarkable point in the multilateral climate change process," Li said. Patricia Espinosa, UN climate change executive secretary, said at a press conference on Saturday in Katowice, "We're very thankful for the leadership [of China] for clarity and vision in putting sustainability and addressing the climate changing at the center of the agenda."Against a background of rising unilateralism, the Katowice conference process is more significant, Li noted."If it fails in Katowice, doubts will emerge about the multilateral climate change process as well as globalization and global governance," he said.China has been working hard on promoting the process in negotiations, Li said. The implementation of the Paris Agreement is complicated due to detailed problems and political issues, he said, but many parties are still working positively and constructively."We have confidence in reaching the goal in Katowice," Li said.As of 2017, China had cut carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 46 percent from the 2005 level, fulfilling its commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 40 to 45 percent from the 2005 level by 2020. The two-week COP24 in Poland aims to finalize the implementation guidelines and provide clarity on how to carry out the Paris Agreement fairly all participating countries.

Private capital is an important supplement for climate financing in developing countries, but these nations must be well prepared with policies to facilitate such funds, according to officials at the ongoing COP24 in Katowice, Poland. When it comes to helping developing countries address climate challenges, "it is extremely important to be able to mobilize private finance", said Michal Kurtyka, president of the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24 . He said there are a number of channels in which private money can be mobilized and will be available to help meet the developmental needs of developing countries. This includes crowd financing. "There are lots of private-sector areas we are considering for you (developing countries), and we can help open the door, facilitate the policy, and create the conditions that make it attractive for (the) private sector to come," John Christensen, director of the UNEP DTU Partnership, said at a side event at COP24 .

[Photo/Agencies] </figcaption></figure> Experts at the UN's annual climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, have urged nations to adhere to the path of the Paris agreement, which sets a global target of keeping the average temperature rise no higher than 2\'b0C above preindustrial levels. "This year is likely to be one of the four hottest years on record," Patricia Espinosa, the UN's climate chief, said in a news release from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which opened Sunday. COP24 needs to make that happen." COP24 , is tasked with finalizing detailed implementation guidelines for the landmark Paris treaty signed in 2015. The conference comes amid a slew of reports warning of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions and their threat to health and other serious impacts, including a report on the effects of global warming of 1.5\'b0C above preindustrial levels by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Espinosa stressed that all of these findings confirm the need to maintain the strongest commitment to the Paris agreement's aims of limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C and pursuing efforts toward 1.5\'b0C. Michal Kurtyka, the COP24 president, was quoted in the release as saying, "The 2015 Paris agreement entered into force faster than any other agreement of its kind. I now call on all countries to come together, to build upon this success and to make the agreement fully functional. "We are ready to work with all nations to ensure that we leave Katowice with a full set of implementation guidelines and with the knowledge that we have served the world and its people," he added. To map out the detailed implementation guidelines for the Paris agreement as scheduled should be the core task of COP24 . The document calls on parties to promote the implementation of pre-2020 promises and actions to lay a mutual-trust foundation for post-2020 implementation of the Paris agreement. Developed countries should offer more detailed information on the delivery of $100 billion of support for developing countries every year before 2020 and meet the reasonable financial demand from developing countries over climate change issues, it added. At the 2009 Copenhagen conference, COP15, developed countries pledged $30 billion to a so-called Fast Start fund from 2010 to 2012 and a scale-up of aid to $100 billion a year by 2020. \</doc>

China's top climate change official reaffirmed the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities in implementing the Paris agreement as negotiations on climate change in Katowice, Poland were winding down to a final intense moment on Friday.Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Representative on Climate Change Affairs, noted that negotiations met with many difficulties, and developing countries are currently "not comfortable."He explained that some developed countries have not kept their promises to provide financial support to developing countries for climate change initiatives and instead made new demands on developing countries.Xie made the remarks while meeting the press on Thursday during the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland.According to previous promises, developed countries should raise $100 billion every year to 2020, and transfer advanced technologies to developing countries to help them tackle climate change. "Money is the most difficult part of it. This is all money talk. This (meeting) is about technical decisions although it turned political," a delegate was quoted by Reuters.Meanwhile, transparency has been a focus during the negotiation of the previous days, as developed countries urged developing countries to report their actions on confronting climate change.Xie also said during the interview that China values the transparency principle, which is important for implementing the Paris agreement and building political trust.Meanwhile, it should also be based on the different capabilities of different countries, and financial and technological support should be provided to developing countries, Xie noted.He also said that climate-change initiatives will not reduce employment, but would promote the sustainable development of economic and social activities. All countries should recognize this trend."We are not prepared to die. We are not going to become the first victims of the climate crisis. Instead, we are going to do everything in our power to keep our heads above water," Mohamed Nasheed, former president of the Maldives and leading negotiator of the island country, told delegates at the talks on Thursday in Katowice, Reuters reported.The COP24 is scheduled to officially close on Friday, but on-going negotiations could delay the end of the meeting for hours or days in the hope the parties can reach an agreement. \</doc>

China leads the world in electric vehicles and has a remarkable role to play in the ongoing EV revolution, senior environmental officials said at the UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland. The Chinese progress in terms of EVs is "absolutely remarkable" and "China is taking a leadership role right now", said Michal Kurtyka, president of the ongoing 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ). "If I remember correctly, every second electric car being sold in the world is being sold in China. Shenzhen (Guangdong province) has more electric buses (over 16,000) than any other city in the world. So it is a very intelligent strategy because it combines several benefits, in my opinion," said Kurtyka, who is also a secretary of state at Poland's Ministry of the Environment. He said electric vehicles are an option to address smog issues plaguing cities in many countries, including China, as urbanization continues. One of the leading topics of COP24 was energy transition. Kurtyka said that in this regard, it is important to have an ambitious, realistic energy policy. And China is developing a number of solutions. "I think that there is growing awareness everywhere, in China in particular, of the importance of an environmental model of development that marries economic, social, and environmental benefits," he said. He added that China has a fundamental role to play in ongoing climate change negotiations. "It's a party-driven process, and the Polish presidency is doing its utmost to run it in an inclusive, transparent and party-driven way. It's extremely encouraging to see a very large Chinese delegation working hard to make sure that Katowice is successful," he said, adding the committed Chinese delegation was a good sign for the Katowice negotiations. He said China, due to the size of its economy and its very fast economic growth, is an important player within G77, which assists developing countries in tackling climate change. Patricia Espinosa, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change executive secretary, said there is growing recognition of China's efforts in reducing emissions. A leader in clean technologies, the country has experiences that could be shared with other nations. "I am also very thankful for the leadership in China and their clarity and vision in putting sustainability and climate change at the center of the agenda of development for the coming years," she said on Dec 8.

Ralph Lauren has started selling a version of its iconic polo shirt that is made completely from recycled plastic bottles. Each Earth Polo is made from roughly 12 plastic bottles and manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected and processed into high-quality yarn and fabric. The shirt, which does not require any water in the dyeing process, went on sale in the company's retail stores throughout the world and on its website on Thursday, ahead of Earth Day on Monday. In announcing Earth Polo, the company committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. "Plastic waste is a major issue threatening the environment. We want to be part of the solution and utilize an innovative approach to create something valuable," David Lauren, the youngest son of the company's founder and its chief innovation officer, said in a statement. "Every day we're learning about what's happened with global warming and what's happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it's time to step up and make a difference," he said. "When Ralph founded our company more than 50 years ago, he did so with the idea that whatever we create is meant to be worn, loved, and passed on for generations. It's with this spirit of timelessness that we approach sustainability," Halide Alagoz, the company's chief supply chain and sustainability officer, said in a news release. Alagoz told China Daily that the company would "absolutely" expand its collection of bottles beyond Taiwan to other places. "At the moment, we're refreshing our approach and framework around sustainability," she said. Ralph Lauren partnered with First Mile and works with local entrepreneurs to collect recyclable plastic bottles. "Through innovative partnerships within our supply chain, we were able to develop a scalable solution to produce our Earth Polo program at the same price as our classic Polo shirt," Alagoz said. "The quality of the fabric for the Earth Polo meets the same high-quality standards as all of our other products," she said. The Earth Polo comes in men's and women's styles, in green, white, navy and light blue, and retails for $89.5. Alagoz said Ralph Lauren is working with experts who say the impact of turning a plastic bottle into recycled microfiber is "much less than that bottle ending up in the ocean". Burberry and H&M were among fashion giants to sign on in late 2018 to the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP24 , in Poland. The charter contains a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The Associated Press contributed to this story.

BERLIN, Dec. 17 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the agreement reached at the United Nations climate talks COP24 in Katowice as "an important signal for multilateralism", government spokesman Steffen Seibert said here on Monday. According to Seibert, the outcome of the climate conference proves that it is possible to reach a "global consensus" on climate protection which is "particularly important" to countries suffering from the consequences of climate change. On Saturday, 196 countries and the European Union agreed on a set of rules for the implementation of the Paris Climate Protection Agreement, which was adopted back in 2015. The agreement seeks to implement uniform measurements of CO2 emissions and regular reporting by the signatory countries. "The negotiating partners in Katowice have thus shown that efforts in climate protection can be successful if the international community works together," said the spokesman. Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said on Monday that the Katowice compromise was "urgently needed" for the implementation of the Paris climate protection agreement. German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze remarked at the end of the UN conference in Katowice that "For the first time, we have achieved that not only half the world, but the entire world plays with open cards with regards to climate protection."

[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn] </figcaption></figure> Chinese property developer Jinmao Holdings Group Ltd will continue its low-carbon commitments, aiming to cut carbon emissions by 100,000 tons each year according to its top management. Li Congrui, president of real estate developer China Jinmao Holdings Group Ltd, said at the China Pavilion sector during the two-week United Nations Climate Change Conference "the group has been and will continue to adhere to low carbon emissions during property development and other business operations." According to data from UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 36 percent of the global carbon emissions are related to architecture, while the number for China is about 40 percent. China Pavilion, a series of meetings featuring discussions on the country's efforts battling the greenhouse effect, also highlighted this topic. Li said China is in the process of urbanization, so carbon emissions related to architecture are higher than average. The company has been promoting clean and sustainable energy use in its 35 power station projects. The move is expected to save about 100,000 metric tons of carbon emissions per year. It has also been adopting green energy systems for buildings in construction. As of October 2018, 90 percent of Jinmao's real estate developing projects have "Green Building Labels" certified by agencies like the Research Center of Environment Control and Technology or similar certifications processed overseas. China has achieved many of its goals in advance of the deadlines set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, said representative Xie Zhenhua during the two-week United Nations Climate Change Conference . According to the agreement, China promised to reduce its carbon intensity by 40 percent to 45 percent and to increase its forest reserve by 1.3 billion cubic meters by 2020. The country also said its non-fossil fuels will account for about 15 percent of primary energy consumption. The summit, which was held from Dec 3 to 14 in Katowice, Poland, featured discussions on how the 2015 Paris Agreement would be implemented. The agreement called on all countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a goal to reduce the global average temperature to about 1.5 C above the pre-industrial era. \</doc>

HELSINKI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting concluding in Rovaniemi, northern Finland, on Tuesday failed to formulate a customary joint declaration due to disparities. It was the first time the meeting has not issued a declaration which would also act as a guideline for the next chairing country. As the meeting convened on Tuesday morning, the presiding Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini entered a change in the agenda and deleted the item about a would-be joint declaration. Instead of a joint declaration, the ministers signed on a joint statement, which reaffirmed the commitment to maintaining peace, stability and constructive cooperation in the Arctic, but did not mention the climate change issue. The joint statement emphasized the role of the Arctic States in providing leadership in addressing new opportunities and challenges in the Arctic, working in close cooperation with the Permanent Participants. Timo Koivurova, director of the Arctic Center at the University of Lapland, expressed his disappointment that the meeting concluded without a declaration. He told national broadcaster Yle that the United States remained alone in the meeting in opposing the concept of climate change. Harri Mikkola, a researcher at the Finnish Institute for International Affairs, told Helsingin Sanomat, a national newspaper, that the non-issuance of a declaration is an embarrassing end to the Finnish tenure as a chairman. "But the forces that lead to this are outside the hands of Finland," he said. Meanwhile, Soini issued a separate statement of the chair, which is not necessarily signed by the member states. It pointed out the internal disagreement on the climate change issues. It noted that "a majority of us" regarded climate change as a fundamental challenge facing the Arctic and acknowledged the urgent need to take mitigation and adaptation actions. It also said the majority welcomed the outcomes of the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP24 ) in Poland's Katowice, "including the Paris agreement working program". The United States withdrew from the Paris agreement one and a half years after it was passed by the international community in late 2015. Pompeo did not mention directly the climate change in his speech, but spent time warning the Arctic nations of possible influence from China and Russia. Mikkola said super power politics has not been discussed with that kind of weight in the Arctic Council. In the statement by the chair, Soini noted that the meeting acknowledged the Arctic Council as the preeminent intergovernmental forum for the Arctic region. Addressing a press conference together with Soini, Icelandic Foreign Minister Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson said he would continue to keep the forum in low tension. Finland's rotating chairmanship of the council ends in June, and the chairmanship flag is passed at the Rovaniemi meeting from Finland to Iceland. Enditem \</doc>

KATOWICE, Poland, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from nearly 200 countries on Saturday agreed on a package of implementation guidelines, or a common rulebook of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), stretched beyond official closing time on Friday evening and overran deep into Saturday in the southern Polish city of Katowice. "This was not an easy task. It was hard and daunting, but we pushed it through," said Michal Kurtyka, president of the COP24 and state secretary of Poland's Ministry of Energy. "Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together," said Kurtyka, "We will all have to give in order to gain," he said. "We will all have to be courageous to look into the future and make yet another step for the sake of humanity." Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also hailed the achievement. "Katowice has shown once more the resilience of the Paris Agreement - our solid roadmap for climate action," she said. "The approval of the Paris Agreement Work Program is the basis for a transformative process which will require strengthened ambition from the international community," she said, "Science has clearly shown that we need enhanced ambition to defeat climate change." The UN climate conference came as latest reports show that climate challenges remain undeterred and global carbon emissions are set to hit an all-time high in 2018. A report by the World Meteorological Organization shows the impacts of the long-term global warming trend remains undeterred in 2018, following the 20 warmest years recorded in the past 22 years with the top four in the past four years.

BRUSSELS, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- As the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change kicked off in Poland, a climate protest called "Claim the Climate" was held on Sunday across Brussels, with police saying that over 70,000 people took part in it throughout the day. According to the organizers, it is the biggest climate march ever organized in Belgium. "The climate march is a great success for citizen mobilization, the climate issue must be a central concern for future generations, and Belgium, which has finalized its Climate Energy Plan, will defend ambitious objectives at COP 24 ", announced Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel on Twitter. "This Sunday, the Climate Coalition and Climate Express will challenge our Belgian leaders for a more ambitious climate policy at global, European and national levels. They will demand that warming be limited to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius, as the Paris Agreement requires, "explained Nicolas Van Nuffel, president of the Climate Coalition. "They will also demand that this be done through a just transition, which respects the rights of everyone, including employees of sectors and businesses, the people of the South, refugees ... We will go to the streets for climate justice, in Belgium and all over the world". The march began at the Gare du Nord at around 1 p.m.local time, all the way down to the Parc Cinquantenaire. Two courses are planned: one for pedestrians and one for cyclists. The Belgian National Railway Company (SNCB) announced that no less than 34,000 travelers went by train this Sunday in the capital to join the campaign. Enditem \</doc>

KATOWICE, Poland, Dec. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, on Tuesday urged governments to push for a strong and effective outcome of a major UN climate conference as divisions still remain. The two-week 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the UNFCCC, which runs until Friday in the southern Polish city of Katowice, aims to adopt the implementation guidelines of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement to provide clarity on how to carry out the accord fairly for all participating countries. "Many political divisions remain. Many issues still must be overcome. But I believe it's within our grasp to finish the job," said Espinosa, adding "Let's complete the Paris Agreement Work Program and, by doing so, immediately unleash the power of the Paris Agreement itself." The COP24 Ahead of the COP24 , the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special report on the achievability and implications of a 1.5\'b0Celsius global average temperature rise compared to pre-industrial levels, the lower temperature goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, reiterated the key findings of the report in Katowice that the temperature goal is only achievable if governments take urgent and far-reaching action in all aspects of society, with many implications for policy-making. "Every bit of warming matters. Every year matters. Every choice matters. With this report, the scientific message is clear. It is now up to you, the governments, to act," he said. Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, also warned that current levels of greenhouse gas emissions were unsustainable, and were already leading to dramatic climate change impacts around the world, from the melting of Artic ice to many incidents of fires and flooding this year. "We are expecting a 2 to 4 percent increase in global carbon dioxide emissions this year. If we are serious about the Paris Agreement, we need to see different numbers," Taalas said. The secretary-general also pointed out that even if pollution of the atmosphere is stopped today, the current levels of CO2 would stay in the atmosphere for many years to come, locking in extreme weather. The UN climate conference came as latest reports show that climate challenges remain undeterred and global carbon emissions are set to hit an all-time high in 2018. According to a report released last week by the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the Global Carbon Project, global carbon emissions are expected to rise by more than 2 percent from last year to 37.1 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2018, driven by a solid growth in coal use and sustained growth in oil and gas use.

WARSAW, Oct. 24 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of December's COP24 climate summit, the PreCOP talks held this week brought an increasing convergence of positions on many issues, Polish deputy environment minister Michal Kurtyka said on Wednesday in Krakow, southern Poland. These days of discussion allow the parties to better understand what the negotiation challenges are, test different types of solutions, and look for compromises which can be acceptable for all parties, Kurtyka said. He also expressed hope the COP24 summit could bring about the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The PreCOP conference of climate ministers from United Nations (UN) member states, which ended on Wednesday, was a preparatory meeting ahead of the COP24 talks. The conference gathered delegates from around 40 countries and global business representatives. "What we would like to achieve (on the COP24 in Katowice) is an agreement of all 195 countries on a worldwide scale," Kurtyka announced, stressing that the rules set in Katowice are to set the global climate policy for the next decades. Earlier on Tuesday, Polish Environment Minister Henryk Kowalczyk said the PreCOP talks were a huge opportunity for essential progress in the negotiations, and was the best possible preparation for the climate summit in December. According to the minister, the talks focused on an implementation package for the Paris Agreement and setting guidelines for the COP24 summit's negotiators. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) underlined the COP24 talks in Katowice would be the most important climate summit since the signing of the Paris Agreement, especially taking into consideration that the global warming process could soon get out of control. The 24th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) will be held in Katowice between Dec. 3 and 14. Enditem \</doc>

RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro said on Friday that he will not sign any climate agreement that will damage the country's agribusiness sector. The statement was made in response to a declaration made by French President Emmanuel Macron, who, earlier this week, said that a trade deal between Mercosur, of which Brazil is a founding member, and the European Union was conditional on Brazil's position on the Paris Climate Agreement. The French president said he cannot ask French workers and farmers to change their production habits to lead the ecological transition, then to sign trade agreements with countries which do not agree to do the same, for it would mean an imbalance of trade agreements. Bolsonaro, whose stance on environmental matters differs from recent Brazilian administrations, has been voicing his intention to pull Brazil from the Paris Agreement. He has recently asked for the withdrawal of Brazil's candidacy for host of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP-25) in 2019. "Macron is defending France. This agreement between Mercosur and the European Union harms France's interest, as the country's agribusiness sector is also strong," Bolsonaro said. Enditem \</doc>

Chinese national flags are waving on PNG\' s Independence Boulevard that opened to traffic in recent days. Photo by Wang Xiaodong, Liu Qing China has become a focus in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (PNG), the host city of the 26th APEC Economic Leaders\' Meeting in recent days. The Chinese elements , fresh Butuka Secondary School renovated by China, the wide China-aid Independence Boulevard, as well as the buses offered by China running across the city, can be seen almost everywhere in the city. The people of PNG raised banners in both Chinese and English to welcome visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping, extending their thanks to the president for building schools and roads for them. PNG Prime Minister Peter O\' Neill noted that his country couldn\' t have made such rapid development as it is doing today or organized the APEC meeting in such a smooth manner without China\' s help. China\' s contribution to the Asia-Pacific in promoting regional cooperation and common prosperity is obvious to all.  China is the world\' s second largest economy and one of the largest consumer markets. Its economic development has an impact on the future trend of global economy, said PNG\' s Minister for Finance, James Marape. He believes China plays a vital role among APEC members. China has raised a series of proposals and ideas within the APEC framework in recent years that have exerted huge influence on not only APEC, but also other global organizations, Marape underscored. PNG citizens pose for pictures by an advertising board of APEC. Photo from Xinhua News Agency Alan Bollard, APEC Secretariat executive director holds that as a major economy that has a huge influence in the Asia-Pacific region, China has been extensively engaged in APEC activities, playing a significant role in multiple schemes to enhance regional economic integration. As this year marks the 5th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Chinese proposal has become a hot topic among politicians, businessmen and scholars attending the APEC. On Nov. 12, the first day of the APEC week, China and Fiji officially inked a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation within the framework of the BRI. The BRI proposed by China bears an important referential significance, Bollard said, adding that China\' s rich experience in infrastructure and poverty reduction over the last few years has gradually been adopted into regional agenda, contributing to the development of the Asia-Pacific.  China and Japan are respectively the second and third largest economies of the world, and they should jointly take the responsibility to cope with global challenges, said Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono at a recent press conference. To enhance infrastructure and improve regional interconnectivity could become a focus of China-Japan cooperation in the future, he noted, adding that Japan welcomes the cooperation with China that complies to international codes. Climate change is also one of the major topics at the APEC summit.  Pacific island countries attach high importance on climate change, and we will never forget the last year\' s United Nations Climate Change Conference which concluded with success under the support from China, said chief economic adviser Joseph Veramu to the Prime Minister of Fiji, host of the 23rd United Nations Climate Change Conference last year. David Morris, Pacific Islands Trade and Investment Commissioner in China highly praised China\' s fulfillment of its obligation in the Paris Agreement, as well as the country\' s efforts to coordinate each country to find the "biggest common denominator" for cooperation, saying China has played a leading role in emission reduction. \</doc>

CAPE TOWN, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa on Monday called for increased support for developing countries in fighting climate change. South African Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane made the appeal as she announced South Africa's participation in the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. "The Katowice Conference should include taking stock of work required to fully implement the Paris Agreement, provide assurances that the political balance of the Paris Agreement is upheld, and that all issues of importance to developing countries will be addressed in the rule-book to be adopted," said Mokonyane. The focus at COP24 COP24 is a critical milestone towards the success of the multilateral approach to addressing climate change at a time when such an approach is being opposed by the United States and further undermined by backtracking on commitments by several other developed countries, Mokonyane said. The international climate change talks started on Sunday and will last until Dec. 14 under the presidency of Poland. The mandate of the Katowice Climate Conference is to adopt the Paris Agreement Work Program, setting out the implementation guidelines required to operationalize the Paris Agreement in 2020. The Conference will also host ministerial-level events, including the Talanoa Dialogue, which aims to raise ambition and accelerate action to address climate change, as well as dialogues on financial support for developing countries and implementation of the pre-2020 agenda under the convention and its Kyoto Protocol. South Africa has identified a number of priorities for COP24 where it is important to ensure the technical needs and requirements of nations to mitigate and adapt to climate change are comprehensively negotiated. In 2015, South Africa joined 196 countries in ratifying the Paris Agreement, which came into effect on Nov. 4, 2016. Enditem \</doc>

KATOWICE, Poland, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- Delegates from nearly 200 countries began talks on Sunday on urgent actions to curb climate change three years after the landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement set a goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The two-week UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP24 , held in the southern Polish city of Katowice, aims to finalize the implementation guidelines and provide clarity on how to carry out the Paris deal fairly for all participating countries. Six months after the 2015 Paris summit, the negotiations on the implementation guidelines were launched and COP24 was set as the deadline. "We are here to enable the world to act together on climate change," said Poland's environmental envoy Michal Kurtyka, who is presiding over the UN meeting. "The United Nations secretary-general is counting on us, all of us to deliver," Kurtyka said, urging all countries to "show creativity and flexibility." The to-be-finalized implementation guidelines are expected to unleash practical climate actions with respect to all the targets and goals of the Paris agreement, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing financial and other support to developing countries. While governments are committed to finalizing the guidelines, a great deal of work still remains to be completed in Katowice. The UN conference is being held following a cascade of UN and other reports on increasing impact of greenhouse gas concentrations and emissions. "All of these findings confirm the need to maintain the strongest commitment to the Paris Agreement's aims of limiting global warming to well below 2\'baC and pursuing efforts towards 1.5\'baC," said Patricia Espinosa, the UN climate chief. "Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and emissions continue to rise. Climate change impacts have never been worse," she said, "This reality is telling us that we need to do much more - COP24 needs to make that happen." COP24 , the climate talks in Katowice also include Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol and the Conference of Signatories to the Paris Agreement. About 20,000 people will take part, including politicians, representatives of non-governmental organizations, scientific community and business sector. Enditem \</doc>

<figure><figcaption> Participants take part in plenary session during COP24 UN Climate Change Conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland, on Dec 13, 2018. [Photo/Agencies] </figcaption></figure> The countries that make up the BASIC bloc said they are confident of a positive result and vowed to exercise flexibility to help finalize the Paris climate change agreement. They made the comment in a news conference on Wednesday in Katowice, Poland, where the 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24 , is being held. Opened on Dec 2, the conference is scheduled to close on Friday. Senior officials of the four countries - Brazil, South Africa, India and China - also said, however, the flexibility will be only exercised under the principal of equity and for the common good, as included in Paris agreement. "We have to adhere to basic principals of the Paris agreement and implement the spirit of the agreement comprehensively and precisely," said Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs. COP24 will be a success. Only a successful COP24 could prove that the multilateral mechanism works. We adhere to multilateralism, so we believe there will be a positive result." Financial support from developed countries is another area of concern, Xie said. "Only with sustainable and sufficient funding can developing countries upgrade their capability in tackling climate change and then increase the transparency in climate change mitigation and adaptation," he said. "BASIC is willing to exercise necessary flexibility. ... We must also ensure that we do not backslide on the balance that we have reached in the Paris agreement," said A.K. Mehta, India's Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Derek Hanekom, head of the South African delegation and tourism minister, echoed those words. "We are in complete agreement that there should be no backsliding on the Paris agreement," he said. Financial commitments from developed countries, as agreed in the Paris accord, have yet to be fully met. "It's quite clear the evidence shows that not only do we need reliability in the available finance to support some of the initiatives, but that the amount allocated is hopelessly inadequate. So more finances will be needed, and it has to be reliable so that countries can depend on it," Hanekom said. He also said the conference should be a demonstration that multilateralism not only can work but must be adhered to. \</doc>

China sent 91 negotiators to the international climate change conference COP24 this year held in Poland The Chinese delegates to the climate change conference are from governmental departments and institutes Those who were born after 1985 have become a main force in China's climate negotiations The two-week Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) is held in Katowice, Poland. Photo\u-230 Shan Jie/GT Mentioning the negotiation work, Sun Shao's eyes shine with excitement."I'm not only good at it," Sun told the Global Times proudly, stopping his work on his computer, "I can also learn about the latest scientific research achievements from top institutes on the conference."Sun is one of the 91 Chinese delegates at the two-week Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland.It is the second time that Sun is negotiating as a Chinese delegate on climate change. His first time was in Bonn, Germany in May."I felt pressure at that time, because I was not familiar with the process. But now I enjoy it," Sun said.Born in 1989 in Beijing, Sun finished his PhD studies at the Beijing Normal University two years ago. He then joined the National Climate Center under the China Meteorological Administration."When I was a student, I always felt climate negotiation was a holy task, as you stand for your country on the international stage," he said.He was very relaxed chatting with this reporter at the office of the Chinese delegation, located in a deep corner of the COP24 venue, the Katowice Spodek.He talked fast when mentioning the complex professional jargon used in the negotiations, as well as the articles under negotiation. "You have to master what you are to negotiate," he said.According to Eco Business, 22,771 registered participants are attending COP24 , with 13,898 people representing specific parties, 7,331 observers and 1,541 journalists. Guinea has the biggest delegation with 406 members.More than 32,000 people have participated in COP24 , said Alexsander Saler, a UN climate change official, during a media conference.There are 91 delegates for China at COP24 , according to the provisional list on the UNFCCC's website. The delegation is led by Li Ganjie, minister of ecology and environment, along with Xie Zhanhua, China's special representative on climate change.The delegates are officials and researchers from governmental departments, including the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Science and Technology, together with experts from universities and institutes.The delegates vary in age. The Global Times learned from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment that the delegates were born from the 1950s to the 1990s. Many delegates in the negotiations were born after 1985. More than half of the delegates are women. The youngest was born in 1995, Sun said.To stand for China in international negotiations, the delegates need to make great efforts, even outside the conference. They also have to give up a lot in daily life and work.By December 21, the negotiations are supposed to be finished. However, according to the example from previous conferences, the ending of the negotiations may be delayed because the parties cannot come to an agreement. The delay could be several hours, or even days.During COP24 , the Global Times talked to several delegates to find out about their lives as negotiators. Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change Photo: Shan Jie/GT Sleep deprivedSeveral new sleeping bags and a row of bottled water were stored in the corner of Chinese delegation office.They are for the negotiators, who work late into the night during the conference.Sometimes the delegates cannot finish work until 2 or 3 am. Sometimes they have no time to sleep.The daily work of Chinese delegates starts early. At 7 am, the negotiators have their first meeting of the day. They must take a shuttle bus to the venue. This year, the journey from the hotel of Chinese delegation to Katowice Spodek takes about 40-50 minutes.The delegates, while on the bus, one by one explain briefly what they had negotiated in the conferences of previous day.Then after arriving at the venue, they check the time and location of negotiations they are responsible for, and prepare for them. By 4 pm, Sun has finished his negotiation work for that day."The daily negotiation takes four or five hours. But it is quite tiring, because you have to be highly focused," he said.However, as the conference nears the end, the work of the delegates becomes more intensive.Li Gao, head of the climate change office at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said in a previous interview with the China News Service that he slept for less than two hours in the last 72 hours of the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009. Another delegate, Pei Liang, said that his record was going sleepless for 40 hours in conference. It was in 2013 in Warsaw. The conference was delayed for one day as the parties could not come to an agreement on an expression. "I felt overextended," Pei said.Three years after the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement passed, the two-week COP24 needs to adopt the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement on how to carry out the accord fairly for all participating countries. Insiders all predicted quite long delays before the meeting ends. The Chinese delegates work in the office at COP24 . Photo: Shan Jie/GT Good reputationWhen talking with delegates, Liu's name is often mentioned."Go ask Liu Shuo, she's a 'big guy,'" Sun joked.However, the real Liu is small, slim and humble, and she is a woman.When this Global Times reporter met her in the Chinese office, she was reading on her laptop, with a coffee cup in her left hand and a tissue in her right hand. Her coat was thrown over her shoulder.Liu, from the Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development in Agriculture under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, works on agriculture and climate change, including carbon reduction in agricultural areas."I have to spend lots of time to sort out the opinions of different countries or interest groups," she said. "Participating in climate change conferences takes a big part of my time.""My colleagues at my institute always say, 'Where have you been this time Liu Shuo? You are either abroad or on the way to apply for work abroad,'" Liu said."It is essential to keep the stability of the delegate team," Liu said in an interview with Chinese media, "so I insist on negotiating.""It is a great honor to make such a contribution for the country. I'm proud of this," Liu said.Liu's 3-year-old child has now got used to Liu being away. "My child can now remember where I went to. At this time I feel sorry for my family," Liu said.This year Liu has negotiated for China eight times. Sometimes the negotiations take around three weeks.Liu still remembers the first time she became a negotiator. She said she felt like someone who cannot swim being dropped into sea."It's like the experience of the Chinese delegation. We used to be in a passive position in negotiations. Now we can express our interests and join a process actively." Red lines"We have two principles in negotiation. We cannot cause the failure of a negotiation. We cannot have results that are against the interests of China," Sun said.Guo Xiaofeng is a Chinese delegate from the office of climate change under the Department of Treaty and Law of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Guo has been engaged in negotiating climate change since 2007.With an education background in law and experience in negotiation, Guo implied that strategies are sometimes used in negotiation, and the delegates have been told to use a poker face when working toward negotiation results.Guo always wears traditional Chinese garments while negotiating. "It suits more to my identity, and it's more convenient without a tie. Moreover, it increases my confidence," he told the media.He said the main goal of negotiation on climate change is to provide a beneficial space for the country's development. In past years, the Chinese delegation has become an active participant and a contributing leader in negotiations, a shift from its previous defensive stance.China has been working together with many developed countries and playing a key role in promoting the implementation of the Paris agreement."No matter what the global society does, China's transition to reducing carbon emissions to confront climate change in economic development will go on," Guo said. "This is a necessary need of domestic economic development and caters to the global trend."

HELSINKI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Veteran French politician Laurent Fabius, who chaired the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, said here Wednesday that he was concerned about the attainment of the Paris Agreement goals. Addressing a climate summit arranged by the Finnish public think tank Sitra, Fabius said the upcoming choice of some South Asian countries to build new coal burning plants, or not, is among the crucial developments in the near future. Whether oil producers will keep exploiting fossil resources or switch to cleaner sources will be decisive as well. He also mentioned future agricultural methods and carbon pricing in Europe were key factors. Fabius said the U.S. announcement to pull out of the Paris Agreement sent "a very bad signal" to the rest of the world. The Paris Agreement needs a workable program that is to be accepted in a meeting in Poland late this year, "but talks have been difficult, particularly regarding public financing," he said. About 80 percent of the global energy mix still relies on fossil fuels, he reminded. "We are in a race against time, and there is not a moment to lose." Opening the event, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto highlighted Finnish efforts to reduce black carbon emissions in the Arctic. Black carbon accelerates the melting of the sea ice and thus accelerates climate change. As the current chair of the Arctic Council, Finland is working toward a summit of heads of state of the eight Arctic Council members. "A firm high-level commitment to (cutting)black carbon emissions in the Arctic would be welcome news for the environment. And it would also benefit peace, a sense of community and trust," Niinisto said. The Finnish president acknowledged that success is not guaranteed, "but the potential rewards are high."

BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- China, France and the United Nations reiterated their firm commitments to working together in combating climate change in a press statement released here on Friday following a three-party meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit. Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also met the press together after their meeting. In the statement, the three parties called on the international community to join hands in building a low-carbon society and pursuing sustainable development, as they defined climate change as critical to the future of the humanity. In particular, the Chinese side reiterated its firm support for implementing the Paris Agreement based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and for reaching a package agreement at the upcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The COP24 In the statement, China and France renewed their highest political commitment to the effective and transparent implementation of the Paris Agreement in all aspects. The two sides said they hoped that the G20 summit would give a political impetus to the success of the COP24 . China takes the implementation of the Paris Agreement as an inherent part of its own sustainable development, and has taken decisive actions in this regard, which has resulted in concrete achievements, Wang said, adding that it will continue devoting itself to better global climate governance, deeper South-South cooperation in fight against climate change and a greener Belt and Road, Wang said. Drian, for his part, said that, at this critical moment in facing up to climate challenges, the international community must beef up actions and demonstrate resolves. He also promised to support China in hosting the COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020. Guterres, apart from expressing gratitude to the two nations for their leadership in reaching and implementing the Paris Agreement, told the press that, the pace of climate change and the challenges it has brought to all nations have exceeded expectations. The international community must work together in pushing for success of the COP24 and the United Nations 2019 Climate Summit, said the UN secretary-general. Enditem \</doc>

BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- All nations should take responsibility, get down to action and strengthen coordination in the multilateral process in tackling climate change, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said here Friday. China stands firm on curbing global warming and will push for positive results out of the next round of negotiations in Poland, Wang said at a three-party meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit. At the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris, Chinese President Xi Jinping pointed out that the Paris Agreement did not represent an end, but a new starting point, Wang said. The upcoming 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), set to be a significant step in the multilateral process, will be crucial for the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, according to Wang. The COP24 China, together with France and the UN, will strive for comprehensive and balanced outcomes from the COP24 and make greater contributions to a clean, beautiful world as well as a community of shared future, Wang said. While reiterating China's pursuit of green, low-carbon and sustainable development, he urged all parties to fulfill their commitments and step up their efforts against global warming. Le Drian, for his part, said France would like to work with China more on climate change, which shall include three-party cooperation to help other developing countries go green and low-carbon. During the meeting, Guterres expressed gratitude to China for its vital leadership on climate change, as well as to both China and France for their leading roles in the face of this global challenge.

The 2018 United Nations climate change conference , now in session in Katowice, Poland, had to take an unplanned day off on Sunday, because the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait blocked the endorsement of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's special report on what would happen if the average global temperatures rise by 1.5 degrees, and how to ensure they don't. Three years back in Paris, when countries agreed on the need for joint actions to contain global warming, they called for such a scientific report on what needed to be done. That report is now in, and the four countries didn't like the implications. The US State Department said the US noted the IPCC report but did not "welcome" it, as to do so would be to endorse it. Which is basically saying we can all go to hell in a fossil-fueled handcart, because not even Mother Nature gets to tell this administration what to do. The statement sends a stark message of how difficult it is to get everyone to appreciate that climate change is happening and lifestyle changes are unavoidable, not optional, if runaway global warming is to be prevented. The current US administration's infamous distrust of the scientific findings about climate change means its casual dismissal of the report comes as no real surprise. But while negotiations in the rest of the week are expected to get a lot tougher than previously anticipated, that would be nothing compared with the critical summit ending up without a meaningful consensus on what to do next. Nonparticipation by a few countries may not stop concerned members of the international community from pressing ahead with their own climate response agenda under the framework of the Paris Agreement. Key supporters including China and the European Union have repeatedly stated their respective commitment to what has been agreed upon, and there is a shared sense of urgency about reworking and upgrading growth models and promoting clean energy usage, an urgency that will only become more acute as the reality of the global temperature rise begins to bite. But climate change is a problem way beyond any individual country's capacities. Collective, indeed universal, actions are indispensable if a difference is to be made globally. If this year's UN climate summit fails to achieve a consensus on actions to be taken, much of what countries agreed in Paris risks becoming empty talk. Because according to that agreement, 2018 is the deadline for plans honoring emissions reduction commitments. (China Daily 12/11/2018 page8) \</doc>

<figure><figcaption> Participants attend the COP24 UN Climate Change Conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland, on Tuesday. REUTERS </figcaption></figure> UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for political compromises and sacrifices as the negotiations to finalize implementation guidelines for the Paris agreement near an end and "key political issues remain unresolved". Guterres made the comment when addressing the closing of the high-level segment of the Talanoa dialogue on Wednesday at the 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP24 , in Katowice, Poland. He reiterated that COP24 is the most important COP since the adoption of the 2015 Paris agreement and Katowice must be a success. The conference is tasked with finalizing the implementation guidelines of the agreement, which aims to keep the average temperature rise in the world no higher than 2 C above preindustrial levels. "I left Katowice hopeful, but uncertain," Guterres said, adding that "much remains to be done" despite some progress in the negotiations. "The key political issues remain unresolved. This is not surprising-we recognize the complexity of this work. But we are running out of time," he added. "Talanoa's spirit is exactly how we can achieve a successful result in these last crucial days of COP24 Initiated by the COP23 presidency of Fiji, Talanoa is a traditional word used across the Pacific to reflect a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue. The purpose of Talanoa is to share stories, build empathy and to make wise decisions for the collective good. "Today, Katowice is the hub of global climate action. The eyes of the world are on us, and more than 32,000 people have come here to find solutions to climate change. They are inspired, engaged and they want us to deliver. They want us to finish the job," Guterres said, warning that failing in Katowice would send a disastrous message to those who stand ready to shift to a green economy. The secretary-general also called for supportive attitude toward the special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, which was published by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October. The report highlighted a number of effects that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5 C. The IPCC report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 C will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island states home, he said. "This is the time for consensus. This is the time for political compromises to be reached. This means sacrifices, but it will benefit us all collectively." Guterres said that to waste this opportunity would compromise the last best chance to stop runaway climate change and "it would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal". As a grandfather of three young girls, Guterres said he would not be able to survive the end of the century. "The same probably applies to all of you," he said. "I do not want my granddaughters or anybody else's to suffer the consequences of our failures. They would not forgive us if uncontrolled and spiraling climate change was our legacy to them," he said. \</doc>

[Photo/Agencies] </figcaption></figure> Delegates to the United Nations climate talks in Poland continued to haggle over some pending issues on Friday, just hours before the conference was set to end, although a draft text had been proposed. The first comprehensive draft agreement was published at 3 am on Friday local time and was then updated at around 11 am. But by press time in China, differences still remained on how to implement guidelines laid out in the 2015 Paris agreement. Transparency in fulfilling nationally determined contributions, or NDCs-the pledges each country made for post-2020 emission reductions to meet the universal goal of holding global temperature increases to less than 2 C above preindustrial levels-and financial support from developed countries to developing ones are among those to be further discussed under the latest draft. "I think generally, the text is balanced. It takes into consideration the interests and positions of various parties," said Gou Haibo, special representative for climate change negotiations from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "But it still needs to be improved. We hoped that during the day these disputes will be settled by consultations between the COP 24 president and the groups." There were many differences, but no extremely big ones, he said. All parties agreed with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities stipulated in the Paris agreement, but some minor differences exist on the understanding over how to embody the principle, Gou said. The developing countries wanted the principle to be reflected more fully in the text. "I believe these differences can be bridged through further negotiations today or tomorrow," he said. The climate conference was scheduled to close on Friday but could be extended. Gou said he was optimistic about a positive result. During the talks, developed countries had also requested developing countries to increase transparency in fulfilling their reduction pledges. Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, said on Thursday that with their emission reduction and support commitments yet to be fulfilled, developed countries are not in a position to make such a new requirement. It is clearly stated both in the Kyoto Protocol and Paris agreement that developed countries should dramatically reduce their carbon emissions before 2020 and also offer financial and technological support to developing countries to help them deal with the effects of global warming. Even as they fail to meet the targets suggested by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, many developed countries have also yet to fulfill their financial commitments, Xie said. At the 2009 UN climate change conference, developed countries pledged $30 billion-called "fast start" funds-from 2010 to 2012, and a scale-up of the aid to $100 billion per year by 2020. "Some of the developed countries have reached their reduction targets as suggested, and also contribute financial support. Many have neither fulfilled their targets nor offered the money or given out enough," Xie said. \</doc>

At the final session of the COP24 , China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua (center) with COP24 President Michal Kurtyka (right) and Iran's head of delegation Majid Shafiepour Motlagh in Katowice, Poland, on December 15 (VCG) Two weeks of intensive talks in Katowice finally saw negotiators from 196 countries and the European Union agree on December 15 on a guideline to implement the landmark Paris climate agreement signed two years ago. The 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Poland, although criticized by some as not being strong enough, still saw the international community making efforts to achieve comprehensive and balanced outcomes. The Katowice agreement demonstrates that countries will continue to fulfill their commitments to cap global warming at 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while pursuing the even tougher goal of limiting it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said the meeting conveyed the positive message of adhering to multilateralism and strengthening global action. It boosted the parties' confidence in the multilateral mechanism for climate governance and provided new drivers for green and low-carbon development worldwide. The outcomes of COP24 need to be measured in the long-term perspective, Zhang Yi, a research fellow with the China Institute of International Studies (CIIS), told Beijing Review. Progress in climate action has been slow as it is a hard and daunting task for humanity to tackle climate change. Even a little step forward can be of great significance for the future. Detailed framework The practical and detailed proposals in the Katowice agreement lay a solid foundation for the implementation of the Paris Agreement in 2020, said Dong Yifan, a researcher on world studies with the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. The conference adopted a detailed transparency framework, requiring countries to provide information about their respective plans for domestic climate actions, such as the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions every two years, starting from 2024. "The aim is to urge countries to undertake emission reduction actions on the basis of facts and provide detailed information on their plans," Dong told Beijing Review. The meeting agreed on how to uniformly measure GHG emissions. Less developed countries that cannot meet the general standard will be allowed to make proportional contributions while a plan to build up their capacity is readied. Outcomes and challenges Despite much debate between developed and developing countries, the meeting finally set new targets on financial support from 2025 onwards, a follow-on to the current commitment of mobilizing $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries. They also agreed to jointly assess the effectiveness of current actions to deal with climate change by 2023, and reached consensus on monitoring and reporting the developments. Besides, they also agreed to transfer technology to developing countries to help them rise to climate challenges. According to Dong, another notable result was that the Katowice consensus reflected the key principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, which is of great concern to some developing countries such as China. Zhang of the CIIS added that China will uphold the principle and shoulder its responsibilities. A recent World Bank report titled Regulatory Indicators for Sustainable Energy 2018 says that although many countries have significantly improved their renewable energy regulations since 2010, there are still grave barriers to global progress on sustainable energy. Global GHG emissions hit a record high this year and are growing at their fastest rate in seven years. Researchers at the University of East Anglia and the Global Carbon Project, which seeks to quantify global carbon emissions and their causes, have warned that to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, emissions have to be slashed 50 percent by 2030 and reach zero around 2050. But the Katowice meeting fell short of endorsing a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the devastating effects of even a 1.5-degree-Celsius rise in global warming and instead, merely welcomed the "timely completion" of the report. This demonstrated that some nations have not woken up to the urgency of the report. COP24 failed to spur a greater desire to cut emissions sufficiently, Dong said. While it showed undoubted progress in the global response to climate change, still greater efforts are needed from all countries to effectively combat climate change. While the adoption of the guideline is a landmark, decisions on some few key issues were postponed to next year due to divisions between different countries. These include how to create a carbon credit market and distribute the funding from developed countries to help developing countries better adapt to climate challenges. China's role China, with its unique geographical location and stage of development, was at the forefront of the challenging negotiations during the conference, Zhang said. It served as a bridge to promote negotiations between developing countries and developed countries on some key issues. Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna claimed in interviews that China's role at the negotiating table couldn't be overestimated. Since 2017, China has been a torchbearer of ecological civilization. Michal Kurtyka, President of COP24 , said that with the effective measures it has adopted, China has become an example for other countries amid divisions and uncertainties. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore has also hailed China's leadership in tackling climate change, saying it is one of the few countries on track to meet its Paris commitment. In recent years, China has made remarkable efforts and invested a lot to ease pressure on the environment. For instance, to reduce GHG emission, China has encouraged the use of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) by offering tax exemptions and purchase subsidies. It has been the world's largest NEV market for three consecutive years, with some 777,000 NEVs sold in 2017 alone. Sales in the first 10 months of this year jumped 75.6 percent year on year to 860,000 units. According to Ministry of Ecology and Environment statistics, in 2017 China's carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP declined by approximately 46 percent compared to 2005, exceeding the 2020 target of reducing carbon intensity by 40-45 percent. The share of coal in energy consumption in 2017 was 60.4 percent, down 1.6 percent from 2016. Non-fossil energy accounted for 13.8 percent of primary energy consumption, up 0.5 percent compared with 2016. Afforestation and forest protection advanced, enhancing the ability to adapt to climate change. "With these goals met, a very solid foundation has been laid for meeting the target of halting the increase of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and even accomplishing that sooner than planned," Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative for climate change affairs, said ahead of the Katowice conference. China is well positioned to meet its carbon dioxide emission peaking target by 2030 and will remain steadfast in addressing climate change and implementing the Paris Agreement, Xie said. \</doc>

What can we expect of the United Nations Climate Change Conference that opened in Katowice, Poland, on Monday? We sincerely hope that it will no longer serve up just a diet of rhetoric and instead produce a down-to-earth action plan in which all countries do their bit. But that requires the major countries to demonstrate the political will to agree on ways to implement the promises they made in the 2015 Paris treaty to limit temperature rises to avert runaway global warming. The only solace we've got is that the just concluded G20 summit at the weekend reiterated the commitment of 19 of the major economies to the fight against climate change - the odd one out being the United States, whose current administration seems to perversely view global warming as simply a vagary of nature, and reiterated its withdrawal from the climate accord to which most other countries have now signed up. China is a strong advocate for joint efforts by the international community to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted in China in 2017 declined by 46 percent compared with that in 2015, according to a report on China's policies and actions to fight against climate change, demonstrating that China is acting to fulfill its promise to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and will spare no efforts in making it happen earlier. It hopes that a mechanism will be established to guarantee that the Paris Agreement will be implemented to the letter, and the Talanoa Dialogue will continue to take stock of what all major signatory countries have done and will do by 2020. Those developed countries in particular are expected to show their political will and help their developing counterparts with both funds and technologies to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide. The clock is ticking on a climate bomb whose chain reaction and fallout should it go off would have catastrophic consequences for all life on Earth. There is still time to defuse it, but not much. There is no time left for talking, what is needed is action - from everyone. (China Daily 12/04/2018 page8) \</doc>

Developed economies should bear in mind the philosophy of "being strict with ourselves and lenient toward others" as they make plans to head to Poland for the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference , a senior official said. Li Gao, director-general of climate change, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the comment during a news conference on Wednesday in Beijing. The main task of the climate conference this year, which will be held in Katowice, Poland, from Dec 2 to 14, is to complete negotiations over the detailed rules to implement the Paris Agreement, which aims for a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels, said Li. Li said the detailed rule for the implementation should be drafted based on the core principle of fairness as well as differentiated responsibilities. There is huge gap between the capability of developed and developing countries. The capability of different countries and their national conditions should be taken into consideration. "If we fail to adhere to this principle, it will be difficult to reach consensus. This is very important," he said. In previous negotiations, some developed countries raised very detailed requirements for developing countries in reducing greenhouse emissions. Actually, it's not that developing countries don't want to offer the information demanded by the developed countries, but they are capacity-constrained in doing so, he said. It seems that developed countries employ different standards when they respond to developing countries' requirements for tackling climate change, he said. "Traditional Chinese culture teaches us that we should be strict with ourselves and lenient toward others. We found in previous negotiations that some developed countries carry a very different philosophy in that they are lenient with themselves but strict toward others. This hinders us in reaching consensus," said Li. Many developing countries have to depend on funds from developed countries to realize their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or the goal of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions published by countries that signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change before the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference. "Funding is always a core issue in negotiations over climate change. It's a core concern as it is actually related to whether or not developing countries will be able to have adequate capability to contribute more in tackling climate change. We hope developed countries will offer sufficient and effective financial support for developing countries," Li said. He also said developed countries should proactively respond to developing countries' concerns over transparency of their financial support.

MADRID, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi discussed the upcoming Group of 20 (G20) summit and climate change with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian by phone on Tuesday. Wang is accompanying Chinese President Xi Jinping on a state visit to Spain. Wang said that Xi will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the G20 Buenos Aires summit, which will be of great significance to advancing China-France relations for the next stage. "China is willing to strengthen strategic coordination with the French side to help ensure that the G20 summit can produce positive outcomes," Wang said. For his part, Le Drian said that Macron is looking forward to meeting with Xi in Buenos Aires. As tackling climate change is one of the important topics for this year's G20 summit, the two sides should make joint efforts to push the G20 members to speak with one voice in this regard at the summit and inject fresh impetus into securing the success of the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is scheduled to be held in Poland in December, Le Drian said. Wang stressed that it is quite necessary for China and France, as comprehensive strategic partners, to strengthen strategic communication on major international issues, including the agenda of the G20 summit.

INCHEON, South Korea, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a world body assessing the science related to climate change, urged "rapid and far-reaching" changes in all aspects of the entire world on Monday to fight against global warming after adopting a special report on global warming. The 48th IPCC session lasted for five days to Friday in South Korea's western port city of Incheon, bringing together about 570 representatives from 135 countries and international organizations. It approved the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius that will be a key scientific input into the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Poland in December. The report highlighted a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in comparison to 2 degrees Celsius or higher. It examined pathways available to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, what it would take to achieve them and what the consequences could be. The report found that limiting the warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require "rapid and far-reaching" transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities. The special report was requested by 195 nations when they adopted the Paris Agreement in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the UNFCCC. The report would become a key scientific basis for the COP24 to the UNFCCC, scheduled for December in Poland, according to the IPCC. The IPCC was established by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments about climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Representatives from many countries gather in Katowice, Poland, for the 24th Conference of the Parties COP24 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Photo: Shan Jie China, the largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, has been promoting the building of a market system for the carbon emissions trade, China's special representative said.China pays great attention to using the market mechanism to confront climate change, Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Representative on Climate Change, said on Monday at a side event of the Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland.Since 2011, China has been conducting trials on local carbon trading in seven provinces and cities. By October, the traded emissions quota exceeded 264 million tons in the trial regions, with transactions worth over 6 billion yuan ($860 million), Xie said.The sections and companies in the trial areas have realized a dual reduction in the amount and intensity of carbon emissions, which shows the great effects of using the carbon market to control the emissions of greenhouse gas and gain experience for the future construction of a national carbon emissions trade, he noted.China is also learning from the practices and experience of the overseas carbon market, Xie said.As a market mechanism, the carbon emissions trade could effectively lower the cost on emissions reduction to achieve the goal of controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon market is playing a more significant role in promoting the global governance of climate.The carbon emissions trading system in China includes power generation, the iron and steel production and cement manufacturing sectors in seven provinces and municipalities. Under the scheme, enterprises are assigned emissions quotas, and those producing more than their share of emissions are allowed to buy unused quotas in the market from those that cause less pollution.

President Xi Jinping holds a welcoming ceremony for Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday. Feng Yongbin/China Daily Interconnectivity with Latin American countries high on bilateral talks agenda China and Chile should connect their development strategies and promote interconnectivity between Chile and other Latin American countries, President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday. Xi made the remark while meeting with Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Pinera is on a five-day state visit and planned to attend the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. Premier Li Keqiang also met with him on Wednesday. Xi said Chile is the first South American country to have established diplomatic relations with China, and the first Latin American nation to fully acknowledge China's status as a market-oriented economy. Xi said that Chile, the first Latin American country to have signed a bilateral free trade agreement with China and to have upgraded the agreement, is an important cooperation partner in jointly building the Belt and Road. The two countries should take the opportunity to jointly build the Belt and Road, deepen mutual political trust and pragmatic cooperation and promote the development of the China-Chile comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level, Xi said. The two countries should promote the upgrading of bilateral trade and investment and enhance cooperation in such areas as minerals, clean energy, information technology, e-commerce, innovation and scientific research on the Antarctic, he said. Xi called on the two countries to make joint efforts to celebrate the 50th anniversary of China-Chile diplomatic ties next year and promote people-to-people exchanges. China supports Chile's hosting of the United Nations climate change conference and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation economic leaders' meeting this year, Xi said. Xi added that the two countries should jointly promote the building of the Asia-Pacific free trade zone and maintain the multilateral trading system. He said China and Latin American countries should support each other, make full use of their complementary advantages and achieve win-win cooperation. The two sides should pursue common development and jointly build a community with a shared future for China and Latin America, Xi added. The Chilean president said the Belt and Road Initiative, put forward by Xi, has shown the glorious history of the ancient Silk Road and promoted exchanges between different cultures in the new era. Chile supports the building of the Belt and Road, and it hopes to learn from China's experience in innovative and green development, he said. Pinera said Chile, which is dedicated to maintaining multilateralism and the multilateral trading system, would like to enhance coordination with China on regional and multilateral affairs. With the two presidents as witnesses, China and Chile signed a number of cooperation documents after the talks. According to Chilean Ambassador Luis Schmidt, the two countries on Wednesday secured a deal to open the Chinese market to Chilean pears. He said he is expecting the first pear exports to China to take place soon. \</doc>

<figure><figcaption> Climate change protesters demonstrate on Saturday in central London, prior to the United Nations climate change conference in Poland. [PETER NICHOLLS/REUTERS] </figcaption></figure> KATOWICE, Poland - With the direst warnings yet of impending environmental disaster still ringing in their ears, representatives from nearly 200 nations gathered on Sunday in Poland to firm up their plan to prevent catastrophic climate change. The UN climate summit comes at a crucial juncture in mankind's response to planetary warming. The smaller, poorer nations that will bare its devastating brunt are pushing for richer states to make good on the promises they made in the 2015 Paris agreement. In Paris three years ago, countries committed to limit global temperature rises to well below 2 C, and to the safer cap of 1.5 C if at all possible. But with only 1 C of warming so far, the world has already seen a crescendo of deadly wildfires, heatwaves and hurricanes made more destructive by rising seas. In a rare intervention, presidents of previous UN climate summits issued a joint statement as the talks got under way in the Polish mining city of Katowice, calling on states to take decisive action "to tackle these urgent threats". "The impacts of climate change are increasingly hard to ignore," said the statement. "We require deep transformations of our economies and societies." In Katowice, nations must agree to a rule book palatable to all 183 states who have ratified the Paris deal. This is far from a given: the dust is still settling from US President Donald Trump's decision to ditch the Paris accord. G20 leaders on Saturday agreed a final communique after their summit in Buenos Aires, declaring that the Paris Agreement was "irreversible". But it said the US "reiterates its decision to withdraw" from the landmark accord. Even solid progress in Katowice on the Paris goals may not be enough to prevent runaway global warming, as a series of major climate reports have outlined. Just this week, the UN's environment program said the voluntary national contributions agreed in Paris would have to triple if the world was to cap global warming below 2 C. For 1.5 C, they must increase fivefold. A key issue up for debate is how the fight against climate change is funded, with developed and developing nations still world's apart in their demands. Poorer nations argue that rich countries, which are responsible for the vast majority of historic carbon emissions, must help others to fund climate action. But wealthy states, led by the US, have so far resisted calls to be more transparent in how their contributions are reported\u-243 something developing nations say is vital to form ambitious green energy plans. "The question really is: how do you ensure that ambitious actions are done in an equitable way?" AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE \</doc>

The awards ceremony of Asia Game Changers will be held in New York City, October 9, 2018. (Photo: Source) Asia Society, in partnership with Citi, has announced the recipients of its 2018 Asia Game Changer Awards in recognition of individuals and institutions who have broken barriers, defined courage, worked miracles, and in turn inspired their fellow citizens of the world. This year, Chinese businessman Wang Shi has been chosen as one of the honorees  for championing the environment  from the cities of China to the farthest reaches of the planet. Wang Shi built China Vanke Group, the organization he founded in 1984, into China\' s largest residential real estate company, now worth $34 billion. But Wang\' s great and lasting accomplishment will likely be his commitment to environmental causes. During his expeditions to Everest, he led cleanup efforts to clear refuse left behind by other climbers. He even participated in an expedition to Antarctica to highlight the effect of climate change on polar ice caps. And he has led China\' s Private Sector Delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference three times and has served as UN Environment Goodwill Ambassador. Wang spearheaded China Vanke\' s sustainable building initiatives by requiring all of its structures to achieve China\' s Green Building Evaluation certification, which requires residential buildings to conserve water, energy, materials, and other resources. This spring, he joined other prominent business leaders at the East-West Philanthropists Summit, where he gave a speech emphasizing the government\' s role in fostering environmental integrity. Wang Shi,  a global champion for green cities , joins a group of other remarkable individuals and organizations who have broken barriers, defined courage, worked miracles, and in turn inspired their fellow citizens of the world. Last week, Asia Society President and CEO Josette Sheeran said,  We honor those who are devoting their own lives to improve and save the lives of others. Humanity owes them a debt of gratitude and we are so honored to recognize their works of passion and compassion. We are proud to be a part of their journey. The group of Game Changers includes: the Thai rescuers who saved a dozen teenage soccer players in a flooded cave; the Japanese first responders who risked their lives following the tsunami and nuclear disaster at Fukushima; the founder of the Syrian White Helmets, whose volunteers are among the few  first responders remaining in that country;  a champion for women, champion for sustainability, champion for wellness, and transformative leader of an iconic global company  Indra Nooyi of the first-ever female CEO of PepsiCo; Dr. Munjed Al Muderis  a pioneering surgeon who has brought new hope for amputees; and the founders of Koolulam  a musical phenomenon that aims to bridge the most difficult ethnic and religious divides. The awards will be presented to all of the recipients at the 5th Annual Asia Game Changer Awards Dinner and Celebration in New York City on October 9, 2018. The event will also feature the first-ever US performance of Koolulam. \</doc>

HELSINKI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- A higher price for carbon was one of the solutions offered to speed up environmental efforts at a high-profile Finnish climate summit held here Wednesday. Some 500 elite representatives of municipalities, industries and universities gathered in the white marble Finlandia hall in central Helsinki, discussing the need for change and possible solutions. Veteran French politician Laurent Fabius, who chaired the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, assessed the current situation in the fight against climate change, and mentioned future agricultural methods and carbon pricing in Europe as crucial factors, among others. Fabius said the world "suffered a major setback" after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, which "sent a very bad signal" to other countries. The solution involving carbon pricing was also mentioned by other speakers including Jorma Ollila, former CEO of Nokia and current CEO of steel giant Outokumpu, who said there has not been "a strong enough price signal" that high carbon emissions from production would be bad for business. NORDIC PERFORMANCE The discussions reflected the view that while governments create the framework, citizens and businesses put ideas into practice. Kristin Skogen Lund, director general of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise, Finland's major employers' organization and the leading business lobby, assured that businesses will join the efforts "once they realize there is profit available." Ollila said that currently only 7 percent of Finnish industrial companies have a strategy that involves climate change matters, but on account of a joint Nordic electricity system, energy efficiency in Finland is at a good level. He also mentioned the steel industry has developed low carbon solutions that are "miles ahead" of those of many other countries. Outi Honkatukia, the chief Finnish negotiator for climate change, said Finland was the first country in the world to have a carbon tax, and "everyone must do more for the cause, and do it faster." Ollila suggested that Nordic countries should go alone as a group on carbon issues and not await European Union decisions "as that would mean a ten-year delay." He said he would rather favor carbon trade than taxation, "But if the funds from the tax would be used attractively, people would accept it." CIRCULAR ECONOMY Circular economy was one of the leading themes of the summit organized by the Finnish public think tank Sitra, the Finnish Climate Change Panel and the Finnish Institute for International Affairs. Anne Berner, Finnish minister for communications and transport, said circular economy is part of our daily lives already, and "We behave differently from the generations before us." Ollila told the gathering that in the Outokumpu Tornio steel plant, 85 percent of raw material are recycled. Representatives of Finnish cities reviewed the environmental aspects in their public image. Minna Arve, mayor of Turku, said people would choose where they live in the future on the basis of the environmental record of the cities. "They would choose a place that matches their values," she said. Turku, some 180 km west of Helsinki, has recently declared that it will become a carbon neutral city by 2029. Enditem \</doc>

GLOBAL temperatures in 2018 are set to be the fourth-highest on record, the UN said yesterday, stressing the urgent need for action to rein in runaway warming of the planet. In a report released ahead of the COP24 climate summit in Poland, the World Meteorological Organization pointed out that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, and that  2018 is on course to be the fourth-warmest year on record.  This would mean that the past four years  2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018  are also the four warmest years in the series, the UN agency said in its provisional report on the state of the climate this year. The  warming trend is obvious and continuing, WMO chief Petteri Taalas told reporters in Geneva. The report shows that the global average temperature for the first 10 months of the year was nearly 1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial era (1850-1900).  It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it, Taalas warned. With levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the main driver of climate change, at a record high,  we may see temperature increase of 3-5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, Taalas said.  If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher. Delegations from nearly 200 countries are due in Poland next week for the latest COP24 climate summit, aimed at renewing and building on the Paris deal and limiting global warming. World leaders have been trying to breathe new life into the 195-nation agreement amid backsliding from several nations, most notably the United States, over commitments made when it was signed in December 2015. It is to take effect in 2020 and calls for limiting global warming to less than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. But experts warn that global warming is on track to surpass 3 degrees by 2100 and urge governments to do more than first planned to rein it in.  Every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water, to the extinction of animals and plants, to the survival of coral reefs and marine life, WMO deputy chief Elena Manaenkova stressed.  It makes a difference to economic productivity, food security, and to the resilience of our infrastructure and cities, she said.  It makes a difference to the speed of glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities. \</doc>

JUNGFRAUJOCH, Switzerland - Nearly 900 postcards from youths all over the world were stamped and mailed on Wednesday from Europe's highest mailbox on the Jungfraujoch peak, Switzerland, to global leaders, calling for action against climate change. Last November, a gigantic postcard breaking the Guinness Worlds Records was staged just under the 3,466-meter-high Jungfraujoch to raise awareness worldwide of the emergency and necessity to fight climate change. At the center of the postcard was a huge slogan that read "STOP GLOBAL WARMING #1.5 C" to signify the goal of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5 C, a target recently set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It shows that under certain conditions, it's still possible to keep the impacts of climate change at a tolerable level. Copies of a special postcard, made of images of the record-breaking one, were later brought to the UN Climate Conference, or COP24 , in Poland in December, to collect handwritten anti-climate-change messages by world's youth representatives there. On Wednesday, about 900 of those postcards, some also carrying e-mail messages by youths from around the world, were stamped and sent from Europe's highest mailbox to heads of government, business leaders, and heads of international organizations in 11 countries, urging for immediate policies and action against climate change. According to SDC's Daniel Maselli, "The youths have started moving. They have raised their voices since COP24 . They want to see decision-makers taking serious measures to reduce CO2 emissions worldwide. They want to have a future." The event's high-rise location on the Aletsch Glacier has been a perfect example of climate change impact, Gass said. Stretching over 23 kilometers, the glacier in the Swiss canton of Valais is the longest in Europe, measuring 1.5 km wide on average and 900 meters at its thickest point. Scientific studies have shown that Aletsch, together with the vast majority of glaciers in central Switzerland, are melting at an ever-quickening pace and could almost disappear by the end of this century.

JUNGFRAUJOCH, Switzerland, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 900 postcards from youths all over the world were stamped and sent on Wednesday from Europe's highest postbox on the Jungfraujoch peak, Switzerland, to global leaders, calling for action against climate change. Last November, a gigantic postcard breaking the Guinness Worlds Records was staged just under the Swiss Jungfraujoch to raise awareness worldwide of the emergency and necessity to fight climate change. The huge postcard was composed of 125,000 small cards, each with drawings, messages and wishes of fighting climate change from children and youngsters from 35 countries worldwide, mostly developing countries, according to the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the event's organizer. At the center of the postcard was a huge slogan that read "STOP GLOBAL WARMING #1.5\'b0C" to signify the goal of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius, a target recently set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It shows that under certain conditions, it's still possible to keep the impacts of climate change at a tolerable level. Copies of a special postcard, made of images of the record-breaking one, were later brought to the UN Climate Conference ( COP24 ) in Poland last December, to collect hand-written anti-climate-change messages by world's youth representatives there. On Wednesday, about 900 of those postcards, some of which also carrying e-mail messages by youths from around the world, were stamped and sent from Europe's highest postbox on the Jungfraujoch to heads of government, business leaders, and heads of international organizations in 11 countries, urging for immediate policies and action against climate change. According to Daniel Maselli, with the SDC, the messages will go to an array of global leaders, including the UN secretary-general, the German chancellor, and the British prime minister. "The youths have started moving. They have raised their voices since COP24 . They want to see decision makers taking serious measures to reduce CO2 emissions worldwide. They want to have a future," Daniel said. Two Swiss teenagers, Sarangan and Selma, both 17 and helping to stamp the postcards at Jungfraujoch, also voiced their calls for people to drive electric cars, which would be better for global warming, and for governments to make new rules and regulations to reduce CO2 emissions. The event's location, the Aletsch glacier, situated at an altitude of more than 3,400 meters, has been a perfect example of climate change impact, Gass said. Stretching over 23 km, the Aletsch Glacier in the Swiss canton of Valais is the longest in Europe, measuring 1.5 km wide on average and 900 meters at its thickest point. Scientific studies in Switzerland have shown that the Aletsch glacier, together with the vast majority of glaciers in central Switzerland, are melting at an ever-quickening pace and could almost disappear by the end of this century. According to the SDC, many of the world's glaciers are shrinking rapidly and will disappear completely in the near future. Enditem \</doc>

December 1, 2018: Climate change protesters demonstrate in London before the United Nations climate change conference is held in Poland. VCG On December 12, 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted by consensus of nearly 200 state parties showing great willingness to work together to protect the common home of humankind. Just three years later, however, the ninth Emission Gap Report released by the UN Environment delivered a jarring wake-up call: Current national emission reduction commitments are far from enough to meet the climate target of 2030. The report also stressed that to achieve the Paris Agreement\' s target of limiting the increase in average global temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, commitments to emission reduction need to be quadrupled from current levels. To limit the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, efforts would need to increase five-fold. Global carbon emissions continue to increase year by year, and in 2018 the annual growth rate reached an all-time high of 2.7 percent. Global warming is no longer a theoretical prediction by scientists, but a harsh reality. Unusually high temperatures in the Arctic Circle above 30 degrees Celsius have led to the thawing of the permafrost. Near Greenland, the Arctic\' s thickest sheet of sea ice broke up for the first time in thousands of years. And the California wildfires in the United States consumed vast swaths of forests and pastures, resulting in heavy casualties and economic losses. A polar bear prowls a barren landscape on the shores of Hudson Bay, Canada. As the Arctic and sub-Arctic sea ice melts due to global warming, polar bears face long summers without fat reserves from seals. VCG Regardless of how long U.S. President Donald Trump continues to deny the consequences of rising carbon emissions, the irreversible damage to the planet will continue. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that the impacts of global warming of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will lead to devastating climate consequences after 2030. Only 12 years remain for decisive preventative action before the planet becomes a greenhouse by 2030. Another noteworthy development is that although countries that had looked to Washington to promote strong climate agreements remain hesitant, China has shown strong determination to step up to the challenge, emphasizing the cost of carbon emissions and using carbon pricing as an important method of reducing emissions. China has successfully reduced coal consumption for three consecutive years. Through supportive policies, sales of electric vehicles in the country are also growing steadily. In recent years, China has constantly stressed  green development by reducing demand for coal-fired power, expanding the clean energy market and improving the national carbon trading system. Examining root causes and seeking effective solutions, China\' s commitment to promoting global green and low-carbon development and building a community with a shared future for humanity has been recognized by many countries. China will continue to play an important role in South-South cooperation in the field of climate change. In the future, the international community will closely monitor China\' s actions, in the hope that it will contribute Chinese experience, wisdom and fresh approaches to tackling global climate change. But we must keep in mind that the road to green development remains arduous and long. Under the Paris Agreement, no mechanism forces any country to set a specific target by a specific date. As severe consequences of climate change continue to emerge, how to allocate emission reduction tasks and achieve a balance between climate governance and national development is still an important issue that urgently needs to be discussed by all countries. In any case, reduction of carbon emissions has become urgent and imminent.  This new report makes it clearer than ever that we\' re in the race of our lives, declared Nathaniel Keohane, senior vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund.  Our fate and the fate of our children is in our hands. We can make decisions that protect our communities, our children and future generations, or we can pass on a world far different and more damaged than the one we inherited.

As the year 2018 is coming to an end, the Lanzhou environmental protection bureau recently reviewed its year-long efforts to improve the city's air quality and deployed new plans for next year's air pollution prevention and control. Located between two mountains and home to a considerable amount of heavy industry, Lanzhou, capital of Northwest China's Gansu province, had suffered heavily from pollution over the past few decades and was listed as one of the cities with the heaviest air pollution nationwide. After years of effort, however, it has improved its air quality to such an extent that it received a prize at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris, France. The environmental watchdog said that this year the city recorded 204 days with excellent or fine air quality as of the end of November, with the average density of PM10 and PM2.5 - hazardous particles smaller than 10 and 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter - falling by 13.1 percent and 8.7 percent respectively over the previous year. This marks the city's lowest density on record since 2013. In addition, there was no severe air pollution caused by human factors, according to the watchdog. Rui Wengang, director of the environmental protection bureau, said: "We have highlighted the comprehensive application of scientific and technological means to prevent and control the air pollution this winter." Lanzhou has also resorted to remote monitoring technologies to better implement the prohibition of straw burning, one of the major emission sources of air pollution in towns and villages. It set up a related integrated monitoring platform, through which the supervision departments at the municipal, district, county and village levels can discover on their computers or cell phones those areas where straw burning is taking place almost as soon as it happens, significantly enhancing workplace efficiency. In the city, registered construction sites are now all equipped with online video monitors and PM10 testing facilities, and fixed infrared remote sensing devices and movable testing vans are also used to examine the exhausts of vehicles throughout the city. Some experts worry that environmental protection might curb economic development. But in Lanzhou, these two things are not a zero-sum game, as the city allows and encourages 24-hour construction on sites that have properly implemented the six dust suppression measures required by the city's environmental protection bureau to ensure economic growth. The city has also invested heavily in the treatment of industrial pollution. Many power plants in Lanzhou have finished reconstruction to meet the ultra-low emissions standards. The industrial emission in urban areas has reached the city's lowest ever level, according to the bureau. The bureau has also made efforts in curbing airborne pollutants from coal-fired boilers and urban residents' bulk coal consumption. The bulk coal consumption is expected to fall to less than 150,000 tons this winter, a drop of 50 percent over the same period in 2016. Rui said that the bureau has paid great attention to the opinions from central environmental protection inspectors regarding rectification, and has made improvements in nearly 81 percent of related issues to date. In the coming years, the bureau will continue to make every effort to protect the environment in Lanzhou and to transform the city into a modernized regional center, Rui said. It will also work to maintain the environmental security and protect the rights of people, while continuing to strive for good air quality and an improved environment to benefit the public, he added.

NEXT month, the Global Climate Action Summit  one of the largest international gatherings on climate change the world has seen  will be held in San Francisco. The event, whose theme is  Take Ambition to the Next Level, aims to serve as a launchpad for accelerated action that will enable the world to meet the goals set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. It is a golden opportunity to make progress in the effort to combat global warming, but it can be seized only with the involvement of all stakeholders. With the Paris climate agreement, the international community agreed to limit the rise in average global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius  and ideally 1.5 degrees Celsius  above pre-industrial levels. To that end, national governments were tasked with developing their own climate-action plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). But national governments cannot do it alone. Everyone  including those at all levels of government, as well as business leaders, investors, and civil society  must contribute. There is unprecedented global momentum to build a low-carbon, climate-secure future, characterized by a dynamic green economy, a thriving society, and a healthy environment. Globally, renewable power accounted for 70 percent of net additions to power-generating capacity in 2017, according to the Renewables 2018 Global Status Report. Moreover, as part of the Under2 Coalition, over 200 states, regions, and local authorities have committed to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80 below 1990 levels by 2050. Urban centers are also proving their capacity for climate innovation and leadership. New York City has mandated the retrofitting of 14,500 of the city\' s most polluting buildings. Shenzhen has become the first city in the world with a fully electric bus fleet. Curitiba, Brazil, has introduced a new model of urban food production. And Oslo has created a climate budget to guide financial decision-making. At the business level, more than 700 companies with a total market capitalization of over US$16 trillion have made far-reaching climate commitments, according to the We Mean Business Coalition. And 289 investors, holding nearly US$30 trillion in assets, have signed on to Climate 100+, a five-year initiative to engage with the world\' s largest corporate greenhouse-gas emitters to improve governance on climate change, curb emissions, and strengthen climate-related financial disclosures. Yet we are far from being in the clear. Scientists agree that global carbon dioxide emissions must reach a turning point in 2020 if we are to achieve carbon neutrality (with emissions low enough to be safely absorbed by forests, soils, and other natural systems) by mid-century. So far, nearly 50 countries have or may have reached their emissions peaks, and more may soon join their ranks. This is progress, but it is not enough. In fact, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are still accumulating at a rate that will soon take us well above the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold, beyond which some of the worst effects of climate change cannot be staved off. On current trends, average global temperatures could well rise by 3 degrees Celsius, imperiling vital natural systems like coral reefs, rainforests, and the polar regions. All relevant stakeholders need to strengthen their climate commitments. To kick-start that process, the Global Climate Action Summit and its partners have issued a wide array of new challenges, including zero-waste goals in cities, a target of 500 companies adopting science-based targets, and initiatives to accelerate uptake of zero-emission vehicles. Such efforts would not just protect our environment; they would also boost our economies. A recent report by the New Climate Economy suggests that, in transportation alone, a low-carbon transition would create 23 million jobs worldwide annually. Perhaps more important, a show of climate-action ambition from leaders across sectors would likely inspire national governments to increase their own NDCs ahead of this December\' s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland, where governments will finalize the implementation guidelines of the Paris agreement.

China, France and the United Nations reiterated their firm commitments to work together on combating climate change after a three-party meeting on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders' Summit. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also met the media together after their meeting. The three agreed that the international community should work together to present a united voice on climate change and jointly promote it to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to achieve significant progress. During the meeting, Wang outlined China's position and proposal to promote international cooperation on climate change control, calling on all countries to be responsible, take action, strengthen cooperation, and jointly promote multilateral processes. Wang emphasized three key words: commitment, action and collaboration. "Three years ago, President Xi Jinping pointed out at the Paris Conference on Climate Change that the Paris Agreement was not the end, but a new starting point," Wang said. The 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as COP24 , will be held in Katowice, Poland, this month. Wang described this as an important step toward a multilateral process on climate change. "It is vital for each party member to cement their confidence in dealing with climate change and effectively implement the Paris Agreement," he said. Wang said China's determination to deal with climate change is unswerving. The country has been vigorously implementing the concepts of innovation, coordination, becoming green, openness and sharing, as well as its National Plan on Climate Change (2014-20). China was the first nation to come up with a national plan on implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, embarking on a path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development. Wang stressed that China has been consistent in its stand on multilateral processes and has been strengthening global climate control and deepening South-South Cooperation. Through its green Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing aims to achieve global cooperation on low-carbon development to build a global ecological civilization. Wang also said China is willing to work with France to get positive results at COP24 in Katowice in order to build a beautiful world for humankind. Le Drian indicated that France was willing to cooperate with China on climate change dialogue, including supporting developing countries' transitions to green and low-carbon development through third-party cooperation. He also indicated that France believes that China's hosting of the 2020 Global Conference on Biological Diversity Conservation will be a success. Guterres said climate change was "running faster" than predicted and "we are facing an extremely difficult situation". It was now clear that the Paris Agreement needed to be fully met, he said. "It is my belief that technology is on our side - we see renewable energy is now cheaper and more competitive than fossil fuels, we see the green economy becoming the best economy, and I have no doubt that those who will not bet on the green economy will have a gray future," he said. Guterres thanked China for its important leadership in the global response to climate change. He also applauded China and France for leading the international community to actively cope with the enormous challenges they face.

KATOWICE, Poland, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Many of the world's largest energy-consuming countries have significantly improved their renewable energy regulations since 2010, said a new World Bank report released here on Monday. The number of countries with strong policy frameworks for sustainable energy more than tripled - from 17 to 59 - between 2010 and 2017, said the report. According to RISE 2018, a World Bank report charting global progress on sustainable energy policies, progress was even more marked in energy efficiency, with the percentage of countries establishing advanced policy frameworks growing more than ten-fold between 2010 and 2017. RISE 2018 measures policy progress in 133 countries on renewable energy, energy efficiency, electricity access, and access to clean cooking - the four target areas of UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), which calls for achieving access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. Among the countries covered by RISE, only 37 percent had a national renewable energy target in 2010. By 2017, that had grown to 93 percent. By 2017, 84 percent of countries had a legal framework in place to support renewable energy deployment, while 95 percent allowed the private sector to own and operate renewable energy projects. Over the same period, the share of countries that had put in place national legislation on energy efficiency rose from 25 percent to 89 percent, according to the report. However, there are still significant barriers to global progress on sustainable energy, said the report. While countries continue to be focused on clean energy policies for electricity, policies to decarbonize heating and transportation - which account for 80 percent of global energy use - continue to be overlooked, it said. "Policy matters. RISE 2018 confirms the numbers that make it clear that policy is a leading indicator of the world's sustainable energy transition," said Riccardo Puliti, senior director for Energy and Extractives at the World Bank. But the report also contains a warning: that without accelerated adoption of good policies, and strong enforcement, the world's climate goals and SDG7 are at risk, he noted. Among the four SDG7 target areas, clean cooking continues to be the most overlooked and underfunded by policymakers, said the report. While the report finds some evolution in policy frameworks since 2010, there has been little progress on standard-setting for cookstoves or on consumer and producer incentives to stimulate adoption of clean technologies. "There is a great opportunity now for countries to learn from each other to accelerate the uptake of good policies," said Puliti. The World Bank report was released here during the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The two-week conference, which runs until Friday, aims to finalize the implementation guidelines and provide clarity on how to carry out the Paris deal fairly for all participating countries. Michal Kurtyka, president of the COP24 and state secretary of Poland's Ministry of Energy, told Xinhua that China has been developing effective solutions to tackle climate change, an example for other countries in this regard. Thanks to increased investment in green energy, China's carbon intensity, or the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product, in 2017 declined by 46 percent from the level in 2005, meeting the target ahead of schedule of a 40-45 percent drop by 2020. "Given the size of the economy, and even the path and the rapidity of development, it (China) is one of the fastest growing energy markets. So it is a very important impact on the world in terms of investment capacity but also in terms of example," he added. Enditem \</doc>

LONDON - Tucked away in the leafy Cotswold hills, English fourth-tier club Forest Green Rovers rarely make sporting headlines but have become unlikely trailblazers for something more pressing than three points on a Saturday afternoon. At this week's major United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, the club's chairman, Dale Vince, received an award for his work in making Rovers the world's greenest soccer club. One of 15 projects to win Momentum for Change awards, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) deputy executive secretary Ovais Sarmad described the Gloucestershire club, founded in 1889 and nicknamed the Green Devils, as "the de-facto standard for sustainability in sport". Businessman Vince, a former New Age traveler and founder and owner of renewable-energy company Ecotricity, believes sport can be an important tool in tackling climate change. After taking over his cash-strapped local team in 2010, he set about getting it into the Football League and becoming the world's first UN-certified carbon-neutral soccer club. The first mission was achieved in 2017 with a memorable playoff win over Tranmere Rovers at Wembley, and this year the second goal was achieved. Vince's vision is all over Forest Green's aptly named New Lawn stadium. It features solar panels on the roof of one of the stands, has an organic, pesticide-free pitch mowed by solar-powered mobots, water and cooking oil-recycling systems and electric-car charging ports outside the stadium. Wildlife trails that are home to rare orchids and slow worms (legless lizards) flank the ground, while one initiative has gone down especially well - a vegan-only catering policy. Some may miss the traditional match-day whiff of frying sausages, but Vince said Forest Green's eco-friendly menu is so popular that fans travel from afar to matches "just to eat the food". "The bar has always been low when it comes to football food," said Vince, who spoke to delegates from FIFA, the International Olympic Committee and Paris 2024 while in Poland this week. "Some fans tell me they only come for the food! Our match-day food sales have quadrupled since we made the changes. Some football fans have adopted us because of our stance. "We've created a new kind of fan." The 5,000-capacity stadium is powered entirely by green energy from Ecotricity while a new stadium, built entirely from sustainably sourced wood and designed by renowned architect Zaha Hadid, could be ready in three years. As world leaders continue to debate in Poland how to achieve the goals set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement, the 57-year-old Vince says sport can bring the "biggest threat we face" to a wider audience, with little Forest Green leading the way. "Sport has a responsibility to do what it can, and that means from fans to governing bodies," he said. "We have shown what can be done. The UN and FIFA are holding us up as an example to other clubs and that's incredible. "It's quite an improbable combination I think - the environment and football - but we've pulled it off. "We've engaged a lot with other sports clubs and organizations around the world, so it's been a great success." Forest Green's stance has seen fan clubs set up in 20 countries and regions, while officials from Paris 2024 are set to pay a visit soon as they bid to make their Olympics the greenest yet. And Vince's eco philosophy is having an impact both on and off the pitch. Attendances have quadrupled since 2010, while this season Forest Green is eighth in the standings and challenging for promotion to League One. Vince says the vegan policy has improved fitness levels and lowered injury rates. "The players buy into the vegan thing from a performance point of view," he said. "There is so much evidence out there that vegan diets enhance performance. "Look at elite athletes like Lewis Hamilton in F1, Serena Williams in tennis and (Manchester City striker) Sergio Aguero. We have seen a real drop in soft-tissue injuries. When we played Tranmere at Wembley a couple of years ago after about 50 games in the season, we had no injuries. Our situation was exceptional."

We marvel at the hectic news reporting every yearend as we change to a new calendar, yet 2018 has still proved itself particularly eventful by all standards. A despicable trade war by the US sent shockwaves around globe, but failed to dim the dazzling achievements of China's reform and opening-up. Much of the world still falls under terrorist threat, in contrast with effective measures in China's Xinjiang that eradicate extremism and improve people's livelihood.The Global Times In-Depth correspondents witnessed and covered many of the major issues on the scene, with both close-up vividness and macroscopic analysis.In-Depth reporters excel in portraying a bigger picture and establishing the relevance of either an everyday occurrence or State policies to the broader socio-political situation.They travel across and beyond China, to countries and regions thousands of kilometers away yet still closely connected to China, economically or politically.They reach out to the people and feel what the locals desire. Their research becomes true and powerful words to better communicate China to the outside world.Liu Xin on Xinjiang issues I went to Northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in late September to report on vocational and educational training centers. During my visit to some training centers in Hotan and Kashi, I was impressed by some female trainees' stories about their previous lives. When extremism went viral in these places, some women were forced to wear a burka, some were beaten by their husbands, and some were abandoned with the man saying talaq three times (a type of instant divorce in Islam), leaving them raising the children alone.I told stories of these women, about their previous life and the current one. They now earn a monthly salary with vocational skills they learned in the centers. They also won the right to lead their own lives.I think that China's Xinjiang is seeking a way to crack down on extremism. This process needs time to verify the results and also needs space to be improved. And I am and will keep paying attention to stories that happen in Xinjiang.Hu Yuwei on China-India military ties It was a marvelous and impressive experience for me to report on the "Hand-in-Hand" 2018 China-India counter-terrorism exercise in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province.It enabled me to come closer to seeing how two armies understand each other despite a language barrier with gestures, eye contact and shared feelings. I was impressed by the resumed friendship and trust between the two after the border stand-off in 2017. The carefully prepared evening party after the training was full of joy and camaraderie. Many Indian soldiers greeted this reporter in Chinese and expressed their gratitude. As a Chinese reporter, this is probably the best end-of-the-year gift - to see Chinese and Indian military forces repair their relationship. I look forward to hearing more good news about China-India cooperation next year.Shan Jie on climate change I was in Katowice, Poland, for two weeks on my own covering the UN COP24 climate change conference this December.I spent a lot of time with the Chinese delegation during the conference, observing the members working. Many of the delegates were very young, born after 1985, but they are veterans in climate change negotiations with years of experience. They told me that it is a holy task to represent China on an international stage. In the intensive negotiations, they were under great pressure and had little time to rest. So I felt empathy when I saw their relieved smile after the COP24 president announced the adoption of the implementation plan for of the Paris agreement. It is a step toward humans saving our future, and these Chinese young people have played a key role in the process. The COP24 is the longest reporting task I have ever undertaken. It was tiring, challenging yet meaningful. Zhang Dan on trade friction As a novice journalist, one of the most impressive stories I did this year was about the soybeans grown by a Chinese company in Russia's Far East amid the China-US trade friction.China's Heilongjiang Province is dubbed the country's granary. Hence it will definitely support China's soybean supply under the current circumstance. Smart Chinese businessmen came up with the idea of growing soybeans in Russia's Far East so that the border areas of both countries could enjoy a revival. Local Russian farmers and Chinese farmers were both glad to see the agricultural cooperation between the two countries. From another perspective, the trade friction brought both sides of the border opportunities. Sometimes, the people who I interviewed and the places I have been take me to a new world. That's where I found the fun part of journalism. Zhang Yu on China-Vatican relations Over the past year, I witnessed new breakthroughs in China-Vatican relations. As a reporter who has covered the beat for years, it was really exciting to see China and the Holy See finally signing a provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops in September. Although the agreement is just a start, changes have already taken place. In some dioceses, the former "underground" church has already merged with the State-sanctioned church as churchgoers pray together in Sunday masses. I expect to see more of these changes in the year to come.Li Lei on reform, opening-up With a mission of reporting changes to the Three Gorges over the past two decades, my priority was to interview people who had been to the place 20 years ago.In a caf\'e9 of the cruise ship we took, David Swanson, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, who had travelled to China seven times, told me stories of his first trip there while sipping a beer. In his stories, there are shabby houses along the two banks and poor children begging for money from tourists with a long stick with a basket on an end.Twenty years later, outside the porthole of the gorgeous cruise are many modern cities and confident people benefiting from China's reform and opening-up.On the last day of the voyage, we arrived at the Three Gorges Dam which has been controversial since its establishment. In Swanson's memory, the dam under construction was "spooky." Twenty years later, when he visited the dam again, he said it was benign and it is a part of China.

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday called on world leaders to promote a fair globalization. "It is imperative that we address the root causes (of crisis of confidence in globalization and governments) and work together to promote a fair globalization," the UN chief told reporters here before he departed for the G20 Summit in Argentina and the climate conference in Poland, COP24 . Noting that the world is facing "a crisis of confidence," the secretary-general said that those left behind by globalization are losing trust in governments and institutions and inequality is pervasive and increasing, especially within nations. The UN chief also highlighted trade disputes, which he said "are escalating," adding that an "undercurrent of geopolitical tensions" is adding further pressure to the global economy. "The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint for that fair globalization. I hope leaders at the G20 will give it a strong push forward," he said. "But let's not forget that equity is not just a matter for this generation. We must think of generations to come," he noted. Enditem \</doc>

BRUSSELS, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- About 70,000 people took part in the 2nd "Rise for Climate" march on the rainy streets of Brussels on Sunday to pressure the Belgian government and the European Union to increase their efforts to fight climate change. The event was described as Belgium's biggest climate march ever, exceeding previous demonstrations held this month. The protest march began at 1.30pm from the Gare du Nord and the crowds arrived shortly after 3pm at the Place du Luxembourg, at the headquarters of the European Parliament, where a series of speeches and concerts were performed until 6pm. "Humanity is facing the greatest challenge it has ever faced on Earth, and it is imperative that we should make our politicians accountable!" cried the organizers in front of crowds of protesters. "The fight looks long and difficult, but we will not let go," they added. The protesters waved banners and placards smeared with all sorts of slogans, such as "No More Company Cars", "Act Now", "No time to waste". While 30,000 people arrived by train, many others joined the gathering by bicycle and on foot. This march follows an earlier demonstration of more than 65,000 people held in Brussels on Dec. 2, a date that coincided with the first day of the COP24 that opened in Poland, a major international meeting to discuss the fight against climate change. Since the beginning of this year, Belgian school children and students have also taken matters into their own hands. So far, they have organized a number of spontaneous marches and announced plans to keep holding demonstrations every Thursday, at the risk of skipping classes if necessary. Enditem \</doc>

SEOUL, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an international body set up to assess the science related to climate change, launched its 48th session in South Korea's western port city of Incheon Monday to adopt a special report on global warming. The session, set to last until Friday, was attended by about 570 representatives from 135 countries and international organizations, according to Seoul's foreign ministry. South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a video message to the opening session that the entire world needed to determine and act toward the abnormal climate, which has become the norm and posed a threat to the world. Moon expressed his hope for the session to adopt the special report, titled Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius, to address the climate change with stronger international efforts. A press conference was scheduled to be held next Monday to present the Summary for Policymakers of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius, which would include the impacts of global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and suggestions to curb global warming. The report was requested by governments when they adopted the Paris agreement in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). COP24 ) to the UNFCCC, slated to be held in Poland in December. Enditem \</doc>

It's that time of the year world leaders seem extremely concerned about climate change, the changing weather conditions, the fate of humankind and the world it inhabits. Yet it is heartening to note some world leaders still spare a thought for the planet, even if for different reasons. The ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, has a lot on its agenda, the prime one being finalizing the rules of the 2015 Paris Agreement. And although not on the negotiations agenda, the conference is expected to discuss the forest policy, because the negotiations on market mechanisms, transparency and guidelines for building Nationally Determined Contributions will directly affect forests. Which has acquired added importance in the light of forest loss increasing significantly in Brazil even though it has decreased in Indonesia. In particular, concluding the negotiations on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is essential for finalizing deals on market mechanisms before 2020, so countries can use the to be created markets to fulfill their NDCs that in turn will allow them to channel funds for forest conservation. That conservation of forests is critically important to keeping global temperature rise to within 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century is general knowledge today. However, a UN report last month said the world has to triple its emission reduction efforts to stay within 2C rise. Why? Because the recent greenhouse gas (GHG) levels have set new records. Yet even keeping the temperature rise to within 2C may not prevent the dieback of coral reefs, sea level rise or extreme weather. The aim therefore should be a 1.5C rise in temperature, which seems impossible, given the current state of the world and its obsession with business as usual - and in many cases a disdain for anything beneficiary to the environment, ecology or biodiversity. But for now, let's focus on the findings of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: continuous increase in GHG emissions over the next 12 years could lead to a "breaching of the 1.5C limit". Which will be nothing short of a disaster for the future of the planet and its human inhabitants. Thanks to the continuous rise in GHG emissions, the oceans have been absorbing an increasing amount of heat, which resulted in the mild La Nina event early this year only for El Nino conditions to return in October that could further raise temperatures. The tragedy is, global temperatures have continuously increased in the first 10 months of this year, with the average rise in 2018 being 1C above pre-industrial levels. Sea ice and glaciers continue to melt, and sea levels are rising. The past four years have been the hottest on record, with the 20 warmest occurring in the past 22 years. The warning is unmistakable, said the World Meteorological Organization last month, cautioning that, given the current trend, global warming could reach 3C to 5C by the end of this century, which could mean the end of the world as we know it. Still, some governments continue to label climate change a hoax and insist human activities have nothing to do with global warming. Well, not to put too fine a point on it, science says that's baloney and warns that a lot of things are going to happen - none of them good - as is evident from the findings of the international organizations discussed above. Yet the concerted worldwide action to prevent that from happening has not been forthcoming. Even the US should have the lowdown on that, as the 1,600-page National Climate Assessment report issued late last month warns about a world heading into complete chaos by the end of the 21st century without swift and immediate action. The report, like the more comprehensive IPCC report, paints a stark picture that climate change is real, that if we continue as we are, things are going to go downhill rapidly, but - and fortunately it's a big but - we already have most of the tools needed to aggressively curb carbon dioxide emissions, thereby limiting the rise in global average temperatures. What is needed is just the political will to use them. But despite the current US administration insisting the Paris climate accord is harmful to the US economy and refusing to review its withdrawal from it, Xie Zhenhua, China's special representative on climate change affairs, promised on Nov 26 in Beijing that the country will "implement the Paris Agreement, no matter what changes take place in other countries' positions and attitudes". And if China, and other countries, can pursue stricter emissions control under such trying circumstances, there is no reason why others cannot - to save the world from doom. We keep our eyes and ears open to the developments in Katowice with hope. The author is a senior editor with China Daily.

<figure><figcaption> Environmental activists display signs inside the venue of the COP24 UN Climate Change Conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland Dec 4, 2018. [Photo/Reuters] </figcaption></figure> Governments have been urged to take urgent action after a new report predicted that global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industrial sources will reach a record high this year. Research by the Global Carbon Project show emissions are expected to reach 37.1 billion metric tons in 2018, up by more than 2 percent year-on-year, due to sustained growth in oil and gas consumption. The findings were published in report Wednesday on the sidelines of the ongoing 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland. The report said the rapid growth in low-carbon technologies still cannot bring a peak in global emissions or help keep the global temperature rise well below 2 C, as required by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. "The 2018 rise in fossil CO2 emissions place us on a trajectory for warming that is currently well beyond 1.5 C," lead researcher Corinne Le Quere, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia, was quoted as saying in a media release. "It is not enough to support renewables," she said. "Fossil energy needs to be phased out, and efforts to decarbonize need to be expanded throughout the economy." Amy Luers, executive director of Future Earth, added: "The continued rise in global emissions is deeply concerning. The recent IPCC report on risk of 1.5 C warming was a somber wake-up call even for many of us deep in the science. "Tackling climate change has now become a win-win. We just need to start down the winning path," she said. \</doc>

KATOWICE, Poland -- China has shown leadership in tackling climate change by making "immense progress" on low carbon technologies and policy work to reduce emissions, said United Nations General Assembly President Maria Fernanda Espinosa. "I think that China's demonstration of the mutually reinforcing goals of climate action and economic development can go a long way to encourage others to increase ambition to see a sustainable and prosperous future," Espinosa told Xinhua in an interview as the two-week-long Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change kicked off in Katowice, Poland. - - - - PANAMA CITY -- Visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping met here Monday with Yanibel Abrego, president of the National Assembly of Panama, urging the two sides to step up legislative exchanges. Xi stressed that the establishment of China-Panama diplomatic ties will produce long-term benefits to the two peoples, as evidenced by the fruitful outcomes in the robust bilateral cooperation during the past 18 months. - - - - WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump's top economic adviser said Monday that the administration is planning to revoke federal tax credits for all electric vehicles, broadening the president's earlier threat targeting automaker General Motors. "As a matter of our policy, we want to end all those subsidies," Lawrence Kudlow told reporters, adding that the plan under consideration is to undo "other subsidies imposed during the Obama administration." - - - - MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday that the Mexico-U.S. relationship will be maintained on a basis of mutual respect.

MANILA, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Multilateral development banks (MDBs), including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), announced on Monday a joint framework for reinforcing their commitment to combating climate change. In a two-paged joint declaration, the MDBs committed to working together in six key areas considered central to meeting the goals of the agreement, which aims to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2 Celsius degree, pursuing efforts for 1.5 Celesius degree. The declaration was issued at the start of the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. "The global development agenda is at a pivotal point," the joint declaration says. "There is international consensus on the urgent need to ensure that policy engagements and financial flows are consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development." The MDBs and the International Development Finance Club (IDFC) had already pledged in December 2017 to align financial flows with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. "To realize this vision, we are working together to develop a dedicated approach," the joint MDB declaration adds. The Manila-based ADB said in a statement that this approach builds on the ongoing MDB contribution to climate finance, which, in 2017, amounted to 35 billion U.S. dollars to tackle climate change in developing and emerging economies, while mobilizing an additional 52 billion dollars from private and public sector sources. Aside from AIIB and ADB, the other MDBs include the African Development Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank Group, the Islamic Development Bank, the New Development Bank and the World Bank Group.

At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, world leaders at last seemed to recognize the reality of climate change. But the response they are pursuing is fundamentally flawed, given its dependence on  renewable energy sources  such as solar, hydro, and wind power, as well as biofuels  that actually damage nature. Ironically, the world\' s best bet to achieve the Paris agreement\' s goals is to rely on an energy source that is often demonized: nuclear power. Water, wind, and solar power cannot reliably provide energy on the scale required for a modern economy. One kilogram of water behind a dam that is 100 meters high can provide just 1/3,600 kilowatt hours of energy. One kilogram of coal, by contrast, provides about 7 kWh of energy. A hydroelectric scheme would thus have to be enormous to generate the same amount of energy as a coal-fired equivalent, implying high environmental and human costs. Wind has a similar energy density. Even with their large and noisy turbines, offshore wind farms produce, at their peak, as little as nine megawatts per square kilometer. To match a one-gigawatt coal-fired plant requires several hundred turbines. The same goes for solar farms: To be competitive, they must be huge, covering vast areas of hillside and meadow. Yet, even if these massive and environmentally damaging structures were installed, they would be unable to produce enough energy reliably. Articles touting the peak power generation of wind and solar often fail to mention that, for periods that sometimes last many days, they offer little to none. If excess energy could be stored efficiently, the lean periods might be covered; but improvements in battery technology are limited by the laws of chemistry. A recent claim that renewable sources alone could supply all of the United States\' electricity needs has been discredited. To avoid blackouts, fully reliable back-up energy sources must be built and kept on stand-by at a cost attributable to the fluctuating renewables. Some argue that the answer is biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, which benefit from subsidies in some places. But, among renewable-energy options, biofuels have the greatest environmental impact of all, because they require large areas of agricultural land and forest, yet fail to retain the carbon dioxide that nature captures so effectively. Nuclear energy is the one carbon-free energy source without these environmental downsides. In fact, nuclear fuel has 100,000 times the energy density of coal, so that a one-gigawatt nuclear plant would require only 15 hectares of land. Smaller modular plants could blend unobtrusively into the landscape. Moreover, nuclear ores are widespread geographically, and the fuel is easily transported and stockpiled. And a nuclear plant is more resilient to extreme weather than wind or solar plants. Despite these advantages, countries around the world are refusing to invest in new nuclear plants and are even shutting down those that already exist. The reason lies in a lack of understanding of how we are exposed to radiation from nuclear processes every day. Fears of radiation For three billion years, life has evolved not to be adversely affected by natural radiation from rocks and space. A century ago, Marie Curie received two Nobel Prizes for explaining the physics and chemistry of nuclear physics and radiation, before pioneering the use of high doses of radiation for cancer treatment. Yet, while virtually everyone has a relative or friend who has benefited from radiotherapy, public attitudes toward nuclear energy and radiation never recovered from the shock of the nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. But the long-term effects of the radiation released by those bombs have been greatly exaggerated. True, up to 200,000 people may have died in the bombings and their immediate aftermath, but that was mainly from the blast and resulting firestorm. Few died of cancer. Indeed, the medical records of survivors indicate an extra 550-850 cancer deaths over 50 years. It did not help that, during the Cold War, politicians and media exploited fear of radiation. Draconian safety regulations were enacted in the 1950s, not because evidence demanded it, but to appease an anxious public whose concerns were exacerbated by the nuclear-arms race between the US and former Soviet Union. In 1986, the nuclear accident at Chernobyl seemed to confirm these fears, though the radiation death toll of that event was just 43. Likewise, although no one died from radiation released by the 2011 accident at Japan\' s Fukushima Daiichi plant, that episode was widely regarded as proof that countries should abandon nuclear power. The world must move beyond radiation phobia and accept more relaxed, evidence-based nuclear regulations. What is required, above all, is the political will to challenge the status quo, in the name of smart and forward-thinking policy choices, and better education of the public. Nuclear power may not be popular today, but it should be tomorrow. It is the best choice for our collective future. We should embrace it.

Governments across the world need to implement more preferential policies to direct investment from the private sector into climate-resilient development to provide the funding needed to curb global warming, said a senior official from the United Nations Environment Programme. Niklas Hagelberg, coordinator of UNEP's climate change subprogram, said that how developing countries will be supported financially to address their challenges will be one of the most discussed topics in negotiations at a UN conference on climate change taking place in Katowice, Poland, until Dec 14. Developed countries pledged in Copenhagen in 2009 to support a $30 billion "Fast Start" fund from 2010 to 2012, and scale up the aid to $100 billion a year by 2020. "You'll hear later over these two weeks that there are differences in opinions on where the money comes from," Hagelberg said. There is a view among developing countries that the financial support should come from the public funds of developed countries. However, he said, many developed countries think more of the money should come from the private sector. Considering the current political situation, it will not be easy to redirect taxes collected in developed countries to developing countries. "So I think that it's going to be important to unlock private sector finance and unlock it to the extent that we're talking about trillions of dollars in investment rather than $100 billion," he said. A lot of money is still being invested in the "old economy", such as coal and the internal combustion engine, rather than the "green economy", including geothermal and solar energies and electric vehicles, Hagelberg said, adding that if the green economy becomes the normal economy, "then suddenly there will be a lot of money available". "In many countries, the investment in climate in general is not easy," he said. "It needs to be made easier." Governments need to draft policies that can give long-term certainty and direction for the private investor - for example, making it compulsory for companies to buy renewable energy at a fixed price. Hagelberg said governments should draft policies under the principles of transparency, longevity and credibility. "They need to be transparent so that everybody has a fair understanding of them, and that the rules are the same for everybody," he said. Hagelberg said China is at the center of the negotiations in Katowice, as the country accounts for more than 20 percent of global emissions. "The progress that China can advance will help the whole of the negotiations move forward," he said. Despite high emissions in China, there has been progress: About 2.2 percent of cars currently sold in the country are electric ones. This accounts for half of total world sales, Hagelberg said, adding that China has also been a major market player in renewable energy development. "I would say China, in many things, is at the forefront of that change," he said.

SUVA, Aug. 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) underlined on Friday their commitment to collective diplomacy and enhanced action for regional security arrangements to build a stronger region for Pacific people. According to a statement released by PIFS in the Samoa capital of Apia, PIF members engaged in wide ranging discussions centered around how the region can operate together to promote the security and development of the Blue Pacific region. "I see the Blue Pacific as a powerful narrative to call us together, drawing on our shared ocean identity, ocean geography, and ocean resources. It serves to empower us -- reminding us of the value and potential of our region, encouraging us to think and act from a position of strength," said Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, prime minster of Samoa and Pacific Islands Forum Chair as he opened the meeting. Recognizing the theme for this year's PIF in Nauru in September: "Building a Strong Pacific - Our People, Our Islands, Our Will," PIF foreign Ministers said that it provided another opportunity to further fortify the region's collective will to pursue its own political and development ambitions. The foreign ministers agreed that events like the upcoming 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) provide strategic opportunities for a unified and amplified "Pacific Voice" that calls for ambitious action to achieve the measures called for in the Paris Agreement. To strengthen strategic international advocacy and engagement in future, a Strategy for Pacific Islands Forum Engagement and Advocacy was endorsed. To develop a new regional security declaration to address emerging security issues, foreign ministers this year reviewed a draft declaration and have recommended that it now be forwarded to Forum Leaders for consideration at their meeting in Nauru. While discussing the importance of securing maritime boundaries for the development and security of the region, foreign ministers also agreed to work together, as a matter of urgency to assess and address the legal and technical implications of climate change and sea-level rise on their maritime zones.

GABORONE, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 30, 000 people in Botswana have been left vulnerable to the impacts of climate change-induced drought that affected the southern African country between 2014 and 2017, a senior government official said Wednesday. Thato Raphaka, the permanent secretary in Botswana's Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism Ministry made this revelation in his speech at the high-level national breakfast meeting in Gaborone, Botswana's capital city. The meeting was held in preparation of the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change scheduled for Katowice, Poland early next month to finalize the rules of the implementation of Paris Agreement on climate change. "An estimated 500,000 livestock deaths and over 30,000 people were left vulnerable to the impacts of the drought between 2014 and 2017. The droughts are closely related to the ongoing climate change in the country," said Raphaka. In the last decade, available reports have suggested that climate change has led to about 2.5 trillion U.S. dollars in disaster losses in developing countries resulting in the number of people affected by natural disasters doubling from 102 million in 2015 to 204 million in 2017. According to Raphaka, the number of food insecure population is at 27 million in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region alone because the regional bloc suffered the worst drought in 35 years caused by the El Nino phenomenon. "The devastating negative impacts of climate change continue to weigh heavily on the vulnerable communities," he said. As such, Raphaka said strategic interventions targeted towards sustainable production and consumption to keep the planet at a safer level and help realize the Paris Agreement should be a matter of priority to all. The long term goal of the Paris Agreement makes provisions for limiting global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels this century while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius through transparent and ambitious emission reductions.

BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping Saturday called on the Group of 20 (G20) to play a political leading role in nurturing favorable conditions for international trade. He also urged G20 to inject political impetus into international cooperation on jointly tackling climate change, during discussions at the 13th G20 summit held in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires. On trade issue, the Chinese president said that G20 should firstly stick to openness and free trade, maintain and further expand an open market, and realize win-win cooperation through mutual exchanges and complementarity. Secondly, G20 should stick to inclusiveness, and bring the benefits of international trade and economic globalization to people of all countries and all classes, Xi said. Thirdly, G20 should uphold rules-oriented spirit and nurture a stable and expectable institutional environment for the healthy development of international trade, he said. On climate change, Xi said it is a major challenge to the future and destiny of mankind, which requires the G20's joint efforts. China, France and the United Nations reiterated their firm commitment to implementing the Paris Agreement on Friday, sending out a strong signal of pushing forward international cooperation to tackle climate change, Xi said. He urged G20 to inject political impetus into the international cooperation on jointly fighting climate change, with a sense of responsibility of building a community with a shared future for mankind. All relevant sides should faithfully abide by their commitment to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, reinforce their actions before 2020, and push for the green and low-carbon transformation across the world, Xi said. Developed countries should fulfill their promises of raising 100 billion U.S. dollars every year till 2020, and transfer advanced technologies to developing countries to help them elevate abilities to address climate change, he said. The Chinese side looks forward for the participating sides to reaching a package agreement at the upcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) of the UNFCCC in Katowice of Poland, and implementing the Paris Agreement based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, Xi said. China stands ready to make joint efforts with various sides and make its due contribution, he added. The Chinese president arrived in Buenos Aires on Thursday night to attend the G20 summit held on Friday and Saturday, and pay a state visit to Argentina. Enditem \</doc>

GENEVA, Nov. 22 (Xinhua) -- The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said Thursday she has sent an open letter to all states warning that decisions taken on climate change next month could put human rights "under threat". She said, "human rights are under threat from a force which challenges the foundations of all life, as we know it, on this planet we share." Bachelet sent an open letter to states ahead of the COP24 climate meeting on Dec 3-14 in Katowice, Poland. She pointed out that the decisions taken at the meeting will govern climate action under the 2015 Paris agreement "for the indefinite future," and said that "the rights of the millions of people [are] threatened by climate change." The UN rights chief urged states attending the meeting to work together "to take effective, ambitious, urgent, human rights-based climate action now." She said, "Climate change is already affecting people's lives, the effective enjoyment of their rights, and the ecosystems on which we all rely." Bachelet said it is known that the total of states' current nationally determined contributions put the world on track for roughly 3 degrees Celsius of warming, which is more than twice the target that the international community agreed to pursue efforts to reach three years ago in Paris. "The consequences of this degree of climate change are unthinkable," the high commissioner said. "Entire nations, ecosystems, peoples and ways of life could simply cease to exist." "Countless lives will be irreparably harmed," she said. This will include those who already face discrimination because of their gender; because of their economic status; because they are members of indigenous peoples or minorities. It will also include migrants and those internally displaced; the aged and those with disabilities. Bachelet said that states have obligations under international human rights law "to ensure that those affected by climate change, particularly those in vulnerable situations, have access to effective remedies and the necessary means of adaptation to enjoy lives of human dignity." "They also have an obligation to strengthen their mitigation commitments in order to prevent the worst impacts of climate change," she said. Enditem \</doc>

DIPLOMATS from nearly 200 countries reached a deal Saturday to keep the Paris climate agreement alive by adopting a detailed set of rules to implement the pact. The deal, struck after an all-night bargaining session, will ultimately require every country in the world to follow a uniform set of standards for measuring their planet-warming emissions and tracking their climate policies. And it calls on countries to step up their plans to cut emissions ahead of another round of talks in 2020. It also calls on richer countries to be clearer about the aid they intend to offer to help poorer nations install more clean energy or build resilience against natural disasters. And it builds a process in which countries that are struggling to meet their emissions goals can get help in getting back on track. The United States agreed to the deal despite President Trump\' s vow to abandon the Paris Agreement. Diplomats and climate change activists said they hoped that fact would make it easier for the administration to change its mind and stay in the Paris Agreement, or for a future president to embrace the accord once again. The United States cannot formally withdraw from the agreement until late 2020. Many of the attendees at this year\' s United Nations climate talks  known as COP24 , shorthand for their formal name  expressed disappointment at what they saw as half measures to deal with a mounting climate crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions are still rising around the world, and millions of people are facing increased risks from severe droughts, floods and wildfires. But supporters of the deal reached Saturday said that they hoped the new rules would help build a virtuous cycle of trust and cooperation among countries, at a time when global politics seems increasingly fractured.  Particularly given the broader geopolitical context, this is a pretty solid outcome, said Elliot Diringer, executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions.  It delivers what we need to get the Paris Agreement off the ground.  The fundamentals are in place, Mr. Diringer added. Not every country got what it wanted at the meeting, which had been scheduled to end Friday. Developing nations were hoping for more robust promises on climate aid, but that issue has been postponed for future talks. The negotiations over the Paris rule book, often dense and technical, were frequently bogged down by sharp political disputes inside the saucer-shaped convention center in Katowice, at the heart of Poland\' s coal country.(SD-Agencies) \</doc>

The world is  way off course in its plan to prevent catastrophic climate change, the United Nations warned yesterday as nations gathered in Poland to chart a way to avert runaway global warming. After a string of damning scientific reports showing humanity must drastically slash its greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told delegates at the opening of the UN climate summit:  We are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough. Leaders from at-risk nations such as Fiji, Nigeria and Nepal are due to plead their case at the COP24 climate talks, which aim to flesh out the promises agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord. But host Poland, heavily reliant on energy from coal, will push its own agenda  a  just transition from fossil fuels that critics say could allow it to continue polluting for decades. Nor are any of the world\' s largest emitters represented at the highest level in Poland. The Paris deal saw nations agree to limit global temperature rises to below 2 degrees Celsius and under 1.5 degrees if possible. Officials from nearly 200 countries now have two weeks to finalize how those goals work in practice. One of the key disputes is finance. Under Paris, richer nations  responsible for the majority of historic greenhouse gas emissions  are expected to contribute funding that developing nations can access to make their economies greener. But US President Donald Trump\' s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord has dented trust among vulnerable nations, who fear there is not enough cash to help them adapt to our heating planet. The World Bank yesterday announced US$200 billion in climate action investment for 2021-25  a major shot in the arm for green initiatives but one which needs bolstering by state funding. The background to yesterday\' s summit could hardly be bleaker: with just 1 degree Celsius of warming so far, Earth is bombarded with raging wildfires, widespread crop failures and super-storms exacerbated by rising sea levels. The United Nations own expert climate panel in October issued its starkest warning to date. To have any hope of reaching the 1.5 degrees goal by the end of the century, it said emissions from fossil fuel use must be halved by 2030. As Poland pushed the continued use of coal, it fell to the president of Nauru, a Pacific island nation that is critically threatened by rising sea-levels, to point out the most obvious barrier to climate action: fossil fuel use. Baron Divavesi Waqa said the Paris agreement  doesn\' t radically disrupt the fossil fuel industry ... these powerful interests emerged from Paris unscathed and we ignore that reality at our peril. \</doc>

DEVELOPING countries rounded on the United States and its allies at emergency climate talks yesterday, accusing the world\' s richest nations of stalling a deal aimed at preventing runaway global warming. Experts from around the world wrapped up discussions in Bangkok geared toward creating a comprehensive rule book for countries to implement the landmark Paris Accord on climate change. But talks foundered over the key issue of how efforts to limit climate change are funded and how contributions are reported. Delegates representing some of Earth\' s poorest and smallest nations said on the final day of the summit that the US and other Western economies had failed to live up to their green spending commitments.  Developed countries are responsible for the vast majority of historic emissions, and many became remarkably wealthy burning fossil fuels, said Amjad Abdulla, the head of a negotiating bloc of small island states.  Yet, we face devastating climate impacts and some of us could be lost forever to rising seas without progress on the Paris deal by the end of the year, he added. The Paris deal, struck in 2015, aims to limit global temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius and to below 1.5 degrees if possible by the end of the century. To do this, countries agreed to a set of promises, including to establish an annual US$100 billion fund to help developing nations react to our heating planet. But the details of the final rule book are subject to intense debate. The US and other developed economies want less oversight on how their funding is gathered and more flexibility over how future finance is structured. But developing nations insist they need predictable and open funding in order to effectively plan their fight against the fallout from climate change. A senior climate negotiator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US and rich nations were asking poorer ones to trust them to self-regulate climate financing.  We want to do our bit, but how can we trust them? Show us the money, the negotiator said. Delegates ended talks yesterday with an agreement to hand over technical discussions to a panel of experts, who will continue to meet before the COP24 kicks off in Katowice, Poland, at the start of December. Patricia Espinosa, the UN\' s climate change secretary, told reporters that progress had been made in Bangkok  on most issues but that  no issues have been fully resolved yet. The issue of climate finance was  very difficult and politically sensitive, she added.  For Katowice to be successful, work needs to speed up and political will needs to be intensified. The Bangkok talks were organized as an emergency negotiating session after little progress was made at previous rounds toward a rule book. \</doc>

NAIROBI, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) -- The African ministers wrapped up a three-day meeting in Nairobi on Wednesday by resolving to embrace innovative environment solutions in implementing ecological actions in solving challenges facing their countries. The ministers who ended the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN) also agreed to enhance capacity building of human capital to achieve sustainable development in Africa. "We are going to start empowering innovators, the private sector, micro-small and medium enterprises and civil society to use new approaches to address environmental challenges in our own countries," said Nezha El Ouafi, Morocco's minister of environment and vice-president of AMCEN. The environment ministers resolved to invest in innovative solutions to change the development pathway in a sustainable way as opposed to the current plans that are not yielding faster results. The ministers agreed to support pan-African platforms on the environment to promote and share experiences and solutions across the continent. "Public-private sector partnership will have to play a key role in embracing innovation and turning environmental policies into concrete actions to achieve the objectives of the African Union Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development," the ministers added. The ministers who have been meeting in Nairobi for the last three days committed to enhance their countries' efforts to implement policies, legislation and programs to fast rack conservation and other environmental plans. They called on the UN Environment Assembly and UN Environment to increase support to African countries as well as facilitating access to innovative partnerships. They announced that a pan-African action agenda is being prepared to respond to land and ecosystems degradation challenges and restore ecosystem in the continent. "We intend to develop common positions on various priority issues and speak with one voice during the upcoming 2018 UN Biodiversity Conference which will be held in Egypt in November 2018," they added. The ministers stressed that adaptation and finance should be core elements for effective operationalization of the outcomes of climate change COP24 agreement. They emphasized the importance of enhancing accessibility, predictability and sustainability of means of implementation, in particular finance. Earlier, while addressing the conference, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) called on African governments to put human and environmental health at the centre of policy making in all sectors. Ghebreyesus said environment is central to human health adding that every year almost 12.6 million people die from hidden risks in the environment. Joyce Msuya, deputy head of UN Environment said that Africa has the human resources, natural wealth, and leadership to innovate and transform the region. Msuya noted that the continent stands to benefit from environment once they massively engage in environmental conservation. Enditem \</doc>

NAIROBI, Oct. 12 (Xinhua) -- The seventh climate change and development in Africa conference (CCDA-V11) wrapped up in Nairobi on Friday with participants endorsing sweeping recommendations to hasten green and inclusive growth in the continent. Mohamed Elmi, chief administrative secretary in Kenya's Ministry of Environment and Natural resources, said the three-day summit injected vitality into efforts to find home grown solution to Africa's climate change crisis. "After three days of fruitful deliberations, everyone agreed that African-led initiatives to tackle negative impacts of climate change have the potential to deliver results in the long-term," said Elmi. More than 700 delegates who included policymakers, representatives of regional blocs, researchers and grassroots campaigners attended the pan African climate forum in Nairobi to explore innovative ways to reactivate the continent's green agenda. Elmi said that resolutions adopted at the forum will be presented at the forthcoming global climate summit to be held in Poland from Dec. 2-14. "We have resolved to speak as a united bloc to ensure our voice is heard at the 24th session of conference of parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that will take place in Poland coming December," said Elmi. "A united Africa should push for developed countries to honor their commitment in emissions reduction and green finance," he added. Among the resolutions adopted at the Nairobi pan African climate forum included domestic resources mobilization, robust grassroots education and harmonization of policies to hasten low carbon development. Olushola Olayide, a senior policy advisor at the African Union Commission, said that a retooling of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Africa is required to realize a green growth that benefits everyone. "It cannot be business as usual as our continent continues to suffer from a chain of environmental disasters that can be tamed if we invest in clean energy,"Olayide added. John Bideri, chair of Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, Rwanda chapter, said that a continental dialogue should be reactivated to hasten the momentum towards achieving zero carbon emissions development. "We have a chance to move forward the climate agenda by involving all stakeholders. The next phase of dialogue should focus on how the continent can tap into its innovations, abundant natural resources and skilled workforce to enhance its climate resilience," said Bideri. He added that low carbon emissions growth is an imperative as African countries grapple with rapid urbanization and pressure on natural resources. Enditem \</doc>

KATOWICE, Poland -- Negotiators from nearly 200 countries on Saturday agreed on a package of the implementation guidelines, or a common rulebook of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), stretched beyond official closing time on Friday evening and overran deep into Saturday in the southern Polish city of Katowice. (Poland-Paris Agreement- COP 24 ) HARARE -- The 17th ZANU-PF annual national people's conference ended in Esigodini, Matabeleland South Province on Saturday, with all Provinces endorsing President Emmerson Mnangagwa as the party's sole candidate for the next elections due in 2023. The conference was being held under the theme "Zimbabwe Is Open for Business: Peace, unity towards an Upper Middle-Income Economy by 2030." Reading out the resolutions, Politburo member Jacob Mudenda said the party would start restructuring next year in preparation for the next elections.

MOMBASA, Kenya, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has become the first country in East Africa to install a solar system at a major airport to reduce carbon emissions by large planes during their take-off. The ground-mounted 500-kw solar power generation facility, which was launched at Moi International Airport in the coastal city of Mombasa on Wednesday, will help reduce at least 1,300 tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. "It is not only a transformative development in Kenya's aviation sector, and of the continent, but also an inspiring model of how such change can best be accomplished," Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), said in Mombasa. Currently, planes use their auxiliary power unit (APU) powered by jet fuel or airport ground power units (GPU) fueled by diesel to run on-board systems and cooling before departing for the next flight. But this project will provide pre-conditioned air and compatible electricity that runs on solar energy to aircraft during ground operations. Kenya's Action Plan sets an ambitious goal to reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions from both domestic and international operations, which is expected to contribute to global efforts to minimize aviation's carbon footprint. Aliu said the pilot project dubbed Solar at Gate was supported by ICAO, a UN agency based in Montreal, which is responsible for setting of standards that regulate aviation systems across the world and funded by EU as part of a 758 million shillings (7.4 million U.S. dollars) initiative, entitled "Capacity Building for CO2 Mitigation from International Aviation." Gilbert Kibe, director general of Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), said the initiative enabled the development of Kenya's Action Plan for Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Aviation. According to Kibe, it also identified the use of solar energy at airports as a measure to bolster global efforts to minimize aviation's carbon footprint. "KCAA recognizes the importance of the global warming issues which took center stage at the COP24 Conference in Poland. As such we have been making aggressive efforts to address Green House Gas (GHG) emission from aviation with the financial, technical and strategic support of ICAO and the EU," he said. The solar facility will generate 820,000 kwh per year and will curb emission of at least 1,300 tons of carbon dioxide annually. The solar facility will be supported with funding from the ICAO-EU Assistance project. The initiative targets 14 countries, 12 of which from the African region and two from the Caribbean region. "It is now a reality that climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing mankind. Unfortunately, aviation has been criticized as a major contributor of carbon emissions," said Jonny Anderson, managing director of Kenya Airports Authority. Anderson said that Kenya's aviation sector aims to operate at zero carbon emissions by 2021. Enditem \</doc>

ROME, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Only about two generations may be left before the impact of climate change on earth and human life become irreparable, according to officials with Italy's National Institute of Health (ISS) on Monday. The warning came as the ISS held its first International Scientific Symposium on Health and Climate Change in the Italian capital on Dec. 3-5. "We have two generations to save the planet from climate change, and from the devastating effects it will have on humankind and land," ISS president Walter Ricciardi said in his opening remarks. "This is the time left to implement effective measures...climate change is the true global threat of this century," added Ricciardi, hygiene and public health professor with Milan-based Catholic University of the Sacred Heart. The Roman event kicked off as the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change continued in Katowice, Poland. Some 500 researchers from 30 countries were taking part in the Italian conference, with the aim of addressing the different health risks connected to climate change through 22 multi-disciplinary sessions. Climate change directly affected social and environmental health determinants, such as clean air, ecosystems health, safe drinking water and sufficient food, the ISS explained in a presentation paper. At global level, people at highest risk of adverse health effects associated with climate change are children, elders and vulnerable groups. "Socio-economically disadvantaged groups and areas where infrastructures and/or social services are not efficient, will fail in adapting to climate change and related health hazards," experts warned. In a concrete example concerning Italy, the ISS said that recent estimates based on worst-case scenario showed Italy may see the number of annual heat waves increase "exponentially" to between 75 and 250 by 2100. "A study evaluated the effects of heat on hospital admissions in children, and showed a 12 percent increase in paediatric hospitalizations for respiratory causes associated with a change in daily temperature equal on average to about 4 degrees Celsius," the ISS wrote. The mentioned epidemiological study was run in the Lazio region surrounding Rome, and was coordinated by Italy's National Research Council (CNR), the regional health service and the research center of the National Institute For Insurance against Accidents at Work (INAIL). At the closure, the international symposium was due to issue a recommendation paper. "The Symposium will produce a document based on scientific evidence, with all recommendations and actions necessary to tackle and reduce the risks of climate changes on health," the ISS said. "The International Charter of Rome...will be meant as a tool to suggest useful actions to policy-makers, but also to raise awareness on such issues and try to put them on top of all agendas."

SUVA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Fijian President Jioji Konrote stressed here Friday the importance of preserving the ocean for the world. Speaking on the World Oceans Day in the Fijian capital city of Suva, Konrote said that the World Oceans Day is not only an opportunity to highlight the importance of the struggle to protect and preserve the oceans, it is also a celebration of the millions of men, women and children around the world who have committed themselves to making a difference in this struggle. The president said that he is determined to persuade the nations of the world to take much more decisive actions to save the oceans. "I know many of you have been directly involved in our global campaign for action on oceans, whether it was the United Nations World Oceans Conference in New York a year ago or the Oceans Pathway launched at COP23 that we will continue to co-chair with Sweden until 2020," he said. "And many of the same people have also been spearheading our fight for climate action across a broad front through Fiji's Presidency of COP23, including the Talanoa Dialogue that is a cornerstone of that effort." Next month, Pacific leaders will gather in Suva for the Climate Action Pacific Partnership Event and a Pacific Talanoa Dialogue as a prelude to the Talanoa Dialogue. Fiji will preside over with Poland at COP24 in December. While stressing that it will all be about raising ambition in the climate struggle, he appealed to the leaders of all the Pacific nations to join Fiji in Suva to set an example for the whole world of building a consensus for more ambition. The president urged Fijians to conserve and preserve marine areas, such as the 250 traditional tabu sites protected by the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network. His message on the World Oceans Day 2018 was oriented around conservation and preservation and of ambitious climate action. In a related development, Meg Taylor, secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, also urged on Friday the Pacific Islanders to make a pledge for healthier oceans. "We share one ocean, we benefit from it immensely, from food on our tables to our economies as forum members, and I believe we should feel some sense of responsibility for its well-being. The Ocean is our home and will be key for our children's and young people's future." Enditem \</doc>

IEA director hopeful agency and partners can lead the world out of global predicament The International Energy Agency's members and its partners can help lead the world out of its climate predicament, says IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. That is his message as representatives of around 200 countries gather in Poland for the 24th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as COP 24 . Birol, from Turkey, is urging governments to find solutions and limit global warming efficiently. "Climate change and energy are very close, because about 85 percent of carbon dioxide emissions come from the energy sector," Birol says. The 30-member IEA, founded in 1974 in the wake of the 1973 Arab oil crisis, includes 22 European countries, Japan, the United States and Canada. China joined the Paris-based group in 2015, as one of its eight association countries. The IEA's mission is to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its member countries and beyond. Birol says the IEA is closely watching this year's UN climate change conference, which is taking place in the Polish city of Katowice from Dec 2 to 14. He says he hopes the international community will take rapid action to avoid climate catastrophe. "When governments make decisions on energy, they have to think about it in terms of affordability - the energy price will have an impact on economic growth and consumers' pockets, employment and the environment footprint. We have to look at all of these issues together," he says. Birol points out that the energy sector has a crucial role to play in combating climate change, and all nations must recognize that their policies on energy transition will have significant impacts on the shared future. Before taking over as executive director in 2015, Birol had served IEA for two decades as chief economist and director of global energy economics, responsible for the organization's World Energy Outlook publication. The 60-year-old energy expert founded and chaired the IEA Energy Business Council, which provides a forum for cooperation between the energy industry and policymakers. Apart from his role at the institution, he is also the chairman of the World Economic Forum's energy advisory board and a member of the UN secretary-general's High-Level Group on Sustainable Energy for All. According to the United Nations, this year marks the deadline agreed on by the signers of the Paris Agreement to adopt a work program for the implementation of the commitments. Other pledges that global leaders made at COP21 in Paris, such as increasing financing for climate action and developing national climate plans by 2020, will also be reviewed. The two-week negotiations in Poland are expected to finalize the implementation guidelines and produce a rule book on how to carry out the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 C and 2 C. "I am really worried there is a growing disconnect between the calls from different international bodies and what is happening in the real energy market," Birol says, referring to the latest warnings made by several United Nations agencies on accelerated global warming. He refers to the warning in November by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN body, that the world is not cutting emissions fast enough. "When the IPCC announced there is an urgent need to cut emissions, we, the International Energy Agency, announced that global emissions will reach a historical high in 2018, a significant rise," he says. According to a report released by the UN Environment Programme on Nov 27, total annual greenhouse gas emissions reached a record high of 53.5 billion tons in 2017 after three years of decreases. UNEP's Emissions Gap Report also estimates that global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 could be between 13 billion and 15 billion tons, which is more than the level needed to keep global warming within 2 C this century. "I think that many countries around the world could take climate change seriously. But when I look at the international determination to tackle climate change a few years ago and today, I see, in general, that there was a greater appetite three years ago from political leaders around the world. But I hope this trend can be reversed sometime soon," Birol says. "Such a disconnect can only be solved through international cooperation between the governments all around the world." On the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina on Nov 30, China, France and the UN reiterated firm commitment to fighting climate change and calling for effective and transparent implementation of the Paris Agreement in all aspects. According to the G20 joint statement, leaders look forward to a successful outcome at the COP24 climate change conference, despite the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement. In line with the goals set by the Paris Agreement, the Talanoa Dialogue, mandated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is a process designed to help countries implement and enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020. In addition, the United States has affirmed its strong commitment to energy access and security, utilizing all energy sources and technologies, while protecting the environment. The G20 economies all agreed to seek possible national paths aiming to achieve energy transition toward a low-emissions future. Confronted with environmental challenges, one undoubtable imperative is to reach for technological advances, Birol says. According to IEA's Renewables 2018 report, renewable energy sources used in meeting global energy demand are expected to grow by one-fifth in the next five years to reach 12.4 percent in 2023. Renewables are forecast to meet more than 70 percent of global electricity generation growth by 2023, led by solar photovoltaic and followed by wind, hydropower, and bioenergy. "When we look at the numbers, renewable energy is growing very strongly and renewables' share in the energy mix is increasing, thanks to the drop in cost and policy support from major economies such as China, which is the global leader for both solar PV and wind power, European countries and the US," Birol says. "But in order to solve the climate problems, renewables alone are not enough. We also need other new other advanced technologies, clean technologies such as nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, electric cars and so on," he says. From his point of view, China is playing a key role in shaping the future of low-carbon energy technologies by leading investment and innovation of cleaner energy sources. Birol says the Chinese government has made enormous efforts toward low-carbon energy transition, with the aim to achieve the fastest and greatest progress in tackling climate issues. "Firstly, China is pushing for zero carbon technologies, including solar, wind, hydropower, nuclear power and carbon capture and storage. Secondly, China is replacing coal with gas. China today is overtaking Japan to become the world's largest importer of natural gas. The natural gas is helping to reduce the local pollution in cities in order to make the skies of China blue again. Thirdly, China is working closely with the IEA, trying to improve energy efficiency," he says. "If I can give you three top projects, one is to integrate renewable energies in the best way to the Chinese electricity grades; second is how we can make sure that the China gas market and relevant regulation is designed in the best way so that the gas becomes a significant part of the Chinese energy mix; and third, like Europe, China is designing its emissions trading system. It will be the world's largest carbon market. We are helping the Chinese government to deliver the best," he says. In addition to closer ties with the IEA, Birol also expects more close cooperation between China and its members on investment in sustainable infrastructure. "I hope to see that the Chinese emissions peak sooner than later, which will be good news for Chinese people, and also for the rest of the world," he says.

<figure><figcaption> People take part in the Claim the Climate march in Brussels, Belgium, on Saturday to demand action at the United Nations conference on climate change in Poland. [Photo/Reuters] </figcaption></figure> Developed countries were called upon to honor their pledges of financial support for developing countries in tackling climate change at the opening of the annual UN climate change conference on Monday in Katowice, Poland. The 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 24 "This meeting is the most important gathering on climate change since the Paris agreement was signed," said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, addressing the opening ceremony. "We are in deep trouble with climate change. ... This is already a matter of life or death," he said. The Paris agreement was signed by almost every country in the world at the 2015 Paris conference. It took effect on Nov 4, 2016, with a target of holding the average global temperature increase to no higher than 2 C above preindustrial levels. "We are still not doing enough nor moving fast enough to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption, nor are we doing enough to capitalize on the enormous social, economic and then environmental opportunities of climate action," Guterres said. He also stressed a collective responsibility to assist the most vulnerable communities and countries, such as small island nations and the least-developed countries, by supporting adaptation and resilience. "Making clear progress to mobilize the pledge of $100 billion a year will provide a much-needed positive political signal," he said. Developed countries made a pledge at the 2009 Copenhagen conference, COP 15, for $30 billion in support in a "fast-start" fund from 2010 to 2012, and an increase in aid to $100 billion per year by 2020. "We cannot afford to fail in Katowice. Some might say that it will be a difficult negotiation. I know it's not easy. It requires a firm political will for compromise," Guterres said. Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji and president of COP 23, said the world must move quickly to have any hope of curbing global warming. "The scientists have just told us the window of opportunity to act is closing very fast," he said. He added, however, that there are other windows of opportunity to save the planet, including new technologies that enable the world to make a transition. "There are many billions of dollars needed for the transition, and for making these technologies more accessible and more affordable around the world," Bainimarama said. Lu Xinming, deputy director-general of climate change at China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said that parties should adhere to the principle of equity, find common but differentiated responsibilities and acknowledge respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances as they work out the implementation guidelines for the Paris agreement. Mapping out the detailed implementation guidelines for the Paris agreement as scheduled should be the first key task of COP 24 , he said. \</doc>

KATOWICE, Poland - Thousands of people from around the world on Saturday marched through the southern Polish city that's hosting this year's United Nations climate talks, demanding that their governments take tougher action to curb global warming. First week of UN talks closes with haggling over fine print in Paris agreement KATOWICE, Poland - Thousands of people from around the world on Saturday marched through the southern Polish city that's hosting this year's United Nations climate talks, demanding that their governments take tougher action to curb global warming. Protesters included farmers from Latin America, environmentalists from Asia, students from the United States and families from Europe, many of whom said climate change is already affecting their lives. "Climate change is the thing that frightens me the most," said Michal Dabrowski from Warsaw, who brought his young daughter to the march. "I'm a father and it's kind of crucial that she will have a decent life." Marchers gathered in one of Katowice's main squares before setting off for the conference center where delegates from almost 200 countries are haggling over the fine print of the 2015 Paris accord to fight climate change. Some protesters were dressed as endangered orangutans while others wore breathing masks to highlight the air pollution in Katowice, which lies at the heart of Poland's coal mining region of Silesia. A group wearing polar bear costumes was expelled from the march after suggesting that fossil fuels should be replaced by nuclear power, a technology that many environmentalists object to. The "March for the Climate" passed largely peacefully, though three people were detained after a small scuffle with police, a Katowice police spokeswoman said. Earlier on Saturday, environmental groups had complained that some of their activists were being turned back at the Polish border or deported. One Belgian activist was allowed to enter the country after her country's ambassador intervened with Polish authorities. Poland has introduced identity checks ahead of the conference, arguing they were needed for security. Inside the UN meeting, negotiators were concluding the first week of talks, which are focused on finalizing the Paris rulebook that determines how signatories to the 2015 deal record and report their greenhouse gas emissions. In a recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said drastic action would be needed to achieve the Paris accord's most ambitious target of keeping global warming below 1.5 C. Illustrating the sensitivity of this message for some governments, major oil exporting countries including Saudi Arabia and Russia objected to "welcoming" the IPCC's report. The issue is now one of several that will be left to government ministers. Strong signal Environmental groups want countries to send a strong signal that they're ready for more ambitious action in the years ahead, but some protesters felt that governments alone would not do enough to fight climate change. US President Donald Trump, who has announced he's pulling the US out of the agreement, claimed on Saturday that "people do not want to pay large sums of money... in order to maybe protect the environment". Economists say the price of curbing climate change is actually far lower than the eventual cost of coping with the catastrophic famines, storms and sea level rises that will happen with a warming climate.

by Alessandra Cardone ROME, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- Climate change jumped on top of the issues most concerning Italians at global level, surpassing the threat of terrorism, a survey by a leading domestic research institute showed on Monday. It was the first time environment-related topics ranked first among the country's major international worries, Milan-based Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI) said in its report. The poll -- run between Dec. 5 and 10 along with Ipsos Public Affairs -- investigated on what topics concerned the Italian society in 2018 at both international and domestic level. CLIMATE CHANGE 1ST GLOBAL CONCERN "For the first time, climate change represents for Italy the most significant threat at global level, making a considerable leap forward in percentage terms from 13 percent to 28 percent (compared to 2017)," the report stated. The indication came as nearly 200 countries and the European Union (EU) recently agreed on a set of rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Climate Protection Agreement, during the UN Climate Conference ( COP24 ) held in Poland earlier this month. In previous editions of the ISPI survey -- now in its fifth -- climate change had represented the top global worry by 13 percent of people in 2017 and 2016, and by 16 percent in 2015. Terrorism linked to an extremist interpretation of Islam came in the second place, yet it kept following a declining trend: it was the highest worry for 16 percent of Italians in 2018, against 23 percent in 2017, and 38 percent in 2015. Global social inequalities (13 percent) and economic crisis (11 percent) continued to be worrying issues as well, ranking third and fourth. Beside the potential factors of threat at global level, the ISPI-Ipsos survey also investigated on what news items involved Italians the most in 2018, showing a slightly different scenario. In this perspective, in fact, the issue of migrants and refugees was mentioned among the most worrying topics by 43 percent of people involved, and considered as the most concerning one by 25 percent. ECONOMIC CRISIS STILL TOP DOMESTIC WORRY With regards to domestic topics, the economic situation was again the major source of concern among Italians by large, after a short period of relief. "Problems related to economy are still perceived as the main (domestic) threat to our country, and they are growing compared to last year," the authors stressed in the report. They specified some 55 percent of those involved in 2018 claimed to be worried by the economic situation most of all -- the highest figure after 2014 (67 percent). "Since 2014, the economic crisis has always been in first place, yet following a decreasing trend," ISPI director Paolo Magri noted in a short video comment to the survey. "However, such decrease stops this year, and this is probably due to concerns linked to the spread and to our public finances," Magri explained. After the 67 percent peak registered in December 2014, the share of Italians seeing the economic crisis as the top threat had drastically dropped to 47 percent in 2015, 46 percent in 2016, and 48 percent in 2017. Immigration was confirmed as the second most worrying domestic factor (16 percent), followed by the recent row between the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government and the European Union (11 percent) on national budget, and by terrorism (6 percent).

KATOWICE, Poland, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday launched an international film festival focusing on climate change during a major UN conference in the southern Polish city of Katowice as part of its efforts to show its firm commitment to tackling the pressing issue. The organizing committee of Handle Climate Change Film Festival(HCCFF) called for entry for the 2019 HCCFF award expected to be announced in October next year in Shenzhen, China. The annual film festival launched in Katowice follows its sessions in Paris in 2015, Marrakech in 2016 and Bonn in 2017. The previous three sessions have received 4,056 films from more than 100 countries. The two-week 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which opened Sunday in Katowice, aims to finalize the implementation guidelines of the landmark Paris deal and provide clarity on how to carry out the accord fairly for all participating countries. Founded in 2015 by Innovative Research Institute of Science Popularization, an NGO based in Shenzhen, the film festival has been welcomed and supported by Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China Meteorological Administration, and China's National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation. With its growing industrial influence, the festival has attracted resources from different stakeholders and an international jury with authorities is involved for the selection and awarding process.

LUSAKA, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government on Thursday called on the international community to endorse the view of scientists that unless governments act quickly, all life forms on earth face the real risk of being endangered by 2030. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a grouping of scientists, presented a report at the ongoing 24th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 24 ), warning that human activities were contributing significantly to natural disasters and unpredictable weather patterns. The experts called on countries to adopt renewable energy and ensure a significant reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels. They also suggested capping the rise in global temperature at 1.5 degrees by 2030. The ambassador cited Zambia's experience in 2015 and 2016 when dry weather caused by El Nino resulted in an electricity shortage. "It is my country's firm belief that the Paris Agreement work program will ... contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Convention by strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change," he said in a release. Zambia is deeply concerned that climate change is posing a serious threat to the country's socio-economic developmental gains and has adopted a National Policy on Climate Change that provides a framework for a coordinated response to the climate challenge, he said.

China is participating in South-South cooperation voluntarily as part of its effort to address climate change, not out of historical responsibility or the obligations of international treaties, said a senior official of an international organization for the developing world. Developed countries have far more responsibility to lead and provide the money and technology needed for developing countries, said Meenakshi Raman, coordinator of the climate change program of the Third World Network. Raman spoke on the sidelines of the ongoing 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 24 , in Katowice, Poland. "China is playing a leadership role ... in a world where you have the largest per capita carbon emitter, the United States, walking out of the Paris agreement," she said on Wednesday. China has been promoting South-South cooperation in curbing climate change, Raman said. "China does this not because of its historic responsibility or because it has any obligation under the Convention on Climate Change or the Paris agreement, but it does it voluntarily," she said. There is much the developing world could learn from China, which leads in renewable energy, she said. "There are many things that we can learn. And in fact, it's very important, through South-South cooperation, that developing countries share with each other," she said. "The responsibility to address the common problem must be differentiated between developed and developing countries. Those with the largest historical responsibility and largest historical emissions have far more responsibility to take leadership." "Well-developed countries are basically going back on their commitments. I use the term commitments because these are legal obligations," she said, explaining that the Climate Change Convention makes it an obligation of developed countries to provide financial support. Developed countries pledged, in COP 15 in 2009, $30 billion for a Fast Start fund from 2010 to 2012, with an increase in aid to $100 billion per year by 2020.

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on Tuesday called for more efforts to fight climate change as a new report showed global carbon dioxide emissions rose for the first time in four years. The 2018 Global Emissions Report released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) showed that global carbon dioxide emissions rose again during 2017 after a three-year hiatus, highlighting the imperative for countries to deliver on the historic Paris Agreement to keep global warming to below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The report came just days before the key UN climate change conference known as COP 24 to be held in Katowice, Poland, with the agency urging nations to triple their efforts to curb harmful emissions. The UNEP report also came hot on the heels of the watershed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on global warming, released in October, which cautioned that emissions had to stop rising now, in order to keep temperature increases below 1.5 degrees Celsius, and reduce the risks for the well-being of the planet and its people. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere is largely responsible for rising global temperatures, according to the overwhelming body of scientific evidence. UNEP's 2018 report indicated that global emissions have reached historic levels. Total annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including from land-use change, reached a record high of 53.5 Gigatons (Gt) in 2017, an increase of 0.7 Gt compared with 2016. "In contrast, global GHG emissions in 2030 need to be approximately 25 percent and 55 percent lower than in 2017 to put the world on a least-cost pathway to limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius and 1.5 degrees respectively," said the report. What's worse, the report noted that there is no sign of reversal of this trend and that only 57 countries (representing 60 percent of global emissions) are on track to bridge their "emissions gap" - meaning "the gap between where we are likely to be and where we need to be." The authors of the report noted that nations would need to triple their efforts on climate action without further delay, in order to meet the two-degree-rise limit by mid-century. The report offered concrete ways for governments to bridge their emissions gap, including through fiscal policy, innovative technology, non-state and subnational action, and more. This ninth UNEP emissions report was prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information. Enditem \</doc>

Illustration: Liu Rui/GT As much as scientists and climate activists are urging the world not to forget the promises it made in Paris in 2015 at the ongoing COP24 United Nations climate meeting in Katowice, Poland, another key global meeting on an issue of global importance barely made the news recently, even if the issue, biodiversity - the ecosystems on which all human life depends - needs just as much attention. At the UN Biodiversity Conference 2018 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 13-29, senior delegates warned that urgent leadership is needed if the world is to halt the current wave of extinction, often referred to as the "sixth mass extinction," the Guardian reported. Many of the delegates then pointed to China as a possible leader in the fight to protect biodiversity, as other issues, political and otherwise, continue to distract other nations. Scientists have been warning of the sixth wave for some time. In a sobering report published in the leading US journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in July 2017, researchers described the rapid global loss of diversity among species as a "biological annihilation." It found that all kinds of species, including mammals, insects and plants, are contracting. The report warns that such is the unprecedented rate of species extinction, it will have "negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization."The main causes of these losses, says the report, are habitat destruction, overhunting, toxic pollution, invasion by alien species and climate change. But one of the report's authors, Paul Ehrlich, also warns of the consequences of further biodiversity loss from overpopulation and overconsumption, according to the Guardian.Moreover, the annual WWF Living Planet Report 2018, published in October, found that since 1970, populations of vertebrates have declined by 60 percent, and among them freshwater species by 83 percent. Since 1500, agriculture and human overexploitation of animals has caused 75 percent of mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian and plant extinction, said the WWF. The world is exceeding its biological capacity. It is not something that we think about a lot. For example, we depend on trees to take carbon out of our atmosphere and provide oxygen, or that deforestation leaves people in mountainous areas at risk of landslides, but they are not perhaps aware of all that ecosystem brings to humans.These range from food and medications, to timber and mineral resources. It includes cultural services. Then ecosystems help regulate our world - sometimes nature turns on us, when there is a wildfire or an avalanche, but we also need working ecosystems to protect us from floods, from the extremes of climate and to purify our water resources. Even pollination of crops is included. Many people will not ever think of these resources in purely economic terms. But now in this increasingly money-driven world, people may only pay attention if an issue is couched in dollars and cents. The WWF report noted that pollinators account for $235 billion to $577 billion in crop production every year, involving over 20,000 species of bees, as well as other insects, birds, flies, beetles - even bats. More to the point, as climate change exacerbates the problems of biodiversity loss, so does the loss of biodiversity exacerbate the effects of climate change, and all the problems we can expect from unchecked temperature rises - extreme weather, disease, drought, climate refugees. It is a classic example of a vicious circle.During the Egypt conference, senior leaders and experts talked of the absence of leadership from the US, Europe and the incoming administration in Brazil, which it is feared will dismantle many of the protections for Amazon rainforest, and pointed to China's potential to lead the way.Cristiana Pasca, executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity told the Guardian that China is a crucial player in the fight against biodiversity loss, particularly given that it was instrumental in pushing through the Paris Climate Accord, but also because China will host the next high-level biodiversity conference in 2020, at which new targets are to be agreed on the protection of rivers, oceans, forests and wildlife. China apparently took a low-key approach at the conference, media said, but the country has set itself new environmental targets, which include the drawing of ecological "red lines" to strengthen environmental protection and the establishment of national parks, in which human activity will be controlled. It also has an overarching goal of creating an ecological civilization, and creating fundamental changes in the environment by 2035, according to the Xinhua News Agency.We can see that China is serious about improving its environment, but there is still a long way to go, and laws are still routinely flouted. We often see reports of animal and plant trafficking in the press, or of people operating illegal polluting factories or coal mines, all of which negatively impact ecosystems and biodiversity. Increased urbanization as people move from rural areas to cities also takes away habitats. Yet so much of China is still mountain, plateau or desert, all unique ecosystems. Many efforts are starting to concentrate on the restoration of particular ecosystems or even species - and here, we are looking beyond pandas, known as a "charismatic" species as it attracts attention, to tree restoration in the deserts of western China, for example. But does China have enough clout to make an impact on the global fight to protect biodiversity? The fact that the key 2020 meeting will be held in the country will perhaps be a decisive factor, as surely the hosts will want to crown the meeting with major achievements. Perhaps, in the interim, China can take the lead in tackling wildlife trafficking and continue to work on giving its environmental laws real teeth, as well as ensuring that when its companies take on projects overseas, they adhere to best environmental practice, then where it leads, others may follow.The author is a Beijing-based freelance writer who is doing postgraduate studies in sustainability at SOAS, University of London.

BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping and other Group of 20 (G20) leaders concluded a fruitful summit Saturday, exchanging in-depth views on building consensus for fair and sustainable development. The group issued a declaration after the two-day summit, sending a positive signal to the international community and market and maintaining the cooperative momentum among the G20 economies. Xi put forward a four-point proposal, urging the group to steer the world economy responsibly, stay committed to openness and cooperation, and play a leading political role in nurturing favorable conditions for international trade and fighting climate change. URGING TO STEER WORLD ECONOMY RESPONSIBLY Addressing the 13th G20 summit on Friday, Xi urged the G20 to stick to openness, partnership, innovation and inclusiveness. He warned of accelerated accumulation of risks in the global economy and pledged that China will firmly push forward a new round of reform and opening-up, with increased efforts in intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and more imports. Noting that it has been 10 years since the global financial crisis broke out and the first G20 summit was convened, the Chinese president said the global economy today, while maintaining growth on the whole, is still not free from the underlying impacts of the crisis. "Old growth drivers are yet to be replaced by new ones, while various risks are rapidly building up," he said. "The world economy is facing another historical choice." With the industrial chain, value chain and supply chain ever growing and expanding, greater coordination and complementarity among countries meet the need of productivity growth and will also shape the future of relations of production, he said. In this process, countries are increasingly becoming a community with shared interests, shared responsibilities and a shared future, and win-win cooperation is the only choice going forward, Xi said. He called on G20 leaders to work with "the same courage and strategic vision" as has been demonstrated 10 years ago when the first G20 summit was convened. "Facing various challenges, we must have a stronger sense of urgency, be rational in approach and look beyond the horizon. We must fulfill our responsibility and steer the global economy in the right direction," he said. During a discussion on fair and sustainable future, Xi said that with the G20's combined economy making up over 80 percent of the world's total, as long as each member keeps its economy stable and growing, the world economy will be stable and growing. He encouraged the G20 to contribute positive energy to the world economy and reduce the negative spillover of certain macro-economic policies, so as to initiate a virtuous cycle of common development. MAKING FOUR-POINT PROPOSAL The G20 economies demonstrated a positive will to address differences through consultation and standing united in face of challenges, with Xi putting forward a four-point proposal. Firstly, Xi called on G20 members to stay committed to openness and cooperation and uphold the multilateral trading system. "We should firmly uphold free trade and the rules-based multilateral trading system," he said. China supports necessary reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and believes that it is critical to uphold the WTO's core values and fundamental principles such as openness, inclusiveness and non-discrimination and ensure the development interests and policy space of developing countries, said the Chinese president. During the process, all sides need to conduct extensive consultation to achieve gradual progress, he said. Secondly, Xi urged the G20 to forge strong partnership and step up macro-policy coordination. He called for the use of "the three tools of fiscal and monetary policies and structural reform in a holistic way to ensure strong, balanced, sustainable and inclusive growth of the global economy." Developed economies, when adopting monetary and fiscal policies, should give more consideration to and work to minimize the impact such policies may exert on emerging markets and developing economies, he said. The international monetary system should become more diversified, and the global financial safety net should continue to be strengthened, he added. Thirdly, the G20 should stay committed to innovation and create new momentum for growth, Xi said. He called on the group to encourage innovation and leverage the role of the digital economy in growing the real economy. "We need to watch out for risks and challenges brought by the application of new technologies, and strengthen the legal and regulatory framework," Xi said. "We should give priority to achieving development through fully tapping our innovation potential. At the same time, we also need to keep our doors open and encourage the spread of new technologies and knowledge so that innovation will benefit more countries and peoples," said the Chinese president. Xi proposed that the G20 carry out an in-depth study on the application and impact of new technologies on a priority basis to explore new thinking and new ways of cooperation in this area. Fourthly, Xi urged the G20 to stay committed to win-win cooperation to promote inclusive global development. "We need to continue to follow a people-centered development philosophy and endeavor to deliver a sense of fulfillment, happiness and security to our people," he said. CALLING FOR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP ON TRADE, CLIMATE CHANGE Xi also called on the G20 to play a leading political role in nurturing favorable conditions for international trade, and urged the G20 to inject political impetus into international cooperation on jointly tackling climate change. On the trade issue, the Chinese president said that the G20 should firstly stick to openness and free trade, maintain and further expand an open market, and realize win-win cooperation through mutual exchanges and complementarity. Secondly, the G20 should stick to inclusiveness, and bring the benefits of international trade and economic globalization to people of all countries and all classes, Xi said. Thirdly, the G20 should uphold rules-oriented spirit and nurture a stable and expectable institutional environment for the healthy development of international trade, he said. On climate change, Xi said it is a major challenge to the future and destiny of mankind, which requires G20's joint efforts. China, France and the United Nations reiterated their firm commitment to implementing the Paris Agreement on Friday, sending a strong signal of pushing forward international cooperation to tackle global warming, Xi said. He urged the G20 to inject political impetus into the international cooperation on jointly fighting climate change, with a sense of responsibility of building a community with a shared future for mankind. The Chinese side looks forward to the participating sides reaching a package agreement at the upcoming Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice, Poland, and implementing the Paris Agreement based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, Xi said. China stands ready to make joint efforts with various sides and make its due contribution, he added. The Chinese president arrived in Buenos Aires on Thursday night to attend the G20 summit on Friday and Saturday, and pay a state visit to Argentina. Enditem \</doc>

China tops the world in its effort to reduce carbon emissions, despite the enormous challenges it faces as a highly populated developing country, according to a senior Chinese climate change expert. He Jiankun, deputy president of China's National Expert Committee on Climate Change, made the comment on Tuesday on the sidelines of the ongoing 24th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 24 , in Katowice, Poland. "China surpasses other countries in carbon emissions, as it is large not only economically but also in territory and population. The country, however, is making great efforts in transforming its energy structure and it tops other countries in the growth of new and renewable energies," He said. China has the largest hydroelectric, wind and solar power generating capacities in the world and also leads all countries in annual growth of those three types of energy. The country's investment in new energy, the largest in the world, is still expanding at unparalleled speed, he said. By the end of last year, China's renewable energy generating capacity had reached 650 million kilowatts, up by 14 percent year-on-year. A total of 1.6 trillion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectric, wind and solar power were generated in the country last year, according to China's Policy and Actions for Addressing Climate Change (2018). On average, the world is seeing its carbon intensity - emissions per unit of GDP - decrease by no more than 2 percent a year, half the rate of China. China's decrease in carbon intensity is much faster than that of developed countries, He said. China's carbon intensity last year was 46 percent lower than in 2005, fulfilling China's goal to cut carbon emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020. The country plans to further cut emissions to lower the intensity by 60 to 65 percent and increase the ratio of energy from nonfossil fuel in the national energy structure to 20 percent by 2030. He also said the country is expected to sell 1 million to 1.5 million electric cars this year, which is more than half the world's total sales of such vehicles. China has produced these huge achievements even though it faces greater challenges than developed countries in reducing carbon emissions, he said. "As a developing country, we must coordinate our efforts to promote sustainable development and tackle climate change. We have to improve people's livelihoods by developing the economy. Meanwhile, we have to try to lower the carbon intensity," he said. With other environmental challenges addressed, however, the developed countries, which have achieved broad modernization, are able to - and also should - have their efforts focused on carbon reduction, he said. "Instead of taking up the responsibility that should be shouldered by the United States, we should do what we can based on our own capabilities," he said. "Developing countries are faced with no other options but to adhere to a low-carbon development path to reduce emissions while promoting social and economic development. China's experience provides instructive references for other developing countries." China has shown great leadership in tackling climate change, said Meenakshi Raman, legal adviser and coordinator of the climate change program of the Third World Network, which was formed to strengthen cooperation among development and environmental groups in developing countries. China still tops the world in carbon emissions. But it's not valid to compare the emissions of China with those of developed countries, she said. "It's not the same because, in the history of climate change, many of the problems we are facing today arose largely because many of the developed countries, which have become rich, did not constrain their carbon emissions," she said. In an interview with Xinhua News Agency, UN General Assembly President Maria Fernanda Espinosa said China has a "critical role" in tackling climate change and has made "immense progress" on low carbon technologies, as well as policy work on the reduction of emissions. "I'm impressed with China's commitment to its climate goals, as indicated by the fact that it has met its 2020 target three years ahead of schedule," Espinosa said. "I think China's demonstration of the mutually reinforcing goals of climate action and economic development can go a long way to encourage others to increase their ambition to achieve a sustainable and prosperous future."

BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa on Friday met here in an informal BRICS leaders' meeting on the margins of the Group of 20 (G20) summit. The following is the full text of the media statement of the meeting: Media Statement Informal BRICS Leaders' Meeting on the margins of the G20 Summit 30 November, 2018 1.We, the Heads of State and Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa, met on 30 November 2018 for the annual Informal BRICS Leaders' Meeting on the margins of the G20 Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We congratulated and supported the Argentine Presidency for G20 in 2018 and expressed our gratitude at the hospitality provided. 2.We exchanged views on international political, security and global economic-financial issues, as well as challenges facing sustainable development. We recommit ourselves to a world of peace and stability, the central role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter, and respect for international law, the promotion of democracy and the rule of law. We reiterate our commitment to working together to strengthen multilateralism and promote a fair, just, equitable, democratic and representative international order. 3.We deplore continued terrorist attacks, including against some BRICS countries. We condemn terrorism in all forms and manifestations, wherever committed and by whom so ever. We urge concerted efforts to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis. We call upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, including all the elements identified in the Johannesburg Declaration. 4.We reaffirm our full support for the rules-based multilateral trading system, as embodied in the WTO, to ensure transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive international trade. We express our common readiness to engage in frank and result-oriented discussions with other WTO members with a view to improving the functioning of the WTO. 5.The spirit and rules of the WTO run counter to unilateral and protectionist measures. We call on all members to oppose such WTO inconsistent measures, stand by their commitments undertaken in the WTO and rollback such measures of a discriminatory and restrictive nature. 6.We support work towards improvement of the WTO with the view to enhance its relevance and effectiveness to address current and future challenges. In this work the core value and fundamental principles of the WTO should be preserved and interests of all WTO members should be reflected, in particular those of the developing members. 7.The dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO is essential for its proper functioning. Its effective functioning will give members the required confidence to engage in future negotiating in the WTO. We therefore urge that the Appellate Body selection process be initiated immediately, as an essential prerequisite for the stable and effective functioning of the WTO dispute settlement system. 8.We reaffirm our commitment to enhance our communication and cooperation and work jointly and collaboratively with other members to enable the WTO to keep up with the changing times, promote inclusive growth and participation of all countries in international trade and play a meaningful role in global economic governance. 9.We welcome the G20 Argentine Presidency's theme of Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development and its focus on the Future of Work, Infrastructure for Development and Food Security for Sustainable Future. 11.We advocate for a strong Global Financial Safety Net with an adequately resourced, quota-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) at its centre. To this effect, we reaffirm our commitment to the conclusion of the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula so as to ensure the increased voice of the dynamic emerging and developing economies to reflect their relative contributions to the world economy while protecting the voices of the least developed counties, by the 2019 Spring Meetings and no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings. 12.We reinforce our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals that would provide equitable, inclusive, open, all-round innovation-driven and sustainable development, in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, towards the ultimate goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. We urge developed countries to honour their ODA commitments fully, in time and to provide additional development resources to developing countries in accordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. 13.The global economic expansion continues, however, it has been less balanced and downside risks have risen. We are concerned that the negative spill-overs by policy normalization from major advanced economies has been an important source of volatility of some emerging market economies witnessed recently. We call on all economies to strengthen their policy dialogue and coordination in the spirit of partnership at the G20 and other fora to prevent potential risks from spreading. 14.Regarding Climate Change, we recommit ourselves to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the principles of the UNFCCC including the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and urge developed countries to provide financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries to enhance their capability in mitigation and adaptation. We call upon all countries to reach a balanced outcome under the Paris Agreement Work Programme during COP-24 that enables operationalization and implementation of the Paris Agreement. We stress the importance and urgency of conducting a successful and ambitious first replenishment process of the Green Climate Fund. 15.We reiterate our warm appreciation to South Africa for the success of the 10th BRICS Summit, Johannesburg, 25-27 July 2018 and recommit ourselves to enhancing further our strategic partnership for the benefit of our peoples. We express satisfaction with the achievements of BRICS cooperation in the areas of economy, peace and security and people-to-people exchanges under South Africa's Chairship, including the establishment of the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution (PartNIR), the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Centre, the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform and the Americas Regional Office of the New Development Bank in Sao Paulo. We reaffirm our commitment to fully implement the outcomes of the Johannesburg Summit and previous Summits. 16.We look forward to the 11th BRICS Summit to be hosted by Brazil in 2019 and extend our full support to Brazil as the incoming BRICS Chair.

Illustration: Liu Rui/GT The headlines have been alarming, but perhaps up till now they haven't been alarming enough. In unusually strong language, scientists have warned it is the "final call" to save the world from catastrophic global warming. The report, released after a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in South Korea, lays out the impact of the world not limiting the rise in temperature to 1.5 C. The IPCC says that currently the world is on track for a rise in temperature of 3 C, double the desired rise promised in the landmark Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. What is needed, they say, is "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society" in the next 12 years. It has been clear what needs to be done for several decades - yet some countries are still balking, and some are taking regressive steps. The IPCC has previously published a number of comprehensive reports on climate change - the last in 2013 - in which they laid out the effects of what different temperature rise scenarios would mean for the world in terms of sea level rise, drought, disease, extreme weather events and the risks to food security. But these reports are hard to wade through, even for the interested, and are couched in scientific language - and this has given climate deniers, at the individual, corporate and the government level - what they believe is wiggle room. Because scientists rarely speak in absolute terms, they use the language of probability - there is a 90 or 95 percent chance of a certain rise in sea level for a 2 C rise, or there is a high likelihood of global warming exacerbating the effects of extreme weather events, like hurricanes. They describe global warming as a theory - which means it's certain for them, but for those less couched in scientific terminology, they use it as a way to insist man-made climate change is not an absolute certainty.I don't want to blame scientists for the lack of urgency on the part of some governments - although I have heard it said that if the responsibility for informing the world about global warming had been given to marketing or PR people in the first place, we would be much further along. I agree - the general public would have had a better understanding and would have been able to exert more pressure on their leaders and lawmakers. Until now, attention has been focused on reducing emissions from power generation, but now, the IPCC report says, we must turn our attention to other sectors, particularly transportation and agriculture. We must all reduce meat consumption, and travel and live more sustainably. Individuals and governments must act now. But at a time populist leaders are gaining ascendency - in the US, Europe and Brazil - and threatening to overturn previous legislation, who should take the lead? The world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the US, not only is withdrawing from the Paris deal, it has appointed climate change skeptics to its environmental administration, and is seeking to unravel many environmental protection measures, such as fuel emission standards. Certainly, this is pushed by vested interests in Washington, but what is hard to fathom is ignoring the evidence in front of people - the incredibly hot summer the Northern Hemisphere experienced this year, increasing incidents of drought and flooding in many parts of the globe, extreme temperatures and even forest fires in the Arctic, and recently, two very strong hurricanes that hit the southern US and Central America, causing extreme destruction and loss of life. The IPCC report said that 93 percent of the excess heat we have caused is stored in the oceans, and warmer water means more intense hurricanes and typhoons.Even some nations which have led in emissions reductions, such as the UK and Germany, have taken a few steps backward - a UK court has just lifted a ban on fracking in northwest England, and in Germany, protestors are trying to save the last remnants of the 12,000-year-old Hambach Forest before it is destroyed for an open pit coal mine - and this is lignite, the worst type of polluting coal. In Australia, while it's true the nation does not contribute a high amount of greenhouse gases in global terms - some 1 percent, the government is still pinning its hopes on coal, one minister having referred to the IPCC document as "some sort of report". As for US President Donald Trump, according to media reports, he has not deigned to comment at all. Forbes magazine described the US administration's approach to the issue as "stupid," and former vice president Al Gore said that the Trump administration is a "rogue outlier" in its desire to prop up polluting industries and that it is in direct opposition to many US businesses, states, cities and people. What about China? Still the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, nevertheless, it has been taking steps to reduce emissions and decrease its reliance on the most polluting fossil fuels. At the end of 2017, China announced plans for a carbon trading market, although it won't start until 2020. In some sectors, it is moving rapidly - production of solar panels has been so quick, the price has come down globally much earlier than expected. Shenzhen's entire fleet of 16,359 public buses are electric - according to a Bloomberg report in May, China adds some 9,500 electric buses every five weeks - that's as big as the London bus fleet. Still, despite the progress on renewables, China still gets 68 percent of its energy from coal, according to data from the International Energy Agency.We may yet see at the upcoming COP 24 climate conference in Katowice, Poland, at which more details of the Paris Agreement are to be thrashed out, that the IPCC report has helped focus the minds of lawmakers. The US is attending, but like last year, is unlikely to play a prominent role. So far, China has not signaled that it will step in and fill the leadership vacuum left behind by the US, but some observers think that it could fill this role. After all, if other nations are unwilling to invest in green technologies and take the bold steps necessary to mitigate climate change, the world may turn to those who are willing to.The author is a Beijing-based freelance writer who is doing postgraduate studies in sustainability at SOAS, University of London.

Coffee shop adds royal flavors to Palace Museum The Palace Museum opened a coffee shop for the modern-day guests of Chinese emperors recently - the Corner Tower Cafe - and it quickly became a hot spot for visitors, bringing traditional cultural heritage closer to the younger generation. The decor of the cafe will be altered from time to time based on the themes of the exhibitions in the Palace Museum, says Zhang Yadong, who runs the shop. In addition to drinks and food, the Corner Tower Cafe offers cultural and creative items such as stamps, fans and table mats, all of which have designs related to the museum. Training in Portuguese emphasized by Macao The Macao Special Administrative Region has placed "unprecedented" importance on encouraging people to learn Portuguese, language and culture scholars say. They added that the efforts by Macao are one answer to the country's call for the SAR to become a commercial and trade cooperation service platform between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. Only 0.6 percent of Macao residents speak Portuguese, according to official statistics. The total population of Macao is more than 650,000. Yao Jingming, head of the Department of Portuguese at the University of Macau, says more seats and scholarships have been provided for local students to study Portuguese. Hydropower operator looks to opportunities China Three Gorges Corp, which built and now operates the world's largest hydroelectric power plant-Three Gorges Dam - is looking forward to further cooperation with Portugal to jointly tap the potential of third-party markets. In addition to the 950-megawatt Moray offshore wind project in Scotland that CTGC and Portuguese power company Energias de Portugal will jointly explore, the Beijing-based company said it looks forward to more exploration of third-party markets around the world. The two sides have made significant progress in third-party markets since a strategic partnership was established in 2011. The companies aim to further combine efforts to become a worldwide leader in renewable energy generation. Contributions of 3 to Angkor Wat recognized The Cambodian government awarded honorary medals to three Chinese cultural heritage conservators in Siem Reap on Dec 4 for their outstanding contributions to the protection of Angkor Wat. The three conservators from the Chinese Academy of Cultural Heritage in Beijing-Xu Yan, Wang Yuanlin and Gu Jun - were leading experts in the China-led renovation of Ta Keo, a 46,000-square-meter temple dating back to the 10th century in Angkor Wat, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Siem Reap. The renovation began in 2010 and was completed earlier this year. Officials fired over English exam scores Several senior officials with the education and examination management authorities in Zhejiang province were punished on Nov 5 after the weighting of scores in the college entrance examination's English test sparked widespread discontent and challenges from examinees and teachers. Chen Guangsheng, deputy secretary-general of Zhejiang's provincial government, told a news conference that Guo Huawei, Party secretary and head of the provincial Education Department, and Wang Yuqing, Party secretary of the Zhejiang Education Examinations Authority, had both been removed from their posts. The provincial discipline inspection commission also launched an investigation of Wang and Chen Yujun, the chief of the examinations authority's discipline inspection commission, for violations of Party discipline. Employment kept stable amid downward pressure 282 get prison terms for telecom fraud roles Eight are arrested in online gambling case Police in Anhui province arrested eight people for allegedly organizing online gambling that involved more than 500 gamblers and a cash flow of over 100 million yuan ($14.6 million; 13 million euros; 11 million). Police in the city of Chuzhou received a tip in July about a gang organizing an online casino via an instant messaging app. The informant confessed to having lost 130,000 yuan since March in chat groups. A task group was set up to investigate the case in the city of Pingxiang, in neighboring Jiangxi province, where the chat group organizers were based. Constitution endorses 'one country, two systems' Better control of opioids will reduce risks China's announcement that it will expand control of fentanyl and related substances will further reduce the risks of illegal production, abuse and smuggling, a narcotics-control expert said.

In early November, as the United Nations COP26 climate summit was getting underway in Glasgow, Scotland, I wrote an op-ed about the "eco-anxiety" I have been experiencing for many years. It began nearly 30 years ago when I witnessed a torrential downpour. It caused me much angst, and since then, as the impacts of climate change have worsened and politicians have repeatedly failed to confront this crisis with real action, my angst has worsened. COP26 , considered by many to be the world's best and last chance to avert runaway climate change, has now come and gone. What might have been a climate summit that would offer some relief to eco-distressed people like me, has instead left us feeling betrayed, even more anxious and with little hope. To make matters worse, no sooner did COP26 end than British Columbia was battered by yet another catastrophic climate event, its third in six months. After the summer's brutal wildfires and a deadly, suffocating heat dome in late June, an atmospheric river descended on B.C. causing massive flooding and landslides and leaving many homeless, roads washed out and at least four people dead. The following week, Atlantic Canada experienced a similar atmospheric river. In response to the first atmospheric river event in B.C. in November, the insurance industry called the devastation caused by the extreme rainfalls a wake-up call. A wake-up call? There have been many climate wake-up calls in Canada going back several decades. Anxiety levels are further heightened by reports that the greenhouse gas reduction pledges by nearly 200 countries at COP26 will fall far short of keeping the global temperature increases below 1.5 C, not nearly good enough to stave off climate chaos. If COP26 In the words of UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, "the outcome of COP26 (is) ... a compromise;...(it takes) important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough." COP26 did not deliver its promise. So what do we do now? Immediate plans and funding for adaptation and emergency measures are required to ensure those affected are able to weather and survive the many more severe storms to come. Canada needs to steadily transition away from fossil fuels and cease all subsidies that have sustained the coal, oil and gas industries for decades. The transition needs to be just and equitable, so that workers who lose jobs due to the phasing out of fossil fuels are safeguarded and supported though the transition. Individual actions, while vital and important, will not solve our climate emergency on their own. As Seth Klein states in his 2020 book, "A Good War: Mobilizing Canada for the Climate Emergency," this crisis can be best addressed by focused government action similar to Canada's extraordinary efforts during the Second World War. As individual citizens, our most important mission is to petition our government to act. We must remember the shortcomings of COP26 and extreme weather events of November 2021 and push our elected representatives to reach for and meet ambitious climate goals. In my experience, citizen action is, by far, the best remedy for eco-anxiety.

Given recent flooding, heat domes and fires, British Columbians have a direct interest in the outcome of the most recent efforts to address climate change at the COP26 meetings in Glasgow, Scotland. After two weeks of negotiations, close to 200 countries reached agreement on the COP26 Climate Pact. But while the parties reached a consensus agreement, there is no consensus on what was accomplished. U.S. special presidential envoy John Kerry, for example, concluded that COP26 brought the world "closer than we have ever been before to avoiding climate chaos and securing (cleaner) air, safer water and (a) healthier planet," while former Irish president Mary Robinson described the outcome as a "shameful dereliction of duty." Those supporting the positive view of COP26 can point to the commitment to deliver financial aid to poorer countries, cut methane emissions, stop deforestation, strengthen nationally determined commitments by 2022 and to accelerate "efforts toward the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies." Those supporting the pessimistic view can point to the fact the targets submitted to COP26 will not limit warming to 1.5 degrees. And the situation is even worse because emissions are likely to exceed these woefully inadequate targets because policies to achieve them are not in place. And, while the optimists herald the first ever explicit reference to addressing coal and fossil fuel, the pessimists point to the watereddown commitment from "phasing out coal power" in an earlier draft to "phasedown unabated coal power" as a symbol of the paucity of commitment to tackle the climate crisis. Like many debates, there is evidence to support both interpretations. Analysis from Climate Action Tracker and the United Nations confirm that under current policies, the world will warm by 2.7 degrees, almost double the Paris target. If the 2030 GHG national reduction targets submitted at COP26 are met, the world will still warm by 2.1 degrees. But on a positive note, this is a big improvement since the Paris Accord in 2015, when existing policies would have resulted in a warming of 3.6 degrees. Progress has clearly been made. And if the 2030 and 2050 net zero targets submitted at COP26 are met, warming could be limited to between 1.8 and 2.1 degrees. Admittedly meeting these targets is a big if. The world has missed past targets and a recent evaluation concludes that 96 per cent of the net zero plans are inadequate. The mixed view of COP26 progress is well illustrated by Canada. Canada attempted to show leadership at COP26 by upping its 2030 emission reduction target from 30 per cent to 40-45 per cent and adopting a 2050 net zero target, generally consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Canada also announced a cap on oil and gas emissions and has committed to a phase out of coal by 2030, and a 75 per cent reduction in methane emissions by 2030. But Canada's current climate plan will not meet its 2030 target and Canada has no plan to meet its 2050 net zero target. The details on the commitment to cap oil and gas emissions are unclear, and the plan to reduce consumption and ultimately phase out fossil fuels is left for another day. Canada committed to the phase out of fossil fuel subsidies and financing of foreign fossil fuel development at COP26 , but still provides $25 billion in subsidies and financing of fossil fuel pipelines in Canada contrary to its promise to phase them out. Overall, Canada's climate plan is rated as highly insufficient in a recent international evaluation and Canada remains among the highest per capita GHG emitters in the developed world. The good news is that COP26 and Canada have made progress in addressing the climate crisis. The bad news is that there remains a massive gap that needs to be filled. It may be expecting too much to have this gap addressed in a single meeting, but it is imperative that it be addressed soon. And Canada's role should not be underestimated. Although Canada accounts for under two per cent of world emissions, its performance is a portent of the world's ability to address this gap. If a wealthy country like Canada with a population highly supportive of action to address climate change cannot meet the challenge, then the pessimists are right.

Science Matters Vol. 23, No. 46 November 23, 2021 Suggested HL: Where do we go from COP26 ? By David Suzuki AS THE world moves on from the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, the signs of our predicament are everywhere. Where I live, torrential rains have flooded towns and valleys, stranding and killing people and animals, wiped out roads, bridges and railways and cut land access to Vancouver. A state of emergency was declared. Horrific memories of summer heat domes and wildfires are still fresh. This is a small corner of the world. But the signs are everywhere. We should never consider this as some kind of new normal, and we must do everything we can to prevent it from getting worse. In light of that, was COP26 just more "blah, blah, blah," or will it help us avert catastrophe? International gatherings and agreements are important but they alone aren't enough. COP26 was intended to finalize the Paris Agreement and get countries to accelerate climate action this decade. It's all proceeding as intended, but things get watered down during negotiations and many of the agreed-upon measures are voluntary. Most world leaders are sincere in recognizing climate disruption for the crisis it is and in wanting to address it. But until they recognize the urgent need to radically shift course and halt all new coal, oil and gas development, we'll continue to face ever- accelerating risks from flooding, heat, drought, wildfires, human displacement and more. Although many countries made some progress, including reducing or eliminating methane pollution, cutting fossil fuel subsidies abroad and reducing coal, oil and gas production, they came up short in many areas. COP26 was an epic fail for climate justice. In many ways, the agreements increase divisions among rich and poor countries and civil society and corporate interests, worsening the situation for those losing their lives, homes and livelihoods to climate change impacts. Despite limited measures to curb fossil fuel subsidies, governments around the world, including Canada's, will continue to bolster the industry with tax and royalty breaks and things like infrastructure purchases - not to mention public relations support from some provincial and state governments. Despite its failings, the climate summit did get politicians, bureaucrats, corporate executives and others to agree on important goals. But it's not enough to leave it all up to people, countries and companies with widely varying agendas and priorities. We must all get involved. We can thank those who have engaged for much of the progress at COP26 . Millions of young people and elders taking to streets around the world, massive marches in Glasgow during the summit, and people speaking out, writing, petitioning and creating art have made the world pay attention to humanity's role in the crises we now confront. When we demand action, politicians must listen. Here in Canada, our government has made strong commitments. We need to make sure those words are backed with effective action and we need to push for better. Canada must work quickly to update its climate plan, cap and ratchet down oil and gas emissions and develop a blueprint for a managed production decline. To confirm a true change in direction, our country must sign on to the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance and deliver on the commitment to end public finance for oil and gas subsidies abroad by 2022. Canada must also bring in just transition legislation without delay to ensure workers affected by the necessary energy shift are given support and opportunities. Canada may only contribute around two per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions (not counting those from others burning the products we sell or producing abroad the products we buy), but we have the third- highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita, the third-largest known oil reserves and we're the world's fourth-largest oil exporter. What we do matters. Our climate is rapidly changing and it will continue to do so for some time because of the emissions we've already pumped into the atmosphere. That means, as well as halting activities that contribute to climate disruption, we must also find ways to protect ourselves from costly and deadly floods, fires, slides, extreme weather events and more. COP26 and the Paris Agreement are part of the solution, but we need so much more. David Suzuki is a scientist, broadcaster, author and co-founder of the David Suzuki Foundation.

Tribune News Service LONDON - 291 positive COVID-19 tests have been reported as linked to COP26 -related activities, an initial assessment has found. The findings from Public Health Scotland, released this week, assessed the number of people who reported that they had been to an event related to the climate summit, including workshops and protests outside the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow. PHS also estimated that just four out of every 1,000 people in the conference centre itself tested positive for the virus. About 12 in every 1,000 people in the wider Scottish population tested positive in the week of Nov. 6. But PHS said further assessment of the impact of the summit on case numbers will be required, given the event closed on Saturday. Speaking at Holyrood last Thursday, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I can confirm that there is no sign so far of any significant spike in cases associated with COP. "Rigorous measures were put in place to minimize the risks of COVID transmission. "For example, anyone entering the main summit site - the Blue Zone - had to provide evidence of a negative lateral flow test result. Information published earlier today by Public Health Scotland suggests that of the people officially affiliated with COP26 , approximately four in every 1,000 tested positive for COVID through routine lateral flow testing." The Scottish leader added: "All of this suggests that the mitigations put in place were effective. "I want to put on record my thanks to delegates for their compliance and indeed to everyone who worked so hard in the run-up to and during COP26 to secure the safest possible environment." Attendees were asked to show a negative lateral flow test before accessing the venue, and there was enforced mask wearing and intensive cleaning regimes. The PHS report shows 92 people returned a negative test, but were in the venue while potentially infectious. "One explanation for this is that the performance of LFDs, even in the hands of trained users, can be less sensitive than PCR-based tests," the report said. "As a result, early asymptomatic infections may have been missed. "Further linkage of LFD and PCR linkage may identify additional people who tested positive only by PCR or, alternatively, people who subsequently tested negative by PCR. "Consideration of this additional analysis will be important in refining final estimates of infection rates amongst COP26 affiliates." \</doc>

GLASGOW - Quebec Premier Fran\'e7ois Legault met with Prince Charles during the United Nations conference on climate change ( COP26 ) in Glasgow. The unplanned meeting was not included on the official schedule for the premier. Media following the premier were only advised after the fact. Legault had meetings planned at the Kelvingrove Museum. Prince Charles was in the same building at the same time, the premier's office said. It was Prince Charles who asked for the meeting, it said. The premier's office provided a photo that shows the two seated at a table at the museum with Legault's wife, Isabelle Brais. The heir to the throne made a speech at COP26 , as the Queen was recovering from a health issue. Earlier this week, Legault briefly met with former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and presidential adviser Gina McCarthy.

Disclosure information is available on the original site.

A couple of weeks after the summit and the adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact, it\' s time to look back at the event, both on paper and on the ground. We are researchers in environmental law and governance from the University of Ottawa and the University of Cambridge. Three of us were on site in Glasgow and had the privilege of observing COP26 first-hand for the Centre Qu\'e9b\'e9cois du droit de l'environnement (Qu\'e9bec Centre for Environmental Law). Access, inequalities and transparency COP26 had a strange flavour, having been organized in the middle of a pandemic. Preparations were marked by complexity and uncertainty, and access issues were omnipresent. Physical access to the site was a challenge from the start. The combination of health restrictions and security measures meant that there were long waiting times for many participants, sometimes up to several hours. First, there were incidents about accessibility standards. There was also criticism of the obstacles that delegates from developing countries faced in getting to the negotiation tables. Travel restrictions, visa problems, access to the COVID-19 vaccine and affordable lodging explained why several countries and citizens\' movements were absent, making this COP even more exclusive than past ones. The presence and role of Indigenous representatives also became points of contention in public debates during the event. In addition to access issues, there were ones of transparency, since obtaining accreditation did not guarantee access to critical discussions. For example, Canadian observers were not allowed to attend Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\' s press conference. Discussions about Article 6 of the Paris Agreement also provoked debates about the inclusion of observers in the negotiations. Were the negotiations a success or a failure? Under the Glasgow Climate Pact, states did not adopt new commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They do now recognize  following recommendations by the IPCC  the importance of reducing global emissions 45 per cent by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, and of achieving carbon neutrality around 2050. However, there is still a huge gap between these targets and the commitments states have made to date. That could lead to an overall increase in emissions of 13.7 per cent compared to 2010 levels. The fact that only 112 states have updated their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) is also worrying. States that have not provided the required update this year are invited to do so as soon as possible before the next COP. While the fact that the 1.5 C degree temperature increase target remains  alive is a positive sign, concrete measures to achieve it are still lacking. 2. Unprecedented progress towards ending fossil fuel use One of the most important advances made at COP26 was the mention of fossil fuels and coal in the pact. Indeed, for the first time, the elephant in the room was included in the outcome of a COP. Parties are called upon to accelerate efforts to  phase down unabated coal power and to phase out  inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. It was about time, even if the wording of the text was weakened at the last minute. The strong presence of fossil fuel lobbies during the negotiations must be noted. COP26 was also an opportunity to launch or strengthen certain alliances between states. This was the case, for example, of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, co-founded by Canada, which aims to eliminate unabated coal power. It now has 165 members (national governments, regional governments and various organizations), including 28 that joined during COP26 . These agreements, which are concluded in parallel to the main negotiations, may allow states to take action on issues where there is still no international consensus. 3. Missed targets to support the South At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries pledged to financially assist developing countries in mitigating climate change by mobilizing a variety of financial sources amounting to US$100 billion per year by 2020. Unfortunately, this target was missed. Canada and Germany did show some leadership in mobilizing new funding to help vulnerable countries adapt. Indeed, Canada announced at the G7 Summit in June that it was doubling its climate finance to $5.3 billion over five years. Recognizing the failure of developed countries to stick to their financial commitments, the Glasgow Climate Pact urges them to reach the US$100 billion yearly target as soon as possible, pending the adoption of a new and much more ambitious target in 2025. At the same time, developed countries are urged to at least double their contributions to climate change adaptation in developing countries. During the climate finance negotiations, developing countries and island states called for the establishment of a mechanism to finance the loss and damage resulting from climate change. The Glasgow Climate Pact does not satisfy this demand. It only calls for  dialogue on the issue and mentions the allocation of funding, as yet unknown, to the Santiago Network. COP26 therefore marks broken promises on climate finance, and did not bring new and specific targets to help vulnerable countries, developing and island countries in particular, cope with the climate emergency although their needs are growing exponentially. 4. Emissions-trading rules finally adopted, but weak One of the key objectives of COP26 was to develop the rules for emissions trading based on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows countries and companies to buy credits generated by others and to subtract these from their own emissions inventories. Parties were unable to adopt the necessary rules at COP24 in Katowice or at COP25 in Madrid. Their adoption in Glasgow can therefore be considered a success. One can be more critical of the Glasgow outcome in terms of the impacts that some emissions-trading projects may have on local communities. Since COP21, several proposals have been made on this issue, including the possibility of creating a human rights-based appeal against the certification of projects aimed at removing emissions. Indeed, as shown by cases in Chile and Panama, many credits allowed under the Kyoto Protocol are associated with rights violations. An appeal mechanism was adopted in Glasgow, but it is fragile. With non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International sounding the alarm, the purchase of carbon credits by governments, companies and individuals in Canada is far from a straightforward option for achieving net-zero emissions. Already looking ahead to the next COP According to the COP26 presidency, while  Paris promised, Glasgow must deliver. It is clear that Glasgow did not deliver on everything. COP26 did see some progress and new announcements, but the national commitments  in addition to having to pass the implementation test  fall far short of what science requires. The 1.5 C degree target is still alive, but one wonders how long it will survive. Various estimates produced before and during the negotiations to take new commitments into account predict a temperature rise of 1.8 C to 2.7 C. Yet measures to meet these commitments are often missing. We are a long way from achieving the 1.5 C degree target, which would still have very serious consequences for our societies and an even greater impact on the most vulnerable countries, groups and individuals. ___ Thomas Burelli is a member of the University of Ottawa.

Justin Trudeau has never met a promise he didn't like - or one that he could keep. He met a couple more in Scotland at COP26 . (26! Good God, the world has been meeting on climate change since 1995 and we're still cooking the earth!) He promised - again - that he would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Since he first made that promise in 2015, they've risen. We are now, per capita, the most polluting people in the world. Even the U.S. has managed to bring down its emissions. Trudeau promised in the last election (and again in Scotland) that he would cut subsidies to oil and gas corporations. Getting Big Oil and Gas off the government payroll will be a good trick. We pay them some $2 billion a year in direct subsidies; $18 billion in publicly funded financial support; and another $63 billion if you count the cost to our health and environment. If you add in the cost of cleaning up the half million or so abandoned wells that litter the landscapes of Alberta and Saskatchewan, well, that's another $260 billion. He signed on to the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use, pledging to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. But timber companies are built into Canada's extractive economy. They supply the raw materials for houses, furniture and toilet paper that are sold in the marketplace. Like much that is agreed to at these COPs (Conferences of the Parties), the deforestation promise comes with no plan, no timetable, and no guarantee that the signatories won't let their logging companies back into the bush as soon as our backs are turned. Indonesia has already reneged on the Declaration. And who thinks that Jair Bolsonaro will halt his plan to axe the Amazon jungle? For that matter, what makes Trudeau think he can halt and reverse deforestation in a country where industrial logging clearcuts a million acres a year of intact (original) boreal forest. That's a figure that put us in the company of Russia and Brazil. Glasgow's COP is shaping up to be the 26th COP-out. COP26 .

SANDIE RINALDO: Well, the destruction of the climate brought out hundreds of thousands of protesters around the world today. A quarter of million in Glasgow alone where the UN climate change conference is underway for a second week. CTV's Heather Butts now on COP26 negotiations and the protestors demanding faster action on global warming. HEATHER BUTTS (Reporter): Glasgow, London, Sydney and Toronto, thousands of protestors demonstrating around the globe. (CROWD CHANTING) BUTTS: This global day of action for climate justice generated some of the largest protests to take place during the COP26 summit. ASAD REHMAN (War On Want NGO Director): It's trade unionists. It's people working around poverty. It's environmentalists and faith organizations, all united together in saying, we're in a moment of huge crisis. ERIEL DERANGER (Indigenous Climate Action): We spend a week inside these spaces in the hallways, negotiation rooms. It's really dry faces. And the marches are a place to come together with community to have our voices heard, to bring our messages out. BUTTS: Inside the conference, world leaders have already made promises to curb deforestation and cut methane emissions. Negotiations continued today and there could be further agreements by ministers next week. COP26 President): We have, overall, made progress. I think people have been constructive in the negotiating rooms. BUTTS: But there is concern there may be too much corporate interest. DERANGER: I feel like there are some good solutions being proposed, but there's also a lot of really heavy players that are proposing solutions that are looking to put the economy first, before people and the planet. BUTTS: An ocean away from Glasgow in Canada, some of the loudest voices calling for change are young people, like 15-year-old Mamy Sow. MAMY SOW (Young Minister of the Environment Sors De Ta Bulle): (Inaudible) something a lot of young people are having right now because you don't really what's going to happen. You don't know if everybody cares as much you do. BUTTS: And today, Canada's new environment minister, Steven Guilbeault announced 20 percent of a $5.3 billion international climate aid commitment will go towards nature based solutions, like restoring wetlands.

The global grassroots climate movement is rousing itself to hold world leaders accountable at the critical UN climate conference in Glasgow, now just days away, COP26 activists say. A multitude of civil society stakeholders and action groups  in the U.K. and around the world  are mobilizing to push for transformational change to tackle the global emergency, said Marco Tenconi, an organizer with the COP26 Coalition, one of the largest umbrella groups fighting for climate justice at the conference. The coalition has been organizing for 18 months with trade unions, NGOs, community campaigns, migrant and racial justice networks, direct action and faith groups, Indigenous peoples, and climate leaders to stage a  counter COP, featuring a Global Day of Action on Nov. 6 and the ensuing People\' s Summit, he said. Despite a healthy dose of skepticism about the U.K. government\' s commitment to inclusivity at COP26  It\' s like a sleeping giant has been woken after two years of the pandemic, he said.  We can\' t not be filled with real excitement and the adrenalin and hope you get from knowing the strength you have in numbers. "The thing about grassroots organizing is that against all odds, you just feel the power and strength of solidarity." However, there\' s also dismay that many fellow activists and climate leaders, particularly from the Global South, can\' t be at COP26 , Tenconi said.  There\' s also a huge sense of regret because we know if it wasn\' t for the incompetency of our governments, a lot more of our sisters and brothers would be with us. Aside from the logistical challenges typically associated with the ambitious scale of events being planned by the coalition  and in a pandemic  organizers have also assumed the responsibilities of the U.K. government in securing visas and accommodations for members of civil society, particularly those from red-listed countries in the Global South, he said. The U.K. government\' s utter failure to ensure some of the world\' s most important voices attend COP26 is no accident and benefits private and government interests, he said.  It\' s a pretence of incompetence, Tenconi said, adding there are instances where countries have waived visas in the past so people can attend international football matches, yet Indigenous leaders from the countries most affected by climate change can\' t attend a conference of global importance.  We have a host government that seems hell-bent on doing everything it can not to facilitate an inclusive and genuinely fair COP, he said,  much less whether it is going to facilitate transformational geopolitical change.  They haven\' t even dealt with the basic housekeeping, like making sure people can even arrive. But the obstacles won\' t deter the coalition from advancing the movement\' s primary objective.  How can we get justice at the centre of the agenda? That's really our main concern, Tenconi said. The coalition and its partners are focusing on three demands. The first is to dissemble false solutions, such as carbon capture and net-zero, he said.  For the past 30 years, the model has been to ask the perpetrators of the crime how we can stop them from repeat-offending, Tenconi said.  Which means that we end up with all these false solutions and all this dodgy accounting that allows them to continue to pollute while making it seem like they're not. The only real net-zero solution involves no more fossil fuel investments and holding the companies culpable for some many harms accountable, he added. The second focus is on a just transition for workers  in Scotland and worldwide. Oil and gas extraction is one of the largest and last industrial employers in Scotland, he said.  We want governments really prioritizing and shifting away from fossil fuel (interests) to focus on workers and their rights and their livelihoods first. What\' s more, the Global North is infamous for shuttering dirty, polluting industries at home and setting them up in southern countries where northern countries exploit labour with impunity, he said.  So, how will we build a just transition with all the workers in the world in mind? Thirdly, there\' s the need to ensure global climate justice, reparations, and redistribution to Indigenous communities and the Global South, Tenconi said. Global North countries  currently and historically responsible for the lion\' s share of emissions, and enriched at the expense of the Global South  continue to balk at paying for those countries\' climate adaptation, he said. Movement is already afoot at COP26 to water down or bypass discussion of redistribution or reparations to nations or communities that deserve them, he said.  We want to mainstream the idea that it's not enough for the Global North countries to just sort of do their bit, Tenconi said.  Fundamentally, in the most basic moral sense, they owe it to the Global South to help them with debt cancellation, with grants and technology transfers, and really, any means possible to accelerate their transitions. Although many activists are unable to attend COP26 in person, much of the coalition\' s Day of Action and People's Summit will be virtual, so people around the world can tune in, participate, and be inspired by climate heavy-hitters at the rally, such as activist Greta Thunberg, and U.S. congresswoman Ilhan Omar who will attend digitally, he said. Thousands upon thousands will be marching in downtown Glasgow on Nov. 6, Tenconi said.  We are going to be out there in huge numbers, he said, adding 18 different activist blocs are attending.  Many different communities and people are turning out in huge force. Demonstrations on the streets of Glasgow have already begun. The Glasgow Actions Team (GAT) staged an art installation on Thursday, symbolically setting Glasgow\' s iconic George Square  on fire as a welcome for world leaders arriving for the conference, and to remind them of their obligations at the upcoming climate negotiations Protesters unfurled a huge banner calling for the end of the climate emergency in tandem with mockups of enormous fire extinguishers, massive cardboard flames, dry ice, and smoke. The atmosphere couldn\' t be ignored, said GAT director Andrew Nazdin, adding the flames and smoke at the protest are a graphic reminder of the impending calamity the climate crisis holds.  Unless world leaders step up their ambition and deliver on the promise of the Paris climate agreement and take it further, we're going to see mass devastation around the world, Nazdin said.  And different people from across the movement are showing up in different ways, and art can be a powerful way to make sure those people's voices are heard. Much of the grassroots movement at COP26 will involve building solidarity and engaging in dialogue  but direct action is also definitely on the agenda, said Tenconi, who is uncharacteristically desk-bound following his involvement in an occupation of Shell oil rig moored for repairs in the city of Dundee\' s harbour last year.  I\' m usually involved in a direct action role, but I\' m on bail right now  rather than something more interesting, he said. The people of Glasgow, and Scotland as a whole, are renowned for their spirit and tenacity, and any real commitment from political leaders at COP26 will be the result of pressure by civil society, Tenconi said.  The emphasis for change never comes from them, but from the ground up and from grassroots holding their feet to the fire, he said.  There\' s going to be a heck of a lot of direct action and disruption and really powerful symbolic acts to grab the attention of those world leaders by people trying to change the narrative.

Canada is among 19 countries promising to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from some international shipping routes at the COP26 climate talks in Scotland Wednesday. Transport Minister Omar Alghabra also signed Canada on to a zero-emission car accord, an international aviation emissions promise and an agreement to make heavy trucks and buses emission-free in less than two decades. They are the latest in a long list of new climate promises Canada is making during the critical negotiations, from targeted funds for coral reefs and a promise to halt deforestation to ending international financing for fossil-fuel projects by the end of next year. Critics say almost all of them have a common theme: they're mostly talk and not a lot of actual work. Andrew Dumbrille, the lead specialist on marine shipping and conservation at World Wildlife Fund Canada, says a promise to help create at least six emissions-free shipping corridors within the next three years is a great start but Canada hasn't said anything about which port will be affected or how. Catherine Abreu, a member of Canada's net-zero advisory body and the executive director of Destination Zero, says COP26 has been heavy on big headline-grabbing announcements and light on detail for implementing the promises. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Osprey Media Group Inc.

Humans are storytellers. From fireside talks to television to TikTok, stories have always shaped how we understand the world and ourselves. Stories offer us connections to the past and glimpses of future potential. In our collective storytelling history, there are few stories that have had the tenacity of capitalism's consumption story. And if there is one reality that COP26 showed with blinding clarity, it is that in spite of the climate-change-fighting rhetoric, our global leaders are no match for the same old story. Our consumption story was born a couple of hundred years ago when the Industrial Revolution gave birth to mass production; products spilled off the assembly lines and stories framing the Earth as a collection of "natural resources" similarly began to flow. Stories - advertising and marketing - also began teaching us to be consumers. These new stories coexisted with an often brutal process of trying to destroy Indigenous people, their stories and rituals celebrating the Earth as interconnected, spiritual and alive. If the Earth was going to be reframed as a collection of raw materials awaiting production and consumption, other ways of knowing would have to end. These new stories also had to teach us why it was so vitally important to not just consume for our food, shelter and living healthfully but that we had to consume ever-greater quantities of stuff even when we had enough. Consumption of lots and lots of stuff, the stories told us, would bring us greater and greater happiness. Consumption was how to show love. Consumption was how to create jobs. It is the Industrial Revolution's frenzy of fossil fuel burning that set us on our current course of devastating climate change. Thankfully, 30 years after the declaration by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that anthropogenic activity was causing climate change, world leaders have almost without exception accepted this scientific reality. At COP26 one world leader after another spoke about the need to address climate change. However, while the leaders all told stories acknowledging the reality of climate change, the need to address carbon emissions and the necessity of limiting warming, capitalism's endless growth consumption story remained intact. Listen closely to the COP26 stories. The narratives include ending deforestation, stopping the burning of coal and ushering in the infrastructure for renewable energy, but exclude environmental implications for the economic framework of these changes. For example, of the over 22,000 newspaper stories about COP26 in the Nexis-Uni Major World Publication database, 287 - or .01 per cent - also mention capitalism. The number of articles that mention consumerism or materialism? 58. There is an absence from the tales we are telling that question our consumptive culture. Instead, the stories seem to have become the new kinds of consumption that will save us. Electric vehicles, for example, are the way of the future but details about the massive new Earth-based needs - such as mining the cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium for the new cars' batteries - are rarely in these stories. The good news is for most of human history our stories were not about the Earth as a collection of resources for our rabid consumption and as a place to dump the related waste. We can remind ourselves of what our ancestors knew of the Earth as a vibrant, spiritual and interconnected place. And we can tell stories to help us visualize what reducing our reckless consumption of stuff would look like. We can tell honest stories about economic models that are not built on growth. But if there was ever a time for our leaders - and media providers, educators, NGOS - to start telling those stories, it is right now.

In the fall of 2021, a Climate Change Conference was held by the United Nations. Almost every country in the world attended the COP which stands for "Conference of the Parties". These COPs have been held for nearly three decades. In 2021, the 26th-annual conference was held, therefore, it was named COP26 . These conferences are attended by world leaders, government representatives and businesses. At the COP21, every country agreed to limit global warming below two degrees with the aim to reach 1.5C in order to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement was formed at this particular conference in 2015. At the COP26 So, who did not receive and read the memo? Following the COP26 , the federal government declared that "our Earth is in danger" when Parliament reopened. Was this information not shared with Premier Ford and local governments? If the information was shared then why is the provincial government making changes which would impact the environment and work on ways to silence the taxpayers? The Ontario government is working at removing "red tape" in order to ease the burden on industry. When Premier Ford came into power the title for the Minister of Environment and Climate Change was changed to Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. The last independent environment commissioner, Dianne Saxe, who exposed the issues in regard to Porcupine Lake in 2018 had her voice silenced in 2019 and according to the last auditor general's report written by Bonnie Lysyk, Ontario is failing when it comes to climate change. If you read the COP26 document, certain phrases were used: ? "work together"; ? "move forward together"; ? "keep our promises"; ? "building collaboration in order to ensure a greater range of voices"; ? "embed science in the decision-making process"; ? "capacity for engagement and knowledge sharing"; ? "open and inclusive with a greater variety of voices heard and helping to shape outcomes"; and ? "empowerment focused on climate education, training, public awareness, public participation". These words are lacking at all Ontario government levels. Raw sewage containing pharmaceuticals, needles, used personal hygiene products, are entering our lakes and waterways, snow dumps are placed along shorelines which contain contaminants from ore rock being transported for milling and road salt. Trees are removed to make space for agriculture and mining and the list goes on. There is one common denominator in all of this and that is the disrespected taxpayer. It is the Ontario taxpayers who pay the salaries, benefits, pensions of government leaders and employees yet taxpayers do not have a right to say what they want to see for their future. Performance appraisal time is coming up in June. This is evident when you see money coming out of the coffers or empty promises being made in order to buy votes. Municipalities which are barely noticed are back on the map until the elections are over. It is certain that corporations, industry and businesses will all give government an "A" for excellence. Why would they not since "red tape" and "burdens" have been removed or money provided to them? The real question is what rating will the silenced taxpayers give when they are struggling to feed their children, pay their bills and save their environment so that life can go on. Bottom line - it doesn't matter which party or person is elected or re-elected since nothing will change until we can all learn to work together for the betterment of everyone not just those with money or a personal agenda or maybe even an ego. In order to have any healthy relationship, it is essential to have healthy communication and all levels of government need to take the above wording which was used and agreed upon by almost every country in the world and use them. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2022 Osprey Media Group Inc.

SANDIE RINALDO: Good evening. Disappointment tonight over a contentious compromise reached in Glasgow. Almost 200 countries have struck a deal on climate change, but after two weeks of negotiations, some are calling COP26 a copout. At issue, the wording on coal. Most of the nations wanted to promise to phase out the fossil fuel but in the end, the final agreement says they'll phase down instead. CTV's Todd Battis now with details of the deal that didn't calm climate change concerns. TODD BATTIS (Reporter): For the 26th time, delegates from the majority of the world's countries gathered to solve the climate emergency. For the 26th time, they left with a compromise. XAVIER MATSUTARO (Palau Delegation Member): I think we're better off having this agreement, bringing something home than going home empty-handed. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: By no means are we following what science tells us. BATTIS: A deal was upended when India demanded an amendment. Despite its city's often choking on smog, the country insisted it needs to burn coal. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels. BATTIS: A last minute rewording will allow the use of coal to be phased down, instead of phased out, drawing the ire of several countries. SIMONETTA SOMMAURAGA (Swiss Environment Minister): We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language that we had agreed on, on coal and fossil fuel (inaudible) has been further watered down. PATRICIA ESPINOSA ( COP26 Executive Secretary): Negotiations are never easy, and while we seek an outcome that is acceptable to all, few return home completely satisfied. BATTIS: Conference president, Alok Sharma, seized by emotion as he apologized for the abrupt change. ALOK SHARMA ( COP26 President): It's also vital that we protect this package. (APPLAUSE) BATTIS: Earlier, with the deal teetering on collapse, the European Union enjoy issued a plea, bordering on begging, for delegates to consider the fate of loved ones. FRAN TIMMERMANS (European Union Vice President): ...and how that person will live if we do not stick to the 1.5 degrees here today. BATTIS: What was widely seen as a last-ditch attempt to limit temperature rise, fund poor countries and end the use of fossil fuels, has come to an end. Now perhaps the real work begins as delegates return to their home countries, Canadian Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault among them tasked with selling a deal that many people argue falls short of real change, Sandie. RINALDO: Todd, thank you. \</doc>

The National Farmers Union (NFU) condemns the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) press release of November 9 calling "on COP 26 delegates to recognize the necessary role of the natural gas and oil Industry in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement." Glenn Wright, a member of the NFU's COP26 contingent in Glasgow and a farmer from Saskatchewan, responded saying that "It is both false and manipulative to suggest that the path to mitigate climate change is to increase oil and gas extraction. At a time when scientific consensus clearly shows that we must decarbonize our economies and accelerate the transition to clean energy, the statement from CAPP calling for increased oil and gas development is shameful." Climate change is predominantly caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Coal, oil, and natural gas are responsible for more than 75 percent of the additional manmade greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Expanding oil and gas production will not decarbonize our economy nor the economies of our trading partners. The International Energy Agency's research found that limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C requires significant cuts to all fossil fuel production, including both oil and gas. At COP26 Farmers and Indigenous People are seeing the effects of the climate crisis on our farms and lands and know the policy and science needed to address the climate crisis in agriculture. We understand that agriculture currently relies on inputs derived from fossil fuels like fertilizer and diesel fuel. But the consistent message coming from COP26 is that all sectors need to accelerate the transition to clean energy and make ambitious efforts to decarbonize now. We know that agriculture needs to be a part of the transformation to a clean energy future. Farmers are on the front lines of the climate crisis and need to take action alongside all sectors to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Agricultural practises can make large and positive contributions to easing the climate crisis. For more information on a climate friendly agricultural sector see the NFU report: Tackling the Farm Crisis and Climate Crisis. As reported by Global Witness, over 500 oil and gas lobbyists from Canada and around the world are attending COP26 . These oil and gas lobbyists and press releases such as the latest one from CAPP advance false solutions that actually preserve the status quo and thereby undermine the goal of decarbonization. Energy companies continue to focus investment on expanding fossil fuel development much more so than investing in clean energy. This needs to change. Energy companies have a role to play in decarbonization. That role is to expand clean, renewable energy, not oil and gas. The NFU calls on all governments to end fossil fuel subsidies and focus on clean energy to align public finance with their pledges to tackle the climate crisis. Furthermore, shifting subsidies to clean energy development would encourage energy companies to invest in the energy future necessary to tackle the climate crisis. Canada should consider becoming a signatory to the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and join the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance. The bottom line: Canada cannot be a climate leader while financing the expansion of fossil fuel projects. \</doc>

Jason Nixon MLA, Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre COP26 has ended in Glasgow with Canada making more empty pledges while the world's largest emitters continue to feed their energy needs and develop their economies. While some called Canada's empty pledges a victory, the reality is Canada's government foolishly capped the most ethical, environmentally friendly oil and gas in the world. And this point cannot be stressed enough: Canada did not provoke a single large-emitting economy to follow their empty pledges and rhetoric. In short, Canada's government failed at COP26 . Now, the federal government holds on to the belief that Canada has a social licence to propose things like tripling the carbon tax. Global leaders did not follow Canada on their empty pledges and they're right to be skeptical of their leadership. Socialists in Alberta were even burnt by the guy Trudeau appointed as his Environment Minister. After standing on stage endorsing Rachel Notley's climate plan exactly six years ago in 2015, Stephen Guilbeault stabbed Alberta's socialists in the back when he supported the National Energy Board's ruling that it would assess the downstream emissions of Energy East &#x26;#8211; a pipeline project that would've seen Canada clean up its own internal energy consumption. International investors and the world's largest emitters took notice. Canada needs to be focussing on investing in actual emission reductions and mitigation projects here at home. Instead, it finds itself foolishly throwing targets at the sky to dazzle the chattering classes to feed their appetite for buzzwords and self-flagellation. Alberta's government on the other hand stayed at home to make investment announcements that keeps our industry competitive, cuts emissions, and gets Albertan's back to work. By focussing on practical solutions and tangible emissions reduction results here at home, Alberta is protecting the environment while creating thousands of jobs in construction, trucking, electrical engineering, and more. That's why Alberta's government also invested over $100 million in industrial energy efficiency and carbon capture, utilization and storage projects across Alberta's oil and gas industry. As we maximize the value for Alberta's clean hydrocarbons with commercial scale funding, regulatory enhancements, and knowledge sharing &#x26;#8211; Alberta can export emissions reducing innovation technology throughout the world along with the clean, ethical hydrocarbons. That's actual progress. International investors are taking notice of Alberta's policies and carbon infrastructure too. Dow Chemical announced the world's first zero-emission ethylene derivatives complex will be built in Fort Saskatchewan, creating thousands more jobs. As that announcement was made, CEO, Jim Fitterling, said on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, "You have to have policies that support moving to low-carbon emissions and that's what we're doing up in Alberta." He's right. That's exactly what we're doing here in Alberta. We won't wait for Canada to dictate terms to us. Alberta will protect our industry and grow our resources. \</doc>

Climate change is one of the biggest public policy challenges confronting Canadian and international policy makers and was the topic of discussion at the COP26 Conference on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. World leaders, climate scientists and environmental activists converged on Scotland's biggest city to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. COP26 climate change conference for the Strathclyde Centre for Environmental Law and Governance (SCELG) and contributing to the COP26 delegation run by the British Columbia Council for International Cooperation. "I was in Glasgow at this time and so I was looking for a reason to stick around and stay for COP26 COP26 coordinator for the Strathclyde Centre for Environmental Law and governance." He wasn't enlisted out of the blue, Fawkes was already at ground zero when it came to the climate change conference. He is just completing a Master of Laws in Global Environmental Law and Governance from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, which is where the SCELG is based. Fawkes finished his dissertation in September and his supervisor is heavily involved in COP26 and acts as a government consultant. "He is world renowned for the work that he does in terms of climate legal affairs," Fawkes said. The SCELG was organizing a lot of events that are not in the "blue zone," the UN zone, but they were events that were going to be open to the public and COP26 delegates and were complementary to the COP26 negotiations. This would be UN representatives, civil servants, bureaucrats, NGO members and academics, as well as the public. "And so the university was organizing a lot of this, they needed a lot of help," Fawkes said. The other hat that he was wearing during the conference was as part of the B.C. Council for International Cooperation delegation. This is a predominantly youth group &#x26;#8211; youth in UN terms being anyone under 30 0r 35 &#x26;#8211; that would be meeting with ministers from the Canadian federal government and some provincial governments and presenting a policy brief. The goal is to push Canada towards rapid action on climate change, particularly a rapid phase out of fossil fuel subsidies. When asked how optimistic he is feeling about the world taking action on climate change, Fawkes said that he's more optimistic over the last year than previously, due in large part to the climate pledges that have been coming in. RELATED: COP26 "I think we're we're starting to see some momentum but the next five years are going to be really telltale," he said. "I find it very inspirational that there's a legal path that's been charted now towards some sort of rapid ambitious climate action." Building a career in international cooperation A graduate of Timberline Secondary School in 2012, Fawkes got involved with Rotary's Interact Club at the school and was active with them during his highschool career. Then he attended Quest University in Squamish and obtained his undergraduate degree with a focus on environmental sciences and maintained his connection with Rotary there, graduating in the spring of 2016. Then he worked and studied abroad for four years before starting the program at Strathclyde University in Glasgow in 2020. Right when the pandemic hit, of course. So, there was some uncertainty as to whether the program was going to go ahead. But it did and classes were done remotely, which was interesting, given the international nature of the student participants spread out between the west coast of Canada and India. Fawkes was living and working Victoria at the time. He managed to attend in the United Kingdom in August 2021, just before the UK rescinded travel restrictions for those arriving from Canada. Once he was accepted to Strathclyde University he applied for and received two generous scholarships from Rotary &#x26;#8211; a $15,000 Rotary District 5020 Ambassadorial Scholarship and a $15,000 Rotary International Global Grant Scholarship. Fawkes was sponsored by the Rotary Club of Campbell River Daybreak. "While the scholarship experience did not materialize how I had expected (due to the pandemic), this past year has left me with lifelong friends, a great support network and a new love for Scotland," Fawkes said. "On the professional side, the scholarship enabled me to engage in a world-renowned educational program and undertake a dissertation project that saw me connect with dozens of experts in my field." Fawkes will be moving to London now that the COP26 conference is over and will begin work as a crisis media manager in a maritime communications firm.

Many world leaders and activists expressed disappointment this weekend with the climate deal that emerged from two weeks of heated negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland -warning that countries will have to strengthen their commitments if they want to avert disastrous consequences and help at-risk nations cope with the damage that's already occurring from climate change. "We must end fossil fuel subsidies, phase out coal, put a price on carbon, protect vulnerable communities from the impacts of climate change and make good on $100 billion climate finance commitment to support developing countries," United Nations Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said in a video after the agreement won approval from nearly 200 nations. "We did not achieve these goals at this conference but we have some building blocks for progress." Echoing that message, European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen said in a statement that while some progress was made on the goals of COP26 , more work remains and the key to determining the impact of the conference will be how the commitments secured in Glasgow are implemented. She said, "1.5 degrees Celsius remains within reach; but the work is far from done." As part of the pact agreed upon in Glasgow, countries committed to reassessing their targets to cut emissions by the end of next year and to providing more aid to nations bearing the brunt of climate change. But these voluntary measures do not put the world on track to limit Earth's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, a central goal of the 2015 Paris accord. "We're all well aware that, collectively, our climate ambition and action to date have fallen short on the promises made in Paris," said Alok Sharma, the British minister of state and president of the Glasgow talks, who appeared emotional Saturday after delegates from China and India proposed a last-minute edit that weakened a provision in the text to phase out fossil fuels. The paragraph initially called for the "phaseout of unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies," but the final agreement refers only to a "phase-down." A key unresolved question is how much more rich nations will to do help vulnerable nations -particularly island nations who face the threat of extinction from rising sea levels -from the damage wrought by climate change. A video played at COP26 showed the foreign minister of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu giving a speech while standing knee-deep in seawater. "The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us," the environment minister of the Maldives Aminath Shauna said Saturday. The United States, which took on a position of leadership at COP26 after four years of near-absence in the global climate conversation under President Donald Trump, celebrated the Glasgow climate pact but called for more action. "The text sets out a path to increase the commitments and actions of countries starting next year, outlines new rules of the road for the Paris Agreement that will provide transparency for countries to turn words into actions, and doubles the amount of support that is going to vulnerable countries to enhance their resilience to the crisis," a statement from the White House read. "But it is not enough." "More work remains as we leave Glasgow to get where science tells us we need to be and the United States will continue to push for more progress at home and abroad in this decisive decade for climate action," the statement continued. Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, struck a more upbeat tone in his statement following the conclusion of COP26 . "We asked nations to come together for our planet at COP26 , and they have answered that call," Johnson said in a statement. "There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward. I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change," he said, "and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal." !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Times &; Transcript (Moncton) \</doc>

JOYCE NAPIER: And welcome back. Youth will inherit the Earth, but what kind of worth will it be? It's at the top of today's COP26 agenda. Today's theme is Youth Day at the global climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. And young people from around the world are at the COP26 to make their voices and the voice of their generation heard. So what are they fighting for? Let's find out. Joining me now are two Canadian youth who are in Glasgow. Eden Luymes is a 24-year-old student and researcher at the University of British Columbia. And Shalaka Jadhav is the designing community manager for Youth Climate Lab. Welcome to you both. Thanks for doing this, and it's really nice to see you. Eden, let me start with you. You have been at COP26 since last week, and will stay throughout the summit. Has your voice, do you think, and the voices of your, of your generation been heard at that summit? Do you feel that you have made an impact? EDEN LUYMES (University of British Columbia Student & Researcher): I mean, it's a difficult question to answer. In short, no. I believe that we are making impacts in the small ways that we can. For example, we've been able to meet, my delegation, at least, has been privileged enough to be able to meet with different members of government and specific ministers to push for our points and our agenda. But, you know, even if we are in those spaces and are privileged enough to have those meetings and those audiences, are our, you know, demands being met? And are our opinions being validated? No. That's not what we're, we're seeing here. And that, this is all in the context of the youth that are given badges and allowed to even represent their interests at this conference which, you know, not all youth are represented here, in particular, the under representation of Indigenous youth and their interests at this, at this conference. NAPIER: Well, that, that's interesting. Shalaka, let me ask you this. Climate activist Greta Thunberg said today, it is no secret, and I'm quoting, that COP26 is a failure. She says she hears a lot of, quote, blah, blah, blah from leaders. So have you heard from our leaders directly? You know, you, have you met with them, with the prime minister? You know, it is important for your voices to be heard. You are the present and you are the future. Do you feel that you, you're doing something there that is meaningful? SHALAKA JADHAV (Youth Climate Lab): Hmm. Yeah, that's a great question. Frankly, no. I have to echo Eden's sentiments here, you know. I would really describe, as a young person, being at COP26 is being in a state of dissonance. You know, it's, it's a lot of big and small feelings all at the same time. And there's a lot of global power and wealth present but, you know, on day four, yesterday, it really set in, the recognition of the failings of this power. You know, it's measured by capital and markets, but this power is, you know, quote-unquote, is really lacking the spirit and strength that's needed to move through a climate emergency. You know, there is no space made for healing, justice and one in accountability. You know, there's very few spaces for people to meet organically, you know. There's very little seating. As someone who suffers from a lot of chronic body pain, you know, it's been a pretty inaccessible COP26 experience. And that's, it's not a good sign, frankly, the method in which we do policy making and their message that we need to co-create these solutions together, across generations, are frankly just missing and it's, it's pretty unfortunate, yeah. LUYMES: I would add to... NAPIER: Well, what I'm hearing from you two, go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead, Eden. LUYMES: Well, I would just add, too, that even having audiences with these members of government and ministers and people who are sitting at the decision-making table, we have to fight for those conversations, as well. We are waiting outside of press conferences to speak to Justin Trudeau, and he leaves through a different exit. We're removed from security, from the hallway outside of a press conference, not even, you know, in that room. We are, you know, after events and plenaries, going up and informally having to network and advocate for ourselves and schedule these meetings. And obviously it's different with different politicians and different representatives have responded to our requests in different capacities and manners, but it definitely has been a struggle to even have that small seat at the table. And it can, this is in the context of we are already privileged enough to have badges. What about the youth standing behind the line of security in the streets? They're not, they're even further removed. And then on top of that, at this COP, as well, because of the added layer of COVID restrictions, we have not been able to be in as many negotiating rooms as we would like to be. And the first two days, because it was the world leaders' summit, observers were not allowed in any of the negotiations, which is... NAPIER: Yeah... (OVERLAPPING SPEAKERS) NAPIER: Yeah, I know. You've, I've been to a few of these huge summits and meetings. I understand, but Shalaka, let me ask you this, if you were to meet with Canada's environment minister, or the natural resources minister, the prime minister, and you had a few minutes, what would you tell them, what would the message of Canada's youth be to them? JADHAV: My message would really just be around recognizing how interconnected our, our issues are, you know. As young people, we are recognizing that climate justice is health justice is land justice is racial justice, and we're so deeply enmeshed within one another. Yet you come to a conference like COP26 , and it's so frustrating that climate and conversations about land are so, so disconnected. You know, climate doesn't recognize borders and boundaries, you know, rivers don't just stop or shift in terms of, in the question of boundaries. And so my message for leadership would be that we need to start and ground these questions about our progress and our ambition in our positionality, you know, and take up that framing as climate leaders, we have the capacity to do this work, we have the capacity to lead with joy and hopefulness and not only can Canada, you know, be more ambitious on the global scale, excuse me, but this climate ambition also needs to really be reflected on the ground. It can't be co-existing as an international level conference like this, while on the ground, there's colonial violence, you know, against Indigenous people continuing. We've had so many different, you know... NAPIER: Yeah. JADHAV: ...clashes this past year, and it's incredibly frustrating when there's this sort of inconsistency not only with financing on the ground when pipelines and fracking are funded, you know, we need a just transition. We need a skills policy and finance shift, both as a process and where we need to go. And, you know, imagine this work doesn't just happen in one single-mind's person, like, one person's mind. This work needs to happen together. NAPIER: Yeah. JADHAV: And if we're going to leave youth behind, our governments are failing us very, very severely. NAPIER: Well, I hope they hear what you both have to say, Eden Luymes and Shalaka Jadhav. Thanks for taking the time. Good luck in Glasgow at the COP26 , and make your voices heard. They're important. LUYMES: Thank you so much. JADHAV: Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks so much. NAPIER: Bye-bye to both of you. Coming up, will the civil liberties caucus challenge O'Toole's leadership? We bring in our Friday panel of strategists to dig in next. Stay with "Power Play". (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \</doc>

It takes a lot of chutzpah to claim success for a climate conference whose own president had to fight back tears as he confessed he was "deeply sorry" for the way it turned out. Yet in the wake of the much-ballyhooed COP26 summit, the world's climate-crats are fanning out across the globe, urging us all to see the glass they poured in Glasgow as at the very least half-full. We understand the temptation to look for the silver lining in the cloud that is COP26 . After all, it's the way the world's governments have agreed on to try and find a way to keep the planet from reaching catastrophic levels of heating. If that process collapses, what's left? So the primary victory claimed for the Glasgow conference is that it avoided that result. The worst outcome would have been no agreement at all, so the very fact that the 197 nations managed to sign on to something called the "Glasgow Climate Pact" must be regarded as success. But if that's success, then God help us. Before COP26 opened on Oct. 31, senior figures like the U.S. climate envoy, John Kerry, were talking it up as the "last, best hope for the world to get its act together" and head off global warming above 1.5 degrees C by the end of the century. Now that the meeting is over, the best they can claim is that it didn't actually fall apart. Others with less invested in the COP process can see the truth more clearly, or at least are in a position to say it out loud. Take, for example, Mary Robinson, a former UN commissioner for human rights and chair of The Elders group of former leaders, who says: " COP26 has made some progress, but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster ... Not enough leaders came to Glasgow with a crisis mindset. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty." The most striking failure came at the very end of the conference. India suddenly insisted that a pledge in the conference's final agreement about "phasing out" coal be softened to "phasing down." Burning coal is the single greatest contributor to the greenhouse gases that result in global warming, and the pressure from India (backed by China) to render the pledge essentially toothless was indicative of the lack of resolution shown by some key countries. The conference also fell short of meeting a longtime demand from the most vulnerable countries for $100 billion a year in financing for "loss and damage" caused by global warming. Of course, there were successes, eagerly grasped by "glass-half-full" proponents. There was progress on finance for climate adaptation. The timetable for countries to produce more ambitious plans to reach net-zero emissions was advanced. And there was a series of agreements among some countries on such issues as ending deforestation and stemming methane emissions. Those could have real, positive effects. And it's true the COP process overall is making measurable progress. Before the landmark Paris accords in 2015, the organization Climate Action Tracker estimated the world was on course to a disastrous 4 degrees C rise in average temperature. Actions to limit greenhouse gases have already reduced that to 3 degrees, and a new report says that would be cut further to between 2 and 2.4 degrees if governments actually carry through with commitments they have made. That's far above the global goal of 1.5 degrees; it would be, in other words, only highly damaging rather than catastrophic. And it shows it is possible to make a difference if governments take strong, effective action. \</doc>

There wasn't much progress in phasing out fossil fuels at the recent UN COP26 climate summit, but the conference was surprisingly successful in supporting lower CO2 emissions for the steel industry, the source of seven per cent of the world's carbon pollution. The Glasgow conference produced several unexpected steel announcements, including deals on public procurement of green steel, trade in low-CO2 steel and financing the carbon transition of steel and other high-CO2 sectors. The agreements come as good news for the thousands of steel workers at ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AMD) and related companies in Hamilton who are hoping a recent AMD announcement to cut greenhouse gas emissions can preserve their jobs well into the future. It's a huge and urgent challenge for Hamilton where steel is among an economic mainstay. In one key COP26 Catherine Cobden, CEO of the Canadian Steel Producers Association (CSPA), cautiously welcomed the announcement. "We are eager for a new vision of putting public procurement to work for climate change because we have a strong need now, but also an obligation to future generations," she said. Governments around the world are pumping money into infrastructure projects to kick-start their pandemic-hit economies, planning large expenditures for buildings, bridges, ports, flood protection and public transit - all big users of steel. The aim is to ensure that only bidders with low-CO2 steel can win contracts for these large projects. This would encourage companies to switch from high-CO2 blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace production to lower-emitting electric arc furnaces and direct reduced iron furnaces burning natural gas or hydrogen. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signalled the importance of this policy for the steel industry when he appointed Hamilton-area MP Filomena Tassi to minister of public services and procurement. Tassi, a strong steel-sector advocate, is expected to play a key role implementing the green procurement initiative. In another unexpected COP26 deal, the European Union and the United States ended steel and aluminum tariffs between the two regions and pledged to create the world's first "carbon-based" sectoral trade agreement to encourage trade in low-CO2 steel and barriers to high-emission steel. The CSPA is urging Canada to join the talks. "We believe that it is imperative for Canada to work with the US and EU to combat the global climate challenge, to address global steel overcapacity, and to ensure fair steel trade practices," Cobden said in an email. One of the largest COP26 announcements came from the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a financial industry network representing $130 trillion in assets. GFANZ signatories pledged to reduce financed emissions for their bank and investment portfolios to net zero by 2050 and to announce 2030 interim reductions in the next few years. One of the chief priorities of alliance members will be to use capital to guide the transition to net-zero, said Mark Carney, former head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England who championed the agreement. Loans and investments from GFANZ will "go where the emissions are - in sectors such as autos, steel, cement - and back those companies with plans to decarbonize, while withdrawing capital from those companies that aren't moving fast enough," said Carney. Steel is part of the fabric of modern life and is expected to become even more important as the world transitions to electric vehicles and net-zero buildings, energy projects and infrastructure. Governments and businesses are adapting their policies and markets to meet this demand, but without the climate-destroying carbon emissions of the past.

Coming out of COP26 , the issue of phasing out coal-fired generation has emerged front and centre as a key element in the global fight to tackle climate change. A clean electricity system is a foundational element to clean air. Electricity not only powers our homes, businesses, schools and hospitals, but it is essential to enable cleaner transportation, a high standard of living and a robust economy. If we are ever going to phase out coal globally, we have to do so using proven, reliable solutions. So how did one of the only jurisdictions in the world to successfully phase out coal actually achieve this? What was missing from the coverage of COP26 was how Ontario phased-out coal using reliable nuclear power. This achievement in Ontario represents one of the most significant emissions reduction achievements globally. Twenty years ago, coal generated more than a quarter of our electricity in the province and today it's zero. That has not only reduced emissions but has reduced smog days and established a clean electricity system we can now leverage to make progress in other areas like transportation. The renewal of our nuclear fleet, dominated by the return to service and optimization of the Bruce Power units, accounted for approximately 90 per cent of the energy needed to phase out coal - 70 per cent from the Bruce site. By leveraging our nuclear fleet in Ontario, which produces 60 per cent of our electricity, the elimination of coal, while not impacting reliability, was achieved. It's a clean source of electricity which is also reliable and stable from both an output and cost perspective over the long term. In Ontario, it's a source of innovation, tens of thousands of jobs and also the source of life-saving medical isotopes. For that reason, as demonstrated through independent polling, 80 per cent of residents in the province support the ongoing work to extend and optimize our existing nuclear fleet. This is in stark contrast to a country such as Germany that has reduced nuclear power and consequently both coal use and electricity prices have dramatically increased. Combine that with a continued instability in both reliability and pricing and you end up with a country that will be challenged both environmentally and economically for years to come. If we are serious about fighting climate change and phasing out coal, we need to be serious about nuclear power. James Scongack is the chief development officer and executive vice-president, Operational Services at Bruce Power. \</doc>

COP26 has ended in Glasgow with Canada making more empty pledges while the world\' s largest emitters continue to feed their energy needs and develop their economies. While some called Canada\' s empty pledges a victory, the reality is Canada\' s government foolishly capped the most ethical, environmentally friendly oil and gas in the world. And this point cannot be stressed enough:Canada did not provoke a single large-emitting economy to follow their empty pledges and rhetoric. In short, Canada\' s government failed at COP26 . Now, the federal government holds on to the belief that Canada has a social licence to propose things like tripling the carbon tax. Global leaders did not follow Canada on their empty pledges and they\' re right to be skeptical of their leadership. Socialists in Alberta were even burnt by the guy Trudeau appointed as his Environment Minister. After standing on stage endorsing Rachel Notley\' s climate plan exactly six years ago in 2015, Stephen Guilbeault stabbed Alberta\' s socialists in the back when he supported the National Energy Board\' s ruling that it would assess the downstream emissions of Energy East \- a pipeline project that would\' ve seen Canada clean up its own internal energy consumption. International investors and the world\' s largest emitters took notice. Canada needs to be focussing on investing in actual emission reductions and mitigation projects here at home. Instead, it finds itself foolishly throwing targets at the sky to dazzle the chattering classes to feed their appetite for buzzwords and self-flagellation. Alberta\' s government on the other hand stayed at home to make investment announcements that keeps our industry competitive, cuts emissions, and gets Albertan\' s back to work. By focussing on practical solutions and tangible emissions reduction results here at home, Alberta is protecting the environment while creating thousands of jobs in construction, trucking, electrical engineering, and more. That\' s why Alberta\' s government also invested over $100 million in industrial energy efficiency and carbon capture, utilization and storage projects across Alberta\' s oil and gas industry. As we maximize the value for Alberta\' s clean hydrocarbons with commercial scale funding, regulatory enhancements, and knowledge sharing \- Alberta can export emissions reducing innovation technology throughout the world along with the clean, ethical hydrocarbons. That\' s actual progress. International investors are taking notice of Alberta\' s policies and carbon infrastructure too. Dow Chemical announced the world\' s first zero-emission ethylene derivatives complex will be built in Fort Saskatchewan, creating thousands more jobs. As that announcement was made, CEO, Jim Fitterling, said on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange,  You have to have policies that support moving to low-carbon emissions and that\' s what we\' re doing up in Alberta. He\' s right. That\' s exactly what we\' re doing here in Alberta. And we want to re-assure our international partners and investors \- Alberta will do everything in its power to provide certainty to our largest industry, tangible results with industry and the talented workforce that supports innovation here in Alberta. We won\' t wait for Canada to dictate terms to us. Alberta will protect our industry and grow our resources. MLA, Rimbey-Rocky-Sundre \</doc>

Environment Minister Nils Clarke said the territorial government didn\' t send a delegation to the international COP26 climate conference due to active sitting and COVID-19. Clarke rose in the legislature on Nov. 26 to give a ministerial statement acknowledging the conference and noting the Yukon\' s own climate targets.  We certainly hope to have a presence at future COPs. The challenge for elected officials and their ministries is that it\' s set during this sitting, so I personally wasn\' t able to attend, he said.  I inquired of my officials as to why others didn\' t go and it was generally COVID-19 related. Clarke said the decision to send people to the conference  is complicated, since it means burning air-fuel on international travel, but he said in-person meetings are important and lead to major agreements. The government of the Northwest Territories sent both its Environment Minister and a second MLA to Scotland for the conference. Clarke said he has a meeting scheduled with federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault to discuss the outcomes of COP26 . The government\' s plan to reduce emissions is called Our Clean Future and includes a long-term plan to build up renewable energy infrastructure. The government has also committed  as part of the CASA agreement signed by the NDP and the Liberals  to reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels in the territory. The plans to reach that target are being developed by the newly-formed Yukon Climate Leadership Council. Clarke said the goal is  in close alignment with the critically important 1.5-degree warming limit. \</doc>

Manitoba M\'e9tis Federation Minister of Housing, Will Goodon, is representing the Red River M\'e9tis at the COP26 Climate Summit in Scotland and attending the event as a member of the Indigenous Circle of Experts. The Manitoba M\'e9tis Federation (MMF) is attending to ensure Red River M\'e9tis have a voice at the global table when it comes to climate change.  It\' s extremely, vitally important that all the stories that we hear from our hunters, from our trackers, from our fishers, that they are reflected at an event like this, Goodon said. There are several goals the MMF is looking to accomplish during the summit, he said, including the need to ensure nation members linked to traditional economies like hunting, trapping and fishing or work in resource sectors and rural sectors, are protected against the effects of climate change. Climate change directly impacts these sectors and the MMF is hoping to ensure the people impacted by wildfire or floods can feed their families sustainably, he said. A major factor in this initiative is to ensure the M\'e9tis Nation has a voice and part in saving the planet. COP26 is a two-week summit running from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, which brings together leaders from across the globe to commit to tackling environmental issues and slowing down the effects of climate change. A large focus of the 2021 COP26 is to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow down the rise of the average global temperature. Goodon attended the COP23, 24 and 25 summits in the past. The impacts of climate change have been visible for decades, Goodon said, and over the last couple of years, these issues have only become more visible. These effects are felt by Indigenous people, especially those who live in northern regions.  There are such pronounced changes, Goodon said.  The ice is not as thick. The ice is affecting all of the ecosystems from bears, to seals, to fish, marine life, wildlife and they see it every single day where the tundra is melting. The effects of climate change are also being felt in M\'e9tis communities, he added. For example, commercial fishermen have seen changes in the water, largely driven by the changing climate. These impacts can also be seen in extreme weather leading to natural disasters including wildfires, flooding and dire droughts. It will take united action across the world to address the growing effects of climate change. If no action is taken, Goodon said, the world will be uninhabitable for future generations.  It is an existential problem, Goodon said. He praised Canada for welcoming the MMF into its delegations and serving as advocates on behalf of Indigenous issues. There have been many people who have diligently worked to ensure Indigenous voices are heard at an event like COP26 , he said. Their voices must be included because Indigenous people on every continent are often the first to feel the acute effects of climate change.  They\' re always the most marginalized people and they\' re feeling climate change the most. To have a voice here is really important, Goodon said. He added that climate change is an issue that greatly affects youth across the globe.  They know that if the planet goes sideways they\' re the ones that are going to suffer, it\' s not going to be us, Goodon said.  It\' s about making sure those resources are there in the future  we have a responsibility to make sure the resources are there for future generations. That\' s what this is about. \'bb HYPERLINK mailto:ckemp@brandonsun.com ckemp@brandonsun.com \'bb Twitter: @The_ChelseaKemp \</doc>

OMAR SACHEDINA: Countries at the global climate talks in Scotland did not approve a deal on what was supposed to be the final day of the conference. And now, at the 11th hour, those critical negotiations have been extended. CTV's Vanessa Lee on who is facing the heat. VANESSA LEE (Reporter): A thick haze of toxic smog choking India's capital is getting worse, making it difficult to breathe. The air is so dangerous, authorities may be forced to implement emergency measures that include shutting down schools, highlighting a climate emergency activists say world leaders are not taking seriously. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Why are we talking about five to 10 years as if the climate crisis isn't here today?! LEE: They say language in the draft agreement is not urgent or drastic enough. Coming up with a consensus nearly 200 countries are comfortable signing is proving to be arduous, with talks going into overtime. Sticking points include phasing out coal, and compensating poor countries for the effects of climate anchge. Canada's environment minister says he is pushing for a deal, with actions strong enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. STEVEN GUILBEAULT (Environment Minister): We need to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, and we would agree that there should be, that a timeline should be put in there. Now obviously not all parties, part of these negotiations necessarily agree with that. LEE: While the US and China, the world's top two greenhouse gas emitting countries, have agreed to cooperate in a surprising summit deal seen as a step towards success, environmentalists say overall COP26 has failed the planet. SABAA KHAN (David Suzuki Foundation): We've seen Indigenous voices, youth voices, island nations talking about the urgency and the risks of, that humanity will face, and this mass movement is not being reflected in the decisions that we're seeing.

Two environmental activists from Nelson, Linn Murray and Jamie Hunter, attended the U.N.'s climate change conference COP26 this month and came away energized for more climate action. "It has definitely reinforced a preconceived notion that I had," Murray, 22, told the Nelson Star, "that climate leadership is mostly coming from the bottom up right now. Municipalities and local groups are really doing the most on climate action. And we're starting to see that trickle up into government policy, but it's still not there yet." He and Hunter, 21, both commented on the number and the enthusiasm of various civic groups at COP26 An estimated 30,000 people visited Glasgow for the conference. "It's the collective humanity of it," Murray says, "where there's so many people from so many communities all over the world. I can't help but have faith that even though we're not where we need to be, we are heading in that direction, and hopefully we're headed there fast enough. I'm more hopeful right now than I was going into it."Hundreds of events The COP26 Last summer the U.N. described latest scientific finding about climate change as a "code red for humanity," and asserted that the conference would have to find a way to keep the increase in warming under 1.5 degrees to avoid global catastrophe. Hunter and Murray went to the conference representing Stop Ecocide Canada, which Hunter founded as part of a larger international movement that wants the destruction of natural ecosystems criminalized. They were not among the members of public groups that were invited into the main forum as observers. Outside the forum, in various locations around the city, there were hundreds of events connected to COP26 "They had this space booked the whole time," Hunter said. "It's called The Ferry and it was an old boat, turned into an event space, and they invited young people to come and use it as a space to be in. They had speakers and events going on throughout the whole two weeks."Marches and new friends They joined two marches, one on a Friday with about 10,000 people and another on the following day with 100,000 or more. "We just stood and watched the march continue, more and more people continued to arrive for four hours or so. It was a mind-boggling amount of people," said Murray, adding that a significant number of them were not travellers but people from Glasgow. Murray and Hunter think the demonstrations and the sheer size of community representation from around the world will be impossible for governments to ignore, but some of them will act on it more than others. They said one of their most profound experiences was meeting young people from around the world, including a discussion with people from Namibia, Chile, and the Amazon about how climate change was affecting their parts of the world.Exclusivity and inequality Despite those positive experiences, both men were concerned about what they called the exclusivity of the COP conference. Fossil fuel companies had the most delegates at the conference, they said, and in the rooms where negotiations happened business and industry had the largest representation with access to negotiators and world leaders. They said Canada, Russia, and Saudi Arabia had fossil fuel industry interests as part of their national delegations. Many poorer countries could only afford to send a few people or none at all, they said, particularly the low-lying island countries that are now being flooded by sea-level rise. "Only four Pacific Island states were officially represented," said Hunter. "And there's about 13 of them. These are the countries which are really, really going to suffer the most from climate change. So the fact they weren't included those just doesn't make any sense." Hunter and Murray said they were disappointed that funding from the rich to the poor countries to adapt to the effects of climate change came up short.Better than expected, but not enough Did the conference meet its goal of finding ways to reduce greenhouse gases to keep warming under 1.5 degrees? "It's certainly not enough," Hunter said. "But considering the way that delegates were talking before the deal was agreed, it does seem like this deal is more than was expected." He said the specific inclusion of the fossil fuels and coal in the agreement is a step forward. Those words did not appear in previous agreements. They also cited the mention, for the first time, of the need to stop subsidies to fossil fuel companies. Countries were supposed to come to the conference with emissions reduction targets that would keep warming to 1.5 C. "Most countries failed on that." Hunter said. "Canada certainly failed on that." The positive side, they said, was a decision to have another meeting next year to which countries would bring more strict targets and methods for achieving them, because the pledges and plans presented so far would not meet the 1.5 C threshold. Murray said he noticed a disconnect between climate action by national leaders and industry, and by local communities around the world. "I spoke to many people who were working on projects at home and really showing leadership where, unfortunately, our higher levels of government aren't. They aren't there yet." Despite their criticism of national governments and big industry, Hunter and Murray spoke positively. "We are headed in the right direction," said Murray. "And certainly civil society is headed in the right direction, around the world, and I would like people to understand that. We are accelerating this quite substantially from where we were a few years ago. And I think that's working. Or I hope so at least."

GLASGOW, SCOTLAND Greta Thunberg may not have been officially invited to the landmark COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, but on the first day of the conference, she was making her presence known. The Swedish teenager, who is something of a rock star for climate activists around the world, is among the thousands of activists descending on Glasgow for the U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP26 , which kicked off Sunday. They are calling on world leaders to take bold action to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 Celsius above preindustrial levels. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, in an interview aired on Sunday, Thunberg said the 1.5C goal was "possible in theory" but "it's up to us if we want that to happen." Thunberg arrived in Glasgow Saturday night and was quickly surrounded by about a hundred people at a Glasgow train station. Several police officers escorted her away from the throng. "Finally in Glasgow for the COP26 ! And thank you for the very warm welcome," tweeted the 18-year-old, who included a picture of her giving a thumbs-up to the assembled crowd. Scotland's Sunday Mail newspaper dubbed the scene: "Greta Mania." In the BBC interview, Thunberg said sometimes anger was the right response as part of environmental demonstrations. She was asked about the protest tactics of campaigners in the U.K. who in recent weeks have been blocking roads. "To make clear, as long as no one gets hurt ... then I think sometimes you need to anger some people," she said. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton) \</doc>

LONDON - British heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles will speak at the opening ceremony of the COP26 United Nations climate summit on Monday to welcome world leaders, his office said, a day after Queen Elizabeth pulled out on doctors' advice. The 95-year-old queen is a draw for other world leaders so her withdrawal is a blow to the event in Glasgow. Charles, 72, who will be with his wife Camilla, is to deliver opening remarks as he did at COP21 in Paris in 2015. The queen, who was recently overheard saying she was irritated by world leaders who talked about climate change but did nothing to tackle it, had been due to attend an evening reception on Monday at the conference. Charles has spent most of his life campaigning on environmental issues and earlier this month said he shared the concerns of Greta Thunberg and other activists that politicians were all talk and not enough action. He will also be joined at COP26 by his eldest son Prince William and his wife Kate, who have followed in the family footsteps by speaking out about green issues. However, the queen herself, the world's oldest and longest-reigning monarch, will continue to rest at her Windsor Castle home having stayed overnight in hospital last week for an unspecified but not COVID-19-related ailment. She carried out her first official engagement since being in hospital on Tuesday, holding two virtual audiences to welcome new ambassadors to Britain from South Korea and Switzerland. Britain has cast COP26 , which begins on Oct. 31, as the last big chance to slow rising temperatures, and it hopes to persuade leaders to adopt tougher climate targets. \</doc>

LONDON - China attaches great importance to tackling climate change but an announcement has yet to be made on whether or not President Xi Jinping will attend the COP26 summit, China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, said on Tuesday. Asked by Reuters if Xi would attend the COP26 conference in person, or by video call or not at all, Xie said: "We still need to wait for the information (from the) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and only after they make an announcement will we tell you." Britain's Queen Elizabeth said last week she was irritated by world leaders who talk about climate change but do nothing to address global warming, and added it was still unclear who would turn up at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as host of the summit, has cast the meeting as one of the last major chances to cool down the planet, and had hoped it would showcase his attempt at global leadership. Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison will attend the summit. The Kremlin has not yet said whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend. Xi, China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, has not left the People's Republic since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, though he has joined video calls with global leaders. Xie, speaking through a translator via video link, said that the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow was deeply significant and that the People's Republic was working for the success of the conference. Xie said China wanted to work with the international community to slow climate change and that the world's second largest economy would do its best to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Developed countries, Xie said, should honor their promises. Zhao Yingmin, the vice-minister of ecology and environment, said leaders at COP26 should avoid "empty slogans" and that Beijing hoped to see progress on climate issues for developing countries.

(ANNews) - First Nations perspectives need to be front-and-centre in any response to the climate crisis, Indigenous delegates to the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow say. "I think people at a global stage need to hear that we, regardless of who's making policy or what's going on, Indigenous folks, knowledge keepers, elders are still caring for this land and we can only benefit from that," Indigenous Climate Action (ICA) researcher and policy analyst Rebecca Sinclair told the CBC at the conference\' s outset. James Harper, who is Nehiyaw from Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation in Alberta, is attending COP26 with Indigenous Clean Energy, a non-profit that aims to involve Indigenous people in renewable energy projects as a form of  community empowerment. "We'll be talking about how government policies, financial policies and so forth can help enable remote energy microgrids to come to fruition," Harper told the CBC. "The key stress on access to funding, among other things, like capacity building and, you know, making sure that there's an updated framework in place for that duty to consult." Winnipeg-based Sinclair, a Cree woman from Barren Lands First Nation in Manitoba, has spent the past two weeks attending actions, webinars and discussions at COP26 , alongside several of her ICA colleagues. "[We'll be] trying to influence as much policy as we can to uplift Indigenous voices and sovereignty and our rights," said Sinclair, who adds that Indigenous voices have been  excluded from the conservation. The Glasgow conference has given ICA delegates the opportunity to connect with other Indigenous climate leaders from across North America and learn their perspectives. "We're really trying to be informed with each other's actions, with each other's goals and our strategies and in participating in this so that we're ensuring a united, collective Indigenous voice," said Sinclair. \</doc>

LONDON - Britain's Queen Elizabeth has pulled out of the COP26 conference in Glasgow next week after she was advised by doctors to rest, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday, in a blow to the United Nations climate summit. A palace source said the decision not to attend had been taken as a "sensible precaution" and to let everyone know in advance. The 95-year-old queen remains in good spirits and wants COP26 to be a success, the source added. "Following advice to rest, The Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle," Buckingham Palace said. "Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the Evening Reception of COP26 on Monday, 1st November." The world's oldest and longest-reigning monarch stayed overnight in hospital on Wednesday after undergoing "preliminary investigations" for an unspecified but not COVID-19 related ailment. Aides gave no details on what had prompted the medical attention, which followed the cancellation of a visit to Northern Ireland, and some royal correspondents said they hoped the official version of events painted the full picture. She carried out her first official engagement since the hospital stay earlier on Tuesday, holding two virtual audiences to welcome new ambassadors to Britain from South Korea and Switzerland. Elizabeth, who is queen of 15 other realms including Australia, Canada and New Zealand and next year celebrates 70 years on the throne, is known for her robust health. She is still carrying out many public duties. Last Tuesday she hosted a drinks reception at Windsor Castle for billionaire business leaders, including Bill Gates, attending a green investment conference ahead of COP26 . News of the cancellation is likely to raise concerns about her health. She was recently overheard saying she was irritated by world leaders who talked about climate change but did nothing to tackle it. The queen had been due to attend an evening event next Monday at the conference where world leaders will meet, including U.S. President Joe Biden and the prime ministers of Britain, Australia and India. She will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded message, the palace added. Elizabeth's son and heir, Prince Charles, and his eldest son, Prince William, are still due to attend. Britain has cast COP26 , which begins on Oct. 31, as the last big chance to slow rising temperatures, and it hopes to persuade leaders to adopt tougher climate targets. Chinese President Xi Jinping is not expected to attend, however, and Russia's President Vladimir Putin is also not coming. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday it was "touch and go" as to whether COP26 would succeed in securing the requirements needed to limit the rise in the average global temperature to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. \</doc>

OAK HAMMOCK MARSH, Manitoba, Nov. 10, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC), one of the country's largest and longest-standing conservation organizations, will deliver climate solutions research at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ). DUC's presentation will showcase the important role that peatlands-a highly beneficial wetland ecosystem-play in storing and sequestering carbon. Peatlands are prevalent in Canada's vast boreal forest, which extends from the Yukon and northern British Columbia in the west to Newfoundland and Labrador in the east. These carbon-rich ecosystems store and sequester more carbon than any other type of terrestrial ecosystem. In fact, it's estimated that one-quarter of the world's carbon is held in Canada's forest habitat. Kevin Smith, DUC's national manager of boreal programs, will present research supporting innovative climate solutions being developed in collaboration with conservation partners across Canada. "We are stressing the need for conservation activities that both increase the amount of carbon absorbed by wetlands and also maintain the carbon already contained in these ecosystems," says Smith. "When wetlands are left unaltered, the carbon stored in the wetland will not be released into the atmosphere, whereas degraded wetlands will release the carbon, contributing to climate change." The boreal region is one of DUC's highest priority areas for conservation. To date, DUC has positively influenced more than 121 million acres of wetlands and associated natural habitats in the area through partnerships and policy efforts. "We've been actively partnering with governments, Indigenous Peoples and industry to develop comprehensive, science-based approaches for conserving wetlands in the boreal for more than 20 years," says Larry Kaumeyer, DUC's chief executive officer. "Today, our collaborative research and on-the-ground habitat work are more important than ever. It's encouraging that leaders at COP26 recognize the need to better understand and protect these important carbon sinks." Earlier during COP26 , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau emphasized the importance of nature-based climate solutions to help adapt to the impacts of climate change, protect and restore nature and biodiversity, and strengthen people's health and well-being. This supports the commitment made by the federal government to protect 25 per cent of Canada's land and oceans by 2025, working toward 30 per cent by 2030. Investments that support the conservation of boreal forest wetlands, including peatlands, will be essential to reaching these ambitious targets. Smith will deliver a virtual presentation to delegates gathered at COP26 on November 11. He says the presentation will be valuable for other European and Asian countries that also possess significant peatland areas. "Canada has an opportunity to be a global leader in employing wetland conservation as an effective tool in climate change mitigation," says Smith. "Investment in these incredible carbon sinks needs to be a priority for policy makers and industry. We look forward to sharing our science and delivering conservation that will ensure the ongoing security of these vital areas." Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) is the leader in wetland conservation.

The past two weeks at COP26 have been both inspiring and frustrating. Thousands of young people in Glasgow, and millions more around the world, took to the streets to call for political leaders to take real action on climate change. There were lots of impressive-sounding new commitments, but overall, a worrying lack of urgency to face the challenge of the climate crisis. COP26 was a time to bring the leaders of the world together to make sure all countries are on track to meet the targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement. When they signed that historic agreement, leaders from around the world committed to keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve that goal, the science is clear that emissions of greenhouse gases must nearly halve by 2030. This is a code red for the planet. Over the past year, we've witnessed the devastating impacts of climate change in Canada, and around the world, including heatwaves, wildfires, and flooding - caused by the mere 1.0 degree of warming we have experienced so far. Scientists have shown that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C will avoid the disastrous effects we can expect if warming is allowed to go to 2 degrees C and beyond. To "keep 1.5 alive" -the unofficial motto of COP26 - we needed to see a major ramp-up in ambition, with the biggest polluters coming to the table with new targets to rapidly reduce their pollution by 2030. But that did not happen. Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific group, has analyzed all those 2030 targets and calculated that they would put the world on track for 2.4 degrees of warming - and only in the unlikely event that all countries actually achieve them. World leaders can and must do better. And Canada - as a wealthy, high polluting country and a major exporter of fossil fuels - must play a role as a climate leader on the world stage. We saw some promising signs that Canada is willing to step up. It was one of 20 countries that committed to stopping government financing of fossil fuels overseas. This new agreement could see a shift of $20 billion away from the development of fossil fuels. But now we need to see action at home to stop funding the oil and gas extraction that is leading us to climate disaster. We also heard the new Environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, reiterate the climate promises his party made at the recent federal election. He announced that Canada will stop exporting thermal coal by 2030. Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and has no place in the low carbon transition, so we were disappointed not to see that date brought forward. Canada can't profit from selling coal for another eight years and claim to be a climate leader. There was no advance on Canada's target for 2030: 40-45 per cent. While it will be an enormous challenge to meet this target, it falls short of Canada's fair share given its historic responsibility for climate change. COP26 is over. Now the real work must start to make sure that Canada and the rest of the world is doing everything it can to reduce emissions and avoid a climate catastrophe. The youth have made their voices heard - they want action from their political leaders. It is now the job of every politician, whether it is municipal, provincial, or federal, to be ambitious and introduce policies that will give us a safe and sustainable future. If they won't listen to young people and fail to take the climate crisis seriously, then we are going to hold them accountable. That is why we are taking the Government of Ontario to court for rolling back on climate ambition in this province. Next September, we will face the provincial government in court for failing to protect our Charter right to life, liberty, and security of the person. The message that all political leaders must hear following the past two weeks at COP26 is clear - we need you to do more.

Jewel Davies, a Carcross/Tagish citizen of the Dakl\' awedi clan, whose Tlingit names are Yekhunashin and Khatuku, went to Glasgow for COP26 without expectations.  I like to go in, just keep an open mind and see what goes from there, she said. COP26 , a climate change conference hosted by the United Nations, took place in Scotland from Oct. 31 to Nov. 13. An estimated 25,000 delegates from about 200 countries attended to discuss the goals laid out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Davies, 21, is a fourthyear student in the Indigenous Governance program at Yukon University. She told the News she was taken aback by the conference\' s arrangement.  I was very surprised about how colonialist the space was  it was very paternalistic \- the time structure and schedules were very rigid, Davis said.  It was very much set up like a stage and an audience, like a lecturer, who was telling people something  not interacting, not inviting conversations.  Even in some Indigenous meetings I attended, we weren\' t able to do a proper opening or closing. And people weren\' t able to say what they were wanting to say, because of the time restrictions. For someone like Davies, steeped in Indigenous ways which depend upon conversations, listening and shared experience, she could not ignore the underpinnings of the worldview COP was founded on and precipitating. Outside the conference, Davies said she had more opportunity to speak with Indigenous knowledge holders from around the world.  They spoke to the fact that all the quote-unquote \' climate solutions\' that corporations and countries were proposing are all solutions that were based on market or market-based solutions, or carbon markets and carbon trading laws, Davies said.  It\' s still supporting the same economy, the same government, in the same worldview that is the direct cause of climate change. She said she realized that real change does not come from big conferences. It will happen in communities, where conversations can take place and people can share and listen and learn from one another.  We need to learn how to create a reciprocal, and balanced relationships with mother earth again, Davies said. Davies is a fellow with the Yukon First Nations Climate Action Fellowship program. She is also working with \' How we Walk with the Land and the Water\' as a youth climate ambassador. \' How we Walk\' is a three nation (Kwanlin D\'fcn, Carcross/Tagish and Ta\' an Kwach\' an) initiative to compile the Indigenous values of community members to inform their processes to create an Indigenous-based land relationship planning process in anticipation of when First Nations decide they want to go into land use planning. Understanding the interconnectedness of land, water and human beings is critical, Davis explained.  Our whole worldview is centered and based around relationships. This is why we need to reclaim and reconnect with this relationship with nature  this holistic, balanced relationship with nature and realize that, we\' re intrinsically interconnected, she said.  We cannot survive without it. Davies is well-supported by her Indigenous climate change connections and different global organizations. She is grateful to the Northern Council for Global Cooperation (NCDC) for supporting her trip to COP26 . Daqualama Jocelyn Joe-Strack, the Research Chair of Indigenous Knowledge at Yukon University oversees the Yukon First Nations Climate Action Fellowship with Jodi Gustafson, who co-leads a global NGO out of New Zealand, RIVER, whose goals include bringing awareness to different worldviews. They are all connected in a strong growing circle that supports Indigenous knowledge sharing. Davies travelled to Glasgow for the full two weeks with the executive director of NCDC, Tracey Wallace. Davies described multiple lines of police every day, revolving metal gates, packed crowds of people flowing down streets and security checks just to get into a conference room.  No one was obviously six feet apart. But everybody was wearing a mask. Organizers distributed COVID-19 tests to everyone. Davies had a cold on her return, but a few days later was back to normal. Reflecting on her trip she talked about the things she realized.  I would say it\' s like the most colonialist space I\' ve ever been, in my whole entire life. The individualism at the conference seemed stark. Davies\' favorite part  was just listening to Indigenous peoples\' experiences from around the world and just, the unity in our knowledge and our issues that we\' re facing against colonialism.

EDINBURGH, U.K. - Quebec is taking part in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, COP26 , to "put a little pressure on all heads of state." That's what Fran\'e7ois Legault suggested on Tuesday during an interview with The Canadian Press in a hotel in Edinburgh. "When we look at the reports (of experts on climate change), it is clear that we are not going in the right direction," he said. Legault is participating from Tuesday to Thursday in his first mission as premier at a United Nations Conference. This summit aims, among other things, to come to an agreement on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Often accused by the opposition of lacking eagerness to defend the environment, the CAQ leader says that playing politics without worrying about climate change "does not make sense." "It's as if we forgot the biggest challenge we have," he said. Although elected in 2018 with a rather limited environmental program, the CAQ government now wants to lead by example. He said Quebec is, among all the federated states of North America, the one that emits the least greenhouse gases per capita, just under 10 tonnes per capita, compared with an average of 20 tonnes in the rest of Canada. "Quebec must be present, if only to put a little pressure on the other heads of state. (...) If you are in politics, it is normal to come here and say: 'Hey, we have to act, and maybe look at Quebec, there are things that we do well'. " The premier had already indicated that he intended to promote the sale of buses and electric trains designed and assembled in Quebec at COP26 . The mission's promotional document states that Quebec is "essential" for its "electrical expertise," from Hydro-Qu\'e9bec to the construction and recycling of batteries. While everyone is calling on the U.S. to make more binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Legault has not yet unveiled new GHG reduction targets. Quebec is aiming to reduce its GHG emissions by 37.5 per cent in 2030 compared with 1990. But it missed the 20-per-cent reduction target set for 2020, only reaching six per cent. Ultimately, all countries must achieve carbon neutrality, zero emissions, in GHGs. Legault said Canada and the United States not only missed their 2020 reduction target, but even increased their GHG emissions. He also deplores the absence at COP26 of China, the world's largest polluter, and accuses India, another major polluter, of postponing the goal of achieving carbon neutrality until 2070. "Without becoming anxious, I have two sons ages 28 and 29, and it is worrying, the future of the planet," Legault said.

"Farmers have everything at stake as the UN COP26 climate talks begin in Scotland. Farmers will be among the first and the hardest hit if the world doesn't slash emissions. Drought, floods, and extreme weather are already hitting many Canadian farms. But also, as emitters ourselves, farmers want to contribute solutions. And we want rapid emission reductions from all sectors. These are the messages we're taking to Glasgow," said NFU Youth President and Ontario farmer Stuart Oke, about to depart for the UNFCCC COP26 climate negotiations that begin October 31st. Oke is one of six National Farmers Union (NFU) representatives going to the UN talks. The six farmers will engage with negotiators; underscore that farmers and Indigenous peoples are among those most directly impacted by climate change; build solidarity with allies; push for justice and equity in the UN process; and advance solutions such as low-input agriculture, agroecology, and Food Sovereignty. "Many Canadian farmers suffered a crushing drought this year. Fires, floods, and other climate impacts hit others. We're already feeling the effects of an increasingly hostile climate. And like every other sector of our economy, we also contribute to climate change-our farms produce greenhouse gases. Thus, we want to do our part; we want to partner with governments to transform our food systems and slash emissions," said Tiffany Traverse, BC farmer, also on her way to Glasgow. En route to the UN talks, Saskatchewan farmer Glenn Wright added: "This year my Saskatchewan farm was hit hard by drought. I've watched as the climate has become more extreme and damaging. At the same time, I've taken actions on my farm to reduce fossil fuel and farm input use and to dramatically cut our emissions. I'm going to the COP26 talks in Scotland to let our leaders know that solutions are urgently needed and available, and that farmers want to help lead the way." \</doc>

For a couple of weeks in early November, world leaders, climate scientists, business stakeholders and NGOs congregated in Glasgow for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to address the looming climate crisis. The need for urgent climate action has never been clearer here in Canada. Just a few short months after British Columbia recorded a high temperature of 49.6 C and experienced more than 1,600 forest fires that burned almost 8,700 square kilometres, southern B.C. is now being ravaged by flooding that has washed out entire roads, causing at least four deaths and leaving many trapped. As the southern end of the province addresses the devastating fallout of the climate disaster, the RCMP in northern B.C. have arrested 14 unarmed, peaceful land defenders working to prevent the construction of the multibillion-dollar Coast GasLink natural gas pipeline, which is planned to run through Wet'suwet'en Territory. The conflict between the Canadian state, working in defence of a natural gas company, and Indigenous land defenders, working to protect the earth and defend Indigenous rights, raises a contradiction in light of the recent public commitments to meaningful climate action by the Canadian government. According to Kyla Tienhaara, a professor in the Queen's University School of Environmental Studies and Canada Research Chair in Economy and Environment, the Canadian government made two significant commitments to reduce fossil fuel emissions at COP26 . The first was a commitment to stop financing overseas investments in fossil fuels, and the second was a commitment to phase out "inefficient" fossil fuels. "Countries have been talking about (phasing out fossil fuels) for a very long time, but that commitment got watered down in the end because it basically put the word inefficient in front of fossil fuel subsidies, which raises the whole question of what on earth is an inefficient fossil fuel?" Tienhaara said in an interview with the Whig-Standard. While Tienhaara was pleasantly surprised to see Canada - one of the largest producers of oil in the world - sign on to these commitments, she was nonetheless disappointed that more action wasn't taken to reduce fossil fuel production. "The International Energy Agency had a report earlier this year that basically said if we're going to stick to keeping warming below 1.5 C - which is the objective that everybody's trying to keep alive - then there's no room for any more developments in oil, gas or coal," she said. For Ryan Riordan, the director of the Sustainable Finance Institute at Queen's Smith School of Business and the head of delegation for Queen's University at COP26 in Glasgow, the conference brought a good focus to the issue of climate change but does not do enough to address the climate crisis. "It was, I would say, probably not enough. But if there was some meaningful progress on things that don't get as much attention that you normally think of, like deforestation and methane gas, I think those are important pieces that saw actual progress," Riordan said in an interview with the Whig-Standard. In particular, Riordan was hoping to see more discussion on carbon markets, which would set an international cap on fossil fuel emissions. "I would have really liked, as a finance person, progress in Article 6 (from the 2015 Paris Agreement), which is about carbon markets. This was a mechanism that allows richer industrialized countries like Canada to cross-subsidize emissions abatement in less-industrialized countries. And I think it was just a big missed opportunity," Riordan explained. Carbon markets work similarly to budgeting, in which a global emissions target is set and all countries work annually to reduce emissions, but can offset emissions by buying or selling reductions. Riordan argues that the commodification of emissions reductions would incentivize both investment by governments into such projects and incentivize private development of emissions-reducing technology. "If we have our financial industry focused on making sure that the things that are sustainable, because their shareholders and stakeholders care about that stuff, then feasibly or theoretically we might have a point where only things that are environmentally sustainable get financed, and things that don't get financed generally don't get built," he said. Both Riordan and Tienhaara were lukewarm about the outcomes of the COP26 conference but agreed that such international conferences were an important part in addressing climate change. "Having the international and the national press focused on whether or not you sign on to commitment or not, or even just being cajoled by fellow foreign leaders to say, 'Hey, listen to me. If you want to be on the stage in 10 minutes and say that you also signed on to this, you have to sign on to it,£nd so without that peer pressure and that focus, and the attention on these things, I don't think we'd be making any meaningful progress towards actually reducing emissions," Riordan said. Tienhaara echoed the importance of such attention but added that she would like to see an end to the attendance at such events. "The value of COP26 is that ... everybody's, I think, sort of reminded about how important it is that we move and that it puts more pressure, hopefully on governments, if people are looking at what their leaders are doing," she said. "I'm mostly disappointed with the continued lack of progress to actually address the elephant in the room. So allowing fossil fuel lobbyists to still come in huge delegations, it just doesn't make any sense to me at all. I mean, we don't let tobacco lobbyists go to health conferences."

By Beh Lih Yi KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - As the clock ticks down to November's COP26 climate talks, a global citizens' assembly was launched on Tuesday in a bid to formulate responses to climate change and get more voices heard. Billed as the first such international initiative, 100 people from around the world will take part in the assembly in the run-up to the U.N. COP26 climate negotiations in Scotland. The assembly is modeled on similar efforts in countries like Britain and France in recent years, which have been used to help inform government policy on climate issues and other divisive topics, such as Ireland's 2018 abortion referendum. "The upcoming COP26 is one of the most important meetings in my lifetime and in your lifetime," said Bob Watson, a leading environmental scientist who chairs one of the two governing committees of the new global citizens' assembly. "Your voices represent the people of the world, and it is vital that governments and the business community hear your concerns - they need to listen to you," he told the online launch of the global assembly. "They need to hear that we need a more equitable world, and that nobody is left behind. The time for action - not talking - is now," he added. The assembly's 100 members are being chosen by lottery from around the world and will reflect the global demographic make-up, with 60% of participants from Asia and 17% from Africa. Half will be women and 70% will earn $10 a day or less, the organizers said. The initiative - championed by more than 100 climate, community and public policy groups worldwide - is also supported by the United Nations and the British government as the host of the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The assembly launch comes amid concerns that unequal access to vaccines and high travel costs could exclude officials and activists from developing nations from the COP26 summit, further side-lining those who are already vulnerable to climate change. Those concerns prompted a call by a network of 1,500 groups last month to delay the Glasgow conference, but the British government has insisted the summit - already postponed a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic - should not be put off again. Alok Sharma, the senior British official who will preside over the COP26 talks, said the global assembly was "a fantastic initiative." "We recognize just how important its work is and also because we are committed to bringing the voice of global citizens into the heart of COP26 ," he told the online launch. The people's assembly will deliberate on how climate change can be addressed in fair and effective ways and will present its members' views on the sidelines of the COP26 talks. Its recommendations will be finalized in March next year and delivered in a report for distribution to world leaders. Organizers are also working to encourage civil society groups in different countries to hold "community assemblies" to broaden discussions on how climate change is affecting the local level. The COP26 conference has been billed as the last chance to galvanize the collective effort needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.

Minister says no Yukon government delegation went to COP26 Environment Minister Nils Clarke said the territorial government didn't send a delegation to the international COP26 climate conference due to active sitting and COVID-19. Clarke rose in the legislature on Nov. 26 to give a ministerial statement acknowledging the conference and noting the Yukon's own climate targets. "We certainly hope to have a presence at future COPs. The challenge for elected officials and their ministries is that it's set during this sitting, so I personally wasn't able to attend," he said. "I inquired of my officials as to why others didn't go and it was generally COVID-19 related." Clarke said the decision to send people to the conference "is complicated," since it means burning air-fuel on international travel, but he said in-person meetings are important and lead to major agreements. The government of the Northwest Territories sent both its Environment Minister and a second MLA to Scotland for the conference. Clarke said he has a meeting scheduled with federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault to discuss the outcomes of COP26 . The government's plan to reduce emissions is called Our Clean Future and includes a long-term plan to build up renewable energy infrastructure. The government has also committed & - as part of the CASA agreement signed by the NDP and the Liberals & - to reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels in the territory. The plans to reach that target are being developed by the newly-formed Yukon Climate Leadership Council. Clarke said the goal is "in close alignment with the critically important 1.5-degree warming limit." Quill Creek timber harvest moves ahead More firewood supply is on the way, says Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources John Streicker. Streicker rose in the House on Nov. 25 to announce that the Quill Creek timber harvest plan is moving to the next stage after being recommended by YESAB. The project scope is for the harvesting of 136,726 cubic metres of beetle-killed spruce and 26,429 cubic metres of green spruce over a 15-year time frame. The harvest represents more than 70,000 cords of wood, he said, which should be available to harvest at the beginning of December. Earlier in the year, the Yukon Wood Products Association raised concerns that due to project delays, the Yukon was running out of wood that was approved for harvest. "Implementing the Quill Creek timber harvest plan will provide long-term opportunities for commercial fuel-wood harvesting and help to ease pressures around future supply," he said. The allowable cut on public lands in the Dawson Forest Resources Management Plan area has also been increased to 28,000 cubic metres per year. Responding in the legislature, both Wade Ischenko and Kate White noted that the government's strategy in Our Clean Future features biomass fuel, which will require long-term supplies of local wood. "I appreciate that this new plan took time, but I'm hopeful that, for future planning, we don't find ourselves short of timber fuel again," said White. Streicker said the government is working closely with the Wood Products Association, First Nation governments and renewable resources council to maintain local wood supplies.

GLASGOW, Scotland, Nov. 10, 2021 /CNW/ -- New technology aircraft and jet fuel made from waste: the global air transport industry has outlined how to meet its new long-term climate goal during Transport Day events at the UN COP26 in Glasgow. This confirms the commitment of the world's airlines, airports, air traffic management and the makers of aircraft and engines to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, in support of the Paris Agreement. Aviation is one of the only sectors to have made such a global commitment. Analysis detailed in the Waypoint 2050 report outlines credible paths for the air transport sector to reach net-zero carbon. The industry says a mix of new technology including potentially shifting to electricity and hydrogen for some shorter services; improvements in operations and infrastructure; and a transition to sustainable aviation fuel by mid-century would provide a majority of the carbon reductions. Remaining emissions could be captured using carbon removals measures. Speaking at a COP26 event with the UK Government today, Haldane Dodd, Acting Executive Director of the Air Transport Action Group said: "Aviation has increased its ambition in line with the need for all sectors of the economy to pursue rigorous climate action. Despite having endured the greatest crisis in aviation history, this net-zero 2050 goal shows that our sector has placed climate action as one of its highest priorities." A complete shift away from fossil fuels for air transport around mid-century would be possible, with sustainable aviation fuels made from waste resources and rotational cover crops gradually transitioning towards fuels generated from low-carbon electricity. Importantly, the shift to sustainable fuels will enable green energy industry opportunities in nearly every country, sustaining up to 14 million jobs worldwide. "Our analysis shows several scenarios, with new technology options such as electric and hydrogen aircraft for the short-haul fleet, to a complete shift to sustainable aviation fuel for medium- and long-haul operations. We have identified the building blocks needed and the scale of the challenge is substantial, but with supportive government policy and the backing of the energy sector, it can be done." "National government policy measures focused on innovation and energy transition are vital. We also urge the member states of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to support adoption of a long-term climate goal at the 41st ICAO Assembly in 2022, in line with industry commitments."

VANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 3, 2021 /CNW/ -At COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, Blockchain for Climate Foundation launches the BITMO Platform, an innovative tool to help countries achieve their climate goals. The BITMO Platform allows signatories to the Paris Agreement to issue and exchange carbon credits as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. While countries negotiate at COP26 , the BITMO Platform stands by to enable a quick start of international carbon trading under the Paris Agreement. Blockchain for Climate Foundation created the BITMO Platform to advance Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and shepherd an effective, efficient, and timely global carbon market using blockchain technology. The BITMO Platform enables issuance and exchange of "Blockchain Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes" (BITMOs) as ERC-1155 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Each BITMO token, equivalent to one tonne of CO2, has all pertinent carbon credit data embedded right into the NFT. Launching November 8, the BITMO Platform will provide accounting and exchange infrastructure necessary under Article 6, connecting demand for emissions reductions with the best climate action opportunities around the world. Countries signatory to the Paris Agreement may help fulfill commitments to reduce emissions by purchasing BITMOs from proven emissions reductions achieved elsewhere. The BITMO Platform is a secure record of issuance, transfer, and retirement for each country's Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) that can be reconciled with National Carbon Registries and meet future UN requirements. BITMOs make all relevant data publicly available and are settled immediately when exchanged, helping avoid double counting of emissions reductions. The BITMO Platform helps humanity address the climate crisis while fostering global co-operation. In that spirit, Blockchain for Climate Foundation is convening a National Party Working Group to pilot the issuance and exchange of ITMOs using the BITMO Platform. If you represent a national party interested in exploring how the BITMO Platform can help you, please reach out to learn more.

More sweltering summer days expected in Vancouver's future Three arrested at Vancouver rally UN Secretary General says temperatures on course to rise more than 2 C Here's your weekly update with everything you need to know about climate change and what B.C. is doing to address the climate and ecological crises for the week of Nov. 1 to Nov. 7, 2021. This week the dominant climate news continued to be the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, which wrapped up Friday. World leaders met to discuss how to create a zero carbon future and avert the catastrophic damage scientists say will occur if global warming exceeds 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. Check back here every Saturday for a roundup of the latest climate and environmental stories.

This is an increase of 3.0 MtCO2e since 2007, the baseline year. B.C.'s net emissions in 2019: 67.2 MtCO2e, an increase of 1.5 MtCO2e since 2007. B.C.'s 2030 target: 40 per cent reduction in net emissions below 2007 levels. B.C.'s 2040 target: 60 per cent reduction. B.C.'s 2050 target: 80 per cent reduction. Canada's 2030 emissions target: Between 40 and 45 per cent reduction. Canada's 2050 emissions target: Net-zero. (source: B.C. and Canada governments) Climate change quick facts: The Earth is now about 1.1 C warmer than it was in the 1800s. Human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by nearly 49 per cent above pre-industrial levels starting in 1850. The world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change. 2015-2019 were the five warmest years on record while 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record. On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, temperature could increase by as much as 4.4 C by the end of the century. In 2019, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs. Carbon dioxide levels were 148 per cent of preindustrial levels. Emissions must drop 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 C and 2.7 per cent per year to stay below 2 C.

After two weeks of often fraught COP26 talks, delegates agreed to reduce the use of coal, end "inefficient" fossil-fuel subsidies and boost their climate targets sooner. The Glasgow Climate Pact puts the world, barely, on a path to limit the rise in global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial times - the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement and the level scientists say is needed to avoid climate catastrophe. The accord came despite last-minute objections from China and India, two of the world's largest emitters, who argued developed countries should do more. Delegates also approved the framework to create a market for trading carbon credits, which some see as a vital part of any global climate solution. Discussions over the rules had been deadlocked for six years. The agreement rests on the huge assumption that the biggest polluters - especially China, the U.S. and India - will carry through on their promises to zero out their emissions over the next decades. It was also criticized by activists for not doing enough to raise financial support from rich countries to help developing nations transition to clean energy and prepare for more extreme weather.

Now, experts say, the real work begins of putting meat and bone to the pledges and commitments made by world leaders to keep global warming below catastrophic levels. "The next couple years are going to be the most important, fastest-moving period of carbon reduction in Canadian history," said Rick Smith, president of the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices. With the UN-sponsored COP26 climate conference coming to an end, the federal government has to put some specifics behind promises. Business leaders are looking for details on everything from when the commitment to cap fossil fuel emissions will kick in to regulations on methane releases to tax credits for carbon storage. "At the end of the day, it comes back to how you translate those targets into policy in Canada," said John Dillon of the Business Council of Canada. Dillon said he expects the climate discussion to broaden after Glasgow to include sectors such as construction, agriculture - even the military. "The military produces a lot of GHG emissions."

The Local News Data Hub at Ryerson University compared temperatures from 1951-80 with projections for the period 2051-80 using data from ClimateData.ca , a national data initiative bringing together scientists from university, government and private-sector organizations. The results for 30 cities and towns show that in most locations there will be fewer days when the thermometer drops below zero. Residents accustomed to deep-freeze cold will encounter temperatures below -15 C less often. Sweltering summer heat above 30 C will be more common. The projections show that: . Vancouver residents who weathered a brutal heat wave this past summer should expect more hot days. In the 30 years between 1951 and 1980, local temperatures rose above 30 C for just one day per year on average. But in the decades after 2051, this will increase to three to 12 days per year on average. . Winnipeg's "Winterpeg" reputation will suffer. By 2051-80, there will be only six to 19 days per year on average when temperatures will be colder than -25 C. That's down from an annual average of 33 days per year for 1951-80. Meanwhile, summer temperatures above 30 C that used to make an appearance for 12 days per year will scorch the city for 27 to 50 days by mid-century. . Other famously cold cities such as Yellowknife, Dawson City in the Yukon, and Churchill, Man., which used to experience just over 80 days of extreme cold per year on average, could see that fall by as much as half by 2051-80. For Dawson City, that means 44 to 58 days per year on average when it will be below -25 C. Churchill can expect 34 to 59 extreme cold days. Yellowknife will experience 44 to 62 such days.

Every country, city and company must decarbonize by 2050 or earlier - with verifiable and aligned 2030 targets, credible and clear measures, and maximum urgency," he said. Guterres said climate risk must be systematically integrated into all decision-making processes and financial flows. "Fossil-fuel subsidies - especially coal finance at home and abroad - must end once and for all," he said. "Private sector finance must be aligned with a credible net-zero, resilient and sustainable development pathway. And we must ensure that our transition to net zero is just, equitable and inclusive."

MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica, April 25, 2022 /CNW/ -- Developing countries will access new climate funding and finance tools to address climate change, thanks to a Finance Strategy launched by the NDC Partnership in Montego Bay, Jamaica. The Most Honourable Andrew Holness, Prime Minister of Jamaica, launched the new Strategy with NDC Partnership Co-Chairs, Senator the Honourable Matthew Samuda of Jamaica, Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, and The Right Honourable Alok Sharma of the United Kingdom, COP President and Member of Parliament, to support developing countries implement their climate commitments. The Finance Strategy targets money and support for developing countries, harnessing a unique cooperation model to drive sustainable national, regional and international transformation. The Strategy will: The new Finance Strategy builds upon the Partnership's recent work, which has seen USD1 billion mobilized to support developing countries' climate action. Yet, much more is needed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's Sixth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, warns that we are not on track to meet the 1.5\'b0C target above pre-industrial levels established in the Paris Agreement. Following COP26 "As a small island developing state, the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement is not an abstract target but a matter of survival," said Prime Minister Holness. "That is why the development and launch of the NDC Partnership's Finance Strategy is so important and timely." "The Partnership's Finance Strategy provides a strong signal to members and global leaders that raised ambition in developing countries must be urgently matched with large-scale, predictable and timely financing," added Minister Samuda. COP President Alok Sharma added: "At COP26 we made significant progress, but now is the time to turn commitments into action. The Partnership has shown that by combining countries' leadership with a coordinated response from international partners, technical and financial support can be mobilized effectively." About the NDC Partnership The NDC Partnership brings together more than 200 members - including 115 countries, developed and developing, and 80 institutions - to deliver ambitious climate action that helps achieve the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Governments identify their NDC implementation priorities and the support needed to produce actionable policies and programs. This informs a tailored package of expertise, technical assistance, and funding, for members.

As usual, there was a lot of heated rhetoric doing the rounds at the COP26 Glasgow climate summit that just wrapped up. Some of the most attention-grabbing statements came from none other than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who called for both a global carbon tax and a hard cap on emissions from Canada's oil and gas sector. Trudeau's remarks generated a lot of headlines both at home and abroad. He knows how to make news, that's for sure. It would have been nice though if he'd also taken the opportunity to use the podium at COP26 to offer the world, and summit protesters like Greta Thunberg, a snapshot of what the actual numbers tells us about Canada's emissions situation. Because while you wouldn't know it from the way everyone's talking, Canadians'emissions are actually going down. A lot. This information comes courtesy of none other than the federal government's own annual reports on energy. "Since 2000, there has been a decoupling between the growth of Canada's economy and GHG emissions, largely because of technological improvements, regulations, and more efficient practices and equipment," explains the 2021 edition of the government's Energy Fact Book. If you look at the charts produced by the government that show annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), it's pretty much a slightly jagged line that moves horizontally. There are ups and downs, but we're pretty much at the same place we were at 20 years ago. "Canada's total GHG emissions in 2019 were 730 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2 eq), a slight increase from 728 Mt CO2 eq in 2018," explains the feds. That figure may be a slight increase. But it's not like there's a similar slight increase every year. In fact, the figure for 2006 was exactly the same - 730 megatonnes. That means after 15 years, Canada's emissions have been static. How this translates into a decrease in emissions is that this number has remained flat even as Canada's population has significantly increased. The energy fact book explains that Canada's emissions have gone down by 20% per capita over the past 20 years. That's quite something and it would be nice if the word got out more. That emissions in Canada are not out of control serves as a sober check on the more extreme rhetoric we hear about an imminent climate crisis. It should also make more people re-think whether we really need to be ratcheting up the current carbon tax and adding a second, overlapping, carbon tax, which is what will happen with the implementation of next year's Clean Fuel Standard tax. So, what should the plan be moving forward? The government energy fact book already shows us the way. Better technology and greater efficiency are what has brought us to where we are and that will only continue. The private sector is on it, by their own volition. And they'd still be on it regardless of how many cocktails an activist drank at COP26 . There are those who would have you believe that the only initiatives that can bring about advances in the green sector are grandiose proclamations from politicians and NGOs at places like COP26 .

"A turning point for humanity." COP26 As the U.K. gets ready to host this year's conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Johnson has called on world leaders to "recognize the scale of the challenge we face" on climate issues. This past summer, much of the Northern Hemisphere was battered by a succession of record-breaking natural disasters, from severe heat waves in North America to deadly flooding in parts of western Europe, India and China to uncontrollable wildfires in the Mediterranean. The latest report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that the Earth was heating faster than previously thought, calling it "code red for humanity." So what exactly are world leaders hoping to achieve at COP26 ? Here's what you need to know. What is COP26 Every year since 1995, the UN has brought together nearly every country in the world to address climate change at what is called the Conference of Parties (COP). Simply put, it's the biggest, most important climate conference on the planet, and COP26 has been hailed as "the world's best last chance" to stave off the worst effects of the climate crisis. Last year marked the 26th year of COP, but the global pandemic delayed the gathering, so it is taking place this year from Nov. 1 to 12. It will bring together more than 20,000 participants in Glasgow, including heads of state, negotiators, climate experts, business leaders and citizens. COP26 is seen as the important follow-up to COP21, held in Paris in December 2015, which gave birth to the Paris Agreement. Why is the Paris Agreement important? In 2015, for the first time, countries agreed to work together to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, aiming for 1.5 C. Under the Paris Agreement, each nation committed to setting out a plan to reduce their carbon emissions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Countries also agreed to update their NDCs every five years to reflect the most ambitious and achievable target at that time. COP26 is the first time since Paris that countries will have to present their updated NDCs. Canada's updated NDC is reducing emissions by 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, an upgrade on the original pledge to cut emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. WATCH | Greta Thunberg and other climate activists voice their concern about the speed of action: Another important promise made in Paris was to reaffirm a prior commitment by developed countries to contribute to a climate fund of $100 billion US per year to help developing countries by 2020, and extend that commitment for another five years until 2025. What does COP26 COP26 has four key aims: - Secure global commitments to net zero emissions by 2050 and keep 1.5 degrees within reach, specifically by taking measures like phasing out coal, switching to electric vehicles and stopping deforestation. - Adapt to protect communities and natural habitats. - Mobilize finance to make good on the promise to pool at least $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020. - Work together to deliver on these goals. "Accountability is really a watchword for this COP. One of the key issues there is making sure that there is accountability in the system," said Jennifer Allan, a lecturer in International Relations at Cardiff University and a contributor to the Earth Negotiations Bulletin, the de facto record of global environmental negotiations. "It's really about getting that reporting so everybody knows what everyone's doing on a regular basis, rather than worrying about it a few years later." This is why COP26 is happening over two weeks. Time is needed for an army of negotiators to get into the nitty-gritty of time-frames, emissions-cutting pledges and a reporting system where progress can be measured and countries can be held accountable. Allan says these negotiations are crucial to the success of COP26 . "Yes, these technical rules are boring. But it builds confidence that all countries are doing similar things, they're all moving in lockstep." How far is the world from reaching its climate targets? Still quite far. Critics have warned that current updated national pledges to reduce carbon emissions will miss climate targets by a long shot. "At the moment, we're only 15 per cent closer than we were two years ago to being on track for 1.5 degrees if no more NDC revisions are made ahead of the Glasgow summit," said Anna \'c3 berg, research analyst at Chatham House in London. Meanwhile, pledges to reach the $100 billion in financing have also fallen short. Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada's environment minister, is part of an effort to push countries to stand by their commitments and deliver on the $100 billion US climate finance goal through 2025. "This $100 billion figure is mostly symbolic. It is not commensurate with the needs of developing countries, but it is really important that it is delivered," \'c3 berg said. "It was the core element of the bargain underlying the Paris Agreement. Not delivering would constitute a massive breakdown in trust." What are some of the biggest announcements leading up to the conference? Before the conference, several major players have made significant climate pledges. Chinese President Xi Jinping made an unexpected announcement at the UN General Assembly in September that China would end funding for foreign coal power plants. Xi provided no details, but the announcement followed similar moves by South Korea and Japan earlier this year. U.S. President Joe Biden also upped the ante at the recent UNGA by doubling the U.S.'s climate aid. He said he would work with Congress to double funds by 2024 to $11.4 billion per year to help developing nations deal with climate change. These positive moves by the world's two biggest carbon emitters has injected a note of optimism ahead of the Glasgow summit. Earlier this month, a group of major cement producers pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by up to 25 per cent this decade and reach net zero by 2050. The industry is responsible for around seven per cent of global carbon emissions \'e2\€  more than any one country other than China and the U.S. What does a successful COP26 look like? The question is, will COP26 have a positive outcome or just be the culmination of "30 years of blah blah blah," in the words of climate activist Greta Thunberg? \'c3 berg says one of the key things to watch for are "statements policymakers make during the high level plenary," where ministers and other prominent figures demonstrate their climate ambition. Experts are particularly interested in what governments plan to do to bridge the gap between current pledges versus the emissions cuts necessary to remain on track to keep global warming to 1.5 C. "Will they be revising their NDCs earlier than the Paris timetable dictates? Will they be making concrete commitments on fossil fuel phase-out and protecting nature?" \'c3 berg said. In a nutshell, a successful COP26 is about making good on promises made in the Paris Agreement. It's about making more ambitious moves to meet climate targets as early as possible. And it's about having concrete plans of action \'e2\€  not just words \'e2\€  to get us there. Without that, the implications are especially dire for parts of the world that bear the brunt of climate change, says Nnimmo Bassey, a Nigerian architect, climate activist and one of Time Magazine's Heroes of the Environment in 2009. "Africa as a continent warms at a level higher than the global average \'e2\€  about 50 per cent more," said Bassey. "We survived being in the pot, on the fire, for so long. Now, Africa is on the chopping block." Allan points out that to date, major emitters like China, India and Australia still haven't submitted updated NDCs ahead of the summit. Current pledges represent a 12 per cent reduction in global emissions, but that still puts the world on track for 2.4 C warming by 2100. "It's going to be really difficult to call a win out of this COP unless we see a big increase in that ambition," she said. \'c3 berg said she's "hesitant to use this success-failure language, because I think it's quite clear at this point that Glasgow will not achieve everything we want to achieve." But she acknowledges "we can still come very far. What this COP26 is all about is implementation. We're not there yet, but we're on the right track. I think the worst thing we can do is give up." \</doc>

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established an international environmental treaty to combat "dangerous human interference with the climate system," in part by stabilizing greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere. First signed in 1992 at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, it entered into force in 1994, calling for annual meetings and ongoing scientific research to adapt to climate change to prevent threats to food production, aid ecosystem adaptation, and enable economic development in a sustainable manner. The First Conference of Parties (COP1) was held in 1994 in the Bahamas; COP3 in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, saw the Kyoto Protocol adopted; COP21 was held in 2015 in Paris with official representation from practically every country in the world, resulting in the Paris Agreement, where 196 governments agreed to work together to keep the world's average temperature from rising 2 C (preferably less than 1.5 C) above what it had been before the Industrial Revolution. By 2020, UNFCCC had 197 signatory parties, a supreme decision-making body, but held no conference due to a world pandemic. COP26 was held last month in Glasgow, Scotland, in the wake of a summer of intense heat, drought, wildfires, fall flooding and extreme storm events. Many saw this conference as the last hope for G7 countries Canada and United States, where emissions have risen every year since the agreement. Canada, one of the world's top 10 carbon emitters, agreed to meet the Paris Agreement targets by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. After two weeks, COP26 ended in a deal that some felt was compromised by India's use of coal (the worst fossil fuel) and lack of political action, while others saw success with the first talks toward eliminating fossil-fuel use totally.

This is an increase of 3.0 MtCO2e since 2007, the baseline year. B.C.'s net emissions in 2019: 67.2 MtCO2e, an increase of 1.5 MtCO2e since 2007. B.C.'s 2030 target: 40 per cent reduction in net emissions below 2007 levels. B.C.'s 2040 target: 60 per cent reduction. B.C.'s 2050 target: 80 per cent reduction. Canada's 2030 emissions target: Between 40 and 45 per cent reduction. Canada's 2050 emissions target: Net-zero. (source: B.C. and Canada governments) Climate change quick facts: The Earth is now about 1.1 C warmer than it was in the 1800s. The world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change. 2015-2019 were the five warmest years on record while 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record. On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, temperature could increase by as much as 4.4 C by the end of the century. In 2019, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs. Carbon dioxide levels were 148 per cent of preindustrial levels. Emissions must drop 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 C and 2.7 per cent per year to stay below 2 C.

A Sunday news release from the province's environment ministry says the program was awarded most creative climate solution by the Under2 Coalition, a global alliance of state and regional governments committed to climate action in line with the 2015 Paris Accord. It says the CleanBC program uses two complementary initiatives to encourage industries to reduce emissions. The first uses a portion of the carbon tax paid by emitters to contribute to projects that reduce greenhouse gases in areas such as mining, pulp and paper, cement, agriculture, and oil and gas. It says the second one reduces carbon tax costs if an industry can show they are among the lowest emitting in the world for their sector. The ministry says B.C. has set greenhouse gas emissions targets for oil and gas of up to 38 per cent below 2007 levels by 2030. - Canadian Press Big crowds rally in rainy Glasgow for COP26 climate action( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/big-crowds-rally-in-rainy-glasgow-for-cop26-climate-action https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/big-crowds-rally-in-rainy-glasgow-for- HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/big-crowds-rally-in-rainy-glasgow-for-cop26-climate-action cop26 -climate-action ) Tens of thousands of protesters marched on Saturday through rainy downtown Glasgow, and in many other cities around the world, to demand bolder action at the U.N. climate conference. Students, activists and climate-concerned citizens linked arms as they moved slowly through the streets of the Scottish city, host of the COP26 meeting that began on Monday. Some pushed children in strollers, some danced to stay warm. Police watched the procession from the flanks. "It's good to have your voice heard," said Kim Travers of Edinburgh. "Even with the rain, I think it makes it a bit more dramatic." Just a few blocks from the procession, back-room negotiations continued at the COP26 meeting. On stage, speakers sounded the alarm over the threat of global warming to food security. Since the climate talks began, national delegations have been working to agree on technical details for the final pact, to be announced at the end of the conference after more negotiations this week. -Reuters New mapping shows how climate change could flood low-lying areas in Vancouver and beyond( HYPERLINK https://vancouversun.com/news/national/new-mapping-shows-how-climate-change-could-flood-low-lying-areas-in-vancouver-and-beyond?utm_medium=Social&;utm_source=Facebook&;fbclid=IwAR3EMIub46JT58HdHnjHsZTNdl9kXYRo6dF9ExAIiaubTPOfb4FuVm2fwwg#Echobox=1635976477 https://vancouversun.com/news/national/new-mapping-shows-how-climate-change-could-flood-low-lying-areas-in-vancouver-and-beyond?utm_medium=Social&;utm_source=Facebook&;fbclid=IwAR3EMIub46JT58HdHnjHsZTNdl9kXYRo6dF9ExAIiaubTPOfb4FuVm2fwwg#Echobox=1635976477 ) Low-lying areas of major cities like Vancouver and Montreal could become inundated with floods in the next 80 years under various climate change scenarios, suggests a floodplains map developed by a Western University researcher. The maps, created by engineering professor Slobodan Simonovic, are a visual distillation of almost 150,000 reference documents - including current and historical rainfall and snow-melt runoff data, topographic analyses, urbanization factors that impede effective drainage and a range of climate projections. Simonovic superimposed the data on web-based maps to show potential future flood inundation - how much of an area is covered by water - as well as how often and how significant floods could be. The maps, which show flood impacts on a Canada-wide scale in a standardized way, identify areas where rivers are most likely to overflow, including the Assiniboine and Red rivers that converge on Winnipeg and the Fraser Valley that runs through Vancouver.

Before the panel started on Wednesday she tweeted that fossil fuel companies and banks are trying to "give polluters a free pass to keep polluting." Offsets are a way for buyers to continue polluting while essentially paying someone else to adopt climate-friendly behaviours. But no global oversight or common standards exist, and an abundance of low-quality offsets appears to have little impact on global warming. The projects also have the potential to harm local communities if they aren't executed properly.

Heyman made the statements in a media teleconference from the United Nations' COP26 Climate Summit in Scotland, where he was invited to discuss the climate crisis with other government leaders. Last week, the B.C. government introduced its climate plan to chop greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, which includes initiatives like reducing the number of kilometres driven by residents by 25 per cent compared with last year and boosting the carbon tax. Heyman gave keynote remarks during a panel at the gathering about the government's CleanBC Roadmap to 2030, which he says was met with enthusiasm from other leaders at the conference.

"It's a big deal," said federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson from Glasgow, Scotland, the site of a United Nations-sponsored meeting on climate change. "It's a signal that many countries in this world are making this commitment not to use public resources to finance further exploration and development for fossil fuels." Climate activists welcomed the deal. "It shows that Canada recognizes the harmful social and economic impacts of fossil fuels and the urgent need to end global production and use," said Alan Andrews of Ecojustice, an environmental law firm. But industry groups responded warily. "We believe responsible energy producers such as Canada should be playing a larger role in meeting global energy demand," said Jay Averill of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Few details were immediately available about the deal. It commits signatories to stop using loans, loan guarantees, grants, share purchases and insurance coverage from any government or government agency to finance new international fossil fuel developments.

NFI GROUP INC ("NFI-T") - World leaders at COP26 transported in NFI electric buses provided - by Stagecoach NFI Group Inc. ("NFI"), a leading independent bus and coach manufacturer and a leader in electric mass mobility solutions, subsidiary Alexander Dennis Limited ("ADL") today announced that dignitaries from around the world, including UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, were transported in BYD ADL Enviro400EV electric double deck buses during the 26th United Nations ("UN") Climate Change Conference of the Parties (" COP26 ") in Glasgow, Scotland. Dignitaries from around the world rode on the buses, including state leaders, negotiators and COP26 COP26 campus in the conference's secure Blue Zone--where a BYD ADL Enviro400EV electric double-deck bus is the only bus on display--to an evening reception at Glasgow's iconic Kelvingrove Art Gallery. "We are delighted that world leaders at COP26 have had the opportunity to ride on Alexander Dennis' market leading, electric double-deck buses and experience the zero-emission transportation that is transforming travel throughout the United Kingdom," said Paul Soubry, President and Chief Executive Officer, NFI. "As the world comes together to find ways to limit global warming, we look forward to helping agencies and operators with clean, safe, accessible and efficient solutions to meet their needs. NFI moves millions of people around the world, each and every day, and we are ready to continue leading the way as the global transition to zero emission accelerates." The dignitaries rode on 10 of the UK's favourite electric buses, built in Britain by the BYD ADL partnership which has delivered or taken orders for over 1,000 zero-emission buses to date. The buses, which arrived at COP26 fresh from ADL's production line in Scotland, have been built for Stagecoach's operations in London and are painted in the iconic red of buses in the UK capital.

The province with Can-ada\' s largest oil and gas industry has sent one of the country\' s smallest delegations to the COP26 international climate conference where emissions from that sector are under scrutiny. It\' s a missed opportunity, said one Alberta observer.  It\' s incredibly good to be there and learn from these events, said Keith Brownsey, a political scientist at Mount Royal University.  It\' s smart, but apparently we don\' t think it\' s all that smart. New Democrat Opposition Leader Rachel Notley said the United Conservative government has let Albertans down.  Alberta workers need a seat at that table and the UCP made the decision to leave it empty, she said Wednesday. A preliminary list of the Canadians attending the COP26 meetings in Glasgow, Scotland, shows that of 200 Canadian delegates, two are from the Alberta government. They are officials from Emis-sions Reduction Alberta, an agency funding emissions-reducing technologies, and are the province\' s only representatives. Almost every province has sent more delegates or higher-level representatives to the meetings, which are setting the world\' s path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Newfoundland has nine people at the meetings and Manitoba has six. Ontario has four, as does the Northwest Territories. Quebec has 36 representatives. Five provinces sent environment ministers. Prince Edward Island sent the director and coordinator of its environment department. Inuit and M\'e9tis groups have more representation than Albertans. So do groups such as the Climate Action Network. Oilsands giant Suncor Energy has its own delegates. There are also more Mounties at the meetings than representatives of the province with, arguably, the most at stake of any Canadian jurisdiction. Premier Jason Kenney has said he didn\' t consider the conference worth attending.  We\' re still in a state of public health emergency and so we\' re not travelling unless it\' s absolutely essential, he said earlier this week.  Just one more politician flying into a gabfest in Glasgow is not going to make any meaningful difference. But Brownsey said the United Conservative government has missed an important chance to gather information, make contacts and tell Alberta\' s story to the rest of the world.  What goes on at COP has a dramatic impact on us in Alberta, he said.  Even the Saudis were there, talking about how they were going to reduce emissions. And we sent two delegates? Brownsey said being at the conference allows delegates to better understand the positions of other countries.  We don\' t know what\' s going on. We can read the official documents, but it\' s in the off-hours you find out what these groups are really thinking. As well, Brownsey said not showing up leaves the field to a federal Liberal government with which Alberta\' s United Conservatives are often at odds.  You complain about them, but do nothing to counter them. Notley, who represented Alberta as premier during the COP21 meeting in Paris, said showing up would have been a good chance to work with Ottawa\' s new environment minister. She said such meetings allow Albertans to tell their own story.  I remember a friend sending me a bunch of things from The Guardian (a U.K.newspaper) talking about all the progressive things the province of Alberta was doing. That story\' s not being told in our absence. Notley said Alberta has missed a window to pitch the province as an investment destination for renewable energy.  With all the investment money there, why isn\' t somebody telling the story about the promise that is our renewable energy industry? So far, the COP26 conference has seen announcements from Canada on emissions caps for oil and gas. Banks, insurers and investors managing $160 trillion have pledged to emphasize green investing.

VICTORIA - British Columbia's CleanBC program( HYPERLINK https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/higher-carbon-tax-more-electric-vehicles-b-c-revises-plan-to-fight-climate-change COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. A Sunday news release from the province's environment ministry says the program was awarded most creative climate solution by the Under2 Coalition, a global alliance of state and regional governments committed to climate action in line with the 2015 Paris Accord. It says the CleanBC program uses two complementary initiatives to encourage industries to reduce emissions. The first uses a portion of the carbon tax paid by emitters to contribute to projects that reduce greenhouse gases in areas such as mining, pulp and paper, cement, agriculture, and oil and gas. It says the second one reduces carbon tax costs if an industry can show they are among the lowest emitting in the world for their sector. The ministry says B.C. has set greenhouse gas emissions targets for oil and gas of up to 38 per cent below 2007 levels by 2030. Related B.C.

Consumer research shows two-third of travellers are thinking more about sustainability when planning vacations TORONTO, Oct. 29, 2021 /CNW/ -The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference( COP26 ) is set to start this Sunday, October 31, 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland, and VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, is taking the opportunity to promote sustainable tourism in Britain. VisitBritain's latest international consumer research showed that more than two-thirdsof travellers surveyed across 13 countries are thinking more about sustainability and the environmental impact when planning holidays. In the run-up to COP26 VisitBritain has launched a global sustainable tourism content 'hub' for visitors with itineraries, activities and experiences toenjoy a sustainable stay in Britain. VisitBritain Executive Vice President Americas Gavin Landry said: "The COP26 "Many businesses and organisations in our sector are already putting sustainability at the heart of what they do and we want to support visitors and our global travel trade partners to find products and experiences that will enrich their stay. And we hope people will then stay longer, travel more widely using low-carbon transportand to explore out of season." Follow these links for terrific ideas on exploring Britain sustainably: COP26 Host City Glasgow, Scotland: discover an urban sanctuary connected with nature Electric car driving routes in Britain's Countryside: England's The Lake District and Northumberland regions and the Scottish Highlands Discover some of Britain's most sustainable accommodation options: A selection of Green Tourism accredited properties across England, Scotland and Wales The Caledonian Sleeper night train: access Scotland's sustainable travel experiences by rail from London Explore Britain's cities on two-wheels: Brighton, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, London and Manchester Discover sustainable fashion in Britain: eco-friendly shopping through ethical clothing brands, vintage apparel and recycled goods Coastal Cornwall, England's sustainable traditions: a bio-diversity and ecological research hub VisitBritain has set out its prioritiesto aid the recovery of both domestic and international tourism, including rebuilding a more resilient, sustainable and accessible industry supporting the UK Government's ambitions set out in the Tourism Recovery Plan. Its recently published Sustainable Tourism discussion paper sets out its approach, from championing regional dispersal and low carbon transport, sharing resources and best practice with businesses to working with the trade on itineraries that support sustainable and responsible tourism. COP26 is the next in a series of major events to be held in Britain. Next year, significant global tourism draws will includeHM The Queen's Platinum Jubilee, the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, and 'UNBOXED: Creativity in the UK' 2022- to promote the UK's creativity and innovation to the world. Tourism is a critical industry for the UK, usually worth \£3127 billion a year to the economy and VisitBritain continues to also work with the industryto spread the economic and social benefits of tourism more widely, driving visits right across the year and across the nations and regions, supporting local economies.

Barack Obama issued a rebuke to China and Russia Monday over their "dangerous absence of urgency" as he attempted to rally the final week of talks at the COP26 summit. "We are nowhere near where we need to be," the former U.S. president told an audience in Glasgow. He said China and Russia's plans "so far reflect what appears to be a dangerous lack of urgency and willingness to maintain the status quo on the part of those governments, and that's a shame." China has been largely invisible during the summit. President Xi Jinping declined to attend and Beijing has not signed up to any of the headline pledges led by the U.K. or U.S., nor did it make more ambitious commitments to cut its emissions. Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, has also been absent, and the country is missing from key agreements on coal and methane. But the U.S. has also faced criticism for bringing little to the Glasgow talks, as President Joe Biden faces pressure at home over his domestic climate agenda. The U.S. declined to sign a deal to end coal power and is also not expected to sign up to an agreement to make all new car sales electric by 2035, both of which were led by the U.K. Dead or alive?

He also hit out at Republican opposition to climate action, saying: "Saving the planet isn't a partisan issue. "If we are going to act on the scale that's required, climate change can't be seen anywhere in the world as just an opportunity to score political points." Louisa Casson from Greenpeace claimed Obama's intervention was a "distraction." She said: "This is Joe Biden's administration. They can't just be looking back. We have seen a lot of bullish comments from the U.S., but we haven't seen much of substance that's going to unlock the talks." With most major deals already announced, this week will focus on talks to resolve outstanding issues. Negotiations are predicted to overrun their Friday night deadline and Saudi Arabia is among countries accused of trying to block specific policies. John Kerry, the U.S. climate envoy, has suggested a pledge to reach $100 billion in annual climate financing by 2020 could be met as soon as next year - two years late, but a year earlier than was originally feared at this summit. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

While some called Canada's empty pledges a victory, the reality is Canada's government foolishly capped the most ethical, environmentally friendly oil and gas in the world. In short, Canada's government failed at COP26 . Now, the federal government holds on to the belief that Canada has a social licence to propose things like tripling the carbon tax. That's actual progress. International investors are taking notice of Alberta's policies and carbon infrastructure too. Dow Chemical announced the world's first zero-emission ethylene derivatives complex will be built in Fort Saskatchewan, creating thousands more jobs. As that announcement was made, CEO, Jim Fitterling, said on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, "You have to have policies that support moving to low-carbon emissions and that's what we're doing up in Alberta." He's right. That's exactly what we're doing here in Alberta. And we want to re-assure our international partners and investors - Alberta will do everything in its power to provide certainty to our largest industry, tangible results with industry and the talented workforce that supports innovation here in Alberta. We won't wait for Canada to dictate terms to us. Alberta will protect our industry and grow our resources. Jason Nixon \</doc>

GLASGOW, United Kingdom, Nov. 3, 2021 /CNW/ - Climate finance is integral to addressing climate change and helping developing countries adapt to its worst impacts. Today at COP26 as delegates focused attention on financing a robust and sustainable effort to combat climate change, the Minister of Natural Resources, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson and the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Honourable Steven Guilbeault, are meeting with stakeholders and country representatives to highlight Canada's climate finance contribution. They also stressed the need for developed countries to advance plans to ensure climate finance is delivered effectively, efficiently and at scale. At a press conference with Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's State Secretary at the Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, and Minister Wilkinson highlighted the joint Canada-GermanyClimate Finance Delivery Plan. The Delivery Plan, released last week, provides clarity on when and how developed countries will meet the $100-billion annual climate finance goal through to 2025. The Plan helps keep momentum going, and facilitates important conversations ensuring that we collectively deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. While developed countries have significantly scaled-up their climate finance commitments over the last decade, more must be done to reach the $100B goal. Canada is at the forefront of driving progress on climate finance and recently accepted a request from COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma to work with Germany to produce a focused Delivery Plan on the $100-billion commitment with the objective of building confidence and trust that developed countries will deliver on their promise. The Plan sets out an estimated trajectory of climate finance from through to 2025 taking into account new climate finance pledges from individual developed countries and multilateral development banks, as well as collective qualitative actions to improve the delivery of climate finance. The Plan shows that developed countries will make significant progress toward the $100-billion goal in 2022 and provides confidence that it will be met in 2023 and thereafter through to 2025. Quotes "It is critically important for developing countries to be able to trust that the developed world will make good on its promises, starting with the $100-billion climate finance goal. Canada doubled its climate finance commitment earlier this year and is proud to have taken on this leadership role with Germany at the request of the COP26 President-Designate. While more work needs to be done, I hope that we can instil confidence and trust that developed countries will deliver on their promises to the developing world and that Canada will continue to be a constructive player to this end internationally." The Honourable Jonathan WilkinsonMinister of Natural Resources Canada "Developing countries are the hardest hit by the impacts of climate change. It is our responsibility, as developed countries, to live up to our goal and deliver $100-billion in climate finance. Through the Climate Finance Delivery Plan we demonstrate that although we will be late, we will meet the goal. Addressing this priority in advance of COP26 would not have been possible without the leadership that Canada and Germany played." The Honourable Steven GuilbeaultMinister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts: Climate finance plays a critical role in helping developing countries fight climate change and adapt to its impacts. That is why, in 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilize $100 billion in climate finance per year by 2020, and in 2015 agreed to extend this goal through to 2025.In June 2021, the Prime Minister of Canada announced that Canada will double its international climate finance commitment to $5.3 billion over the next five years. Canada's increased commitment to climate finance includes an increased focus on adaptation and recognizes that urgent action is needed to address the interconnected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, which disproportionally affect the poorest and most vulnerable.The OECD supported the work on this Delivery Plan with its expert analysis that provides aggregate, forward-looking estimates of an increase in climate finance from 2021 to 2025.The United Kingdom holds the Presidency of COP26 , this year's international climate meeting and negotiations.

It's hard to know where disappointment ends and hope begins at the COP26 climate conference as it continues today in Glasgow. We're more than halfway through this gathering of leaders from more than 100 countries, all of them presumably committed to saving the planet from a human-influenced climate-change catastrophe. But it's obvious their noble intentions and eloquent words are not translating into strong enough action. A prime example of this dangerous disconnect came with the new international agreement to transition away from coal power that was announced at the conference last Thursday. In theory, that's exactly what humankind needs if it hopes to achieve the goals set by the landmark Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. At that time, the nations of the world vowed to keep the rise in the Earth's temperature since the mid-19th century to well below 2 C and if possible to no more than 1.5 C. That of course would require drastically cutting back on human greenhouse gas emissions. And since coal is responsible for roughly 30 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, the pact signed by more than 40 nations in Glasgow seemed a giant leap forward. In practice, however, it was a halting baby step. Conspicuously absent from the list of signatories were the United States, China and India, which together account for 70 per cent of the world's consumption of this dirty fuel. Even when it came to setting distant targets for moving to net zero emissions, there was wild disagreement. To keep a net-zero commitment, a country would need to balance the amount of greenhouse gases it emits by the amount of greenhouse gases it removes. Scientists say the world must reach net zero by 2050 to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change. Canada and many other rich western nations are aiming at that target. But India, the world's third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, pledged last week to go net zero by no earlier than 2070. As for China, its target is just a decade ahead of India's. Considering that the leaders of these countries will be long dead and, therefore, unaccountable by those dates, their commitments seem more fantasy than reality. All these are inconvenient truths. They remind us how steep and rocky the road is ahead. They should not deter us, however, from attempting the journey. Countries such as India and China are still struggling to grow their economies enough to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. They argue they have the right to move more slowly on emission reductions than rich nations that have contributed far more to climate change and long reaped the material benefits of their actions. Whether Canadians agree or not with this position, their take-away from COP26 should be that their country should push on with its initiatives to reduce its emissions. What we learn and accomplish by converting to clean, emissions-free sources of energy, by replacing our gas-guzzlers with electric vehicles, by sequestering carbon dioxide in the ground and planting more trees to take it out of the atmosphere will help us honour our promises. It could also provide a working model for other countries, such as India and China, to emulate as they transition, albeit at a slower pace, from their carbon-based economies. So do we take courage or succumb to despair? While it is still possible to keep within the 1.5 C warming target, the window allowing that to happen is rapidly closing, COP26 president Alok Sharma warned last week. That still leaves room for hope - and action. All the more reason Canadians can't throw in the towel now. \</doc>

Despite environmentalists accusing COP26 of  greenwashing, broad disappointment with the final conference statement as too little too late and an ambivalent Global South, there is still hope for climate change solutions from an unlikely place  global business. The goal of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), launched in April 2021, is to bring together the financial sector to accelerate the transition to a net-zero economy. In a US$130 trillion commitment announced during COP26 , business leaders  including Mark Carney, the United Nations\' Special Envoy for Climate Change and former head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England  announced a coalition of banks, insurers, pension funds, stock markets and others from across the financial spectrum aimed at tackling climate change. GFANZ offers hope because it is taking on climate change from a global rather than a narrow national perspective. GFANZ\' s transnational approach recognizes that sustainability requires a whole planet strategy. Global South hit hard To date, efforts by nations to fashion climate change solutions have fallen short, in particular with respect to Global North-Global South interactions. The Global South continues to bear the brunt of climate change effects. A climate change solution resulting from countries acting independently or even multilaterally has not worked. The solutions we need are collective. The entire world, Global North and Global South together, needs to act like a single state in a co-ordinated move to address climate change. But how can this be done when larger emitters enter and exit their international commitments like a revolving door (in particular, the United States and China), stand on moral arguments for lower compliance (India) or deflect attention from their per capita emissions (Canada and Australia)? Trying to reach consensus and legislate solutions at national levels has been uneven at best. Standards being adopted globally That\' s why GFANZ\' s announcement is so timely. The unrelenting march of global business shows that national governments are of declining influence, as highlighted by the adoption of voluntary international standards on everything from the Basel Capital Accords for banking to ISO 9000 for quality management. There is a transnational sphere that exists beyond individual countries consisting of multinational corporations, think tanks and non-governmental organizations that involve voluntary standards and practices. Adoption of those standards is occurring globally. Such co-operation is independent of national governments, sometimes even prompting the adoption of transnational standards as national legislation. For example, voluntary banking standards such as the Basel Capital Accords set by Global North central bankers became de facto global standards over time that are also being adopted in the Global South. GFANZ is strikingly similar to the adoption of Global North financial standards in the Global South. By offering guidance on the use of huge sums of money in an environmentally sustainable manner, global business is poised to create a voluntary financial standard transnationally rather than waiting for governments to act. Four responses Recent research has identified four distinctive types of responses of the Global South in responding to Global North financial standards:reformist (highly motivated), disobliging (talk not action), cosmetic (faking it) or instigative (activists agitating for change from within). Reformist behaviour is about doing the right thing. When governments use carrot-and-stick approaches to enforce environmental standards, they prioritize global interests rather than short-term national agendas. If all of the major carbon-emitting nations were reformist and were setting and enforcing ambitious targets, COP26 would have been a resounding success. But that was not the case. Disobliging behaviour represents lower adoption of standards nationally. Here, there may be a motivation to take action, but this desire is negated for fear of regulatory or political reprisals from unsupportive national institutions. Cosmetic behaviour is the financial equivalent of environmental greenwashing  an attempt to make consumers believe your company or government is doing more to protect the environment than it really is. It involves both government officials and business adopting the rhetoric of adoption of standards and masking the lack of any substantive change. The spotty implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change would be an example. Instigative behaviour, exemplified by GFANZ, is when financial institutions wanting real change leapfrog government inaction by acting transnationally. Change is instigated by public officials being responsive to transnational business behemoths. Local regulators and political elites then benefit from the advantages afforded to national officials who coordinate with transnational partners, whether by choice or necessity. While reformist nations do the best they can, and deserve support for their tenacity, GFANZ offers a complementary transnational solution for those who want to bring about change regardless of government positions. The climate change strategy then becomes both top-down from the reformist national government and bottom-up from instigative financial institutions acting transnationally. The next step:GFANZ must ensure that positive outcomes aren\' t eclipsed by inadvertent colonial behaviours as Global North wealth is invested in the Global South. But with both reformist and instigative actions, the transition to a netzero economy might be one step closer. F. Haider Alvi is an assistant professor of Innovation Finance at Athabasca University.

A surprise deal between China and the U.S., the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, has boosted the COP26 UN climate summit as it enters two final days of tough bargaining to try to stop global warming becoming catastrophic. Britain's conference president, Alok Sharma, told delegations that the latest draft conclusions that he had seen showed "significant" progress, but that "we are not there yet." In particular, he called for more effort on "climate finance" - the perennially vexed question of how much rich countries whose development caused most global warming should pay the poorer ones who will bear most of its consequences. Developing nations want tougher rules from 2025 onwards, after rich countries failed to meet a 2009 pledge to provide $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 to help them curb emissions and cope with the effects of rising temperatures. Campaigners say that sum is anyway woefully inadequate. A first draft published on Wednesday merely "urges" developed countries to "urgently scale up" aid to help poorer ones adapt to climate change, and calls for more funding through grants rather than loans, which add to debt burdens. China, the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases, has gradually accepted more responsibility for its emissions from an economy that has grown beyond measure in the last two decades. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, unveiled a joint declaration late Wednesday in which China, the biggest producer and user of coal, promised to accelerate its transition from the dirtiest fossil fuel. The deal between two global powers, which have been divided by many diplomatic disputes on other issues, sent a powerful message to COP26 , including the producers of the fossil fuels that are the main cause of man-made global warming. "This is a boost to negotiations as we go into the final days of COP26 and continue working to deliver an ambitious outcome for the planet," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter. Kerry said during a news conference: "Together we set out our support for a successful COP26 , including certain elements which will promote ambition." A joint declaration said China, home to half the world's coal-fired plants, would begin phasing out its coal consumption from 2026-30 and also cut its emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide. Observers had been worried before the announcement that Chinese President Xi Jinping was not attending the talks in Glasgow, and Beijing had made no substantial new pledges. China's climate plan had also not addressed its methane emissions, linked largely to its sprawling coal industry. The U.S. has set a goal to decarbonize its economy by 2050, although President Joe Biden has been struggling to pass crucial legislation to do so through a politically divided Congress.

(Bloomberg) &mdash; COP26 President Alok Sharma told Group of 20 leaders they must act to curb coal consumption at a summit in Rome this month to keep alive the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 C. G-20 leaders must agree new measures to eliminate coal to avoid climate catastrophe, he said in Paris on Tuesday. Sharma wants the COP26 talks in Glasgow to consign the most polluting fossil fuel to history, but G-20 countries have so far resisted making a collective commitment. &ldquo;The response of the G-20 will quite simply be make or break, for keeping 1.5 within reach,&rdquo; he said. Sharma&rsquo;s call for action comes as the widening energy crisis prompts Chinese policy makers to rethink the pace of the country&rsquo;s green transition. China and India are among the G-20 countries that have failed to submit more ambitious climate pledges to the United Nations, although both had promised to do so before the Glasgow talks begin. While China last month agreed to stop building coal-fired power plants in other nations, Premier Li Keqiang said on Monday that the country needs to prioritize economic development. Before establishing a timetable for peaking carbon emissions by the end of the decade, China needs to conduct an in-depth assessment of how it handled the recent power crunch, he said. Those comments could be contentious as without additional commitments from China, COP26 &rsquo;s success could be put in jeopardy. Sharma brushed off concerns that the energy crisis could derail progress at COP26 , saying volatile prices show the importance of countries shifting to greener power. The COP26 &ldquo;This is a totemic figure, a matter of trust,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And trust is a hard won, and fragile commodity, in climate negotiations.&rdquo; COP26 will be the first major climate summit to take place since the start of the pandemic. Sharma said 120 world leaders are expected to attend and there will be daily Covid-19 testing. He also promised funding for any delegates who are forced to extend their stay in Scotland as a result of catching Covid-19 in the U.K. In a sign of how the restrictions may affect the summit, Sharma also said there will be limits on room numbers at the conference. &ldquo;It will be an extraordinary COP, in extraordinary times,&rdquo; he said. \</doc>

There's no two ways about: The annual international climate gabfest currently going on has descended into a farce. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 has become a joke. It's rightly being derided in many corners as something of an international laughingstock, and that growing reputation is well-deserved. Why do we say that? The evidence abounds. Take your pick. The conference in Glasgow this year has seen a massive number of jets descend upon Scotland's airports. For a group of people who supposedly want to reduce global emissions, this may be one of the most emissions-intensive events of the year. Canada sent 277 delegates and 17 press aides along for the ride. That's a lot of emissions - and a lot of taxpayer dollars. Besides, didn't most of the world just spend the past year and a half doing everything via videoconference? If it's good enough for most major corporations, it should be good enough for this enviro shindig. Speaking of the past year and a half: While the pandemic has thankfully receded in most Western nations, aren't we still being encouraged to avoid excessive travel? Political leaders certainly encourage that approach. If only they would lead by example. Then there's the fact that not even its attendees seem all that interested in it. U.S. President Joe Biden appeared to fall asleep during part of the summit. We must say, we agree with Biden's assessment: Climate gabfests are a real snore. When Biden did awake from his slumber, he took some time to lambaste China and Russia for not being there. Doesn't that render the event kind of meaningless if a major emitter like China doesn't participate? The most frustrating part of COP26 is that it's basically all about rich elitists getting together to talk about how they're going to make life more difficult for regular people by jacking up the cost of living. Our own Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jumped the shark there - announcing the need for a cap on oil and gas sector emissions, as well as calls for global carbon pricing. Let's call for a hard pass on both of those bad ideas. And let's stop taking these gabfests as seriously as we do. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Sun Media Corporation. All rights reserved. \</doc>

GLASGOW, UK, Nov. 9, 2021 /CNW/ - Climate change can no longer be considered a future threat. It is upon us. From droughts and wildfires to shoreline erosion and floods, Canadians are already feeling the effects. The increasingly harsh impacts of climate change are borderless and disproportionately affect the world's most vulnerable countries. Today, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, reaffirmed the Government of Canada's support for the High Ambition Coalition and more ambitious actions on climate outlined in the COP26 Leaders' Statement. The High Ambition Coalition aims to ensure that the 1.5\'b0C goal remains the top priority for climate action globally and that support for adaptation continues to increase. In 2015, Canada helped to spur global ambition and strengthen resolve by pushing for the 1.5\'b0C objective into the Paris Agreement, which has guided our climate policy ever since, and when Canada first joined the High Ambition Coalition. The 1.5\'b0C limit matters for Canada, which is warming at twice the global average. The 1.5\'b0C limit is even more essential for developing countries, which often lack adequate resources to fight climate change and adapt to its impacts. Through this new Declaration, Canada alongside other global leaders at Glasgow, including New Zealand, the United States of America, Independent State of Samoa, Italy, Micronesia, Ireland, Trinidad and Tobago, Rwanda, Seychelles, and the Republic of Angola is pushing for increased climate action, including through enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); phasing out unabated coal-fired electricity; reducing global methane emissions by at least 30percent from 2020 levels; enhancing adaptation support for developing countries; and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The goal is to translate ambitious pledges into concrete actions, a priority for the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), and for Canadians across the country. Quotes "Since first joining the High Ambition Coalition in 2015, Canada has demonstrated our willingness to continually raise our climate ambition and to match that ambition with pragmatic plans to achieve it. We are fully committed to taking stronger actions to limit the effects of climate change and to support vulnerable communities as they adapt to the current, inescapable realities. Just as it is clear there is more work to be done, it's equally clear that we must all work together." The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts Thus far, countries such as Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland have joined the High Ambition Coalition. With new 2030 mitigation targets this year from the Canada, Japan and the US, combined with ambitious action from the EU and UK countries accounting for more than half of the world's economy have now committed to the pace of emission reductions required globally to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C. On October 11, 2021, Canada was among a dozen countries to announce its early support for the Global Methane Pledge, which aims to reduce global methane emissions by 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. The Pledge was formally launched at COP26 and now has over 100 members. The Government of Canada is also committed to developing a plan to reduce methane emissions across the broader Canadian economy and to reducing oil and gas methane emissions by at least 75 percent below 2012 levels by 2030. Canada is the first and only country to support the Pledge and the 75 percent goal, and our approach will include regulations. Canada is accelerating the phase-out of coal by 2030, while supporting a just transition. Canada is committed to reaching net-zero emissions no later than 2050. Bill C-12, the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, became law earlier this year. At COP26 last week, Canada announced that it will allocate a minimum of 40 percent of its climate finance towards climate adaptation.

Canada's environment minister fended off accusations Friday that UN climate negotiators are resorting to "weasel words" on addressing fossil fuel subsidies. As United Nations negotiators wrestled over a final text in the closing hours of the Glasgow climate talks, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault reiterated the Canadian view that subsidies should be phased out. COP26 . But he acknowledged that "not all parties part of these negotiations necessarily agree with that." The minister, who is a former environmental activist, was addressing sharp criticism of a draft text addressing fossil fuels that contained language calling for phasing out "unabated" coal power and "inefficient" fossil fuel subsidies. "We have sadly seen the hand of fossil fuel interests interfering with that text to water it down with weasel words, like unabated and inefficient," Catherine Abreu, a member of Canada's net-zero advisory body and the executive director of Destination Zero, said at a separate press conference in Glasgow on Friday. "This language 'unabated coal,'inefficient fossil fuel subsidies'- we've seen it before. We've seen it in the G20 for 12 years - 'inefficient fossil fuel subsidies'- it means nothing." The dispute largely arises between those who argue science dictates all fossil fuel production and use must be phased out to save the planet from catastrophic warming, and those, largely in oil-and gas-producing nations, who see room for continued production and use as long as emissions are reduced or captured. Eliminating subsidies that help make fossil fuels more affordable is one key part of the process, environmental advocates say. Abreu called for "some decent language" in the final COP26 declaration to address the need to move more quickly towards a transition to renewable energy. She said governments need to show more courage and admit the "need to phase out all new production of fossil fuels as soon as possible, including the billions of dollars that world governments spend on fossil fuel subsidies." Guilbeault said he heard the criticism but that it was premature to judge what will be in the final text. "Someone earlier this week said, 'Oh, my goodness, there's nothing in the text about fossil fuel subsidies.'And then we saw yesterday a version where there was language," said Guilbeault. "There's another version today." Canada has been promising to phase out fossil fuel subsidies since 2009, when it was first referenced by the G20 in a communique. Now, Canada is part of a G20 peer review process that is overdue reporting back on what subsidies exist in Canada and how they can be eliminated. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during the recent federal election to phase out subsidies by the end of 2023. But he didn't identify what subsidies he meant, and in Canada there is no agreement yet on what constitutes such a subsidy. Guilbeault touted the backing of his American counterpart, John Kerry, who denounced the continued subsidies as the "definition of insanity." Guilbeault said Canadians could take some quiet pride in what they have accomplished in the fight against climate change over the past few years. But he said they still have their work cut out for them to make their commitments a reality. The minister referenced his background as an activist, saying there were high expectations coming into COP26 but that is because everyone recognizes that the stakes are high. Guilbeault plans to travel by train across Canada in early 2022 to meet Canadians and discuss ways to implement the Trudeau government's environmental agenda. COP26 is seen as critical to global co-operation in the effort to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 C by the end of this century, with the final rules for implementing the 2015 Paris climate accord being discussed, and a push for all countries to come to the table with more plans to curb the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. "We either find a way of agreeing or we risk blowing it," said Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, the COP26 host government, as the quest for a final declaration continued and overtime loomed late Friday. "If they can have the courage to do this deal ... then we will have a road map that will enable us to go forward and start to remove the threat of anthropogenic climate change." \</doc>

One of the presenters at the recent COP26 global climate change summit was local environmentalist Kathleen Brosemer. A PhD student at Michigan Technological University (MTU) in Houghton, MI, Brosemer is working toward her degree in Energy and Environmental Policy remotely. She received the opportunity to take part in COP26 through her university connection. "Dr. Sarah Green, a professor of Chemistry at MTU, is connected with a university consortium that brings students to the COP summits and has for quite a few years," Brosemer told Sault This Week. "She offers a course to prepare for it, because the COP process is intense and very complex. I've never taken that course, but I presented in one of her classes two years ago, and have been on her list to travel to the COPs." The university only receives a limited number of badges for students so those students who have taken Green's course get priority, Brosemer said, but she did not expect to get one. She was pleasantly surprised to learn she had made the cut. That badge only got Brosemer to the summit, however. "After that, sent me a note about the Indigenous Peoples'Pavilion soliciting presentations and events, so I responded to that and asked to present," said Brosemer. "I was selected for an hour time slot in the second week of COP26 , just three weeks before travelling." Brosemer's presentation at the conference was based on her dissertation, titled "Energy Justice for the Anishnabek." "It directly relates to COP26 because energy justice incorporates climate justice, and indigenous peoples are simultaneously the people who contribute the least to the climate catastrophe, the people who suffer first and worst from the climate catastrophe, and the ones on the front lines trying to halt fossil fuel extraction and transportation," explained Brosemer. "Indigenous peoples are the friction trying to slow and stop our headlong rush over that cliff." Brosemer spent much of her time at the Indigenous Peoples'Pavilion throughout her time at the conference. She helped with drafting responses to the various statements being produced in the negotiating rooms. "We were shut out of the negotiations, another major issue with this COP - it was the least inclusive COP in recent memory," said Brosemer. "But we sent documents with wording that we wanted to see in the resulting agreements, and responded to drafts as they were circulated. We added language recognizing indigenous peoples'rights, for instance, and specifying that indigenous peoples should be part of designing and implementing climate solutions, and there should be independent grievance mechanisms when states take actions that indigenous peoples object to. "Some of this language made it into some of the final documents to come out of the COP, but not all," she said. Brosemer also spent time networking related to Enbridge Line 5, a 690-mile pipeline across Michigan that is now 18 years beyond its planned lifetime but still in use. She met with a staffer from the Senate Transportation Committee, for example, and she hopes to follow up with her in relation to the efforts of Michigan's tribal nations'efforts to have the pipeline shut down. Although the COP summits are well attended and highly publicized, this year's event has received a lot of criticism for being just for show with no binding commitments. For instance, and of note, wellknown Canadian environmental activist David Suzuki declined his invitation to COP26 because he "didn't see the point" and didn't feel that anything was going to come from the meeting. Brosemer said she feels the criticism is valid. COP26 ," she said. "For 26 years they've been meeting to try to halt climate change. And they still subsidize coal and oil. They will not commit to stopping... It's shocking, really, that the rich governments are so unwilling to make real commitments to save humanity." Brosemer said the COP process in unnecessarily complex and obscures the real work that needs to happen. "The first thing governments should have done long ago and must do now is to stop subsidizing fossil fuel extraction, transportation, and use," she said. "The second thing they must do is to refuse to permit any new fossil fuel projects except where there is an emergency need to protect human health or safety. The earth cannot afford new extraction and new transportation of fossil fuels." \</doc>

WILLIS TOWERS WATSON PUBLIC LTD CO ("WTW-Q") - Post COP26 : Unprecedented Growth in Renewable Energy Driving - Increased Use of Transition Plans, According to WTW The accelerating growth of the renewable energy sector continues as companies are looking to transition to a low carbon environment. The speed of growth is also creating significant demand for building resilience against climate change, according to WTW, a leading global advisory, broking, and solutions company, at the launch of its annual Renewable Energy Market Review. The report also outlines how the renewables insurance market is stabilizing with low to mid single-digit price increases expected in 2022. Some of the key challenges besetting the renewables insurance market include aged assets, operation &maintenance and spares, natural catastrophe risk, contractor experience, lender obligations, the pace of technological change and COVID-19 related supply chain interruption risks. Graham Knight, Head of Global Natural Resources, WTW, said: "The renewable energy industry is transforming at a speed which can be difficult to track. This can be seen in the record growth in solar PV and wind capacity additions - beating the previous year's record - as well as the increasing interest from insurers in offshore wind and hydrogen, where synergies in environment and technology strategies are available. This creates an incredibly complex and fast evolving environment for the sector, so it is essential that organisations understand how to manage not only the speed of growth but also the emerging risks that arise, such as supply chain issues. At WTW, we are helping renewable energy companies navigate this complex risk terrain by providing innovative solutions which can help mitigate risk in this fast-growing sector."

Our planet is changing. So is our journalism. This story is part of a CBC News initiative entitled Our Changing Planet to show and explain the effects of climate change and what is being done about it. As the UN climate summit began in Scotland, an event billed as the "last, best hope" to save the planet from catastrophic consequences, there were more than enough reasons to feel as gloomy as the Glasgow weather that welcomed delegates. Harmful greenhouse gas emissions keep rising in spite of 25 previous UN Summits aimed at holding them at bay. The Conference of Parties (COP), as it's known, meets every year and is the global decision-making body set up to implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted in the early 1990s, and subsequent climate agreements. The leaders of two of the world's biggest polluters, Russia and China, stayed away from the event, and while Australia's prime minister will be here, environmental critics say the country's stance on abandoning coal production lacks ambition, to put it charitably. Even the world's richest nations, those in the best position to reposition their economies to a low-emissions future, failed to ante up enough money to cover a $100-billion US fund to help poorer nations make the same transition. Still, longtime COP watchers and participants told CBC News there may still be room for pleasant surprises and even some "eureka" moments at COP26 as the two-week event plays out and international pressure to show progress takes hold. COP26 is in getting a 'eureka' moment around countries coming back with more ambition for the 2020s \'e2\€  right now," said Alex Scott, climate diplomacy leader at E3G Consultancy, an energy think-tank based in London. "We will definitely see from this COP26 a series of deals on moving faster in key sectors," she said, referencing finance, green energy and the protection of natural spaces in particular. "We will see countries coming together in small coalitions around faster action in those sectors." - Have questions about COP26 or climate science, policy or politics? Email us: HYPERLINK mailto:ask@cbc.ca ask@cbc.ca Your input helps inform our coverage. Scott, who has advised the U.K. government on climate issues and has attended several COP events, says even when a national leader is not present at the event, there can be intense pressure on national delegations to produce deals once negotiations begin. Canadian climate campaigner Catherine Abreu of Destination Zero, a Canada-based NGO that's pushing to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels, agreed. "We bring all these countries together to declare one to another what their commitments are and then they sit across the table and say is that good enough \'e2\€ \£6 and I think those processes are really, really key," she said. Her group is pushing nations and industry for a faster transition away from fossil fuels. "I think we will see some significant progress on coal phase-out. That's one of the things [U.K. Prime Minister] Boris Johnson has been saying \'e2\€  coal, cash, cars and trees," said Abreu, who arrived in Glasgow Sunday as the first sessions were beginning. "We have a pact that will be announced on coal phase-out later in the COP process." WATCH | Here's what young activists want to see at COP26 : More than 21,000 delegates, 13,000 observers and 3,000 members of the media have registered for COP26 . Although weather delayed many arriving trains, on Sunday the halls and conference rooms at the venue were crowded with delegates from all over the world. All around the venue, artwork and signs promote the net-zero goal. China crucial to global success The case of China is especially crucial to success on climate change. It's currently the world's largest polluter, but its climate plan, released on the eve of the summit, contained no new initiatives. While China has slowed the growth of its emissions over the past several years, it has recently increased the use of coal for energy generation and has failed to set a timetable for hitting net-zero emissions. "We'll start to see coalitions forming around a high ambition outcome that really puts countries under the thumb to revisit their 2020s climate action so that we get on that pathway to 1.5 degrees," she said. The key goals of COP26 have been to deliver on major promises from the 2015 Paris Summit. They include securing the $100-billion US global finance agreement, agreeing on a roadmap to get to net zero by mid-century and keeping 1.5 degrees within reach and signing agreements to help communities adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts. Successive reports from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (UNIPCC) along with a new one released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Sunday collectively paint a bleak picture of efforts so far to hold the line on global emissions. WATCH | What half a degree of warming could mean for climate change: The WMO reports that in 2020 greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs. Temperatures were about 1.09 C above the 1850-1900 average \'e2\€  almost two-thirds of the way to the 1.5 degree threshold after which climate scientists say the world risks catastrophic consequences from fires, drought, and other extreme climate events. 'We will succeed or fail as one' To hit that mid-century target requires cutting global emissions in half by 2030 with yet more drastic cuts in the decade following that. Nonetheless, as COP26 host British MP Alok Sharma launched the event, he too stressed that room for a breakthrough remains. "We know what we need to do," Sharma told the opening plenary session. "We will succeed or fail as one." COP26 was cancelled last year because of COVID-19. Though the logistics for the Glasgow event have been complicated to work though, tens of thousands of delegates and members of civil society groups planning major demonstrations will nonetheless make their way here over the next two weeks. They will include 95-year-old Sir David Attenborough to 18-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. World leaders to speak Monday The world leaders' segment of the conference begins Monday with speeches from heads of state and prime ministers, including Canada's Justin Trudeau. His government has promised to cut emissions over the next decade to a level representing a 40 to 45 per cent reduction compared to 2005. At the same time, however, the Liberals continue to support the Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to B.C. and other other fossil fuel initiatives, which critics claim is incompatible with the goals of COP26 . \'e2\€  \'e2\€  "We recognize that the impacts of climate change at 1.5 C are much lower than at 2 C. Keeping 1.5 C within reach will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries," G20 leaders said in a communiqu\'c3\£9. \</doc>

VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis and other religious leaders made a joint appeal on Monday for next month's U.N. Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) to offer concrete solutions to save the planet from "an unprecedented ecological crisis." The "Faith and Science: Towards COP26 " meeting brought together Christian leaders including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, as well as representatives of Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism and Jainism. " COP26 "We want to accompany it with our commitment and our spiritual closeness," he said in an address which he gave to participants instead of reading it, in order to give other leaders more time to speak. The religious leaders' joint appeal, which described climate change as a "grave threat," was handed to Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio and Britain's Alok Sharma, president of COP26 in Glasgow. "The climate crisis is great and is of our making," Sharma told them. Welby, spiritual leader of the world's Anglicans, called for a "global financial architecture which repents of its past sins," including changes in tax rules to promote green activity. 'WAR ON CREATION' "We have in the past 100 years declared war on creation... Our war against the climate affects the poorest among us," Welby said. The appeal urges all governments to adopt plans to help limit the rise in the average global temperature to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions as soon as possible. Wealthier countries must take the lead in reducing their own emissions and in financing poorer nations' emission reductions, it said. "We plead with the international community, gathered at COP26 , to take speedy, responsible and shared action to safeguard, restore and heal our wounded humanity and the home entrusted to our stewardship," said the appeal's executive summary, which was read out at the start of the meeting. Several leaders stressed that no nation could go it alone. "If one nation sinks, we all sink," said Rajwant Singh, a Sikh leader from the United States, who sang a poem for the participants. In his written address, Francis said cultural and religious differences should be seen as a strength, not a weakness, in defending the environment. "Each of us has his or her religious beliefs and spiritual traditions, but no cultural, political or social borders or barriers prevent us from standing together," he said. The Vatican's foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher, told Reuters on Sunday he hoped Monday's meeting could "raise ambitions" on what can be achieved at Glasgow. Scotland's bishops said in July that the pope would attend the opening of COP26 , health permitting. A decision is expected in the next few days. Francis, 84, strongly supports the goals of the 2015 U.N. Paris accord to reduce global warming. He told young people at the weekend that theirs was "perhaps the last generation" to save the planet. U.S. President Joe Biden returned the United States to the Paris accords after his predecessor Donald Trump pulled it out. Biden and the pope are expected to meet at the Vatican at the end of October. (Reporting by Philip Pullella Editing by Gareth Jones) !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

Being part of Concordia University's observer delegation at COP26 in Glasgow offered entirely new insights into international diplomacy. While the represented 197 parties attended with both technical and political negotiation teams, the observers were there to maintain a high level of transparency and provide a civil society view to the negotiation process. Daily briefings from the Canadian Climate Action Network CAN-RAC allowed us to understand and interpret the negotiation process, which mostly took place behind closed doors. So, what has been achieved? For the first time, a COP has agreed on "phasing down" unabated coal power, meaning coal power use without carbon capture and storage. Fossil fuels were not even mentioned in the Paris agreement, while phasing out all fossil fuels was a big topic in Glasgow, not just in the official negotiations, but also at the People's Summit, led by climate justice, environmental and youth groups. This is extremely important, as fossil fuels are the main cause of the climate emergency. Phasing out fossil fuel production, and fast-tracking progress toward safer and more cost-effective renewable energy alternatives, is a must if we want to prevent further global warming. Among the many announcements of new initiatives at COP26 , banks, other financial institutions and a group of 25 countries made commitments to end the funding of international coal financing by the end of 2022 and instead prioritize support for the clean energy transition. Also, 28 new members signed up to the world's largest alliance on phasing out coal, the so-called Powering Past Coal Alliance. However, we also observed a huge gap between the countries'pledged nationally determined contributions (NDC) for greenhouse gas reduction, and what would be needed to keep the 1.5 degree goal set in Paris. The United Nations'latest assessment of climate plans says pre-Glasgow pledges will result in a 13.7 per cent rise in emissions by 2030 (compared with 2010 levels), by which time we need to halve them. Time is running out, and such large emitters such as India, the world's third-largest emitter, only want to achieve net zero by 2070. On the positive side, India pledged to produce 50 per cent of its energy needs by renewables by 2030. These intermediate goals are very important, as they mean action now. A good outcome of COP26 is that countries need to submit new pledges on GHG reductions by 2022, and not just in five years as specified in the Paris agreement. We also had Premier Fran\'e7ois Legault at COP26 for a few days, and the delegation heads were invited to discuss Quebec policies directly with him. Legault talked about the electrification of transport as a major Quebec innovation area. Quebec also just committed to the end of the extraction of hydrocarbons on its territory, while Canada as a whole is reluctant to do so. However, Quebec's CO2 emissions are still double those of Switzerland, which is at 4.7 tons per capita. And the existing hydro power resources, which provide clean electricity today and are a source of Quebec's pride, cannot provide the missing 60 per cent of the energy needed for transportation and heating that is still fossil today in Quebec. If the province seriously wants to get out of fossil fuels, it is necessary that Quebec implement more renewable energy resources today and encourage demand reduction through higher efficiency. The next decade must be a decade of action and implementation, from new transportation concepts to large-scale building retrofit, new renewable power plants, less polluting industry and more nature-based solutions to absorb at least a part of the emitted carbon. And we need to keep negotiating, and to increase our emission-reduction targets every year from now on. While COP26 \</doc>

With renewed COP26 commitments, Airbus, CottonConnect, Earthworm Foundation, Tropical Forest Alliance and World Resources Institute called for collaborative action across supply chains during RSPO's 2021 roundtable conference to achieve positive impact for people and planet. KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Nov. 24,2021 /CNW/ --On 16 November, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) hosted the2021 Virtual Roundtable Conference on the theme of "Climate Resilience: Assuring the Future of Sustainable Palm Oil". The panel brought together leading voices across the agricultural commodities sector to exchange views on some of the thorniest issues in the industry - from climate change to accessible technological innovation to economic inclusion. Collaborative action across supply chains needed to achieve renewed COP26 commitments Panellists opened with their views on COP26 , highlighting that forests and land use have never been more prominent during the summitwhere over 100 world leaders pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. Directly impactingcommodities like palm oil - often seen as a driver of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions - COP26 underscoredthe vital need for solutions like RSPO and other voluntary initiatives. Protecting human rights and labour rightsThe first deep dive addressed the complex issue of human rights and labour rights, where panellists emphasised that human rights and labour rights' violations cannot be separated from environmental issues, and they remain some of the toughest challenges facing agri-commodity industries. Panellists highlighted the importance of standards, such as RSPO's, "as guidancefor a rights-based approach across supply chains,"Janhavi Naidu from the Earthworm Foundation said."We focus on translating the agenda, visions and expectations set by RSPO and similar standards into resources and actionable solutions. This is because actors require guidance, time and investment to be able to scale just labour practices." Echoing this sentiment, Alison Ward from CottonConnect added, "Ensuring just treatment of workers requires strong investment in each step of the supply chain, local intervention and engagement.In the textile sector, this means brands and companies meeting farmers, ginners and spinners to understand their concerns and investing adequate resources to address them." She shared examples of building trust in cotton growing communities in India and Pakistan to ensure that their health and safety needs are met, inspired by similar work in the palm oil sector. Appropriate uses of technologyPanellists also explored the importance of leveraging innovation and technologies to address climate challenges. Technology can help provide greater transparency and traceability in the palm oil supply chain and enable businesses to uphold their sustainability commitments. RSPO has been at the forefront of developing solutions to strengthen the credibility of its certification scheme. Rod Taylor from the World Resources Institute (WRI) cited one example,GeoRSPO, which integrates RSPO concession maps with the Global Forest Watch platform. He explained "Global Forest Watch feeds directly into GeoRSPO by combining satellite imagery and cloud computing to show land use change in a user-friendly manner... it helps companies manage deforestation risk in their supply chain and integrate risk management and reporting into a single system". Wendy Carrara from Airbus elaborated, "We have invested 20 years of research and development on a verification tool that promotes traceability to plantations, raises alerts on deforestation and correlates it with supply chain data. Altogether, thisensures the responsible sourcing of palm oil.Satellite images are analysed using biophysical parameters tocreatea base map against which monitoring can be done at scale and with local precision". Supporting rural livelihoodsThe final deep dive discussion covered how achieving climate resilience through certification like RSPO not only delivers benefits for the planet, but for people too. Achieving climate resilience in the sustainable palm oil sector is not merely an ecological imperative - it can also generate social empowerment by strengthening workforce capacity, creating jobs and fostering economic development. Justin Adams from the Tropical Forest Alliance advocated for integrating livelihoods into climate action: "There is a clear recognition of the importance of the social dimension in achieving environmentalgoals; climate goals are central but just one dimension to optimise. We need ecopreneurs in the landscape to drive real change". Rod continued by highlighting that the big picture solution is to optimise existing resources like land through sustainable practices, stabilise existing resources, and make farming more lucrative, topped with incentives to reward good stewardship. Despite the challenges ahead, the past few years have seen closer integration of environmental and social goals - key to securing a sustainable and resilient future across the palm oil sector. Panellists closed on an optimistic note by saying that organisations like RSPO are critical because they bring communities together to solve problems. "It goes beyond simply increasing the volume of Certified Sustainable Palm Oil and towards creating a sustainable palm oil ecosystem; all of us have a role to play in achievingthis", said Justin. About RSPO:The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) was formed in 2004 with the objective of promoting the growth and use of sustainable oil palm products through credible global standards and engagement of stakeholders. RSPO is a not-for-profit, international, membership organisation that unites stakeholders from the different sectors of the palm oil industry including oil palm producers, palm oil processors or traders, consumer goods manufacturers, retailers, banks and investors, environmental or nature conservation NGOs, and social or developmental NGOs. This multi-stakeholder representation is mirrored in the governance structure of RSPO such that seats in the Board of Governors, Steering Committees and Working Groups are fairly allocated to each sector. In this way, RSPO lives out the philosophy of the "roundtable" by giving equal rights to each stakeholder group, facilitating traditionally adversarial stakeholders in working together to reach decisions by consensus, and achieving RSPO's shared vision of making sustainable palm oil the norm. The seat of the association is in Zurich, Switzerland, while the secretariat is currently based in Kuala Lumpur with satellite offices in Jakarta (ID), London (UK), Zoetermeer (NL), Beijing (CN) and Bogot\'e1 (CO).

Various nations and organizations hosting events at this year's UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow have raised concerns over the high cost of building and renting pavilion space at the COP26 global summit. The cost of renting space is notably higher - an increase by approximately 30% per square meter, according to a UN official - than the previous conference hosted in Madrid pre-pandemic. Labour, supply and materials shortages are said to be the cause of this price hike. Participants were shocked when quoted a large sum for the construction of pavilions. With only a few weeks left, uncertainty looms over whether construction will be finalized in time for the summit. In an interview with the Financial Times( HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/a409fbd0-f0d8-42a7-bf65-5bedeef7c539 ), the World Wildlife Fund, an organization working on reducing human impact on the environment, emphasized that 'the conference was important for influencing policymakers and it was "vital" that all countries as well as civil society groups were represented.' A demonstrator holds up a sign as he attends a Fridays for Future climate strike in Milan, Italy ahead of Glasgow's COP26 meeting The Pacific pavilion garnered much attention in recent years featuring an array of events such as music and dance from the Islands, in addition to informative talks and panel discussions. This year, however, instead of having their pavilion, they will have to resort to a designated space seating about 20 people compared to their usual 100. "It is smaller, much smaller," said Tagaloa Cooper-Halo, director of climate change resilience at the secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Program, to FT. "It is pretty much the same cost as a much larger space in Madrid." 'Thirty years of blah blah blah': Greta Thunberg skeptical about the climate talks in Italy( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/world/thirty-years-of-blah-blah-blah-thunberg-nakata-question-leaders-commitment-at-italy-climate-change-talks https://nationalpost.com/news/world/thirty-years-of-blah-blah-blah-thunberg-nakata-question-leaders-commitment-at-italy-climate-change-talks ) Thunberg says COP26 is time for leaders to be honest( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/pmn/environment-pmn/thunberg-says- HYPERLINK cop26 -is-time-for-leaders-to-be-honest The project manager for the Nordic Council of Ministries, Michael Funch was told by organizers to 'try not to use too many walls because it's going to be really expensive.' While recycling pavilions from previous years is customary, it still may not be enough to cut costs for some groups, since renting ground space significantly increases the finances this year. 'It's really hard for anyone who doesn't have at least over \'c2\£3100,00 to be able to build a pavilion and secure that kind of representation,' he adds. Due to the pandemic, like many other international events and conferences, COP26 was postponed in 2020, which generated a higher demand for pavilion space this year. For countries and organizations who paid the hefty price for their presence, issues arise as construction cannot begin until mid-October when the event space becomes accessible, creating additional hurdles for smaller nations. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

Essity's Tork PaperCircle\£e service recycles used Tork paper hand towels from the conference. PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 15, 2021 /CNW/ --Essity, a leading global hygiene and health company, and maker of the Tork brand, announced Friday that its circular service, Tork PaperCircle, was showcased and used at more than 80 washrooms at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ). This two-week long, global climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland marked a decisive moment for climate action, with a specific focus on scaling circular initiatives to decarbonize the economy and lead the way to tackle climate change. Tork PaperCircle is the world's first circular recycling service for used paper hand towels, turning discarded waste into new tissue products. By implementing Tork PaperCircle throughout COP26 , the conference organizers contributed to a circular society, reducing waste by at least 20%1and cutting carbon emissions from the collected paper hand towels by up to 40%2. While paper hand towels are the preferred method of hand drying3, only 1% are currently recovered for recycling, indicating that paper hand towels remain an untapped opportunity for a circular business model. "In our commitment to climate action, Essity helps our customers, and their waste management teams go circular with our innovative Tork PaperCircle service in select EU countries. We are extremely pleased that Tork PaperCircle was used during COP26 , the world's most important meeting for climate change, and enabled delegates to be part of a circular solution that allows resources to be used efficiently, purposefully and repeatedly," said Don Lewis, President of Professional Hygiene at Essity. Tork PaperCircle now reaches more than 35 million users in over 150 different locations in Europe. The service builds on the dedicated partnerships between customers, waste management companies and Tork. By creating a circular loop for paper hand towels, Essity and Tork are leading the way for industry change. Tork PaperCircle is just one example of Essity's contribution to the climate goals of the Paris Agreement, and as a Global Compact signatory, towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. To drive progress towards these initiatives, Essity has prioritized 6 of the 17 UN Goals, emphasizing a focus on climate action, responsible consumption and production, clean water and sanitation, and more.

GLASGOW, United King-dom  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is push-ing the world to impose a global price on carbon by 2030 that would cover 60 per cent of the planet\' s greenhouse gas emissions. Trudeau spent the second of two days of meetings and negotiations at the United Nations COP26 climate talks Tuesday extolling the virtues of Canada\' s carbon pricing system, and urging the rest of the world to jump on board.  We recognize right now that only about 20 per cent of global emissions are covered by a price on pollution, he said during a speech Tuesday at the climate talks in Glasgow.  We should be ambitious and say as of right here today that we want to triple that to 60 per cent of global emissions should be covered by a price on pollution in 2030. Trudeau assembled a stacked panel to back his call in a morning event on the sidelines of COP26 , which is seen to be a critical juncture for ramping up policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions, if the world is going to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 C above pre-industrial temperatures. Above 1.5 C the impact on the world\' s climate starts to accelerate rapidly, and the higher it gets the more difficult it is to undo. Throwing their weight behind Trudeau\' s ask today were European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, World Trade Organization Director General Ngozi Okonji-Iweala, International Monetary Fund man-aging director Kristalina Georgieva, and UN climate finance envoy Mark Carney, whose influence in the investment world as the former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England is significant. The notion of a global carbon price is not new. The IMF proposed such a system last spring.  The average global price of carbon today is $3, Georgieva said Tuesday.  If we are to make a dent on emissions in a meaningful way to retain our hope for 1.5 degree, close to1.5 degrees Celsius, by 2030 we have to be at $75 or more. She said a minimum global carbon price would first force large emitters to have  compatible pricing of carbon and that the price should be equitable so big emitters and wealthier countries pay more, and less developed and poorer nations pay smaller amounts. Von der Leyen, with whom Trudeau met one-on-one at the G20 leaders\' summit in Rome leading into COP26 , said the European carbon trading market in place since 2005 has had tremendous success lowering emissions from industry and energy and has proven that the economy can grow without emissions growing. \</doc>

MONTREAL GAZETTE Being part of Concordia University's observer delegation at COP26 in Glasgow offered entirely new insights into international diplomacy. While the represented 197 parties attended with both technical and political negotiation teams, the observers were there to maintain a high level of transparency and provide a civil society view to the negotiation process. Daily briefings from the Canadian Climate Action Network CAN-RAC allowed us to understand and interpret the negotiation process, which mostly took place behind closed doors. So, what has been achieved? For the first time a COP has agreed on "phasing down" unabated coal power, meaning coal power use without carbon capture and storage. Fossil fuels were not even mentioned in the Paris agreement, while phasing out all fossil fuels was a big topic in Glasgow, not just in the official negotiations, but also at the People's Summit, led by climate justice, environmental and youth groups. This is extremely important, as fossil fuels are the main cause of the climate emergency. Phasing out fossil fuel production, and fast-tracking progress toward safer and more cost-effective renewable energy alternatives, is a must if we want to prevent further global warming. Among the many announcements of new initiatives at COP26 , banks, other financial institutions and a group of 25 countries made commitments to end the funding of international coal financing by the end of 2022 and instead prioritize support for the clean energy transition. Also, 28 new members signed up to the world's largest alliance on phasing out coal, the so-called Powering Past Coal Alliance. However, we also observed a huge gap between the countries'pledged nationally determined contributions (NDC) for greenhouse gas reduction, and what would be needed to keep the 1.5 degree goal set in Paris. The United Nations's latest assessment of climate plans says pre-Glasgow pledges will result in a 13.7 per cent rise in emissions by 2030 (compared with 2010 levels), by which time we need to halve them! Time is running out, and such large emitters such as India, the world's third-largest emitter, only want to achieve net zero by 2070. On the positive side, India pledged to produce 50 per cent of its energy needs by renewables by 2030. These intermediate goals are very important, as they mean action now. A good outcome of COP26 is that countries need to submit new pledges on GHG reductions by 2022, and not just in five years as specified in the Paris agreement. We also had Premier Fran\'e7ois Legault at COP26 for a few days, and the delegation heads were invited to discuss Quebec policies directly with him. Legault talked about the electrification of transport as a major Quebec innovation area. Quebec also just committed to the end of the extraction of hydrocarbons on its territory, while Canada as a whole is reluctant to do so. However, Quebec's CO2 emissions are still double those of Switzerland, which is at 4.7 tons per capita. And the existing hydro power resources, which provide clean electricity today and are a source of Quebec's pride, cannot provide the missing 60 per cent of the energy needed for transportation and heating that is still fossil today in Quebec. If the province seriously wants to get out of fossil fuels, it is necessary that Quebec implement more renewable energy resources today and encourage demand reduction through higher efficiency. The next decade must be a decade of action and implementation, from new transportation concepts to large-scale building retrofit, new renewable power plants, less polluting industry and more nature-based solutions to absorb at least a part of the emitted carbon. And we need to keep negotiating, and to increase our emission-reduction targets every year from now on. While COP26 \</doc>

The plan shows the trajectory to deliver on the developed countries' goal of mobilizing$100billion per year inclimate finance OTTAWA, ON, Oct. 25, 2021 /CNW/ -Today, the UK COP26 Presidency is publishing the Climate Finance Delivery Plan, to provide clarity on when and how developed countries will meet the $100billion climate finance goal and how the financing will prospectively proceed until 2025. Climate finance plays a critical role in helping developing countries fight climate change and adapt to its impacts. That's why, in 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilize $100billion in climate finance per year by 2020, and in 2015 agreed to extend this goal through to 2025. While developed countries have significantly scaled up their support over the last decade, recent trends show that it is unlikely the $100billion goal was met in 2020. Against this background and with COP26 approaching, the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change,and Jochen Flasbarth, Germany's State Secretary at the Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety, accepted a request from COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma to work together to produce a focused Delivery Plan on the $100billion commitment with the objective of building confidence and trust that developed countries will deliver on their promise. Building on assessments of progress on the $100billion goal to date, the Delivery Plan sets out an estimated trajectory of climate finance from 2021 through to 2025, taking into account new climate finance pledges from individual developed countries and multilateral development banks, as well as collective qualitative actions to improve the delivery of climate finance. Based on the analysis from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of recent climate finance pledges, the forward-looking Delivery Plan shows that developed countries will make significant progress towards the $100billion goal in 2022, and provides confidence that it will be met in 2023. The data also provides confidence that developed countries can mobilize more than $100billion per year thereafter through to 2025. Though it is disappointing that the goal was not met on time, the redoubling or significantly increased efforts from a large number of developed countries including Canada, UK, Germany and others provide important signals of willingness to deliver to developing countries. The vast majority of increased climate finance in the projections comes from public finance. Given that levels of mobilized private climate finance to date have underperformed against expectations, the plan makes clear that more needs to be done in this respect, but does not rely on a significant improvement in this for the goal to be met by 2023. Furthermore, based on consultations undertaken by Minister Wilkinson and State Secretary Flasbarth, additional pledges from developed countries may be expected this year but are not yet ready to be included in the analysis at the time of publishing. These additional pledges are likely to further increase the projections outlined in the report. Individual country pledges to date have been published on the UK COP Presidency's Website. The Plan acknowledges a number of additional issues that developed countries will look to improve in the delivery and mobilization of climate finance to 2025, and lays out a set of guiding principles for collective actions, including increasing financing for adaptation, the need for a reasonable share of grant-financing besides loans, addressing barriers to accessing climate finance, and improving private finance mobilization. Importantly, the Plan states that developed countries will continue to engage with developing countries and other key stakeholders and partners to ensure climate finance is delivered effectively, efficiently, and at scale. The OECD supported the work on this Delivery Plan with its expert analysis that provides aggregate, forward-looking estimates of an increase in climate finance from 2021 to 2025. The co-authors would also like to thank Sweden for its valuable input. Climate finance will be key at COP26 in Glasgow later this month. Providing clarity on the timing and sources of funding is only the first step on the path towards delivery. Robust conversations will continue at COP26 on ways to ensure countries are collectively doing what is needed to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. Quotes "The Delivery Plan sets out how developed countries will deliver the $100billion goal that has long been promised to developing nations. "Scaling up climate finance has been one of my top priorities as COP President. This plan recognises progress, based on strong new climate finance commitments. There is still further to go, but this Delivery Plan, alongside the robust methodological report from the OECD, provides clarity, transparency and accountability. It is a step towards rebuilding trust and gives developing countries more assurance of predictable support. "We can and must do more to get finance flowing to developing nations. So in the lead up to COP26 , it's vital we see further pledges from the donor community and action on key priorities such as access to finance and funding for adaptation." COP26 President-Designate Alok Sharma "It is critically important for developing countries to be able to trust that the developed world will make good on its promises, starting with the $100billion climate finance goal. Earlier this year, Canada doubled its climate finance commitment and is proud to have taken on this leadership role with Germany, at the request of the COP26 President-Designate. While more work needs to be done, I hope that today's report can instill confidence and trust that developed countries will deliver on their promises to the developing world, and that Canada will continue to be a constructive player to this end internationally." The HonourableJonathan Wilkinson, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change "Developing countries have been rightfully disappointed that, so far, developed countries have not delivered on the $100billion promise that was already given in 2009. Hence, I am glad that the process I was honoured to lead jointly with Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has created momentum to help complying with the finance commitment overall in the period up to 2025. We are very aware that also after today's release of the Delivery Plan, a lot of work remains. However, it is my strong hope that with this plan, we can show the international community that developed countries remain committed to deliver on their promises. I can assure you that Germany is strongly committed to the US$100billion target. In 2020, we provided in total EUR7.8billion for international climate finance. We intend to increase the fraction of our climate finance coming from our national budget from EUR4billion in 2020 to prospectively EUR6billion in 2025. Thus, we will continue to provide our share in the years to come." German State Secretary Jochen Flasbarth, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Notes to editors In 2009, developed countries committed to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100billion a year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation. This collective goal was reaffirmed under the Paris Agreement in 2015 as Parties committed to continue delivering on this goal through 2025. In June 2021, the Prime Minister of Canada announced that Canada will double its international climate finance commitment to $5.3billion over the next five years. Canada's increased commitment to climate finance includes an increased focus on adaptation and recognizes that urgent action is needed to address the interconnected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, which disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable. Since 2015, the Government of Canada has invested over $100billion in clean growth. The Government of Canada's existing climate actions put Canada on a path to exceed its previous target and allowed the government to set an ambitious new target of 40% 45%reductions below 2005 levels by 2030 earlier this year. Germany is to become climate neutral by 2045 and has outlined a path to achieve this with binding targets for the 2020s and 2030s. The interim target for 2030, currently 55 percent, is being increased to a 65 percent greenhouse gas reduction compared to 1990. A new interim reduction target of 88 percent has been set for 2040. Climate action efforts up to 2045 will thus be more appropriately distributed across the current and future generations. Germany is moving away from coal during the 2030s. Coal-fired power generation is set to end by 2038 at the latest. By its Climate Change Act Germany has retained the system of year-specific permissible emission levels for the individual sectors for this decade, with these levels significantly reduced. The new German 2030 climate target also takes account of the new, higher EU climate target for 2030, which all member states agreed on at the end of 2020 during Germany's Council Presidency. The EU and its Member States wish to communicate the following Nationally Determined Contribution. The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a binding target of a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. With new 2030 mitigation targets this year from the Canada, Japan and the US, combined with ambitious action from the EU and UK countries accounting for more than half of the world's economy have now committed to the pace of emission reductions required globally to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C. The financial support for international climate action has been consistently increasing and on a high level in recent years. In 2020, Germany provided in total EUR7.83billion for international climate finance. As part of that, Germany was significantly surpassing its pledge to double climate finance from budgetary sources to EUR4billion by 2020. As announced at the G7 summit, Germany also wants perspectively to further increase its climate finance, from 4 to EUR6billion annually by 2025 at the latest. The United Kingdom holds the Presidency of COP26 , this year's international climate meeting and negotiations. Climate finance is one of the four COP26 goals, a key priority for the UK's COP26 Presidency. In 2019, the UK doubled its climate finance commitment to \£311.6billion between April 2021 and March 2026, compared with the previous five-year commitment of \£35.8billion between April 2016 and March 2021. These amounts follow on from the \£33.8billion spent on international climate finance between April 2011 and March 2016.

It's not too early to assess the success or failure of COP26 , the climate summit that began in Glasgow on Oct. 31. The first week, while the heads of state are there, is when all the big promises are announced; the second week is devoted to haggling over the details of the deals. So we already know that it hasn't been an absolute failure. Forty-six countries (not including China, Japan, India, Mexico or Australia) have promised to phase out coal power by the 2030s "or as soon as possible thereafter." The world's biggest and third biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, China and India, pledged to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2060 and 2070 respectively, although the runaway train may have left the station by then. (Most countries'Net Zero commitments are for 2050.) An alliance of more than 90 nations, representing two-thirds of the global economy, committed themselves to reducing methane emissions by at least 30 per cent from current levels by 2030. Only 12 years late, the rich countries said that in another couple of years they will finally keep their promise to provide $100 billion a year to poor countries so they too can play their part in cutting emissions. And more than one hundred leaders agreed to end deforestation by 2030. They even made $19.2 billion available to help developing countries like Brazil and Indonesia meet their commitments on protecting the tropical forests, or what's left of them. Now, it's true that these are all voluntary deals between willing partners. They are not unanimous agreements between all the sovereign parties present at COP26 , so they will not be part of any formal treaty and there is no way of enforcing them. That's well north of the declared target of +1.5 degrees Celsius, and too close for comfort to the 'never exceed under any circumstances'level of +2.0 degrees Celsius. However, the commitments in place before the conference were practically guaranteed to result in an eventual rise of 2.7 degrees Celsius, so it's a better result than most people had expected. That's the good news. Here's the bad news. "Nature," one of the world's most respected scientific journals, did an anonymous survey of the 233 climate scientists who wrote the massive Sixth Assessment Report, which provided the science to which this conference is responding. Sixty per cent of them said that they expect the world to warm by at least 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Only 20 per cent of the scientists said they expect nations to limit global warming to +2 degrees Celsius. A mere four per cent said they thought the world might actually manage to stop the warming at +1.5 degrees Celsius. And 82 per cent of the scientists who replied said they expected to see catastrophic impacts of climate change in their lifetime. I'm not in the least surprised by these responses, because for the past year I've been interviewing climate scientists for a new book and television mini-series I'm working on. In fact, I've spoken to at least a dozen of the same people "Nature" polled, and I'm hearing the same things. They try to stay positive, and they work very hard. There has been an extraordinary expansion in our understanding of how climate has worked in the deep past and how it works right now. There is a cascade of new carbon-neutral energy sources, decarbonising the food system, even taking carbon dioxide and methane back out of the air. But they also remember that on no previous occasion have all the promises and pledges made at these conferences been kept in full and on time. They know that there are still many non-linear unknowns out there that could suddenly make matters much worse. And they know that more than half the anthropogenic carbon dioxide that the human race has put into the air has been emitted since we all learned that we were causing dangerous warming in 1990. I wouldn't even buy a used car from this species, let alone trust them with a planet. So the scientists, and the rest of us too, walk a fine line between hope and despair, with occasional bursts of silent rage. But that is the human condition. \</doc>

With pledges for a United Nations climate conference, the world may be ever so slightly receding from gloomy scenarios of future global warming, according to two new preliminary scientific analyses released last week. The two reports - one by the International Energy Agency and the other by Australian scientists - focused on optimistic scenarios. If all goes right, they said, recent actions will trim two-or three-tenths of a degree Celsius from projections made in mid-October. Instead of 2.1 C of warming since pre-industrial times, the analyses project warming at 1.8 or 1.9 C. Still, both projections leave the world far from the 1.5 C of warming since pre-industrial time that is the goal of the 2015 Paris climate deal. The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius. The UN planned an announcement for Friday afternoon at climate negotiations about how much "actions announced so far at Glasgow helped to bend the curve." "We are now in a slightly more positive outlook for the future," said University of Melbourne climate scientist Malte Meinshausen, whose flash analysis, not peer-reviewed, sees warming at 1.9 degrees, mostly because of late long-term pledges by India and China. "It's still a long way away from 1.5 degrees. We know that some of the ecosystems are going to suffer and we're going to notice, for example, the coral reefs and the Great Barrier Reef here in Australia (die) with these temperature levels," Meinshausen said in an interview. "It is just scraping below two degrees. So therefore there's a lot more to be done." The energy agency analysis factored in India's announcement of short-term carbon dioxide emission curbs and a net-zero pledge by 2070 on Monday, as well as pledges by more than 100 countries Tuesday to reduce the powerful greenhouse gas methane. The intergovernmental agency said it was the first time projections fell below 2 degrees Celsius - a long-standing threshold for tipping points that some scientists say could bring even more dangerous and potentially uncontrolled warming. "If all these pledges were to be implemented, the temperature increase could be limited to 1.8 degrees Celsius. I think this is a very, well-celebrated achievement," agency chief Fatih Birol told leaders at climate negotiations in Glasgow called COP26 . "Congratulations." Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research Director Johan Rockstrom, who wasn't part of either research, said small differences at this temperature level are important: "Every tenth of a degree matters because it gets worse and worse."

LONDON - The COP26 Boris Johnson said Sunday it was impossible for the U.K. to force big polluters to cut their carbon emissions but he insisted that the change in wording from "phasing out" coal to "phasing down" coal did not "make that much difference." However, Johnson acknowledged that the Glasgow Climate Pact was "tinged with disappointment" after several of its key pledges were softened during the talks and the commitments to cut emissions fell short of that needed to restrict global heating to 1.5 C. Climate campaigners have said the change in language, which came after a last-minute deal between China and India, will allow countries to continue using coal indefinitely. "The conference marked the beginning of the end for coal," Johnson insisted. "For the first time ever, the conference published a mandate to cut the use of coal power. "The conference has sounded the death knell for coal power," he declared. Johnson also said it was impossible for the U.K., which acted as the broker for talks in Glasgow, to force other nations to cut their emissions. He said that the COP26 summit, which ended on Saturday night in Glasgow, had reached a "game-changing agreement," and rejected suggestions that it had kicked the can down the road. The deal means the 196 countries will be expected to return next year with new plans to cut emissions before 2030, to keep global warming "well below 2 C." Pledges brought to the summit by world leaders for emissions cuts by 2030 will put the world on track for around 2.4 C, analysts have warned. The U.K. government had made the aim of the Glasgow summit to keep the world on track for warming of just 1.5 C, the preferred aim of the Paris Agreement, which Johnson on Sunday insisted had been achieved. " COP26 was never going to be able to halt climate change," he said. "That was never on the cards." He added: "A fatal mistake would be to think we've cracked this thing." But he said that the mention of coal and fossil fuels in the deal was a historic first, and would prove to be "the beginning of the end" for coal. "Whether the language is 'phase down'or 'phase out'doesn't seem to me as a speaker of English to make that much of a difference. The direction of travel is pretty much the same," he said. China and other major polluters had pushed back on key elements of the talks throughout the two weeks of negotiations. Speaking as the summit ended, Alok Sharma, the COP26 president, said the 1.5 C limit was "alive, but its pulse is weak." The measure of the summit's success will come in what happens in the coming months, and whether big polluters are persuaded to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. It will also depend on whether developing and emerging economies receive enough public and private financing to drive the switch to renewable energy, and to adapt to more extreme weather. Last week, China's daily coal output hit a record 12.05 million tons, and the nation is building coal plants faster than the rest of the world combined. China insists it is moving as fast as it can to cut emissions, and has repeatedly called on developed countries to do more to provide climate financing. China reiterated its position on Sunday that developing countries should not have to move as fast on emissions cuts, in a statement from its environment ministry. India has defended its continued reliance on coal, arguing that it is in a "different" situation from developed countries, many of which rely on oil and gas, including the U.K. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

The first COP1 (Conference of the Parties) on Climate Change was held in 1995 to review emissions inventories submitted by parties. And yet, here we are 26 conferences later actually increasing our GHG emissions. So to date, these conferences have been all talk and no action, or as Greta Thunberg so articulately put it, "You are all still just Blah Blah Blah." We've heard "pledges"from COP26 countries but no specific road map on implementing them. "If these countries want to be taken seriously on their latest announcements, then they should first halt the new fossil fuel projects they are licensing at home, end fossil fuel subsidies and shift the fossil fuel financing to renewables,"Mohamed Adow, director of the Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa, said in a statement on Thursday, Nov. 4th. COP26 countries agree that we're not moving fast enough to reach the targets necessary to stop global warming from accelerating past 1.5 degrees (at which point it will be irreversible and accelerate past 5 degrees). However, best-selling author of the book "A Good War,"Seth Klein provides an optimistic road map on how to reach these targets quickly. All they have to do is follow it. Here is the condensed version of what governments need to do:1. Educate the public that this is truly an immediate Emergency that threatens our very existence unless we adopt a wartime level of mobilization to reduce emissions now. 2. Therefore, every household and institution must be MANDATED to reduce emissions (and how to do it), not voluntarily but with legal regulations. 3. We must LEGIS-LATE a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 for all sectors (ie Ban the sale of gas-fuelled vehicles by 2025 NOT 2035; ban the advertising of fossil fuel vehicles, and ban the use of fossil fuels in all homes and buildings by at least 2040). 4. Appoint a Climate Emergency Cabinet Committee in the PM's office and for each premier to ensure that all institutions are focussed on this national task as their number one priority. 5. Educate and rally the public DAILY to remind them that global warming is an EMERGENCY (with the same deluge of information we are getting about stopping the global Covid-19 pandemic). 6. Spend what's necessary to win this Good War "because if we lose, nothing else matters." (ie. Funding should come from taxing the wealthy, corporations and the sale of Green Victory Bonds.) 7. Undertake massive public investments in climate and social infrastructure. 8. Produce more affordable heat pumps, solar panels, wind turbines and electric buses. I could add a few of my own too, such as legislate that COP26 countries immediately start producing affordable electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that are cheaper to buy than gas-fuelled vehicles. Don't let corporations take their time producing EVs. Speed up production so we see more on car lots in 2022. Klein concludes that fully decarbonizing our economy and society is possible and can be done quickly. We just have to demand it from our three levels of government. More aggressive net zero targets by 2030 should also be possible if we all mobilize as in World War II when Canadians and their governments completely remade the economy-retooling factories, transforming the workforce and uniting for a common cause. We should therefore aim for the maximum ambition. Klein says EVERYONE has to do their bit to reduce emissions and also demand that our three levels of government and every other institution make it their number one priority with wartime urgency with all hands on deck. (I.e. Ask for monthly updates on what government is doing to reduce emissions and what we can do). Klein says "We can do this!"There is power in numbers. So please email your three levels of government TODAY demanding that they follow these 8 steps immediately.

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP)  Detected deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose for the second straight month compared to last year, ending a streak of encouraging data at a moment when the government has promised to curb illegal logging. Satellite alerts of deforestation in October corresponded to 877 square kilometers (339 square miles), the highest indicator for the month in five years and 4.9% more than for the same month in 2020, according to data from the Brazilian space agency\' s Deter monitoring system that were released on Friday. September registered 2.3% more deforestation than the same month last year. That data is considered a leading indicator for complete calculations released near yearend from the more accurate system, Prodes, which is based on clearer images, but which generally tracks with the Deter data.  I haven't seen these numbers, I heard they came out today, but my concentration is here in ( COP26 At the United Nations in September, Bolsonaro credited his administration\' s redoubled efforts for the plunge of alerts the prior month. But the accumulated deforestation in 2021 has been essentially flat compared to last year, according to the preliminary data. Before Bolsonaro took office in 2019, the Brazilian Amazon hadn\' t recorded a single year with more than 10,000 square kilometers of deforestation in over a decade. Between 2009 and 2018, the average per year was 6,500 square kilometers. It averaged 10,500 square kilometers in the first two full years of Bolsonaro's term. Bolsonaro has raised concerns among environmentalists by calling for development within the Amazon region and dismissing global complaints about its destruction as a plot to hold back the nation\' s agribusiness. His administration also has defanged environmental authorities and backed legislative measures to loosen land protections, emboldening land grabbers.  The data from Deter is a reminder that the same Brazil that circulates in the corridors and halls of COP26 , in Glasgow, is the same where land grabbers, illegal loggers and miners have a government license to destroy the forest, the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental groups, said in a statement. \</doc>

XI'AN, China, Nov. 5, 2021 /CNW/ --LONGi founder and president Li Zhenguo has participated in a special company activity at COP26 in Glasgow via online video, outlining LONGi's "Commitment and Action to Address Climate Change" and releasing the company's first White Paper on Climate Action at the China Corporate Pavilion. In 2020, LONGi joined the RE100, EV100 and EP100 in succession, becoming the first Chinese company to join all three initiatives of the Climate Group at the same time. LONGi also joined the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in the same year in response to a CDP climate change questionnaire, which opened the way for the company's involvement in Climate Action. According to its white paper, LONGi is actively fulfilling its commitments and promoting the implementation of the four international initiatives. The company has completed the accounting and verification of greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain for the first time, with the proportion of renewable electricity used in 2020 reaching 41.83%, the equivalent of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1.35 million tons. LONGi's five manufacturing plants in Yunnan Province have in the meantime achieved 100% use of renewable electricity. In accordance with SBTi standards, the company has also submitted its own emission reduction targets for the first time - based on 2020 figures, greenhouse gas emissions within the scope of operation in 2030 will be reduced by 60% and carbon emission intensity per ton of silicon material, per watt of cell and per ton of glass will be reduced by 20%. "LONGi's philosophy on Climate Action corresponds to the four initiatives, which every company must follow, and the advanced presentation of this can be a demonstration and example for the entire renewable energy industry. In the future, the overall thinking behind LONGi's Climate Action will be to refer to the SBTi in order to set emission reduction targets and integrate the promotion of the RE100, EP100 and EV100 initiatives." Li believes that the road to "Net-zero LONGi" will be long and difficult, but the company hopes to use its own actions to show the outside world a successful demonstration of "manufacturing clean energy products using 100% clean energy". The company also looks forward to working with more partners and stakeholders, especially upstream and downstream organisations in the supply chain, to promote global energy transformation, also working with customers from all walks of life to jointly realize the vision of harmonious coexistence between mankind and nature. The COP26 "In the face of an imminent climate crisis, the Paris agreement pointed out the actions necessary for a global green and low-carbon transition, and these are still our guidelines for protecting the earth," Li added. Over the past 10 years, China's photovoltaic industry has made significant progress, enabling people to use renewable energy at a cheaper price, with the "Photovoltaic + Energy Storage + Green Hydrogen" model gradually becoming a powerful weapon against climate change. Glasgow is the third consecutive COP at which LONGi has participated. At COP24 in 2018, LONGi released its "Solar for Solar" sustainable development concept of manufacturing photovoltaic products driven by photovoltaic power generation, with COP25 in 2019 seeing the release of the company's "China PV Outlook 2050" report. LONGi's 'special activity' at COP26 saw guests invited from the Climate Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China, the British Energy Transition Commission (ETC), the British Embassy in China, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Vanke Foundation and the Tencent Company, for in-depth discussion on the actions required of corporate entities to actively respond to climate change.

Young people who attended a recent youth climate conference in Milan, Italy, presented their list of demands for world leaders Monday ahead of a United Nations meeting aimed at trying to avoid environmental devastation. With one week left until some, but not all, world leaders show up in Glasgow, Scotland, to kick off COP26  We're working to ensure that our voices are heard at COP26 , Olivier Nihimbazwe, the delegate for Burundi who attended Youth4Climate last month, wrote on Twitter with a link to the document.  These are concrete proposals based on science, experiences, and aspirations from 400 young leaders from all over the globe. COP  short for Conference of the Parties  brings the world together to hammer out agreements to reduce global warming. It has taken place since 1995. The talks gather policymakers, scientists, environmental activists, climate experts, and news media from the 197 member countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to set and work towards global climate goals. This year, COP26 will take place at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. Youth4Climate's manifesto is a more fulsome version of a statement released soon after the event. It calls on all levels of government all over the world to take specific steps to involve young people in meaningful action on climate change. Its authors push for net-zero emissions by 2030, by which time, the young delegates expect the fossil fuel industry to be abolished via  a complete and systemic phase-out initiated by developed countries, with the provision of support to developing countries to allow for an aspect of equity in the context of a sustainable transition. The document also stresses the need for nature-based solutions to preserve biodiversity and help adapt to climate change, and calculates these efforts could contribute meaningfully to the overall climate solution. Such solutions should always include free, prior, and informed consent, the document says, and significant provisions for losses and damages relating to any projects. It also calls on countries to create permanent representative positions for youth and Indigenous peoples to develop, deploy, monitor, and evaluate climate solutions. Youth4Climate's demands were released on the same day the U.K., which is hosting COP26 , said the world would not meet a promise by rich nations to supply US$100 billion a year in funding to developing countries by 2020, and that it would now work to get there by 2023. Earlier this month, Youth4Climate attendees, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, decried the "30 years of blah, blah, blah" that have come out of climate talks among world leaders. The youth manifesto instead proposes binding, equitable measures going forward. It calls on politicians to ensure inclusive participation in decision-making through legal and policy tools, such as quotas for youth, Indigenous people, and marginalized groups in climate policymaking. Beyond governmental action, Youth4Climate delegates also want to see transformations in entrepreneurship, sports, fashion, the arts, and academia. The manifesto urges athletes to use their platforms to inspire young people to live more sustainably, and for sports teams to drop fossil fuel and mass-polluter advertisers. Meanwhile, the fashion industry should be looking to switch more of its production to materials and practices with a low climate impact, the document says. The manifesto also calls for any and all research directly related to climate change coming out of universities, colleges, and publicly funded research institutes to be made accessible. A major new poll from the UN\' s Development Program (UNDP) released Monday predicted public pressure for bold climate action from the world\' s major economies would likely only strengthen from here on out, with the strongest demands coming from under-18s.  As they come of age, political leaders cannot ignore the higher expectations of this emerging, climate-aware electorate, said Stephen Fisher, a sociology professor at the University of Oxford who took part in the research. The poll quizzed over 689,000 people, including more than 302,000 people under 18, across 18 of the G20 countries from October 2020 until June 2021. It found most under-18s polled believed climate change is a global emergency, with 63 per cent saying so in Argentina and Saudi Arabia and 86 per cent in Italy and the U.K. In most countries, youth are more likely to believe this than adults, with particularly large margins in Australia, the United States, and India (11, 10, and nine percentage points, respectively), it said. The UNDP poll found Canadians among the most supportive on the issue of a climate emergency in the G20, with three-quarters of adults calling it such, along with 83 per cent of Canadian youth. A youth climate strike is set to take place in Glasgow on Nov. 5 while COP26 is underway, after the leaders have left but well before any deal is reached. \</doc>

The road to net zero will be paved with many new emissions reducing technologies that present enormous opportunity for those who rise to the top. The annual Global Cleantech 100 recognizes the most innovative and promising companies that can advance from commitments to actions in efforts to reach net zero. Canada was among the Global Cleantech leaders with 13 companies selected in the 2022 edition, eight of which presented at GLOBE Forum 2022 in Vancouver. We look at those companies in this series of stories. Even as much of the world is clamping down on emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, much remains unknown about its sources. Recent studies indicate emissions are significantly underestimated and, as they originate from a multitude of mostly small sources, difficult to detect. GHGSat Inc. is well on its way to solving the latter challenge. The Montr&eacute;al-based private space company uses its own satellites to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from industrial facilities around the world. &ldquo;We have the world&#39;s only satellites designed for monitoring everything from an individual wellpad up to a landfill or a coal mine. And so for us, it&#39;s all about global transparency in emissions,&rdquo; said GHGSat president Stephane Germain. The company&rsquo;s global reach is making it all but impossible for any emitter, anywhere, to escape scrutiny as new methane emissions reductions pledges come into play. Last year, the company measured 143 million tonnes of methane, in CO2 equivalent GHG emissions, around the world, he said. &ldquo;And that&#39;s just the beginning. Where we go from here is, we&#39;re launching three more satellites this summer, in June, [and] we have another six satellites behind that,&rdquo; Germain told the GLOBE Forum 2022 in Vancouver in March. &ldquo;So we&#39;ll have over 10 operational satellites monitoring the planet every day, everywhere in the world, bringing transparency to emissions, leveling the playing field for everyone &mdash; whether it&#39;s in Canada, United States, Russia, Australia &mdash; anywhere in the world that has a large source of methane emissions, we will see it and we will track it.&rdquo; GHGSat pioneered high-resolution greenhouse gas emissions sensing technology from space with the first sensor, its patented interferometer, designed for small satellites that are increasingly affordable to launch into lower Earth orbit. In merging multiple sources of light, its satellites are able to create an interference pattern which enables the company to measure and pinpoint methane leaks from individual sites, like malfunctioning gas flares or open thief hatches, with precision. That allows for leaks to be identified and repaired quickly. Satellite data can be used by oil and gas companies to more cost-effectively focus maintenance efforts and to support environmental reporting of emissions reductions activity. According to The World Bank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Global Gas Flaring Tracker Report,&rdquo; 142 billion cubic metres of natural gas was flared in 2020, notes GHGSat, which according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) equates roughly to the total natural gas demand of both Central and South America. Global Methane Pledge At the UN Climate Conference COP26 last fall, a global initiative to reduce emissions, known as the Global Methane Pledge, was agreed to cut methane emissions from all anthropogenic sources by 30 per cent below 2020 levels by 2030. As part of its commitment, Canada also pledged to cut oil and gas specific methane emissions, the country&rsquo;s largest source, by 75 per cent by 2030. To date some 111 nations have signed pledge, though some of the biggest emitters including China, India and Russia have yet to sign on. In support of the Global Methane Pledge, the member companies of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) announced in March an aim for zero methane emissions from their upstream operations by 2030. The OGCI includes most of the world&rsquo;s biggest producers, though no Canadian companies have joined the initiative. The International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) initiative was launched on the eve of the COP26 At COP26 GHGSat will share its archive as well as provide new information collected by its satellites. IMEO will integrate this high-resolution data with publicly available satellite emissions datasets to develop new data products that will be made freely available to stakeholders including legislators and climate scientists. The agreement with the IMEO is a huge step in the global fight to tackle climate change, according to the company. &ldquo;No other commercial or government satellite currently in operation today is capable of providing IMEO with comparable facility-level emissions data,&rdquo; said Germain. Tiered approach GHGSat uses data from public satellites to focus its targeted monitoring campaigns on hotspots and precisely pinpoint the facilities responsible. The tiered approach is useful in developing a clearer picture of emission sources and rates. It also uses aerial surveying by aircraft to add another layer of data useful for localized monitoring campaigns. While GHGSat has generated headlines with the detection of super-emitting events in places like Turkmenistanand Pakistan, most of the emissions observed by its satellites are too small to have been detected by other systems. &ldquo;At GHGSat, we see what other satellites can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the company, reporting that in the fourth quarter of 2021, 74 per cent of the emissions detected by its satellites were undetectable by public satellites. That means the monitoring services and the IMEO initiative will always need a layered data approach, it adds. &ldquo;Oil and gas companies need to understand the rate, the volume of methane to work out the most effective mitigation strategy.&rdquo; In February, GHGSat secured a contract with St. John&rsquo;s-basedC-CORE to continue providing ground segment services for its growing satellite constellation. C-CORE owns and operates two ground stations located in the Arctic (Inuvik) and in Northeast Canada (Happy Valley-Goose Bay), developed with GHGSat&rsquo;s requirements in mind, that provide services for remote sensing satellites by communicating tasking information and downlinking resulting data to Earth. The company secured US$45 million in the second tranche ofSeries Bfunding last summer, with investment from Space Capital, OGCI Climate Investments, and Investissement Qu&eacute;bec, to support accelerating the company&rsquo;s growth, allowing it to expand the constellation to a total of 10 satellites by 2023. &ldquo;For us it&#39;s an incredibly exciting time to be where we are. The technology is fully proven, scaled and deploying now globally,&rdquo; Germain concluded. \</doc>

COP26 will be as much about the words as it will be about the numbers. One key goal is for delegates to put the finishing touches on the Paris Rulebook, first advanced in 2015. But given the momentum the climate debate has gained in recent months, COP26 is expected to produce new and renewed commitments to collective action. Still, it&rsquo;s safe to say there will be much debate and discussion to weigh and ponder &mdash; and many numbers to find the right context in which to contemplate them &mdash; as representatives from nearly 200 countries seek consensus on that collective action. Canada is not the world&rsquo;s largest emitter, of course, but it&rsquo;s among the handful of developed countries whose emissions are still growing. And given that reality, there&rsquo;s a heavier burden on Canada to demonstrate a commitment to action perhaps more than most. For Canadians in general, and Albertans in particular, COP26 presents an opportunity to ground Canada&rsquo;s climate efforts in a global context. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to think critically about choices the country needs to make in the swirling complexities of what we now know as a Net Zero world. It&rsquo;s a chance to make sense of the headlines and broadcasts about climate considerations that are now a daily staple of our lives. Net Zero is a term burdened with tremendous responsibilities &mdash; but also tremendous opportunities. Net Zero is about critical choices Canadians will make. It will influence how we vote and how we invest. It will impact the taxes we pay. It will crystalize our sense of environmental responsibility. It will shape our global perspectives as it cracks open the sad realities of energy poverty and energy entitlement. It will mold our thinking generationally. COP26 is an opportunity to put Net Zero into thoughtful context &mdash; and navigationally map out strategic pathways forward. It can be challenging to sort the climate wheat from the climate chaff &mdash; to understand what is true and valid and distinguish it from the politicized and radicalized hyperbole at the fringe. To help Canadians keen to understand what is a highly nuanced issue, we asked nine individuals to share their thoughts in the days leading up to COP26 . Their perspectives will be presented via ourNavigating Net Zeroplatform &mdash; a thought leadership framework created at JWN Energy to curate content related to Canadian efforts on the climate file. The authors were selected because they each offer a different view of how to contemplate climate &mdash; and understand the climate pathways down which Canada and Alberta are already journeying. They represent the policy and innovation ecosystems, as well as the corporate and Indigenous sectors. Our &ldquo;perspectives panel&rdquo; includes:   Marla Orenstein, director, Natural Resources Centre, and Janet Lane, director, Human Capital Centre, Canada West Foundation   Jeanette Jackson, chief executive officer, Foresight Jim Boucher, chair and president, Saa Dene Group Laura Kilcrease, chief executive officer, Alberta Innovates Michael Binnion, chief executive officer, Questerre Energy Corporation and Modern Miracle Network   Steve MacDonald, chief executive officer, Emissions Reduction Alberta Brad Hayes, director, Canadian Society for Unconventional Resources Martha Hall Findlay, chief sustainability officer, Suncor Energy Inc. &ldquo;Net Zero&rdquo; is also tied directly to the concept of energy transition &mdash; another term that bears much responsibility. Like Net Zero, energy transition is &ldquo;social shorthand&rdquo; that is now part of our lives in ways we are only beginning to discern. Like Net Zero, &ldquo;energy transition&rdquo; has the potential to be both unifying and divisive as Canadians face a range of increasingly difficult choices about energy and the climate. Through JWN&rsquo;sNavigating Net Zeroplatform, our goal is to convene conversations that are balanced and constructive &mdash; creating a space that responsibly advances the dialogues central to climate considerations as Canada explores its pathways and possibilities. \</doc>

OTTAWA, ON, Nov. 1, 2021 /CNW/ - This summer, Climate Proof Canada sent a clear message to government: Yes, we need a strong offence against climate change and we must cut carbon emissions. But, we cannot ignore defence any longer. That means acting with urgency to defend lives, health and property from the extreme weather events we're already experiencing. Any acceptable climate plan must aim to both reduce emissions to limit our future risks from climate change, while protecting us from the present worsening severe weather. In other words, adaptation is vital and must feature in any national climate plan. This is Climate Proof Canada's core belief and its reason for forming. The federal government committed to Climate Proof Canada's key recommendations in its recent election promises. Those recommendations are to: Finalize Canada's Adaptation Strategy in 2022, with clear targets. Create a Climate Adaptation Home Rating Program. Implement the National Action Plan on Flooding by completing flood mapping, launching a flood risk portal, introducing affordable flood insurance and funding natural infrastructure. Expand home and commercial retrofit programs to include more climate resilience measures. Expand the office of the National Security and Intelligence Advisor to include climate disasters. Climate Proof Canada's priority now is to ensure that the government acts on these promises to keep our homes and communities safe. Expectations for COP26 Over the next two weeks,a delegation from Ottawa is joining world leaders at COP26 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Climate Proof Canada's expectation is that the Canadian government represented in Glasgow by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well as Ministers Steven Guilbeault and Jonathan Wilkinson will reiterate the importance of climate adaptation and the electoral commitments it has made. These commitments include setting measurable targets for 2030 as part of the Canadian National Adaptation Strategy by the fall of 2022. About Climate Proof Canada The coalition to Climate Proof Canada formed in June 2021 to amplify an urgent message: People in Canada are increasingly vulnerable to severe, climate-influenced weather events. The human, financial, health, and social costs of climate change-induced events continue to escalate, with outsized effects being felt by poor, racialized and Indigenous peoples and other vulnerable communities. The new federal government must bring a sense of urgency to better defend the health and homes of Canadians against the real and growing threats we face today.

The COP26 summit has sounded the "death knell" for coal, the British Prime Minister says, defending the deal against charges that it was significantly watered down by last-minute concessions to China and India. Boris Johnson said Sunday it was impossible for the U.K. to force big polluters to cut their carbon emissions but he insisted that the change in wording from "phasing out" coal to "phasing down" coal did not "make that much difference." However, Johnson acknowledged that the Glasgow Climate Pact was "tinged with disappointment" after several of its key pledges were softened during the talks and the commitments to cut emissions fell short of that needed to restrict global heating to 1.5 C. Climate campaigners have said the change in language, which came after a last-minute deal between China and India, will allow countries to continue using coal indefinitely. "The conference marked the beginning of the end for coal," Johnson insisted. "For the first time ever, the conference published a mandate to cut the use of coal power. "The conference has sounded the death knell for coal power," he declared. Johnson also said it was impossible for the U.K., which acted as the broker for talks in Glasgow, to force other nations to cut their emissions. He said that the COP26 summit, which ended on Saturday night in Glasgow, had reached a "game-changing agreement," and rejected suggestions that it had kicked the can down the road. The deal means the 196 countries will be expected to return next year with new plans to cut emissions before 2030, to keep global warming "well below 2 C." Pledges brought to the summit by world leaders for emissions cuts by 2030 will put the world on track for around 2.4 C, analysts have warned. See COP26 " COP26 was never going to be able to halt climate change," he said. "That was never on the cards." He added: "A fatal mistake would be to think we've cracked this thing." But he said that the mention of coal and fossil fuels in the deal was a historic first, and would prove to be "the beginning of the end" for coal. "Whether the language is 'phase down'or 'phase out'doesn't seem to me as a speaker of English to make that much of a difference. The direction of travel is pretty much the same," he said. China and other major polluters had pushed back on key elements of the talks throughout the two weeks of negotiations. Speaking as the summit ended, Alok Sharma, the COP26 president, said the 1.5 C limit was "alive, but its pulse is weak." The measure of the summit's success will come in what happens in the coming months, and whether big polluters are persuaded to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. It will also depend on whether developing and emerging economies receive enough public and private financing to drive the switch to renewable energy, and to adapt to more extreme weather. Last week, China's daily coal output hit a record 12.05 million tons, and the nation is building coal plants faster than the rest of the world combined. China insists it is moving as fast as it can to cut emissions, and has repeatedly called on developed countries to do more to provide climate financing. China reiterated its position on Sunday that developing countries should not have to move as fast on emissions cuts, in a statement from its environment ministry. India has defended its continued reliance on coal, arguing that it is in a "different" situation from developed countries, many of which rely on oil and gas, including the U.K. Sharma insisted that China and India would "have to explain themselves" on the world stage when it came to justifying their continued use of coal. The outcome of the talks has done enough for Johnson to claim credibly to have pulled off the challenge of getting 196 parties to form a consensus around tackling climate change.

GATINEAU, QC, Oct. 31, 2021 /CNW/ - Six years ago, the world came together to sign on to the Paris Agreement. The science says that in order to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach and avert the worst impacts of climate change, the world needs to do more, and on a faster timeline. That is why Canada will join over 190countries in GlasgowforCOP26 and whyCanadahas significantly increased its climate targets and climate actions since the coming into force of the Paris Agreement. The conference runs from October31 to November12, 2021, in Glasgow, UnitedKingdom(UK). Prime Minister Trudeau will lead Canada's delegation for the World Leaders Summit on November1 2. Minister Guilbeault of Environment and Climate Change Canada will lead the delegation for the Ministerial segment of COP26 and will be on the ground in Glasgow from November1 to 12, 2021. COP26 is the highest profile United Nations climate change conference since 2015, when the Paris Agreement was reached. This year, the world must demonstrate and build trust around how it will collectively deliver on the promises outlined in the Paris Agreement. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,Boris Johnson, who is hosting COP26 , noted at pre-COP that despite the severity of the climate crisis, rapid change is still possible, and that COP26can and should mark the beginning of the end of climate change. Canada is committed to doing its part to deliver the ambitious climate action that the world wants, and needs. Canada alsohopes to build trust, raise global ambition, and advocate for concrete action by all. Canada has taken steps to ensure diverse perspectives are reflected in international forums. Canada's delegation for COP26 will include representatives of federal opposition parties, representatives of provinces and territories, including Ministers of the Environment and Premiers, as well as National Indigenous Organizations and Representatives (NIORs). The delegation will also include youth, civil society, business, labour, and Canadian municipalities. The Canadian delegation will be posted on the UNFCCC's websitein the near term. Quote "We have reached a global crisis point when it comes to our climate and our planet's biodiversity. Devastating heat waves, floods, and forest fires are on the rise, and Canada is warming at twice the global average. We are heading to Glasgow with a strong plan for the future backed by solid action already under way at home. Importantly, we are also headed there with an understanding that more action must be taken, backed by both the will and the mandate from Canadians to get the job done." The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts Since signing the Paris Agreement in 2015, the Government of Canada has invested over $100 billion in clean growth. Canada has also brought forward a series of other incentives and regulations, including a world-leading carbon pricing and rebate system, regulations to accelerate the phase-out of coal, and economy-wide standards for cleaner fuels. If all G20 countries adopted these three policies alone, the world would be well on its way to net zero by 2050. A priority for both Canada and the UK, as COP26 President, is international climate finance, including achieving the US$100 billion goal through 2025. Earlier this year, Canada announced a doubling of its previous climate finance contribution from $2.65 billion to $5.3 billion over the next five years and accepted an invitation from the UK COP26 President Designate to co-lead a process with Germany to build trust that developed countries will stand by their pledges and deliver on the US$100 billion climate finance goal through to 2025. The Delivery Plan, announced on October 25, 2021, provides clarity on when and how the US$100 billion goal will be met. Under the Paris Agreement, countries are required to submit national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), every five years. Each successive NDC is required to be more ambitious than the previous one. Early this year, Canada announced its enhanced NDC to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. With new 2030 mitigation targets this year from Canada, Japan, and the US, combined with ambitious action from the EU and UK, countries accounting for more than half of the world's economy have now committed to the pace of emission reductions required globally to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C. Ahead of COP26 , Canada developed and passed legislation that puts its climate goals, including net zero by 2050, into law. Earlier this month, Canada announced its support for the Global Methane Pledge, which aims to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. Canada has also set the global pace by becoming the first country to commit to reducing methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by at least 75 percent from 2012 levels by 2030.

SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC SE ("SBGSF,SBGSY-0") - Releases Key Report on Climate Change as Part of COP26 Engagement Schneider Electric, the leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, is actively supporting global climate change efforts at the upcoming COP26 meeting, with experts on the ground and the release of a flagship report that offers fresh perspectives on our planet's pathway to decarbonization. The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) taking place in Glasgow on 31 October - 12 November is widely considered critical to accelerating global action to tackle the climate emergency. Many climate experts, campaigners, and corporates including Schneider Electric are urgently calling on governments, businesses and societies do much more - and act much faster - to ramp up the adoption of clean-energy, electrification, energy-efficiency and other climate-positive technologies. "We welcome the commitments already made by numerous governments around the world, and hope that COP26 Ranked the world's most sustainable corporation by media and research company Corporate Knights earlier this year, Schneider Electric helps customers reduce their carbon footprints via products and software tools that optimize energy management and industrial processes. The company has a decades-long track-record of spearheading and advocating action on environmental, social and governance issues, and recently announced it is also expanding its sustainability consulting practice. To coincide with COP26 , the Schneider Electric TM Sustainability Research Institute is releasing a major new report on how we could achieve net-zero by 2050 and limit global warming to the critical 1.5C threshold. Entitled "Back to 2050" and conducted with energy intelligence company Enerdata, it assesses the long-term impact on energy usage and associated CO2 emissions of changing social expectations and up-and-coming, disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving, decentralized clean-energy generation, smart EV charging stations in buildings and the use of more digital tools in infrastructure construction, among others. "Our key finding is that changing consumption patterns, driven by an appetite for the progress that new technologies herald, will help bring about a less carbon-intensive economy. In other words, keeping global warming to 1.5C may be more feasible than we think, because as the economy modernizes and provides increased benefits to people, it also decarbonizes," says Vincent Petit, Head of the Schneider Electric TM Sustainability Research Institute and SVP of Global Strategy Prospective and External Affairs at Schneider Electric. "What we need, however, is to accelerate this trend by shifting the policy focus from being purely infrastructure-centric to being more consumer-centric." While in Glasgow, Schneider experts will meet customers and business partners to help them better understand the tools that already exist to help decarbonize infrastructure, buildings, data centers, industries, and cities. They will also participate in panels and roundtables with artists, campaigners, climate scientists, policy makers, influencers, entrepreneurs, and innovators such as Bertrand Piccard, Founder and Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, which is supported by the Schneider Electric Foundation. The Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France, will also work with Art of Change 21 to highlight the important role that artists play in the ecological transition by mobilizing youth and creating a dialogue between art, technology, innovation and climate.

Glasgow will host COP26 from Sunday until Nov. 12, where UN leaders and activists gather to determine their evolving response to the climate crisis. It's an unparalleled opportunity for climate action, and has resulted in victories and disappointment over its previous 25 iterations. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, playing host, hopes for a success, but COVID-19 has already wreaked havoc on logistics. Designed to attract 20,000 visitors last year, organizers delayed the summit, cancelled events and postponed meetings. Greenpeace, along with 1,500 other groups, have ridiculed Johnson's government for vaccine requirements that disproportionately exclude representatives from the Global South. The chaos has left young voices unheard, and despite applause and awards for their activism, youth will have little representation on Glasgow's powerful floors. The strategy undervalues the knowledge, innovation, and dedication of youth today. Though we weren't conscious when treaties were decided, we've grown educated on their contents. We have been active, disobedient and organized in our attempts to impact decisions that regularly block us out. The massive uptake has turned "Climate Strikes" and "Fridays for Future" into common terms. We changed the language and intensity with which the crisis is discussed, and today's debates on climate finance and #BuildingBackBetter may not have arisen without youth work. Regardless of success, the progress of global action is inextricably tied to the actions of progressive youth. This movement was largely organized by young leaders who compensate political inexperience with visibly genuine zeal. Their faces and stories encourage, if not loyalty, respect and imitation. Just Google their names to see why governments have responded now after decades of inaction: Joshua Amponsem in Ghana, Licypriya Kangujam in India, Xiye Bastida in Mexico and New York and legions more. By boxing these young leaders out of Glasgow's deliberations, COP risks ignoring impactful ideas from a movement of which Greta Thunberg is just the tip of the melting iceberg. Alok Sharma, the president of the COP26 summit, recently responded to criticism about representation. "Ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change are heard is a priority for the COP26 presidency," he announced, "and if we are to deliver for our planet, we need all countries and civil society to bring their ideas and ambition to Glasgow." It's a worthy goal; and one that youth are pursuing. Throughout October, virtual summits gathered hundreds of young activists across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to deliberate on policy that addresses the climate crisis while uplifting youth populations. It builds on other conferences like Milan's Youth4Climate summit. Their findings will be put to those in attendance on Nov. 5, COP's International Youth Day, at a global panel to discuss how the ideology of these young leaders can evolve into action. Dominique Souris, recently named one of Canada's top 25 environmentalists, leads the organization with Youth Climate Lab and the Green Africa Youth Organization. Both teams are led and staffed by youth from across the globe, and is being funded by Canada's International Development Research Centre. Panellists have experienced the climate crisis on its front line. They draw from developing nations that are already witnessing devastation caused by climate change. Hurricanes, famine and floods today devour their earnings while destroying their homes. And the future is threatening. Youth have responded by demanding leaders address the climate crisis while improving living standards. They are calling for renewable energy, green jobs and climate finance that open up new opportunities to strengthen economic security while accelerating climate action. But a global movement is nothing without connections to the levers of power. COP's real impact stems from connecting leaders with the activists who tirelessly sit down, march, and march again. For their partnership to succeed, events like that taking place on International Youth Day must make waves well beyond International Youth. If COP's leaders hope to make a difference for the future, it will have to be informed, right now, by future leaders. The climate will not wait for them to age.

LONDON - The G20 group of leading economies must come forward with more ambitious 2030 climate action plans, Britain's Alok Sharma, president of the upcoming United Nations COP26 climate change conference, will say on Tuesday. With less than a month before the talks begin in Glasgow, Scotland, Sharma will seek to increase pressure on those who have yet to enhance national goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions under plans known as "Nationally Determined Contributions" that are central to the 2015 Paris Agreement. "Responsibility rests with each and every country. And we must all play our part. Because on climate, the world will succeed, or fail as one," he will say, according to advance extracts of a speech. COP26 , which begins on Oct. 31, aims to secure more ambitious action from the nearly 200 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2.0 degrees Celsius - and preferably to 1.5C (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) - above pre-industrial levels. " COP26 "It is leaders who made a promise to the world in this great city six years ago. And it is leaders that must honor it." Sharma will also be clear that there must be new commitments on public and private finance to support the countries most vulnerable to climate change and progress on adaptation to the effects of the changing climate, his office said.

(Bloomberg) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed he'll attend the COP26 climate summit, raising prospects for the laggard nation to finally commit to a 2050 net-zero emissions target. Australia, one of the world's top fossil fuel exporters, has trailed Group of 20 nations in failing to set a formal goal and Morrison has come under pressure from the U.S. and U.K. Morrison had also previously been reluctant to confirm his attendance at the Glasgow talks, citing a desire to avoid Covid quarantine on his return. "Net zero was an outcome that I outlined at the beginning of this year, consistent with our Paris agreement," Morrison said at a press conference on Friday, adding that his government would flesh out its policy position ahead of the global talks. "The challenge is not about the if and the when, it is about the how." Morrison's decision to travel comes as prospects for the talks are clouding and with key leaders including China's President Xi Jinping and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro now expected to skip the summit. Nations in Europe to Asia are also ramping up production of coal and other fossil fuels to navigate a global squeeze on energy supply, potentially undermining plans for new targets to accelerate a transition to cleaner alternatives. Read more: Energy Crisis Adds New Hurdle to COP26 Goal of Ending Coal Chinese officials have informed G-20 envoys that Xi does not currently plan to attend a summit in Italy later this month in person, and diplomats have said that means he's unlikely to go to COP26 either. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry has already downplayed hopes of success, saying nations could fall short of a new agreement on more aggressive action on global warming. Australia's Morrison said emissions reduction policies should not come at the expense of growth and jobs. His government's junior coalition partner, the National Party, is a strong supporter of the coal industry and has so far been opposed to a net-zero target, citing potential risks to the economy.

CARBON STREAMING CORP ("NETZ-Z") - Comments on Near-Term Cash Flow, Carbon Credit Sales, COP26 Carbon Streaming Corporation ("Carbon Streaming" or the "Company") is pleased to comment on the existing carbon streaming investments in our portfolio and the strong demand and surging prices in the voluntary carbon markets for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) carbon credits. In addition, the Company would like to congratulate the almost 200 countries that came together for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (" COP26 ") that reinforced a global commitment to adaptation, mitigation, finance mobility and collaboration, all key actions to address climate change. Commercial Highlights //st  Carbon Streaming expects to receive up to 7 million Verra registered REDD+ carbon credits in the first half of 2022 (" COP26 Highlights: //st  After 6 years, an agreement on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the rules governing global trading in offsets, has been reached. This is expected to bring greater transparency, rigor and buyer confidence to the voluntary carbon markets.  Over 100 nations agreed to a non-binding pact to end deforestation by 2030.  A declaration was signed by 23 parties on International Aviation Climate Ambition seeking to ensure maximum efficacy of CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). "In conjunction with global talks on climate change at COP26 , significant upward momentum in prices and the exponential growth of the voluntary carbon markets, we are seeing incredibly strong interest in our portfolio of high-quality nature-based carbon offsets," stated Justin Cochrane, Carbon Streaming's CEO. "It's important to remind investors that we're expecting the issuance of up to 7 million REDD+ credits in the first half of 2022 from our current carbon credit streaming investments." Mr. Cochrane continued: "With current prices in the US$13-$14/credit range for REDD+ carbon credits and the strong upward pricing momentum we are seeing, Carbon Streaming expects the credits delivered under these streams to benefit from increasing price and demand which should, in turn, generate substantial cash flow to the Company and our strategic partners."

A cynic, wrote the Irish wit Oscar Wilde, is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. But at COP26 A global pricing mechanism for carbon dioxide emissions could make polluters, and maybe their customers, acknowledge and pay the full environmental cost of the oil and gas that drives the wheels of industry and the lifestyles of many consumers. Many countries have committed to a goal of "net zero" emissions by 2050 to avert the worst of global warming. But without putting a price on CO2, it is hard for governments to force polluters to cut emissions without disadvantaging them unfairly, for investors to assess their risks, or for companies to know what costs lie ahead. "Please put a price on carbon!" was the plea https://reut.rs/3iFsmP8 to COP26 from Francesco Starace, chief executive of Enel , Europe's biggest utility, speaking on Tuesday at the Reuters Impact conference. COP26 aims to secure far bolder action from the nearly 200 countries that signed the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius, and a global carbon price is one of the mechanisms they hope will help achieve that. Bob Dudley, former head of oil company BP and now chair of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative trying to help the fossil fuel industry decarbonise, said a proper valuation of emissions was one of his group's five main goals. Theodor Swedjemark at European power engineering group ABB said "aligning carbon-based trade policies" was one of the business community's main requirements from COP26 . The need is clear. The European Union, where a tonne of carbon dioxide on its Emissions Trading System costs about 60 euros ($69), plans to introduce a carbon levy on imports to shield its own industry from competitors whose emissions are taxed less heavily. The World Bank says only 22% https://reut.rs/3iFq0Qp of global emissions were covered by pricing mechanisms last year and the International Monetary Fund put the average global price at a mere $3 a tonne. Yet the OECD estimates that a price of $147 is needed before 2030 to create enough economic incentives for producers and users of fossil fuels to slash emissions to net zero by 2050. WHOSE PRICE? The challenge of finding a solution at COP26 that can work on an agreed basis for industrialized and developing economies alike will be huge. "We have to apply carbon pricing as part of our economics," Tengku Muhammad Taufik, chief executive of Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, said at the Reuters conference. But he noted that carbon was priced at only about $5-10 a tonne in southeast Asian economies, compared with over $130 in Sweden at the other end of the spectrum. "One of the key things at ... COP26 ... is going to be a need to standardize, to verify, to account for this." Starace said the important thing was to get started. "Put the price on carbon in your own territory ... and then worry about how that carbon price relates to the other carbon prices," he said. "But price it - because if you start with that, then this will finally adjust." Institutional investors and asset managers would also welcome https://reut.rs/3AiAXgS any progress. They are already having to create tools to assess the growing environmental risks to their investments, from climate disasters to new regulations, to "stranded" fossil-fuel assets that may never be recovered and shifting consumer sentiment. At least now, especially after a series of violent weather events showed the dramatic effects of climate change, there is little argument that saving the planet is as much an economic imperative as an environmental ideal, investors say. "It became quite simple for us when we started to see that climate change is a risk to our ability to deliver on our financial commitments," said Morten Nilsson, chief executive of BTPS, Britain's largest private-sector pension scheme with over 50 billion pounds ($68 billion) of assets. "Actually, we see opportunities in this change to a low-carbon economy ... and if we don't attack those the right way, we could be a loser instead of a winner." As Wilde might say: not just a price, but also a value.

Right now, senior political officials from nations around the world are at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland. This Conference of the Parties (COP for short) is the 26th annual meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). There's a lot at stake with COP26 , so I asked three local experts for their perspectives on COP26 and why it matters both globally and locally. Hill shared an analogy to explain this. Think of the entire planet as a bathtub that can only hold so much greenhouse gas emissions before it overflows into dangerous territory. That overflow point is 1.5 to 2 C of global warming. "There are two parts to preventing dangerous global warming," Hill said. "First, we have to stabilize the GHG level in the bathtub by reducing the flow to a trickle. The modelling shows we must act now: that means reducing emissions at least 45 per cent below 2010 levels as soon as possible, ideally by 2030." "The second part is figuring out how to drain the bathtub," explains Hill. "Reducing emissions to near zero is crucial, but not enough by itself. That net-zero target requires capturing and storing significant amounts of carbon, both with natural and technological solutions." The intention of the 2015 Paris Agreement (COP21) was for each nation to commit to reductions that they felt they could achieve, not to stabilize GHG levels globally. Brace yourself: here comes some doom and gloom. The global flow of GHGs into the atmospheric bathtub continues to increase - even during COVID-19 - and has increased every year since the 1992 UNFCCC agreement was signed. Today, world leaders are gathering at COP26 to evaluate the progress of each nation and set another round of ambitious reductions targets. "Even with our late start, it will take time to turn a big ship like our energy system around," Hill points out. "Emissions don't go down that quickly. What we need to see first are domestic policies and accountability measures that back up the commitments nations make at the COP." "The Paris Agreement, along with public pressure and youth activism, acted as a catalyst for recent political action," observes Hill. "In the last five years, climate politics have changed tremendously in Canada. For the first time, we now have credible policies and plans." "The plans that the Canadian government has put forward in the last year aren't perfect, but they're the first I've seen with any kind of teeth," observes Stephanie Rutherford, associate Professor in the Trent School of the Environment. "We need to be asking for real, measurable targets, enforcement mechanisms," continues Rutherford, "and plans for ratcheting down emissions throughout the course of the policy over many years. There are also lots of environmental non-governmental organizations, like GreenUP, that have decades of experience and knowledge on these issues that the government could leverage going forward." Rutherford's research focuses on environmental justice and multi-species perspectives. While previous COPs have tended to overlook the importance of habitat and ecosystem protection and restoration, this year's COP looks different. "The climate crisis is not separate from the biodiversity crisis," explains Rutherford. "These are interlinked crises. You can't have a conversation about climate change without also talking about habitat loss and mass extinction." "The stakes are high for Canada," emphasizes Rutherford. "Climate change is an issue not only of the environment and the economy, but also of justice and equity. First Nations people in Canada have disproportionately felt the impacts of climate change, and there is a lot at stake in the relationship between climate change and reconciliation." "Canada was once known as an environmental leader, but no more," continues Rutherford. "We take a lot of body blows at these COPs because we make big promises but with almost no follow-through. The world is waiting to see us actually act. It will not be easy. There are jurisdictional disputes with some provinces. Historically, Canada has also not pursued the kind of policies that prioritize habitat protection, ecosystem integrity, and treaty rights before resource extraction. We have work to do." Like Canada, Peterborough (once the "Electric City") likes to stake claim to a reputation for innovation and environmental leadership. "As a community, we should be thinking about how we will live in this changing world, in a low-carbon economy," emphasizes Hill. "We should be anticipating what this means for jobs, businesses, housing, education systems, and transportation systems. There are pockets of truly amazing leadership in Peterborough, but we are falling behind other communities." One of those pockets of amazing leadership is the Endeavour Centre, the Sustainable Building School. "I am most excited and also most frustrated about the potential of the building industry for emissions reductions," shares Chris Magwood, founder of the Endeavour Centre. "There's so much talk about incremental reductions in emissions over decades, but with buildings it could be way more than incremental. We could literally - right now in the next few years - reverse the climate impact of buildings." " COP26 COP26 . For decades, the Endeavour Centre has been trying to demonstrate the potential of low-carbon building approaches. The new Forensic Crime Scene Building at Trent University is a net-zero, carbon storage building. This and other local projects are world-leading demonstrations of what's possible right now. These approaches exist, but it seems people do not recognize them as the major precedent-setting examples that they truly are." "While building codes are written at a national level, I think municipalities are going to end up being the leaders in this area," observes Magwood. "Duoro-Dummer had the very first low-carbon building incentive program in North America. The Endeavour Centre is working with Nelson in B.C. right now on something like that. We start working next month with Vancouver and Toronto looks on the verge of doing something. Municipalities don't have power over building codes, but there seems to be the most willingness to move quickly at that level." "I would hope that politicians start to see the potential for becoming the world leader in manufacturing biogenic building materials," suggests Magwood. "Canada is rich in all the best sources of raw materials, and most of these resources are available in rural areas like Peterborough. We are smart enough to manufacture here. We just need the push to do it and scale it up. There's a compelling economic and environmental case for doing this."

Global activist network says UN talks cannot now be held safely  UK has promised vaccines in time, will cover quarantine costs  Campaigners say COP26 must be inclusive for 'credible' outcome By Beh Lih Yi KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - N ovember's COP26 U.N. climate summit should be postponed, as an inclusive and safe event has become "impossible," with delegates from poorer nations struggling to access vaccines and pay rising travel costs, a network of more than 1,500 groups said Tuesday. Civil society activists from many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America have raised concerns about getting COVID-19 vaccines in time and expensive quarantine costs ahead of the key COP26 climate talks, scheduled from Oct. 31-Nov. 12 in Scotland. The logistical challenges have thrown their attendance into doubt and Britain as the host nation has so far failed to provide adequate support, said Climate Action Network (CAN) International, which has members in more than 130 countries. "Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks," said CAN executive director Tasneem Essop. "There has always been an inherent power imbalance within the U.N. climate talks and this is now compounded by the health crisis," she added in a statement. South Africa-based Essop called for the negotiations to be postponed until there can be "fair participation from the Global South under safe conditions." CAN did not suggest alternative dates. Meaningful representation of those on the frontlines of worsening extreme weather and rising seas is key to securing a "credible" outcome at COP26 , CAN said. Despite calling for a postponement, CAN said urgent climate action must continue and insisted it was not asking for a boycott of the talks. Alok Sharma, the UK official who will preside over the COP26 talks, said on Tuesday London was "working tirelessly" with partners, including the United Nations and Scottish government, to ensure an "inclusive, accessible and safe summit" in Glasgow. He said for the first time that Britain would fund required quarantine hotel stays for delegates arriving from so-called "red list" countries, on top of an earlier offer to vaccinate those who cannot otherwise get inoculated against COVID-19. " COP26 "Ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change are heard is a priority for the COP26 Presidency, and if we are to deliver for our planet, we need all countries and civil society to bring their ideas and ambition to Glasgow," he added. 'RED LIST' QUARANTINE British officials have insisted the COP26 summit - billed as the last, best chance to galvanize the action needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius - will be inclusive despite ongoing uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic. Britain has said it wants to push forward work on issues that are a high priority for poorer nations suffering climate change impacts, including finance for measures to adapt. Climate campaign groups, however, have criticized the British government for moving too slowly on its offer to vaccinate delegates. In response, the UK said last week it was "on track" to support all those who had requested vaccines ahead of COP26 , with the first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine it has shipped to be administered from this week. First doses of the vaccines would be given by mid-September, with the second doses due in mid-October, to allow a two-week period for the vaccine to become fully effective, it added. Many developing nations are also on the so-called "red list" of Britain's "traffic-light" system for international travel, meaning participants will be required to quarantine in hotels before attending COP26 , whether vaccinated or not. Accommodation during the summit is also cripplingly expensive in Glasgow, while uncertainty over whether delegates can attend the event is likely to hike travel costs, many said. Meena Raman, head of programs at the Malaysia-based Third World Network, which advocates for climate justice but is not part of CAN, said it was already a huge challenge for officials and campaigners in the Global South to participate in the U.N. talks, even before the coronavirus pandemic. "This time around it's much worse because of the vaccine inequity. The pandemic is a huge challenge - many of us are very concerned about attending," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding she had decided not to travel to Glasgow. In addition, climate activists have demanded that Britain and other wealthy governments loosen intellectual property rules on COVID-19 vaccines to boost production and distribution of the life-saving jabs across the board in poorer countries. Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a key broker of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, said G20 nations should show solidarity and share vaccines equitably with the Global South, beyond just offering them to COP26 participants. "The right to health and concern for fellow humans lie at the heart of the Paris Agreement - no one is safe until everyone is safe," she added.

Climate Action Muskoka (CAM) and RTOERO (formerly the Retired Teachers of Ontario) have provided bookmarks and a companion climate curriculum to teachers and students in Muskoka schools to spread awareness of ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "We hope that students will take the ideas home and encourage their families to take up the challenge to reduce their GHG emissions,"said CAM member Len Ring. This project was approved by the Trillium Lakelands District School Board and the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board. CAM's Community Carbon Challenge provides the content and re- sources for both the bookmarks and the curriculum, and highlights simple everyday actions that individuals and families can take to lower their carbon footprints. You can find the challenge at: HYPERLINK http://www.climateactionmuskoka.org www.climateactionmuskoka.org A study of youth around the globe, released in Britain last summer prior to the global COP26 Climate Summit, reveals that young people are feeling helplessness and despair about the climate crisis. It identified the source of their anxiety as adults not taking the actions required to protect their future. The bookmark project in Muskoka provides the opportunity to enhance family discussions that focus on solutions, starting with indi- vidual actions. Last summer, CAM and RTOERO jointly distributed 7,000 bookmarks in Muskoka communities through local businesses, libraries and other organizations. They intend to do the same this year.

SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC SE ("SBGSF,SBGSY-0") - Schneider Electric Releases Key Report on Climate Change - As Part of COP26 Engagement  New Schneider Electric report outlines "Back to 2050" decarbonization scenarios  Schneider experts on the ground in Glasgow to advance decarbonization insights and solutions with business partners, climate experts and influencers Schneider Electric, the leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, is actively supporting global climate change efforts at the upcoming COP26 meeting, with experts on the ground and the release of a flagship report that offers fresh perspectives on our planet's pathway to decarbonization. The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) taking place in Glasgow on 31 October - 12 November is widely considered critical to accelerating global action to tackle the climate emergency. Many climate experts, campaigners, and corporates including Schneider Electric are urgently calling on governments, businesses and societies do much more - and act much faster - to ramp up the adoption of clean-energy, electrification, energy-efficiency and other climate-positive technologies. "We welcome the commitments already made by numerous governments around the world, and hope that COP26 Ranked the world's most sustainable corporation by media and research company Corporate Knights earlier this year, Schneider Electric helps customers reduce their carbon footprints via products and software tools that optimize energy management and industrial processes. The company has a decades-long track-record of spearheading and advocating action on environmental, social and governance issues, and recently announced it is also expanding its sustainability consulting practice. To coincide with COP26 , the Schneider Electric TM Sustainability Research Institute is releasing a major new report on how we could achieve net-zero by 2050 and limit global warming to the critical 1.5C threshold. Entitled "Back to 2050" and conducted with energy intelligence company Enerdata, it assesses the long-term impact on energy usage and associated CO(sub)2(/sub) emissions of changing social expectations and up-and-coming, disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving, decentralized clean-energy generation, smart EV charging stations in buildings and the use of more digital tools in infrastructure construction, among others. "Our key finding is that changing consumption patterns, driven by an appetite for the progress that new technologies herald, will help bring about a less carbon-intensive economy. In other words, keeping global warming to 1.5C may be more feasible than we think, because as the economy modernizes and provides increased benefits to people, it also decarbonizes," says Vincent Petit, Head of the Schneider Electric TM Sustainability Research Institute and SVP of Global Strategy Prospective and External Affairs at Schneider Electric. "What we need, however, is to accelerate this trend by shifting the policy focus from being purely infrastructure-centric to being more consumer-centric." While in Glasgow, Schneider experts will meet customers and business partners to help them better understand the tools that already exist to help decarbonize infrastructure, buildings, data centers, industries, and cities. They will also participate in panels and roundtables with artists, campaigners, climate scientists, policy makers, influencers, entrepreneurs, and innovators such as Bertrand Piccard, Founder and Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, which is supported by the Schneider Electric Foundation. The Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France, will also work with Art of Change 21 to highlight the important role that artists play in the ecological transition by mobilizing youth and creating a dialogue between art, technology, innovation and climate. Note to Editors: The Schneider Electric (TM) Sustainability Research Institute is the internal strategy think tank of Schneider Electric.

LONDON, Nov. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Billed as a "call to action" from the global private sector involved in forest management and timber production, the Tropical Timber Accord - "Global Forests need Global Governance( HYPERLINK https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=opqLo98KHEwfJgboUXTaBd134SWVXuNYbwUFpVMg6vp7eKYqNFuey8JdFSTmSJ7-LZ-HPNQyLhjrapyV4Fezn1_pcKcrA-YdTPXNElhyA_HTOAq43lCNJDC-Xx1iIIlUzFg2KU0lFjdWvaeNIQRbJYOv46-PQ5nzdo7mokc9038= https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=opqLo98KHEwfJgboUXTaBd134SWVXuNYbwUFpVMg6vp7eKYqNFuey8JdFSTmSJ7-LZ-HPNQyLhjrapyV4Fezn1_pcKcrA-YdTPXNElhyA_HTOAq43lCNJDC-Xx1iIIlUzFg2KU0lFjdWvaeNIQRbJYOv46-PQ5nzdo7mokc9038= )", developed in concert by the UK Timber Trade Federation (TTF), highlights that strong, inclusive legal frameworks are essential for the sustainable management of tropical forests and that this underpins all other climate policy ambitions. The paper proposes a new governance approach for the global tropical forest sector based on national standards within an international framework. Crucially, it also proposes supporting an international secretariat to administer and oversee the development of this framework. Produced from a series of workshops with trade associations and businesses throughout the tropical production belt and facilitated and led by TTF, the Accord is supported by associations in both producer and consumer nations including China, Europe and the UK. "We really welcome this call to action that the TTF has facilitated. We have to be able to support growth in countries across the world where the forests are an important economic resource, but at the same time, protect and support our climate change objectives," said Vel Gnanendran, Climate and Environment Director, FCDO. Sheam Satkuru, Director of Operations, ITTO, said that the international tropical timber agreement 2006 is an established legal framework and a partnership between producers and consumers. Protecting and sustainably managing tropical forests cannot be left to "one-sided" approaches, but must be incentivised through continual dialogue and resources which support sustainable production, commits to sustainable consumption and shares the cost of enforcement. "The tropical timber and forest sector has a key role in achieving the forest management and conservation goals of COP26 , and this requires the private sector, governments and civil society coming together to promote governance and sustainable management of resources," Satkuru said. David Hopkins, CEO of the TTF, said, "It was fantastic to see the pledges being made in the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use, and the other commitments being made toward ending illegal deforestation throughout the world. Now we need to start to put some of the detail behind those pledges into action, with a far stronger global legal framework governing the management of forests and the supply chains through international trade. "This is the first time that the global private sector has come together to speak with one united voice to advocate for greater global governance and enforceable legal frameworks. We need to act now - there is no time to lose." The Tropical Timber Accord was launched in the Blue Zone at COP26 within the UK Pavilion on Tuesday, November 2, 13.15 GMT, and will be featured in the Nature+Zone, Indonesian, and COMIFAC pavilions.

BRUSSELS - European Union countries are struggling to agree their negotiating position for the COP26 climate change conference, with rifts emerging over timeframes for emissions-cutting pledges, according to officials and documents seen by Reuters. The EU is drafting its position ahead of the November COP26 talks, where countries will attempt to finish the technical rules to put the Paris Agreement into effect. One issue they will try to settle is whether countries' climate targets under the 2015 accord should follow a "common timeframe." In an early sign of the clashes to come at COP26 , where nearly 200 countries will negotiate the issue, the EU's 27 member states are divided over whether targets should cover five or 10 year periods. The EU's own emissions-cutting targets are among the most ambitious of the world's major economies, and the bloc is seeking to spur other regions to set tougher goals. But all 27 member states must approve the EU's COP26 negotiating position, and some diplomats are concerned the bloc will fail to present a united front. "What signal is the EU giving the world if we can't even get the common timeframes in line with the Paris Agreement?" said an EU diplomat from a country backing a five-year timeframe. AMBITIOUS TARGETS A country's climate pledge is known as its nationally determined contribution, or NDC. A majority of EU countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Luxembourg and France, support a five-year timeframe for those pledges, according to EU officials familiar with the talks. They say the shorter five-year cycle would put more pressure on countries to set ambitious targets, and help keep track of whether they are cutting emissions fast enough to avert catastrophic climate change. They also worry that 10-year pledges could let countries with weaker climate goals fly under the radar for a whole decade. Other EU states, including Poland, Bulgaria and Romania want to give countries a choice of either five or 10 years, EU officials said. "The content of the NDCs and the will of the parties to implement them proves ambition, and not the frequency of NDCs," said a diplomat from one country supporting the five or 10-year choice. An EU document proposing its position for the COP26 negotiations, seen by Reuters, said the bloc should favor a five-year timeframe. Officials from EU countries will discuss the issue on Friday. In the international negotiations, the United States, African countries and small island states support five-year climate pledges, while China and India are against a single timeframe, the document said. Setting a Paris Agreement pledge every five years would not necessarily change the EU's legally binding targets to cut emissions by 2030 and 2050. Brussels will also set a 2040 emissions-cutting target. For example, the EU could submit a 2035 climate pledge to the U.N. that would be "our best estimate" of where its emissions need to be that year, to stay on track for its 2040 goal, the EU document said.

OTTAWA - World leaders will descend on Glasgow, Scotland starting Monday for the COP26 climate summit. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to arrive there after having visited the Netherlands on Friday and spending a week at the G20 summit in Rome. U.S. President Joe Biden will be in attendance as will several other major world leaders. Chinese President Xi Jinping, leader of the country with the world's highest carbon emissions, is not expected to attend in person, but may appear by videoconference. What is COP26 COP is a United Nations acronym for Conference of the Parties and is an annual climate change conference that has been taking place since the early 1990s. The Paris Climate Accord was worked out at a previous COP summit, COP21, in 2015. The summits also draw climate protesters, business leaders and non-governmental organizations interested in climate change. What happens at a COP summit? Countries attending COP summits are expected to come with details on their climate commitments and their strategies for addressing them. Canada's current commitment is to lower carbon emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050. The Paris agreement committed countries to preventing the earth's average temperature from rising more than two degrees celsius, and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees. Most countries are targeting to reach carbon zero by 2050 to achieve that goal. Above that temperature rise, it is feared humanity will see the worst impacts of warming, including floods, droughts, more violent storms and devastating wildfires. Newly appointed Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said at a press conference Friday that Canada won't be announcing new targets at next week's summit, but will announce new measures to meet those targets that were part of the Liberal platform. "Canada's once again a constructive player in the international climate. But yes, we have to go further and we have to do it faster."

The environment minister said there will be lots of focus on big emitters like the oilsands, but the government is also spending on transit and other projects designed to reduce the amount of fossil fuels individual Canadians use. "We obviously have to work on what's happening on the production level in terms of emissions, but we also need to do more in terms of consumption." Where does Canada's oil and gas sector fit into these commitments? Guilbeault said Canada's oil and gas sector, a major contributor to the country's emissions, will have to cap its emissions and then reduce its emissions over time until it reaches net zero in 2050. He said this doesn't mean a complete end to new projects, but it means the emissions they generate must shrink. "Regardless of what projects are happening in Canada, in terms of oil and gas, we will be putting in place this cap which will make sure that the emissions are first capped and then will be reduced over time," he said. Many oil and gas firms have already pledged to reach net zero by 2050. Timothy Egan, president and CEO of the Canadian Gas Association, raised a cautionary tone on the minister's comments this week saying that natural gas is vital to heating homes for 20 million Canadians and aggressive emission caps could make that more difficult. "All customers care a great deal about actions that could negatively affect their access to reliable and affordable energy. In Canada, there is no more reliable and affordable energy than natural gas," he said. Egan said countries around the world are dealing with shortages as the transition to green energy proves rocky. He said it's important Canada move at a reasonable pace. "We don't want the blackouts and skyrocketing prices that are happening elsewhere." Where does Alberta's economy fit into this? Premier Jason Kenney raised concerns this week about Guilbeault's appointment saying the former climate activist is too extreme and not willing to make a gradual transition that will save jobs and livelihoods. "His own personal background and track record on these issues suggest somebody who is more of an absolutist than a pragmatist," said Kenney. Guilbeault struck a softer tone on Friday and said he was willing to work with anyone on climate change. "I look forward to working constructively with all jurisdictions. In Canada and with the business and investment community," he said. He said Alberta has the potential to be a major player in the transition away from fossil fuels. "The province in Canada that is right now receiving the most investment in renewable energy development is Alberta. That's where we're seeing the most wind energy being developed," he said. "One of the world's largest solar plants is being built in Alberta right now. With funds from investors from Wall Street, from Bay Street and from organizations all across the country." .

World leaders have met annually since 1995 to talk about climate change, and this year, they finally asked young people ahead of time about ways to create jobs in renewable energy, push countries to prioritize low-carbon action, and how to get climate justice. Nearly 20 demands to COP26 came out of the discussions, which circled around meaningful participation, just transition funding, and more backing for climate change education. One goal seeks to support young people of colour, Indigenous youth, those with disabilities, and others already working on climate solutions. Another states the need for a rapid and immediate phase-out of the fossil fuel industry by 2030.  So that was the positive thing: to see how advanced the youth movement is and how it's shaping climate action to something that's not just renewable energy and planting trees, but something about justice and human rights, said 25-year-old Felix Giroux-Szarek, one of two delegates representing Canada at the event.  Anti-capitalist, anti-colonial. This fight is not just for climate change, it's a fight for something much broader. The Youth4Climate: Driving Ambition event was held last week and saw hundreds of participants from across the globe convene in Milan for three days. Although there's been youth participation at and in advance of the climate change conference in the past, this year's was special because it was the first pre-COP event hosted by the United Nations. A final document emerged from the working groups and discussions that took place between Sept. 28 and 30 in Milan, which was shared with decision-makers attending COP26 with the goal of informing the negotiation process at the conference. The climate change conference  also known as COP, short for Conference of the Parties  has brought the world together to hammer out agreements to reduce global warming. The talks gather policymakers, scientists, environmental activists, climate experts, and news media from the 197 member countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to set and work towards global climate change goals. This year, COP26 will take place at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. In a press conference held after Youth4Climate, COP26 president and Conservative British MP Alok Sharma said there were three feelings he got from the event: it was inspiring, the youth spoke frankly, and they spoke the truth  that we need to do more, faster. He said he was  absolutely certain young people around the world will hold leaders accountable if 1.5 C of warming slips out of reach. Six years after the Paris Agreement, key issues are still to be debated, yet this group of young people was able to put together a cohesive document that they agreed on in a few days, said Sharma. He then stressed events like this cannot be a  one-off and youth need to be more adequately incorporated into UN climate events in general. Giroux-Szarek, who will be at COP26 , agrees. He said Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission for the European Green Deal, said he would meet 30 minutes a day for the duration of COP26 with youth representatives for a check-in on how the meetings are going, and how the demands from the youth summit are being addressed, which Giroux-Szarek said is a good start.  I think it's really good to also capture that time from decision-makers. And for good decision-makers, I think that's a great (thing)  having youth as allies because a lot of them are as frustrated as (us) because they're stuck in these processes, he said. \</doc>

The climate summit kicked off in full Monday in Scotland with leaders from countries signed on to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris climate agreement in attendance. Activists are also be at the 12-day conference and while they will be urging others to eat less meat and cut down on air travel by flying commercial via routes already scheduled, the damage was already done as private jets from all over the world arrived in droves at the Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. It's estimated that about 400 private jets arrived for COP26 , according to the Daily Mail, and the VIP passengers include Prince Charles, Prince Albert of Monaco, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. U.S. President Joe Biden and his team will reportedly generate an estimated 2.2 million pounds of carbon to reach the summit thanks to four planes, the Marine One helicopter and his massive motorcade on the ground. Prime Minister Boris Johnson flew in from Rome on his Airbus A321, but was stuck circling Glasgow for more than 20 minutes due to the number of jets arriving at the same time. And leading the parade of private jets was Jeff Bezos's $65-million Gulf Stream. There was so much air traffic that some jets first dropped off VIPs at Glasgow Airport, then took off again to fly about 50 kilometres to nearby Prestwick due to a shortage of plane parking. Some world leaders also landed in Edinburgh before presumably travelling by land. Private jets are reportedly far more polluting than commercial planes, cars or trains with the typical one blasting out two tonnes of carbon dioxide every hour, reported the Daily Mail. Some predicted the fleet of aircraft arriving for the climate conference will expel 13,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide in total. Bezos and Bill Gates, who regularly lecture about the need to combat climate change, did nothing to reduce their carbon footprint leading up to COP26 . Both men were reportedly vacationing on superyachts off the coast of Turkey for Gates's birthday with each boat emitting more than 7,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, which translates to about 19 tonnes each day. At least Prince Charles's jet used a sustainable fuel option. "His Royal Highness has personally campaigned for a shift towards sustainable aviation fuel and would only undertake travel to Rome when it was agreed that sustainable fuel would be used in the plane," said a Clarence House spokesperson, adding that it would also be used "wherever possible ... from now on." !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Sun Media Corporation.

A pledge to phase out coal gained the support of 23 more countries at the U.N. climate conference on Thursday, but was shunned by big users of the dirtiest of the fuels that cause global warming. The COP26 Greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal are the single biggest contributor to climate change, and weaning the world off coal is considered vital to achieving global climate targets. The pledge to drop coal did not include Australia, India, the United States and China, which has around half the coal-fired plants operating around the world and plans to build more. Carbon dioxide emissions fell by 5.4% in 2020 as economies ground to a halt, but the new report by the Global Carbon Project forecast a 4.9% rebound in emissions for this year. "We were expecting to see some rebound," said the report's lead author Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate modeling researcher at the University of Exeter. "What surprised us was the intensity and rapidity." The United Nations says a rise above 1.5C would trigger climate impacts far more catastrophic than the intensifying storms, heatwaves, droughts and floods already being seen. "I think we can say that the end of coal is in sight," Alok Sharma, British president of the two-week summit, said in detailing the pledge to phase out existing coal-fueled power plants and to stop building new ones. The non-binding pledge "has 77 signatories, including 46 countries, such as Poland, Vietnam, and Chile, 23 of which are making commitments on ending coal for the first time," he said. Richer nations agreed to quit coal power by the 2030s and poorer ones by the 2040s. Poland said it was aiming for the 2040s -having previously pledged to stop mining coal in 2049. Indonesia did not agree to the part of the deal on ending finance for new coal plants. Coal-fired power today produces more than a third of the world's electricity. Many developing countries currently rely on cheap, accessible coal to fuel their economies, just as developed countries did from the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century onwards, despite the costs to the environment and public health. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Sun Media Corporation.

The COP26 global climate conference will miss its goal of weaning the world off fossil fuels unless developing economies heavily reliant on coal are given the help they need to adapt, decision-makers told a Reuters climate conference on Tuesday. Usha Rao-Monari, associate administrator of the U.N. Development Programme, said less than a fifth of global investment in clean energy currently went to help the poorest two-thirds of the world's population. Rao-Monari said that out of an estimated $90 trillion that needed to be spent on infrastructure to help the world meet 2030 emissions goals, two-thirds should go to emerging countries - in many cases to prevent them locking in ostensibly cheaper long-term investments, such as polluting coal-fired power stations. Makhtar Diop, managing director of the World Bank's investment arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), said it and other multilateral lenders were working to make green investments in emerging economies "bankable." This involved developing innovative financial structures to "de-risk" green projects for private sector investors. "I believe that in the future, all activity related to climate change will be perceived as much less risky than it was in the past," he said. Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, said it was critical that the finance industry started thinking longer-term to support the transition away from fossil fuels, and that a global carbon market taking account of the full impact of emissions would help. "Right now, carbon is way too cheap, it's ridiculous," she said. POWER TO THE PEOPLE Francesco Starace, chief executive of Europe's biggest utility firm, Italy's Enel, said the transition from fossil fuels had to include making sure all people on Earth had access to electricity - and that meant clean, affordable and renewable electricity. The 800 million people who lack access to affordable energy "won't care about the climate" if their need for power continues to be an existential question for their well-being, he said. Spanish Energy and Environment Minister Teresa Ribera said she hoped COP26 would reinforce the rich world's commitment to spend $100 billion a year on the energy transition in emerging nations, and also ensure it went to climate-friendly projects. Rich nations first committed to the $100 billion figure at COP16 in 2009 but the 2020 deadline set then has come and gone without the target ever being hit. Ribera also called for action on the issue of "loss and damage" - the demand of poorer countries for an agreed basis to assess liability and compensation for the harm done to the climate, largely by the rich, industrialized world. "In the Glasgow conference, adaptation and loss and damage, to my mind, will be the very key milestone to what extent we are credible in terms of this type of solidarity and credible solutions," she said. The IFC's Diop also said that getting enough resources, collectively, to the countries that needed to adapt most because of desertification or coastal erosion was one of the biggest challenges facing the decision-makers at COP26 .

GLASGOW, United Kingdom, Nov. 9, 2021 /CNW/ - The twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss pose enormous threats to long-term sustainability, global security and economic well-being around the globe. Canada, alongside others in the international community, must rapidly reduce carbon emissions and fight climate change. However, confronting climate change in thoughtful ways also offers the potential for significant economic opportunities for businesses, communities and workers in Canada and around the world. The Government of Canada remains committed to ambitious climate action at home and abroad and is working with international partners to build a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for all. Minister of Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson joined Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault in Glasgow for the Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) to increase Canada's climate ambition and action and to deliver on key initiatives intended to accelerate the international community's transition toward a low-carbon future. During COP26 Announced that Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Costa Rica, the East African Development Bank and over 20 other countries will end new direct international public support for the unabated fossil fuel sector by the end of 2022; Attended a press conference with German State Secretary Jochen Flasbarth that highlighted Canada's and Germany's successful completion and submission of the Climate Finance Delivery Plan to COP26 President Alok Sharma. The Plan makes good on the commitment for the world's advanced economies to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance to developing countries to help them mitigate and adapt to climate change; Participated in a roundtable with Bill Gates and Chilean Minister of Energy and Mining Juan Carlos Jobet at the Mission Innovation (MI) and Breakthrough Energy (BE) Innovation Summit to mark the launch of Breakthrough Energy's new partnership with Mission Innovation to drive investment in clean tech innovation; Participated in a panel discussion with International Energy Agency's Executive Director Fatih Birol and Chilean Minister of Energy and Mining Juan Carlos Jobet to discuss how the IEA, Chile and Canada are promoting the production and use of low-emissions hydrogen as a clean fuel; Spoke at the Global Youth Energy Outlook Launch Event with international youth leaders on the findings of their Global Youth Energy Outlook, which Natural Resources Canada helped fund; Participated in the Just Climate Energy Indigenous Renewable Energy Microgrids for Energy Transition Event, which kicked off a partnership between Canada and the International Renewable Energy Agency to support the transition of remote communities around the world to renewable energy; Attended an event led by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Union where Canada highlighted its leadership in supporting workers and reiterated its support for the IEA Global Commission on People-Centred Energy Transition's recommendations; and Spoke at the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue, hosted by former British Prime Minister Theresa May, where Minister Wilkinson discussed specific actions to protect forests in Canada and around the world. The Minister also held numerous bilateral meetings with international counterparts, provincial ministers and other organizations participating at COP26 . These included meetings with Secretary Granholm of the U.S. and EU Commissioner of Energy Kadri Simson. The Minister will return to Canada having taken significant new action to further Canada's leadership on the clean energy transition. Quotes " COP26 is a pivotal moment for the global community, where nations have the opportunity to set themselves on a path to achieving what is required to keep 1.5 degrees Celsius on the table. I'm proud to say that Canada has delivered, demonstrating significant leadership with respect to our increased targets, the energy transition, international climate finance and nature protection. We will take the momentum gathered here in Glasgow back to Canada, where we will continue to drive ambitious climate action at home for families, communities and businesses."

While some young people are passionate about fighting to save the planet, others see unavoidable doom in the collective inability of leaders and individuals to take drastic climate action within our economic systems. Less than a month before a major global climate change conference, students around the downtown campus of the University of Toronto were largely unaware of COP26 or the two-week UN meeting\' s finer details. And while a warming planet and related negative effects were of concern to the dozen or so students who spoke with Canada\' s National Observer, none expressed optimism that meaningful progress would be made.  I think we\' re doomed, said Yun Yang, a U of T engineering student.  Countries aren't going to change the way they're operating because we're too focused on short-term stuff. Yang said he felt that not enough people care enough and that he didn\' t have the right to be angry at others for inaction since he was not actively researching the topic himself.  Obviously, it's concerning when you think about what can happen with climate change going in the direction that it is, he said.  But I think realistically, I don\' t think this world can turn around. I\' m just being honest. For Melissa Bieman, a fifth-year history and philosophy student, it's about people having more pressing post-pandemic priorities.  If people don't have jobs, if people can't afford to live, they're not going to care about the climate. I think that's just reality, she said.  You're more concerned with whether you can put food on the table than whether the Earth\' s going to be here in 30 or 50 years. The COVID-19 pandemic stalled a global climate protest movement that had brought millions of people to the streets in 2019 demanding the systemic change required to slow the warming of the planet and stave off the worst effects of a more extreme climate. It has also made many people\' s economic outlook more uncertain, and countries have marshalled significant resources to battle the virus and ensure economic recovery.  I don't think any progress is going to be made, because at the end of the day, I think it's all about economic prosperity, said a business student who gave her name as Jacqueline.  I don\' t think they really care at the moment about climate change. Talk of a just transition away from fossil fuels would have to provide a meaningful advantage before oil and gas workers would be motivated to switch careers, said Bieman.  The hard part, especially with somewhere that's so dependent (on an oil and gas economy) like Alberta, for example, is that you're going to have to show them that the jobs are there first before they're even inclined to walk away, she said. COP26  also known as COP, short for Conference of the Parties  has brought the world together since 1995 to hammer out agreements to reduce global warming. The talks gather policymakers, scientists, environmental activists, climate experts, and news media from the 197 member countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to set and work towards global climate change goals. This year, COP26 will take place at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. \</doc>

Leaders of the 20 richest countries will acknowledge the existential threat of climate change and will take urgent steps to limit global warning, a draft communiqu\'e9 seen ahead of the COP26 summit shows. As people around the world prepared to demonstrate their frustration with politicians, Pope Francis lent his voice to a chorus demanding action, not mere words, from the meeting starting in Glasgow, Scotland, on Sunday. While the 2015 Paris Agreement committed signatories to keeping global warming to "well below" 2 C above pre-industrial levels, and preferably to 1.5 C, carbon levels in the atmosphere have since grown. "We commit to tackle the existential challenge of climate change," the G20 draft, seen by Reuers, promised. "We recognize that the impacts of climate change at 1.5 degrees are much lower than at two degrees and that immediate action must be taken to keep 1.5 degrees within reach." UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Friday that the world was rushing headlong toward climate disaster and G20 leaders must do more to help poorer countries. "Unfortunately, the message to developing countries is essentially this: the cheque is in the mail. On all our climate goals, we have miles to go. And we must pick up the pace," Guterres said. Climate activist Greta Thunberg is among those who took to the streets of the London, the British capital's financial heart, to demand the world's biggest financial companies withdraw support for fossil fuel. U.S. President Joe Biden will join leaders at the G20 meeting after a setback on Thursday when the House of Representatives abandoned plans for a vote on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which would have represented the biggest investment in climate action in U.S. history. Biden had hoped to reach an agreement before COP26 , where he wants to present a message that the U.S. has resumed the fight against global warming. The Pope will not attend COP26 following surgery earlier this year, but on Friday he led the calls for action at the talks that run from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. The world's political leaders, he said, must give future generations "concrete hope" that they are taking the radical steps needed. "These crises present us with the need to take decisions, radical decisions that are not always easy," he said. "Moments of difficulty like these also present opportunities, opportunities that we must not waste." British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting COP26 , said this week the outcome hangs in the balance. But leaders of Europe's biggest oil and gas companies, among big firms conspicuous by their absence at COP26 , said only governments can effectively curb fossil fuel demand. Current commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on track for an average 2.7 C rise this century, a UN report said on Tuesday. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Osprey Media Group Inc.

The world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change. 2015-2019 were the five warmest years on record while 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record. On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, temperature could increase by as much as 4.4 C by the end of the century. In 2019, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs. Carbon dioxide levels were 148 per cent of preindustrial levels. Emissions must drop 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 C and 2.7 per cent per year to stay below 2 C.

"Even with the rain, I think it makes it a bit more dramatic." Just a few blocks from the procession, back-room negotiations continued at the COP26 meeting. On stage, speakers sounded the alarm over the threat of global warming to food security. Since the climate talks began, national delegations have been working to agree on technical details for the final pact, to be announced at the end of the conference after more negotiations this week. -Reuters New mapping shows how climate change could flood low-lying areas in Vancouver and beyond( HYPERLINK https://vancouversun.com/news/national/new-mapping-shows-how-climate-change-could-flood-low-lying-areas-in-vancouver-and-beyond?utm_medium=Social&;utm_source=Facebook&;fbclid=IwAR3EMIub46JT58HdHnjHsZTNdl9kXYRo6dF9ExAIiaubTPOfb4FuVm2fwwg#Echobox=1635976477 https://vancouversun.com/news/national/new-mapping-shows-how-climate-change-could-flood-low-lying-areas-in-vancouver-and-beyond?utm_medium=Social&;utm_source=Facebook&;fbclid=IwAR3EMIub46JT58HdHnjHsZTNdl9kXYRo6dF9ExAIiaubTPOfb4FuVm2fwwg#Echobox=1635976477 ) Low-lying areas of major cities like Vancouver and Montreal could become inundated with floods in the next 80 years under various climate change scenarios, suggests a floodplains map developed by a Western University researcher. The maps, created by engineering professor Slobodan Simonovic, are a visual distillation of almost 150,000 reference documents - including current and historical rainfall and snow-melt runoff data, topographic analyses, urbanization factors that impede effective drainage and a range of climate projections. Simonovic superimposed the data on web-based maps to show potential future flood inundation - how much of an area is covered by water - as well as how often and how significant floods could be. The maps, which show flood impacts on a Canada-wide scale in a standardized way, identify areas where rivers are most likely to overflow, including the Assiniboine and Red rivers that converge on Winnipeg and the Fraser Valley that runs through Vancouver.

Before the panel started on Wednesday she tweeted that fossil fuel companies and banks are trying to "give polluters a free pass to keep polluting." Offsets are a way for buyers to continue polluting while essentially paying someone else to adopt climate-friendly behaviours. But no global oversight or common standards exist, and an abundance of low-quality offsets appears to have little impact on global warming. The projects also have the potential to harm local communities if they aren't executed properly.

Minister George Heyman says the government aims to make its plan as cost effective as possible to exceed its climate change targets, which requires innovation. Heyman made the statements in a media teleconference from the United Nations' COP26 Climate Summit in Scotland, where he was invited to discuss the climate crisis with other government leaders. Last week, the B.C. government introduced its climate plan to chop greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, which includes initiatives like reducing the number of kilometres driven by residents by 25 per cent compared with last year and boosting the carbon tax. Heyman gave keynote remarks during a panel at the gathering about the government's CleanBC Roadmap to 2030, which he says was met with enthusiasm from other leaders at the conference.

"It's a big deal," said federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson from Glasgow, Scotland, the site of a United Nations-sponsored meeting on climate change. "It's a signal that many countries in this world are making this commitment not to use public resources to finance further exploration and development for fossil fuels." Climate activists welcomed the deal. "It shows that Canada recognizes the harmful social and economic impacts of fossil fuels and the urgent need to end global production and use," said Alan Andrews of Ecojustice, an environmental law firm. But industry groups responded warily. "We believe responsible energy producers such as Canada should be playing a larger role in meeting global energy demand," said Jay Averill of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.

Like a thunderbolt hurled from the sky, following the signing of the Glasgow Climate Pact, B.C. was devastated by its second climate disaster in six months. It was as if it were a message from the climate gods about their displeasure at the weakness of COP26 . COP26 was about to fail at the finish line. Witnessing, live, the harrowing final hours of this unique gathering - literally juggling the fate of the world - was fascinating. We never get more than staged glimpses of the political battles at the G7 or other global forums. Whether you were appalled or simply resigned at the sight of India's successful last-minute power play to water down the commitment to phase out coal, it was high drama to watch it unfold. Minutes before the final concession, Reuters reported that China, India, the U.S. and the EU were huddling just off the floor. China pushed India to demand with them the "soft on coal" language, threatening not to sign the pact if they were refused. The COP gatherings are always disappointing: much is promised and much less delivered. But this one had a level of urgency and conviction, across all but a few miscreant players, that has not been seen before. A former colleague used to call the international conferences we endured as "oceans of words, flowing into deserts of inaction." But COP is different for several reasons. There is no forum in the world like it. This is a decision-making body, made of up of nearly every nation on earth. The world has never succeeded at something this ambitious - and we have often failed. The League of Nations, collapsed; the UN, paralyzed by big power veto; the WTO, at risk of irrelevance. At COP there is little hierarchy of power. The Maldives delegate, a powerful and impassioned campaigner, has the same access to the world's attention as the U.S. It operates by consensus, so the major powers need to fight for Tuvalu's support, not just that of their peers. Of course, there are side deals and hidden coalitions; everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others. Still, this is a body which nudges nations to transform their economies and entire societies from the ground up. This time, COP made some real progress, both on the detail and depth of some of the commitments, but also on the widening array of those willing to sign up to some very hard challenges. Foot draggers like Australia, China, India and Indonesia came under real political pressure inside and - more importantly - outside the hall. One could sense for the first time a sense of near panic about island nations' survival, about extreme weather becoming more severe for everyone. Watching John Kerry weave back and forth between groups, pleading for consensus; listening to the impassioned Africans telling the world of their climate suffering; witnessing the pain on the faces of the poorer nations' delegates at the hard compromises they must swallow - you knew this was for real. As Kerry put it, very few public officials get to make decisions of this magnitude, choices about the very fate of the world. Precisely a year from now, COP27 will gather in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. It will probably take place after another gruelling year of fires, floods and drought. B.C. will have been afflicted with another horrific year of climate crisis year. Given live television coverage, what the conference decides really will take place, as the old cliche has it, "with the whole world watching." We'll see whether this year's small progress can be pushed into real change. Robin V.

The UN climate change conference, just completed in Glasgow, Scotland, comes hot on the heels of the latest IPCC report - a desperate plea for nations around the world to take drastic action to address human-caused climate change before it's too late. According to the world's leading authorities on the subject, we have entered the "make or break" decade for mitigating climate catastrophe. Climate scientists are clear: To avoid climate chaos, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions around the world must be cut in half by 2030. Canada surely has its part to play. Examining cumulative CO2 emissions since 1850 reveals the countries most responsible for causing climate change are the U.S., China, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Germany, India, the U.K., Japan and Canada. That's right, Canada is one of the villainous top 10 climate polluters. Even more disturbing, when population size is factored into the analysis, Canada tops the charts as the worst emitter of CO2 on the planet. That's right, nobody in the world extracts and burns more planet-killing fossil fuels or chops down more of its pristine forests than Canadians do. Next time someone says climate change is not our problem, set them straight! Even if our emissions are less than three per cent of the total, they must be drastically reduced. Just as we wouldn't tolerate three out of 100 babies crashing down on the delivery room floor, it is unacceptable to ignore the destruction that Canada is causing to life on earth. Also consider what the countries with the next smallest populations have accomplished since the inaugural COP, some 30 years ago. The U.K., the nation responsible for the Industrial Revolution and Germany, Europe's industrial powerhouse, have reduced their GHG emissions by over 40 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Meanwhile, Canada has not met a single emissions reduction target. In fact, our emissions have increased by a loathsome 20 per cent over the last three decades. Enough is enough! It is our duty to apply relentless pressure on our MPs, provincial politicians and municipal representatives to reverse our climate pollution trajectory and to evolve Canada into a sustainable post-carbon society. At COP26 COP26 with a sense of urgency and resolve, quickly rolling out new policies and funding to reduce our fair share of emissions this decade, while driving a "Just Transition" to a post-carbon economy. I understand we're all busy trying to make ends meet, but if we think Canada's cost of living is high now, this is just the tip of the iceberg, er heat dome. As climate change brings sea-level rise, flooding and extreme weather events like devastating storms, heatwaves, wildfires and droughts, we will witness devastation to the natural world whose impacts on our economy we cannot fully comprehend. What is obvious is that climate disasters will result in property damage, crop failures, food shortages, manufacturing/trade disruption, and mass human migrations, all resulting in unprecedented unaffordability. There will certainly be nefarious opposition to actions that will reduce emissions. There will be loud and misguided fearmongering about destroying the economy while taking away our freedom. It will be our responsibility to ensure that the mature voice of reason, drowns out the dangerously short-sighted fools. We must remind everyone that regulations that drive down emissions are not taking anything important away from Canadians, rather they are putting us on a path to a better life for all. As painful as it is, it's time for Canadians to stop hiding behind false narratives, pretending that we are a small player on the world stage. Instead, we should be highly motivated to do our fair share to avoid the looming climate chaos. It is our responsibility to drive the necessary political and cultural change toward a post-carbon Canada, accepting and adapting to subtle changes to our lifestyle accordingly.

Climate Minister Jonathan Wilkinson doesn\' t know if he\' ll continue to serve in the role just yet, but with COP26 in arm\' s reach, his portfolio may be the most significant of any cabinet member. Speaking with reporters Friday from a pre-COP meeting in Milan, Wilkinson said Canada\' s focus in the lead-up to COP26 is closing the gap on the US$100 billion worth of climate financing per year rich countries promised developing ones over a decade ago at COP15. Ratcheting up financing to meet that target is widely recognized as essential to the success of the Paris Agreement, but in recent years, momentum has slowed. The latest Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report pegged the total amount of climate financing provided to developing countries at US$79.6 billion in 2019. The amount only grew two per cent from the previous year, and the aim was to hit US$100 billion by 2020. Due to reporting lags, the 2020 figure is not expected to be known until next year.  The $100-billion number is one of the linchpins of the Paris Agreement, Wilkinson said.  That's exactly why the United Kingdom has asked Germany and Canada to work with the donor community to scale up the financing, so that we actually are moving to, and beyond, $100 billion as we move to 2025, he said. Wilkinson said he expects to publish an  action plan the week of Oct. 18 that details countries\' commitments. This year, Canada announced it would double its international climate financing from $2.65 billion to $5.3 billion over five years. That\' s about one per cent of the $500 billion over five years developed countries have collectively committed to. India has been a leading voice calling for developed countries to boost their financial commitments to reach the promised amount. U.S. President Joe Biden recently told the UN General Assembly he would look for Congress to approve doubling climate finance to US$11 billion per year by 2024 to help meet this commitment. Similarly, the European Union recently announced it would add 4 billion euros from 2021 to 2027 to the financial support it offers developing countries. The EU already commits US$25 billion annually, Reuters reports.    It is not an overstatement to say the failure or success of COP26 depends on rich countries' ability to close the $100-billion gap, because it is an issue of trust, said Eddy P\'e9rez, international climate diplomacy manager with Climate Action Network Canada. In particular, increasing financing for adaptation, as opposed to mitigation, will be critical. Mitigation refers to efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation refers to building the type of society that can withstand the climate breakdown that is already locked in.  Thirty per cent of Canada's climate finance has gone to adaptation, while the rest goes to mitigation, and that is the same thing all over the world, P\'e9rez said.  Mitigation finance focuses a lot on private sector mobilization  (but) in some countries, particularly the most vulnerable, they need  first and foremost  financing for adaptation, he said. One reason for that is because mitigation efforts, like solar panels or switching to electric vehicles, have clear business cases that private capital can support. Adaptation efforts, like building a seawall, don\' t always have a business case, meaning public money is needed. Wilkinson said Canada\' s focus is on scaling up government money that can be deployed through multilateral development banks or bilateral agreements between countries but added that won\' t be enough. Still, he emphasized Canada\' s role is about increasing public dollar commitments from developed countries, calling it separate from former Bank of Canada governor and current UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney\' s work leading COP26 \' s  private finance hub. While the work may be done separately, the pieces are likely to be stitched together tightly at the end of the day, because private financing priorities at COP26 are expected to be setting up an international framework for moving massive amounts of money, essentially by making investors feel comfortable they will see worthwhile returns. The strategy\' s priorities reference expanding the role of public-private partnerships and say that  blended finance, referring to public and private investments, has a  vital role to play. Taking place since 1995, the United Nations climate change conference  also known as COP, short for Conference of the Parties  brings countries together to negotiate agreements to reduce global warming. This year, COP26 will take place at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. \</doc>

ROME - Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies agreed on a final statement on Sunday that urged "meaningful and effective" action to limit global warming, but offered few concrete commitments, angering climate activists. The result of days of tough negotiation among diplomats leaves huge work to be done at the broader United Nations COP26 climate summit in Scotland, which starts this week. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi hailed the Rome gathering, saying for the first time all G20 states had agreed on the importance of capping global warming at the 1.5 degrees Celsius level that scientists say is vital to avoid disaster. "We made sure that our dreams are not only alive but they are progressing," Draghi told a closing news conference, brushing off criticism from environmentalists that the G20 had not gone nearly far enough to resolve the crisis. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who warned on Friday that the world was rushing headlong towards climate disaster, said the Rome summit was not all he hoped for. "While I welcome the #G20's recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled - but at least they are not buried," he said in a tweet. While I welcome the #G20( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/G20?src=hash&;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/hashtag/G20?src=hash&;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw )'s recommitment to global solutions, I leave Rome with my hopes unfulfilled - but at least they are not buried. Onwards to # COP26 ( https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP26?src=hash&;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/hashtag/ HYPERLINK COP26 ?src=hash&;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw HYPERLINK https://t.co/c1nhIDbA8m ) - Ant\'c3\'b3nio Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 31, 2021( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1454824213261455360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1454824213261455360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) The G20, which includes Brazil, China, India, Germany and the United States, accounts for 60% of the world's population and an estimated 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The 1.5C threshold is what UN experts say must be met to avoid a dramatic acceleration of extreme climate events like droughts, storms and floods, and to reach it they recommend net zero emissions should be achieved by 2050. The stakes are huge - among them the very survival of low-lying countries, the impact on economic livelihoods the world over and the stability of the global financial system. "This was a moment for the G20 to act with the responsibility they have as the biggest emitters, yet we only see half-measures rather than concrete urgent action," said Friederike Roder, vice president of sustainable development advocacy group Global Citizen. The final summit document said current national plans on how to curb emissions will have to be strengthened "if necessary" and makes no specific reference to 2050 as a date to achieve net zero carbon emissions. The leaders only recognized "the key relevance" of halting net emissions "by or around mid-century." This removed the 2050 date seen in previous versions of the final statement so as to make the target less specific. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the agreement was a good signal for COP26 , but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signaled he would have liked to see more ambition. "There's no question that Canada, along with a number of other countries, would have liked stronger language and stronger commitments on the fight against climate change than others," he told reporters. UN experts say that even if current national plans are fully implemented, the world is headed for global warming of 2.7C, with catastrophic consequences. Draghi, acting president of the G20, said nations would keep on improving their plans to lower carbon emissions in the years ahead, adding that he was surprised by how far countries like China and Russia had shifted their stance in recent days. "It is easy to suggest difficult things. It is very, very difficult to actually execute them," he said. The final G20 statement includes a pledge to halt financing of overseas coal-fired power generation by the end of this year, but set no date for phasing out coal power, promising only to do so "as soon as possible." This replaced a goal set in a previous draft of the final statement to achieve this by the end of the 2030s, showing the strong resistance from some coal-dependent countries The G20 also set no date for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, saying they will aim to do so "over the medium term." METHANE REDUCTION On methane, which has a more potent but less lasting impact than carbon dioxide on global warming, they watered down their wording from a previous draft that pledged to "strive to reduce our collective methane emissions significantly." The final statement just recognizes that reducing methane emissions is "one of the quickest, most feasible and most cost-effective ways to limit climate change." G20 sources said negotiations were tough over so-called "climate financing," which refers to a 2009 pledge by rich nations to provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries tackle climate change. They have failed to meet the pledge, generating mistrust and a reluctance among some developing nations to accelerate their emissions reductions. However, Draghi said the funding gap had narrowed to less than $20 billion and predicted it could be closed further, with wealthy nations considering using financing from the International Monetary Fund to make up the shortfall. World leaders will kick start COP26 on Monday with two days of speeches that could include some new emissions-cutting pledges, before technical negotiators lock horns over the rules of the 2015 Paris climate accord. The United Nations said last week greenhouse gas concentrations hit a record in 2020 and the world was "way off track" in capping rising temperatures. \</doc>

GLASGOW, Scotland - Exhausted negotiators from nearly 200 nations struck a deal Saturday intended to propel the world toward more urgent climate action, but without the transformative breakthrough scientists say must happen if humanity is to avert disastrous planetary warming. Two weeks of high-profile talks yielded a package that pushes countries to strengthen near-term climate targets and move away from fossil fuels faster. It insists that wealthy countries fulfil a broken promise to help vulnerable nations cope with the rising costs of climate change. And it cracks open the door to future payments developed nations might make for damage already done. Saturday's agreement, however, doesn't achieve the most ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris accord - to limit Earth's warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. Instead, delegations left Glasgow with the Earth still on track to blow past that threshold, pushing toward a future of escalating weather crises and irreversible damage to the natural world. And representatives from hard-hit nations feared that the deal still leaves their people facing an existential threat. "The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us," Aminath Shauna, the Maldives'minister of the environment, climate change and technology, told the summit. "What is balanced and pragmatic to other parties will not help the Maldives adapt in time. It will be too late." Organizers acknowledged that the hard-fought agreement doesn't go nearly far enough. But they argued that the progress made creates a road map to a safer future and "keeps 1.5 alive." Yet with global temperatures already up more than 1.1 C, and extreme weather wreaking havoc around the world, it remains to be seen whether this agreement will be sufficient to deal with calamities inflicted by climate change. - The Washington Post !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Sun Media Corporation.

Alberta's top representative to the global climate conference taking place in Scotland has a message to those in the province who feel singled out by the pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You are not alone. "I feel that too," said Steve MacDonald, CEO of Emissions Reduction Alberta, a provincial agency that helps fund carbon reduction initiatives. "But you come here and listen to these other jurisdictions and they're struggling with exactly the same problems. I think that's very reassuring." One of only two Alberta delegates in Glasgow for the UN-sponsored COP26 meeting on climate change, MacDonald's days have been full. He has met with top Canadian officials, including new federal environment minister Steven Guilbeault. He has given panel presentations and met with national delegates from the U.K., the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Sweden, among others. There are booths to meet people from different nations and companies. Coffee chats. And yes, socials. "Over a glass of wine you can have different conversations and build relationships with some of the most influential people in the world around the climate file," MacDonald said. "It can go as late as you want." You can ask questions, follow up ideas, make personal contacts. "It's a bit of a club. You have to be here." The occasional eyebrow does lift at "I'm from Alberta," he said. Some do condemn the province, along with its emissions. And Alberta does have a ways to go, MacDonald acknowledges. The United Conservative government is still working out its climate change strategy, which it has promised to release shortly. But other countries want to hear about Alberta's experience with carbon taxes, he said. They want to hear about its carbon capture technologies. In return, MacDonald is all ears when it comes to measures such as green bonds, a market-based way of raising money for renewable energy. Alberta's two-person delegation is the smallest from all of Canada's energy-producing provinces - smaller even than delegations sent by groups such as the Inuit Circumpolar Conference. MacDonald doesn't feel outgunned. You learn to pick your spots, he said. "As a (province), you have to be very purposeful." Alberta politicians often complain that the bar keeps going up for the province's reduction targets. Join the club, said MacDonald - everybody feels that way. "The whole world is trying to keep up with demands that we need to do more, faster." Plans that were bold five years ago are just table stakes now, he said. "The agenda has changed. But Albertans shouldn't feel that they have to solve those problems themselves, or that they're the only jurisdiction where climate change is a hot topic. It's hard for everybody, said MacDonald. \</doc>

LONDON - British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and Nigerian author Ben Okri read out their "Letters to the Earth" on Monday, as part of a campaign urging action against climate change in the run-up to the U.N. COP26 summit. The 80-year-old designer, known for her environmental activism, Okri and children's choir SOS From the Kids were among those taking to the stage at the Shakespeare's Globe theater in London to read their letters in a recording released next week. In her letter, Westwood called for a land-based economy and opening up land corridors for wildlife. "Rewilding is not to do with stop farming and let everything go, it's to do with start farming in collaboration with nature. Let nature bring the soil back to health," she told Reuters. Founded in 2019, the global campaign has seen the likes of Yoko Ono and Oscar winner Mark Rylance joining adults and children in writing letters about their environmental concerns. "What we're doing now in the run up to COP ... (is) we're really wishing for everyone worldwide to raise their ambition for climate action," Kay Michael, co-founding director of the "Letters to the Earth" campaign, said. "We believe that to enable that, we need to invite people to express their vision for a better world." Booker Prize winner Okri read his previously published letter "The Age of Catastrophes" and joined his partner in a poetry-dance performance. Their 5-year-old daughter read her own letter. "My letter ... is asking the Earth to chastise us," Okri said. "It's time that we took some responsibility for what we're doing." SOS From the Kids, who write and perform songs as part of their environmental activism, shared their letters urging for better protection of nature and wildlife and calling for justice for those badly impacted hit by the climate crisis. Monday's recordings will be released on Oct. 25, a week before the COP26 summit begins in Glasgow.

COP26 HIGHLIGHTS At the "Circular Economy and the 21st Century City: Unlocking the Social & Environmental Benefits of the Sustainable City" panel, Ms. Cabral-Gardner described how the Company introduced circularity in its operations through its greentech production plant (the "Production Plant"), powered by 100% clean energy: applying clean technologies to ensure that 100% of the tailings are dry-stacked, 100% of the water is re-utilized in the processing and no hazardous chemicals are applied in separation and purification processes of the lithium material. As a result, Sigma plans to direct these "lithium rich and chemicals free" quartz and feldspar tailings from the greentech Production Plant to be utilized as an incentive for ancillary industries, such as ceramic floorings and tiles. By setting-up industrial operations in the Vale do Jequitinhonha region to reuse these tailings as raw materials, thereby fostering additional economic growth, job creation, additional CFEM taxes and overall social development of Aracuai and Itinga. The Company also spearheaded the creation of an independent and private Investment Agency to organize these activities, separately from Sigma's. "Sigma's high purity lithium materials have significant value added. Still, the Company could have made a decision to further increase its profits selling tailings for market price to lower the Company's cash costs. However, in relative quantitative terms, that would be a small amount compared to the priceless value of supporting our community by utilizing these dry stacked tailings to foster economic development" added Ms. Cabral-Gardner. "We are creating a legacy by lifting the community together with the Company." During the "Green Brazil" session on November 11, Ms. Cabral-Gardner discussed that the Vale do Jequitinhonha already attracts significant global ESG investment flows creating "green jobs" via Sigma's presence in the region. They are a direct result of the multi-billion-dollar investments made in Europe, United States and China in building lithium ion battery factories to enable the electrification of mobility Ana says "Sigma has developed this high purity and environmentally sustainable lithium material produced according with the highest global technological certification standards. Therefore, our lithium materials will enable the production of the most advanced electric vehicle batteries globally. We are enabling the electrification of the car fleets in countries where the mobility is still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. These materials are not required by the domestic market in Brazil: as a Brazilian, I am proud to say that 88% of the cars in our country are hybrid ethanol, running on clean energy." OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS The Company continues to advance towards initiating commercial production in 2022. On November 9, 2021, the Company announced that it mobilized its workforce and equipment on site for construction of the Production Plant. This stage comprises the earthworks necessary for installation of the Production Plant and infrastructure foundations. It is expected that approximately one million cubic meters of soil/subsoils will be moved, employing a workforce of approximately 180 people. Completion of this stage is expected within three months. The Company expects Front-End Engineering and Design ("FEED") to be finalized in Q4 2021. The revised CAPEX estimation is ongoing and final CAPEX with a Project Execution Plan ("PEP") is also expected to be complete by Q4 2021. Subsequently, Board approval for the construction plan could be made formalizing a final investment decision. Immediately thereafter, the Company would place orders for long lead items and reserve manufacturing slots with the key vendors whose equipment is part of the construction critical path. Contracts for earthmoving, civil construction, and the orders for long lead items will be paid for with funds already in the Company treasury and earmarked for construction. Following the successful conclusion of the first phase of FEED, Promon Engenharia Ltda. ("Promon") and Primero Group Ltd ("Primero") will remain engaged by the Company and continue to focus on negotiating and securing long lead items for the construction of the Production Plant. The Company is currently negotiating an agreement for the engineering, procurement, and construction management ("EPCM") of the Production Plant and associated infrastructure with both engineering firms. The Company is also in negotiations with two finalist mining contractors to build and operate the Company's first mine at the Project. ESG HIGHLIGHTS The Company has ongoing comprehensive environmental and social programs in process, consistent with its leadership role in ESG in the lithium sector and its commitment to sustainable mining. The social and environmental mitigation programs already initiated in the implementation phase, and continuing through the construction phase, aim to establish actions to proactively mitigate, prevent, control and compensate for the environmental impacts that could be caused by the mining and processing activity to be carried out by the Company once it enters the production phase. These programs and actions, which are described below, are linked to one or more United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Sigma Lithium takes center stage at COP26 for a second time (following COP25 in Madrid) for: its pioneering practices in applying clean technologies to achieve environmental sustainability.

Link to Sigma Lithium co-CEO Interview at Investment COP26 CORPORATE SUMMARY UPDATE On November 5th, 2021, the Company filed a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus (the "Canadian Base Shelf") to qualify the distribution, from time-to-time over a 25-month period, of up to US$250 million of the Company's debt and equity securities. The Canadian Base Shelf was filed in each province and territory of Canada, other than the Province of Quebec. The Company also filed a corresponding shelf registration statement on Form F-10 (the "U.S. Base Shelf") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System. The Canadian Base Shelf remains subject to completion or amendment. The U.S. Base Shelf has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. The Company maintains adequate liquidity and rigorous financial discipline. As of [November 15, 2021], the Company had $32.5 million (US$25.8 million) in cash and cash equivalents, out of which approximately $29.7 million (US$23.6 million) is held in a construction savings account (not subject to any restrictions). ABOUT SIGMA LITHIUM: The Company is developing, with an environmental sustainability focused and ESG-centric strategy, the largest hard rock lithium deposits in the Americas, located in its wholly owned Grota do Cirilo Project in Brazil with the goal of participating in the rapidly expanding global supply chain of electric vehicles. The Company plans to produce 220,000/t annually of environmentally sustainable battery grade lithium concentrate (33,000 t of lithium carbonate equivalent in Phase 1 production), note based on the 2021 updated Feasibility Study Report. In Phase 2 production, if warranted after ongoing feasibility study, production would be increased to 440,000 t (66,000 tonnes of LCE) annually. The first and second phase of production for the Project will utilize as feedstock spodumene from the Project's own mines. Since 2018, the Company has been producing low carbon high purity lithium concentrate at an on-site demonstration pilot plant with the objective to ship samples to potential customers for product certification and testing. This pilot production has been an important part of the successful commercial strategy of the Company allowing it to ship samples of its low carbon "green & sustainable" high purity lithium to leading global potential customers, for product certification and testing. The Company is in pre-construction and detailed engineering of the Production Plant, which is to be an environmentally friendly, fully automated, dense media separator production plant that applies proprietary algorithms to digitally control the dense media ("DMS"). The Production Plant will be vertically integrated into the Company \'ccs mining operations, exclusively utilizing as feedstock the high purity spodumene ore with exceptional mineralogy from the Project. The Production Plant will process the spodumene ore into a high purity 6% battery-grade lithium concentrate engineered to the specifications of its customers in the lithium- ion battery supply chain for electric vehicles. In order to secure a leading position supplying the clean mobility and green energy storage value chains, the Company has adhered consistently to the highest standards of environmental, social and governance practices, which were established as part of its core purpose at inception in 2012. Its production process will be powered by clean energy and the Company will use state-of-the art water recirculation circuits in its processing combined with dry stacking tailings management. The DMS process of the Production Plant does not utilize hazardous chemicals, as a result its tailings are 100% recyclable into ancillary industries, such as ceramics. The Company has been developing a plan to submit to its Board outlining strategic steps to achieve net zero carbon emission targets by 2024. A key initiative is to introduce biofuels in the mining operations after the second year of production. It also plans to pursue generation of carbon credits through "in-setting" carbon credits (preserving and developing the agroforestry systems within its regional ecosystem). The Company is currently undergoing an independent assessment of its net carbon footprint, conducting an independent ISO 14000 compliant audit of its life cycle analysis together with an independent expert validation of its carbon credits generated by its internal preservation, reforestation, and compensation forestry programs. The Company expects to complete this work stream in the first quarter of 2022. Sigma has significant potential for additional future expansion and growth, as it owns 27 mineral rights spread over 191 km2 (which include mining concessions, applications for mining concessions, exploration authorizations and applications for mineral exploration authorizations). The Grota do Cirilo Project area includes nine past producing lithium mines.

The COP26 deal faltered within 48 hours as the United States and Australia, two of the world's largest emitters, suggested that they would not set new climate targets next year. A key clause in the Glasgow Climate Pact asks countries to set out fresh plans to cut emissions between now and 2030 by the end of 2022. The clause is an effort to push more ambitious action over the next decade, which is considered crucial to stem the most dangerous effects of global warming. A joint statement released by Australia's foreign and emissions reduction ministers on Sunday read: "Australia's 2030 target is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it, as we did with our Kyoto-era targets." Australia has come under fire for failing to set ambitious climate targets, with its aims barely updated ahead of this year's conference. The country is still heavily reliant on coal. Appearing on ABC talk show Insiders, Greg Hunt, Australia's health minister, also hinted that the country might not make its aims more ambitious. "We've set our target. But what we'll continue to do is update our projections," he said. The country's plan involves cutting emissions by 26 to 28 per cent compared with 2005. The pact also states that global emissions need to fall by 45 per cent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels in order to limit global warming to 1.5C. During the COP26 The U.S. cited language in the agreement that "requests" parties update their plans "as necessary" and "taking into account different national circumstances". John Kerry, the US climate envoy, said that the country's existing climate plans fulfilled the requirements in the Paris Agreement to limit temperature rises to below 2C and make efforts towards limiting them to 1.5C. Speaking hours after the agreement was finalized on Saturday, Kerry said: "The language is 'necessary', I don't expect it's going to be necessary because our ambitious goal is 50 to 52 per cent [emissions cuts] and that's stretching the limits right now. We need to see what's doable." On Monday in the House of Commons, Boris Johnson also suggested that the U.K. would not update its targets. "The U.K. is already compliant with 1.5 as a result of pledges made by 2030 and 2035, so if we can deliver on those we believe we will be able to restrain our emissions," the Prime Minister said. The Glasgow Pact was also hailed for mentioning a phaseout of fossil fuel subsidies and a "phase-down" of coal for the first time in a UN pact, though the coal language was watered down at the last moment following an intervention by India and China. Richard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said he thought it was also "very unlikely" that the EU would update its pledges. "Their priority should be to get stuff done that they've pledged already," he said. "China very unlikely, I think, given the geopolitics. India very unlikely. They'll feel they've made their contribution here. I think the opportunity lies in some other countries," Black added, naming South Africa and Brazil. During the conference South Africa secured U.S., U.K. and EU funding to help it transition away from coal, and both Brazil and Australia have elections next year in which challengers may make more ambitious climate pledges as part of their pitch to voters, he said. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

World leaders promised to protect Earth's forests, cut methane emissions and help South Africa wean itself off coal at the UN climate summit Tuesday - part of a flurry of deals intended to avert catastrophic global warming. Britain hailed the commitment by more than 100 countries to end deforestation in the coming decade as the first big achievement of the conference in the Scottish city of Glasgow, known as COP26 - but experts noted such promises have been made and broken before. More than 120 world leaders were heading home after two days in which they received stark warnings about the state of the Earth from Johnson, naturalist David Attenborough, Queen Elizabeth II and - most powerfully - the people of countries and regions already facing climate upheaval. Johnson said at a news conference that it was important to "guard against false hope," but added that he was "cautiously optimistic" about the outcome of the talks. The conference aims to keep the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial levels - the goal set at the Paris climate conference six years ago. The U.K. said it has received pledges from leaders representing more than 85% of the world's forests to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Among them are several countries with massive forests, including Brazil, China, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia, Russia and the United States. More than $19 billion in public and private funds have been pledged toward the plan. The Associated Press \</doc>

Premier Jason Kenney and his ministers will not be heading to Scotland to take part in the COP26 climate summit that begins next week. On Monday, the premier said he won't attend the high-profile conference with the province still in a public health emergency. "We are not travelling unless it is absolutely essential. I think just one more politician flying into a gabfest in Glasgow is not going to make any meaningful difference," he said Monday at the legislature. "We have expressed great concern to the government of Canada about its ever-changing (emissions) targets ... What we are asking for and what the Canadian energy industry is asking for is clarity and predictability when it comes to climate policy." The COP26 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is headed to Italy this week for a meeting of the G20, is expected to attend the first two days of the conference. Quebec Premier Francois Legault has also announced he will attend. "We are all working with further ambition as we move forward to Glasgow," federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson told reporters Monday. "While Paris was about promises, I think Glasgow six years later is also about trust and delivery." What comes out of the meeting could be of significance to this province, which has among the world's largest oil reserves. At the 2015 Paris meeting, which then-premier Rachel Notley and several counterparts attended, Canada agreed to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Since then, the Trudeau government has adopted a national price on carbon and will introduce a clean fuel standard next year. In April, it announced a new goal of cutting emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2030. And the oil and gas industry will be given five-year climate targets from the federal government. It's easy to set tough goals; reaching them is the tricky part. Between 2005 and 2019, Canada's total emissions only dipped by 1.1 per cent, according to federal data. The oil and gas sector will be watching the discussions up close. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers will be sending a small delegation to COP26 , including CEO Tim McMillan. "We should pursue an energy evolution that will allow for Canadian resources to attract investment and help meet growing global demand," McMillan said in a statement. The industry is making moves to lower emissions. Oilsands producers Cenovus Energy, Imperial Oil, Suncor Energy, Canadian Natural Resources and MEG Energy formed a new alliance this year to work together to hit net-zero targets by 2050. Last week, the Oilsands Pathways to Net-Zero initiative released more details on achieving its target of reducing 68 megatonnes of emissions from oilsands operations. The group says companies will use a variety of technologies to reach their objective, such as electrifying operations, improving energy efficiency and developing carbon capture, utilization and storage projects. The pressing issue is exactly how will the country achieve these national targets? The COP26 talks could provide additional clarity. Alberta's emissions are the highest in the country and have gone up 17 per cent since 2005. On Monday, the British Columbia government unveiled a tougher provincial climate plan that it says will reduce emissions by 40 per cent below 2007 levels by 2030. In Edmonton, Kenney said Alberta will be releasing its own updated climate strategy later this year. While Alberta has targets for lowering methane emissions and a carbon pricing system for large industrial facilities, it does not have an overall emissions goal in place. "I will not be setting a target for Alberta itself, I will be presenting a climate plan that allows our industries to reach their goals ... including their net-zero goals," Environment Minister Jason Nixon said in an interview. "That will be in contrast to the ways the feds have done this, which is the opposite - to put a dartboard up in the minister of environment's office and throw a dart at a target. We reject that." But Alberta's plan should have specific details and timelines, with accountability mechanisms in place and sector-by-sector approaches, said Chris Severson-Baker of the Pembina Institute. "This government doesn't have a target, doesn't have a plan to achieve (a) target and that doesn't help companies in this province who are trying to figure out how to create economic opportunities or how to make good on their own net-zero plans," he said. Nixon pointed out the province announced plans last September to spend $750 million from its Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction fund, which collects carbon levies from heavy emitters. He will be announcing plans to commit about $175 million for projects that will lower emissions and create about 9,000 jobs. It will include money going into agriculture and municipal projects, oil and gas initiatives, recycling technologies and transportation. It's another move in a long journey for this province. The next big step could begin in Scotland in the coming days. Chris Varcoe is a Calgary Herald columnist. HYPERLINK cvarcoe@postmedia.com \</doc>

The Queen has been pictured back on duty at her desk, as Buckingham Palace confirmed she would not travel to Glasgow to speak at the COP26 summit. The Queen, who has recently been unwell and was taken to hospital for tests, has "regretfully decided" not to make the journey to Scotland, saying she is "disappointed" not to be able to attend. She will instead deliver a pre-recorded speech to delegates due to be filmed at Windsor Castle later this week. On Tuesday she was seen smiling on camera as she held virtual audiences with ambassadors - heeding the advice of doctors who told her to limit herself to "light duties." She appeared in good spirits last night, prior to a call with Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, ahead of the budget, but a spokesman confirmed the journey to Glasgow on Monday had been cancelled. "Following advice to rest, the Queen has been undertaking light duties at Windsor Castle. "Her Majesty has regretfully decided that she will no longer travel to Glasgow to attend the evening reception of COP26 on Monday, Nov. 1," he said. "Her Majesty is disappointed not to attend the reception but will deliver an address to the assembled delegates via a recorded video message." A source emphasized the Queen's hopes that other leaders would not use her absence as an excuse to avoid the summit, and that she was "very much" wanting COP26 to be a success. Her video message will urge world leaders to take "meaningful actions" on climate change. Buckingham Palace announced the change of plans in order to avoid the appearance of a last-minute health emergency for the Queen. A source said she "remains in good spirits". The Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will all attend the Glasgow summit. Wearing a bright yellow dress and pearl necklace she was seen smiling on screen with her hands in her lap, in front of her large computer screen as she spoke to ambassadors. The Queen's folded glasses sat on a table in front of her along with several pages of typed briefing notes. Filmed at Windsor and beamed into Buckingham Palace, where her guests were waiting, she greeted Gunn Kim, South Korea's envoy to the UK, who was dressed in traditional costume including a hat known as a gat. The Queen also held a virtual audience with Switzerland's Markus Leitner, who was accompanied by his wife Nicole. Both ambassadors travelled to Buckingham Palace to join the video call, and presented their credentials - their predecessors'Letters of Recall and their own Letters of Credence - on an antique wooden table in front of the screen. Last week the 95-year-old monarch took the unusual step of cancelling a trip to Northern Ireland at the last minute, having "reluctantly" accepted medical advice to rest. On Wednesday, she spent the night at the King Edward VII hospital in London having undergone tests for unexplained symptoms. The Daily Telegraph !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

I hope Prime Minister Justin Trudeau enjoyed his European vacation, virtue signalling with 40,000 others in Glasgow, because the vast majority of Canadians have little faith the vast expenditure of fossil fuels to get there and back will amount to a hill of beans. Even the world's leading teenage green warrior Greta Thunberg has denounced COP26 as nothing more than a "PR exercise" and a "failure." It's a whole lot of appearing to be doing something without actually doing anything while drinking their fill of Guinness and Glennfiddich for two weeks. For some reason, this could not have been done over a series of virtual meetings and conferences, as the rest of the world has operated for the last two years. Instead tens of thousands of people - during an active pandemic, mind you - piled into their planes and jets powered by positive thinking and trains and cars fuelled by socially responsible policy to gather together to talk about the wonderful things the rest of the world needs to do. Trudeau and the 200+ (some reports saying as many as 277) Canadian delegates were all-in on more agreements than one could shake a recycled stick at - including pacts to reduce methane emissions and ending financing of fossil fuel projects that are not carbon neutral, among others - but even if we hit every single goal as a country, it won't make a lick of difference to the global goal. Not when Canada produces about half a gigaton of carbon dioxide with a global output of more than 36 gigatons - that's about 1.3% of total output. We could go down to zero carbon output and the rest of the world would blink and continue on. The world's largest emitter, China, which accounts for 9.3GT or 25.8% of the world's output, was a no-show for most of the two-week party which wrapped up on Friday, knowing how much of a political farce it is. Canadians see right through this global navel gazing, regardless of their stance on the impacts of climate change. A poll from Angus Reid Institute have 43% of respondents not confident at all that the major global emitters will make meaningful progress on controlling or reducing their emissions coming out of the conference, while another 42% were not that confident. Seven percent were not sure while only 9% had any faith in the process. The poll also found 71% of respondents believe climate change is fact and is mostly caused by human activities and another 19% believe climate change is fact and is mostly caused by natural changes and cycles. Canada and the rest of the world came up short on the Paris Agreement coming out of COP21 in 2015 and that was initially with the inclusion of China. The world, of course will go through this exercise in global virtue signalling again next year. This, of course, does not mean we need to throw our hands up and say we are screwed. But neither does it mean we should tank our economy all for public appearances while propping up foreign oil from countries that care as much about climate change as that jacked-up F350 that coal rolls you at intersections. We can spout these grandiose ideas about carbon neutral, but we are in no way in a position to turn off the tap, and likely will not be by 2030. Nor should we be going whole hog on technologies like electric cars which may not produce carbon while on the road, but have severe environmental impacts at every other stage of their production and life. We also still have not addressed the endangered elephant in the room that we live in an often Arctic climate and wind and solar - even in the government's own reports - is less than reliable. It sounds great in Southern California or in the desert, it is something altogether different in Edmonton or Winnipeg or Saskatoon in February. Environmentalism cannot be all about taxing the population through their carbon footprint. We need to focus on better forest management to prevent forest fires which emit massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. We need to focus on alternative programs like carbon capture technology and wetland protection and responsible farming - all of which have taken huge strides. But it's not near as sexy on the world scene when you can talk about your badass carbon tax and how you're going to keep oil in the ground, almost just to spite an entire region of your own country. We need real solutions, not handshakes and hollow one-dimensional promises. HYPERLINK mailto:jaldrich@postmedia.com jaldrich@postmedia.com \</doc>

A new draft agreement for the UN climate conference in Glasgow Friday presses countries to be more ambitious in their plans to tackle global warming, while walking a fine line between the demands of developing and richer nations. While the proposal retained its core demand for nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, vulnerable countries said they needed a more ambitious deal on financial compensation, with contributions from rich countries responsible for global warming going to poorer countries facing huge costs from worsening storms, droughts and rising sea levels. The new draft download, which attempts to ensure the world will tackle global warming fast enough to stop it becoming catastrophic, is a balancing act - trying to take in the demands of climate-vulnerable nations, the world's biggest polluters, and nations whose economies rely on fossil fuels. Some countries said the proposal would keep within reach the Paris Agreement's aspirational target to cap global warming at 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, the limit scientists say would avert its most severe impacts. \</doc>

Consumers invited to show solidarity with farmers by signing a petition urging governments to act NOW WASHINGTON, Oct. 6, 2021 /CNW/ --An open letter sent on behalf of 1.8 million Fairtrade producers worldwide, ahead of COP26 , urges world leaders to keep their promise to provide $100 billion in annual finance to low-income nations disproportionately hit by the climate crisis. 1.8 million Fairtrade producers worldwide urge world leaders to make good on their climate promise leading up to COP26 The letter criticizes rich nations most responsible for climate change for not honoring their pledges to cut their emissions and adequately support farmers suffering the worst effects of climate breakdown. Signed by representatives of Fairtrade producer networks in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the letter warns governments that their lack of action is threatening farmers' livelihoods and global food supplies. Titled 'Be fair with your climate promise,' it says: "We grow the food eaten by people all around the world... But our ability to do so has been badly damaged by the reckless harm done to our environment from years of broken promises concerning the climate crisis. "You promised to cut the emissions that drive extreme weather, which dry up our fields one day and flood them the next. But emissions are increasing dangerously, while your ambition remains too low. You promised to provide climate finance, to help us keep growing food despite the changing weather. But next to nothing is reaching us." Eighty percent of the world's food comes from 500 million family farms. Farmers in climate-vulnerable countries are already using their expertise to deliver climate solutions, but it is not enough: financial support is critical, they say. The letter also urges governments to strengthen business rules on environmental protection and to promote fair, low-carbon trade deals. A delegation of Fairtrade farmers will attend the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, this November to deliver the letter in person. Fairtrade is mobilizing ethical shoppers to support the farmers' call for action by signing a global petition, available on its digital campaignhub. Fairtrade's Be Fair With Your Climate Promise campaign is a critical call for action at a time when systemic change in trade is not happening quickly enough. About Fairtrade Fairtrade is committed to fighting the climate crisis, through its programs, training and Standards, which encourage producers to protect the environment. Visit HYPERLINK .

The COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, saw HYPERLINK https://unfccc-cop26.streamworld.de/webcast/us-delegation-cop26-update-3 incremental progress on addressing climate change . HYPERLINK https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/world/cop26-pledges-climate-change-analysis/index.html But even if countries meet their current commitments to reduce emissions , the planet is on course to HYPERLINK https://climateactiontracker.org/press/Glasgows-one-degree-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/ heat up 2.4 C by the end of the century . This warming will submerge low-lying islands and coastal regions and lead to climate disasters globally. Despite knowing this, it HYPERLINK remains difficult for governments to address the climate crisis . Part of the reason is the phenomena of HYPERLINK https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291353557_Challenging_Climate_Change_The_Denial_Countermovement climate change denial HYPERLINK https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346088327_Sources_and_Amplifiers_of_Climate_Change_Denial obstructionism and HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1111/cars.12211 the lobbying and public relations efforts of the fossil fuel sector . We are three sociologists who study social aspects of climate change, environmental politics and other environmental issues. One of us (David) attended the climate summit in Glasgow, as well as the Paris conference in 2015. The most recent conference illustrates the shifts in the tactics used by climate change deniers towards what we call "climate change denial 2.0." Climate change denial HYPERLINK https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/usd/handbook-of-anti-environmentalism-9781839100215.html Climate change denial takes several forms . The "classic" form involves HYPERLINK https://www.asanet.org/sociological-view-effort-obstruct-action-climate-change strategic action by organizations to challenge or spread doubt that human-caused climate change is real. As several analysts have shown, organized climate change denial has played a major role in shaping HYPERLINK media coverage , HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.06.003 public opinion and HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1080/08941920.2020.1783730 thwarting progress on climate change policy for the past three decades. Some of the key players include: HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1533-8525.2011.01198.x corporations, conservative think tanks and foundations ; wealthy individuals (such as Charles and David Koch), who help fund HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-1018-7 key organizations involved in climate change denial ; HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2241-z lobbying firms and HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764212469800 conservative media . Researchers who have studied the relationships among these groups found they constitute a HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2875 climate change denial movement network . This network has thwarted effective national level climate policy, especially in the United States. It has also contributed to slowing efforts at addressing climate change in other countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. For example, according to an HYPERLINK https://www.policynote.ca/climate-leadership-plan-big-oils-boardroom/ investigation by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives , the fossil fuel industry played a central role in crafting British Columbia's disappointing 2016 climate change plan. In addition, key government meetings were held at the headquarters of Canada's largest fossil fuel industry lobbying organization, where lobbyists reportedly led an effort to weaken the text. Climate change denial 2.0 While outright climate denial works to varying degrees in the context of domestic politics in some countries, it would not be credible in HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/conference/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021 the forum of the COP process Newer forms of this phenomenon might be called climate change denial 2.0. Backers do not deny that climate change is real or serious. Instead they HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2020.13 undermine the need to take immediate bold action, and obstruct progress on decarbonization . A recent incident during a COP26 plenary held on Nov. 4 illustrates this. The plenary was devoted to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) recent report on the physical science basis for climate change, part of the HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/ Sixth Assessment report HYPERLINK India had previously requested that a section on mitigation be removed, as well as references to to low-probability high-risk events (like the collapse of Antarctic ice sheets), and again insisted that these changes be made. Read more: Coal: why China and India aren't the climate villains of COP26 This all seemed somewhat incongruous to both the audience and the presenters. While the IPCC reports inform the COP negotiations, they are separate, independent, prior processes, and are based on science not political considerations. Nevertheless, this intervention highlights denial 2.0 efforts. Denial efforts during negotiations Denial 2.0 efforts often involve the symbolic politics of saying the right things on climate change, while nudging or redirecting climate policy to minimize its impacts on the interests of the fossil fuel sector. Heading into the conference Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia were among those countries that asked the United Nations "to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels," as HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58982445 a document leak reported by BBC revealed . At COP26 HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-59199484 fossil fuel interests also had an outsized presence . There were HYPERLINK https://www.globalwitness.org/en/press-releases/hundreds-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-flooding-cop26-climate-talks/ 503 fossil fuel lobbyists accredited for the meetings , more than the number of accredited delegates for any single country. NGO representatives noted there were about https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/cop26-glasgow-oil-gas-lobbyists-b1953513.html twice as many fossil fuel lobbyists present as accredited Indigenous representatives , even though HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1086/707823 Indigenous Peoples are among the most negatively affected by climate change . Push back against climate denial The environmental movement has mobilized against messages of climate denial and efforts to maintain and expand the fossil fuel energy sector. Climate activists have been vocal in their support for a just transition away from fossil fuels. HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1002/wcc.683 Their tactics include This played out in Glasgow with the HYPERLINK Climate Strike organized by Fridays for the Future , which was attended by 25,000 people on Nov. 6. Youth activists and Fridays for Future (along with with other groups) also established HYPERLINK the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty , which pushes for the rapid phase out of fossil fuels. It has now been endorsed by HYPERLINK https://fossilfueltreaty.org/youth-letter 150 legislators from 30 countries, as well as by 100 Nobel Prize laureates, and several thousand scientists . Furthermore, a group co-chaired by Denmark and Costa Rica launched the HYPERLINK Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance These actions have been important in helping to shape discourse about the need for climate action, focusing the attention of the the general public and influencing the leaders of some countries. Indeed, youth climate activists were frequently mentioned by world leaders during their speeches inside COP26 . For the first time in 26 years of COP meetings, HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/310475 the text of the final agreement It would seem that pressure from the fossil fuel sector, and from countries with significant interests in fossil fuels, including India and China, prevented the text from calling directly for the phase out of fossil fuels. HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.29173/cjs29638 In denial 2.0 fashion The structure of the COP process, which is multilateral and consensus-based, makes it difficult to move beyond the lowest common denominator, as any single country with a significant fossil fuel interest can either weaken or sink an otherwise stronger multilateral agreement. COP26 was yet another win for the fossil-fuel sector, but a loss for the planet.

TRANSALTA CORP ("TAC-N") - Recognized at COP26 Powering the World Past Coal Event As the world gathers at COP26 to take action on the threat of climate change and keep the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C within reach, TransAlta Corporation ("TransAlta" or the "Company") was pleased to participate at the Powering the World Past Coal event at COP26 , in Glasgow, Scotland. At the event, TransAlta and 27 new members joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance (the "Alliance") where the new members were announced by the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom, Co-Chairs of the Alliance. The Alliance is a global organization of governmental and private sector organizations working to take action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity generation and accelerate the energy transition. TransAlta's President and CEO, John Kousinioris, stated, "Our decision to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance is a natural extension of the Company's commitment to delivering clean energy solutions for our customers, strong returns for our investors, and reliable energy for the communities that we serve. Our growth plan will expand our renewable electricity fleet by two gigawatts over the next five years and deploy energy storage at a much larger scale. We look forward to continuing our contribution to global efforts to deliver an accelerated clean energy transition." TransAlta has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 61 per cent over 2005 levels and has a 2030 target that equates to a 70 per cent reduction compared to 2005 levels. TransAlta's transition away from coal-fired generation started in 2019 and by the end of 2021, the Company will end coal-fired generation in Canada. Through this process, TransAlta will eliminate 2,135 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity from its fleet and will have converted a further 1,259 megawatts to gas-fired generation, consistent with the regulatory frameworks set out by the governments of Canada and Alberta. The Company's sole remaining coal-fired unit in the U.S. will also cease operations at the end of 2025. By that time, the Company will have also delivered on its plan to grow its leading renewable portfolio by two gigawatts, which will result in 70 per cent of the Company's EBITDA being generated by renewables. The Company is well positioned to leverage its significant expertise across a variety of geographies and technologies. TransAlta's ongoing focus is to be a leading provider in the renewables space, bringing solutions that work for its customers and the communities that it serves.

CALGARY - Ottawa surprised the country's natural resources industry with the appointment of a former Greenpeace activist as Canada's new environment minister this week, but experts don't expect additional surprises as the global COP26 climate conference begins in Glasgow this weekend. Canada's newly sworn-in Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault said Friday that the country "has one of the world's most detailed and credible climate plans, including the second most stringent carbon pricing system in the world." Guilbeault, who is also a co-founder of Quebec environmental group \'c9quiterre, also took stressed that his role as environment minister means he's accountable to Canada, not the environmental activists expected to attend COP26 in Glasgow, which begins Oct. 31. "I'm very aware that those activists will be holding my feet to the fire and I welcome their attention and focus, but I also know that I work for all Canadians and must make this transition work for everyone," Guilbeault said Friday. "As we look across Canada, it is the energy producing regions that have the most potential to gain by getting the climate fight right and we have to get it right." Earlier this week, Guilbeault said "Our plan on climate change is very clear, most of it is already known," he said, adding that he had "no secret agenda." Indeed, experts do not expect Ottawa to unveil a series of new climate targets in Glasgow over the course of the two-week conference. They do, however, expect global policymakers to provide additional details on a push to eliminate coal-fired power from the electricity mix around the world, for a move toward a net-zero power grid and, potentially, for action on a global carbon credit market. The UN summit, known as COP26 and delayed one year by COVID-19, is intended to finalize the rule book for the Paris accord, including how carbon emissions trading can work between countries and what each country has to report about progress toward climate goals. International officials are also trying to ramp up efforts to curb global warming, with the risk of failure hanging over their heads amid mounting tensions over unmet funding promises. Guilbeault said he is "cautiously optimistic" about how talks will progress, citing a joint report from Canada and Germany this week that they expect rich countries to step up on a pledge to provide developing nations with US$100 billion in annual aid to tackle global warming - a decade-old commitment that has so far fallen short. "That being said, it's not always enough to show up. We can't always agree," he said at a virtual news conference Friday. "These are difficult negotiations. Everyone is not necessarily ready to do more or do more faster," he added in French. Meanwhile, negotiations ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Rome dragged into Friday, stuck on energy and climate issues. Some countries singled out China, saying it is refusing to beef up commitments to limit temperature increases and digging in over coal, with Russia and India also dragging the chain. Hopes are dim for COP26 in light of the G20 summit's dithering efforts. COP26 )," said Michael Bernstein, executive director at Clean Prosperity in Toronto. "The most important COP is, I would say, for countries to come and raise their ambitions and Canada has already done that part of it, including putting out a detailed plan for how they are going to get there." Bernstein said one of the big problems he expects countries at COP26 to tackle is a system for recognizing carbon credits and also for eliminating potential double counting of carbon credits. "That's pretty important because you don't want to get countries double counting their emissions reductions," Bernstein said, noting that carbon credits used in Quebec are sometimes generated from emissions reductions in California. He said it's important that those credits are counted only once, rather than once in each jurisdiction. Earlier this month, Canada set a target of cutting its methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 and by cutting its oil and gas methane emissions by 75 per cent over the same time frame. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attends a news conference in The Hague, Netherlands on Oct. 29, 2021. In April, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the country would cut its CO2 emissions by 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The country's previous target was a 36 per cent reduction by that period. At the COP21 climate conference in Paris in 2015, Canada committed to cutting its CO2 emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Experts do not expect additional commitments. "Are we doing enough in those areas to reduce existing methane emissions?" she said.

It's important that Canada set achievable emissions targets and then stick to them, rather than constantly shifting those targets in an effort to gain green credibility, said Marla Orenstein, director of the natural resources centre at the Canada West Foundation in Calgary. When Trudeau announced during his re-election campaign in September that he would shift emissions reductions deadlines from 2030 to 2025 for oil and gas producers, Orenstein said the industry lost some faith that real targets were being set. "I'm not opposed to where we're all heading, but if it's not done in a reasonable manner, then it makes everyone just look foolish," Orenstein said, noting that 2025 targets are likely unachievable and the country's biggest emitters are continuing to push toward their 2030 targets. A new analysis by Clean Prosperity released this week suggested the Liberal climate plan could meet Canada's greenhouse gas emissions targets for the first time before the end of this decade on the back of promises to end the sale of gas-powered cars and create an emissions-free power grid, both by 2035, as well as capping emissions from oil and gas and then forcing them downward, no later than 2025.

GLASGOW The head of the UN climate conference recognized on Wednesday that countries'climate pledges so far do too little to tame global warming and urged countries to "get to work" to strike an ambitious deal over the remaining two days of talks. A draft of the COP26 conclusions, released earlier in the day received a mixed response from climate activists and experts. Almost 200 countries present in Glasgow have until the close of the two-week meeting on Friday to agree a final text. In an implicit acknowledgment that current pledges are insufficient to avert climate catastrophe, the draft asks countries to "revisit and strengthen" by the end of next year their targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions up to 2030. "What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren," said Britain's Alok Sharma, the COP26 president. "So I request us all collectively to please roll up our sleeves and get to work." "Let's not give in on anything and continue to be more ambitious, we call on those countries who have not yet done so, to scale up their efforts now," he told reporters. Negotiations are likely to be fierce over the next two days. While some developed countries point the finger at major polluters such as China, India and Russia, poorer nations accuse the rich world of failing to keep promises of financial help for them to deal with the ravages of climate change. The overarching goal of the conference is to keep alive hopes of capping global temperatures at 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, which is far out of reach on the basis of countries'current emissions cutting pledges. The document urged countries to speed up efforts to stop burning coal and to phase out fossil fuel subsidies - taking direct aim at the coal, oil and gas that produce carbon dioxide, the primary contributor to man-made climate change, though it did not set a fixed date for phasing them out. The talks are widely viewed as unlikely to clinch enough pledges to nail down the 1.5 C goal this week. But by locking in rules to require countries to upgrade their pledges further next year - a key request from nations most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change - it aims to at least keep the target in sight. Sharma said he would not seek an extension of the conference beyond Friday's scheduled closure. Soberingly, the Climate Action Tracker research group said on Tuesday that all the national pledges submitted so far to cut greenhouse gases by 2030 would, if fulfilled, allow the Earth's temperature to rise 2.4 C. It said if longer-term targets, many of which are not backed up by concrete action plans, were also fulfilled, warming could be held below 2 C. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal of the environmental campaign group WWF said the text "recognizes the shortfall of current ambition and the scale of the task we have in front of us," and that it must be "a floor, not a ceiling." \</doc>

One would really have to isolate themselves to not know that climate change is one of our planet's most pressing issues. Discussions about climate change by countries, territories, provinces and cities has yielded commitments to reach net-zero emission targets by mid-century. It boggles my mind that in addition to feeling Alberta should have a say in Canada's 2050 net-zero emissions target (which matches that of other G7 countries), Alberta's UCP leadership did not send representatives to the COP26 conference in Glasgow. This is a dereliction of duty by the UCP and demonstrates a lack of leadership in our provincial government. To expect Prime Minister Trudeau to boost Alberta at the conference is ludicrous. The UCP seems to prefer reacting to events rather than being proactively present. The proactive, simple and correct choice for COP26 was to have a UCP representative, preferably Kenney, represent Alberta and Alberta's interests at the conference. David A. Weir, Edmonton Blaming Hinshaw for fourth wave shameful Watching Tuesday's evening news, I was furious to see Premier Kenney throw Dr. Deena Hinshaw under the bus for the fourth wave. Whatever decisions were made, weren't Dr. Hinshaw's to make. They were yours, Premier. The buck stops with you. You're the premier. I am a hardcore, true-blue, born-and-raised Alberta conservative, and I have voted conservative my entire life. That is never going to change. But if you're the premier and leader of the UCP in 2023, I simply will not vote - marking the first and only election I failed to do my civic duty. Clearly for me, the NDP is not a viable alternative in 2023, but neither are you Premier Kenney. I am from a generation who worked for what I wanted, and never once took a handout for something I could earn myself. I raised my children to be the same. We stood accountable for the decisions we made, and accepted the consequences. To throw Dr. Hinshaw under the bus to avoid accepting the fallout from your ill-timed "Best Summer Ever" is cowardly, shameful and unworthy of my vote. Shame on you. It is time to resign, and save yourself the embarrassment of being removed at the leadership review. S.C. Thomas, St. Albert Oilsands researcher could help Trump next Re.

DEEPMARKIT CORP ("MKT-V;MKTDF-0") - Strategic Initiative to Explore the Minting of Renewable Energy - Certificates DeepMarkit Corp., ("DeepMarkit" or the "Company") (TSXV: MKT) (OTC: MKTDF) (FRA: DEP), a company focused on transitioning the global carbon offset market to the more accessible digital economy by minting credits into non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"), is pleased to announce that it has embarked on a strategic initiative to explore the minting of Renewable Energy Certificates ("RECs") into NFTs via its proprietary MintCarbon.io platform. RECs, also known as green tags or tradable renewable certificates, are non-tangible energy commodities that represent proof that one megawatt hour ("MWh") of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable energy source. The global REC market was valued at US$12.7 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach US$100 billion by 2030.1 By comparison, the voluntary carbon credit market surpassed $1 billion in market value in November 2021.2 The increase in demand for electricity around the world and company policies to reach certain renewable energy consumption targets, combined with the increase in renewable energy market share, are driving growth in the REC market. Until recently, the market's growth has been restrained by opaque regulations, general inaccessibility and the lack of awareness by developing countries that could benefit from a transparent and accessible platform like the MintCarbon.io platform. MintCarbon.io is expected to play an important role in assisting projects by providing an additional avenue of monetization, while better articulating a project's story and enabling new forms of engagement. Management Commentary "RECs represent a significant market segment for DeepMarkit. Based on input from our corporate development team, the MintCarbon.io platform's ability to seamlessly integrate RECs, combined with positive feedback received from renewable energy sector participants, make our decision to explore entering into this market an easy one, while remaining fully committed to our current carbon credit minting model," said Ranjeet Sundher, Interim CEO of DeepMarkit. ABOUT DEEPMARKIT DeepMarkit Corp. is a company focused on democratizing access to the voluntary carbon offset market by minting credits into non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"). Its common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the "MKT" stock symbol. DeepMarkit's wholly owned subsidiary, First Carbon Corp. ("FCC"), is a software infrastructure company operating in the tokenization vertical of the blockchain. FCC's primary asset, MintCarbon.io, is a web-based, software-as-a-service platform that facilitates the minting of carbon credits into NFTs (based on the ERC-1155 standard) or other secure tokens (based on the ERC-20 standard). MintCarbon.io is currently undergoing testing and FCC anticipates an official launch of the platform in the near future. On behalf of: DEEPMARKIT CORP.

As COP26 concluded, I was asked how Castlegar might eliminate its carbon emissions by 2030. Here\' s my blue-sky list. What if Castlegar created a municipal renewable energy utility similar to Nelson Hydro? The utility could rent flat rooftops and parking lots from commercial and institutional buildings such as the Rec Complex and retail stores. The utility would install gantries in parking lots and install and maintain solar PV systems on the gantries and rooftops. Power generated would be sold to pay rent, capital, and other operating costs with earnings reinvested to eliminate additional carbon emissions. A further investment would be to purchase a service station and convert it into a co-operative for electric vehicles where vehicles can be rented by co-op members and where vehicles can be maintained and stored. There could be rapid charging stations fed by solar PV installed on site. Perhaps the utility would explore commercial gasification of wood waste into DME as a carbon neutral alternative to gasoline, diesel, and natural gas. DME can substitute as a fuel in gas and diesel engines with minor engine modifications rather than scrapping entire vehicles for replacement with electric vehicles. DME can run in natural gas furnaces with minor tweaks. DME gasification is a proven technology so DME could be synthesized profitably and locally at current energy prices. There\' s enough wood waste produced annually within 100 km of Castlegar to make this an option worth exploring. The utility could develop Merry and Boomer Creek for small run-of-river hydro power generation. Both creeks are culverted as they transect the city so environmental impacts would be minimal. The utility could retrofit the Castlegar & District Library to net-zero energy by installing a ground source heat pump under the adjacent park. Such a retrofit could serve as a demonstration project for other commercial and institutional buildings and train trades people to undertake net-zero energy retrofits. Based on Toronto\' s Now House project, the utility could purchase and retrofit a residential house to net-zero energy, open it for public inspection for 12 months, sell it, and repeat. The goal would be to demonstrate how to retrofit houses to net-zero energy and to train trades people with the skills for net-zero energy retro-fits while increasing the inventory of net-zero energy housing. Based on Passive House design, the utility could work with a local commercial or institutional building owner and retrofit the building to net or near net-zero energy so the building\' s energy bill is reduced by a minimum of 80% and the retrofit is completed without requiring building operations to stop. The utility could hire local trades people to craft a reproduction of an old-time paddle wheeler like the S. S. Moyie designed to run on renewable energy. The boat could be moored at theMillenniumWalkwayPark where it would offer river tours:the sunset cruise, the Saturday night dance cruise, the Sunday brunch cruise, the Castlegar to Trail cruise, etc. Project goals would be to create a family-centred tourist attraction that supports Castlegar\' s unique natural environment. Castlegar could lock arms with other municipalities and lobby BC Transit to provide a co-ordinated inter-city bus service across the province that could evolve into inter-city passenger rail service, and renewable energy electric inter-city passenger rail service. Continued on Page A5 Castlegar could design a seven-storey flatiron building between the Pioneer Arena and Columbia Avenue with retail stores on ground level, professional services such as medical offices and labs on the second and third floors, and housing on the upper levels including affordable and accessible housing. The building would be net-zero energy, built from local materials by local trades, and built in consultation with the community as a commu-nity hub. Concurrently, Castlegar could upgrade the Pioneer Arena to expand its use for activities such as a year-round indoor farmers\' market and summer roller skating. Every municipality in B.C. is going to need to generate a similar list as a first step in keeping global warming below 1.5 C and building more sustainable, more resilient communities.

Feminist activists and leaders from around the globe ascended the stage at COP26 to say there is no climate justice without addressing gender equity and human rights for women. Wearing red masks in solidarity with their Indigenous sisters, climate activists spanning the Global South talked to a packed venue about the successes, struggles and what real climate justice must look like during a public event hosted Monday evening by the Women and Gender Constituency, a stakeholder group with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Moderator and international human rights lawyer Kavita Naidu launched the panel by acknowledging that many climate activists were absent at the UN climate conference taking place in Glasgow, Scotland. Many have lost their lives fighting for climate justice, or face the risk of persecution or kidnapping at home, she said. And innumerable other members from the movement couldn't attend due to stumbling blocks created by immigration rules, visas and other challenges posed by the pandemic. Despite the vital importance of a climate conference tasked with confronting a  code red for humanity," COP26 is being roundly criticized for the lack of participation by groups from the Global South, which largely bear the brunt of climate change impacts.  Fundamentally the climate crisis is about justice, Naidu said, noting COP26 \' s blue zone for officials is packed with delegates, corporate partners and trade shows with little acknowledgement of that issue.  This is where we come in as feminist activists, she said.  We need to remind people everywhere that fundamentally the Global North is responsible for climate injustice in this world today, while we in the Global South are facing disproportionate impacts for something that we haven't started, and yet, here we are. Xiomara Acevedo, climate activist and founder of the youth environmental group Barranquilla +20, said her home country of Colombia is one of the richest in the world in terms of biodiversity, yet activists and human rights defenders protecting it must risk their lives. The Colombian government is promoting false solutions that focus on the economic benefits associated with protecting biodiversity, she said.  But we see that [our role] is to protect and conserve this for other generations, she said.  This is the catalog of our national and cultural heritage. Tarcila Rivera Zea, an internationally recognized Peruvian Indigenous activist, said climate justice is tied Indigenous rights and women\' s rights. Any struggle by an individual around securing human rights or fighting for the climate is a struggle for collective rights, Zea said. Women not only give and protect human life but also protect Mother Nature, she said. Women are central to concerns around health, nutrition, food sovereignty, biodiversity protections and an understanding of their lands.  Our knowledge is not the problem. We are not the problem, she said, adding the exploitation of resources by industry and government must be curbed to achieve climate justice. The Women and Gender Constituency has pledged to raise several demands focused around gender, climate justice and human rights at the UN summit where the science is clear that current emissions targets fall well short of what's need to meet the Paris Agreement to keep global warming at 1.5 C. And where promises from the Global North of $100 billion US per year in climate finance to less wealthy nations to fund their climate transitions have not been realized. Marie Christina Kolo, with Ecofeminism Madagascar, said though her nation is a champion of biodiversity it is being ravaged by a number of impacts from climate change including cyclones, flooding, bleaching of coral reefs, and most recently, outbreaks of famine in island nation's southern regions. The humanitarian disaster is a stark indicator of how climate change and the rights of women and children cannot be teased apart, Kolo said.  The sad part is that the women are the most vulnerable and most affected by all these different impacts, she said. Yet women  some suffering under heavy burdens including being unable to cultivate the land or fish the seas as they once could  are often a source of strength and motivation, Kolo noted. She shared the story of a young woman and mother of 13 named Veronique, who had already lost two of her children to starvation. But she became the leader of a cooperative trying to find climate solutions or adaptions in her community, exploring ways to regenerate fish stocks and implement climate-smart agriculture, Kolo said.  She\' s a very strong woman, and today, I can say that she's one of my inspirations. Stories featuring the resilience and successes of women in the Global South tackling climate change are crucial, Naidu said.  It\' s so important that we centre their voices in the work that we do because these are the groups that have the agency to come up with the solutions needed to fight against systems of injustice, she said.  Because it\' s not corporations, and it\' s definitely not our governments, that are coming up with the solutions that we need to hear.

An Ottawa-born animal photographer dodged bushfires in Australia, defied the summer heat in Turkey and snuck onto an industrial farm in Italy under the cover of darkness to snap her winning images in the Earth Project's COP26 photography competition. Jo-Anne McArthur, who was born and raised in Ottawa and now makes her home in Toronto, was ranked in the top three in each of the competition's three galleries. Finalists were determined through online voting and announced during the COP26 climate-change conference, which ended in Glasgow, Scotland on Friday. McArthur's photo of a kangaroo and her joey standing in a burned eucalyptus plantation in Mallacoota, Australia, earned third place in Gallery 1, while a photo of a cow being transported at the Bulgarian-Turkish border tied for third in Gallery 2, and an image of a piglet next to a sow in a cramped crate took first place in Gallery 3. For McArthur, the recognition is a sign that people are realizing the environmental cost of producing animals for food. "There's a lot of wildlife and conservation photography out there in the world," she said in an interview, "but not so much of this kind of investigative work about the billions of animals that we use and how it contributes to climate change and deforestation. We have to face the truth that animal agriculture contributes to 15% of global greenhouse emissions." McArthur has been documenting the plight of animals at the hands of humans for two decades. The 45-year-old vegan is the author of several books and founder of a media agency, We Animals Media, that compiles and distributes her photos and videos, as well as the work of other animal photojournalists. Her most recent book, co-edited with Keith Wilson, came out last year; Hidden: Animals in the Anthropocene features the work of 40 photographers who document animal stories. Growing up in Ottawa's Alta Vista neighbourhood, McArthur was a child who not only loved animals but also had great concern for them. "I always noticed the loneliness of animals in zoos and it made me feel bad," she says. "I paid attention to the dogs kept in backyards and not walked. I saw the animals hit by cars on the side of the road. These are events that always really affected me." After high school, although she majored in English literature and geography at the University of Ottawa, McArthur was most inspired by an elective in black-and-white photography. "By the second class, I knew what I was going to do for the rest of my life. It was magic," she says, crediting her professor, Lorraine Gilbert, as a "phenomenal" teacher. McArthur also developed an interest in conflict photography, and wondered why photojournalists didn't take a similar approach to the animal kingdom. Most animal photographers prefer to shoot beautiful images of their subjects in the name of conservation. "We feel comfortable looking at those animals but it becomes really uncomfortable for us when we look at the animals we eat and the animals we wear," she said. "But they're just as sentient as the tigers and elephants and dogs and cats that we care about so I became quite driven to telling their stories, and showing how their lives are full of pain and suffering." The work is difficult emotionally and often dangerous. To get the shot of the piglet, for example, she teamed up with an NGO and an investigative team to infiltrate an industrial pig farm in Italy's Parma region, sneaking in at night while the others kept watch. Farmers don't want outsiders to see the inner workings of the operation. "People often call what I do breaking and entering but I've never broken anything. I climb fences and I go through open doors, and I will spend as long as I can before daybreak documenting who lives there and what their lives are like," McArthur said. She could see the piglets had been recently castrated, and the wounds looked painful. "It's very awful, it's stressful, it's unpleasant, it's depressing and it's very scary," she said. "Unlike most of my colleagues who have been doing investigative work long term, I have not been caught. We've had lots of red alerts, and we've left many properties quickly and quietly, but I've never been caught." HYPERLINK mailto:lsaxberg@postmedia.com lsaxberg@postmedia.com \</doc>

It's time to put the United Nations' annual global gabfest on climate change out of its misery and ours. This is typical of these conferences as official delegates from around the world hammer out a joint statement, debating over where commas should be placed, in drafting a non-binding document that will be hyped as either a magnificent success or an inglorious failure, depending on which media you believe. The Canadian public has lost faith in these annual farces, where hundreds of global elites fly into wherever the conference is being held on private jets - one of the worst things you can do for the planet when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions - and tens of thousands of delegates, protesters and security forces create a giant carbon footprint over two weeks of rhetoric and demonstrations. Especially appalling, arrogant and hypocritical this year was the UN's decision to hold the conference live instead of by video conferencing, in the middle of a pandemic where ordinary citizens all over the world are being urged not to engage in unnecessary travel. A poll by Angus Reid Institute last week found 84% of Canadians surveyed did not believe that "major global emitters will make meaningful progress on controlling/reducing their emissions during the COP26 conference" compared to only 9% who did, with 7% undecided. That's hardly surprising given that, much like the boy who cried "wolf," UN COP conferences have shredded their credibility over more than a quarter century of dire predictions of imminent climate apocalypse that have failed to come true. Prior to COP26 In 1972, Canadian Maurice Strong, the first director of the UN's environmental program, warned of looming environmental disaster at the UN's Stockholm Conference, although at the time he was talking about fresh water supplies, ocean pollution and urban settlement. In the real world, the UN with a huge assist from the global media, has contributed mightily to "climate porn." That phrase was coined in 2006 by the United Kingdom's Institute for Public Policy and Research, a progressive think tank, to describe the alarmist rhetoric that permeates public discussion of climate change, following an extensive review of government and environmental websites and media coverage. In their paper - Warm Words: How are we telling the climate change story and can we tell it better? - authors Gill Ereaut and Nat Segnit concluded: "Climate change is most commonly constructed through the alarmist repertoire - as awesome, terrible, immense and beyond human control ... It is typified by an inflated or extreme lexicon, incorporating an urgent tone and cinematic codes. "It employs a quasi-religious register of death and doom, and it uses language of acceleration and irreversibility. "The difficulty with it is that the scale of the problem as it is shown excludes the possibility of real action ... by the reader or viewer. It contains an implicit counsel of despair - 'the problem is just too big for us to take on'..." Clearly, the UN's climate of despair has become counterproductive to effective policy. It's time to end it. HYPERLINK lgoldstein@postmedia.com HYPERLINK mailto:lgoldstein@postmedia.com lgoldstein@postmedia.com \</doc>

BRUSSELS - The European Union on Wednesday agreed to back five-year climate targets at the COP26 climate change conference, where countries will attempt to finalize the rules needed to put the Paris Agreement into effect. At the COP26 Environment ministers from EU countries agreed on Wednesday to support the view that countries should set climate targets every five years. Some EU states, including Poland, had wanted an option to set 10 years goals. The EU decision boosts the negotiating position of the United States, African countries and small island states, who also support five-year climate pledges. They say the shorter five-year cycle would keep up pressure on countries to set ambitious targets, and help track whether they are cutting emissions fast enough to avert catastrophic climate change. They also worry that 10-year pledges could let countries with weaker climate goals fly under the radar for a whole decade. China and India are among the countries opposed to a single timeframe. Setting a Paris Agreement pledge every five years would not necessarily change the EU's legally binding targets to cut emissions by 2030 and 2050. Brussels will also set a 2040 emissions-cutting target. For example, the EU could submit a 2035 climate pledge to the U.N. that would estimate where its emissions need to be that year, to stay on track for its 2040 goal.

An end to coal use and fossil fuel subsidies. An accelerated timeline for boosting carbon-cutting pledges. A call for wealthy countries to do more to help their more vulnerable counterparts cope with the toll of climate change -with few details to back it up. These were among the most notable provisions of a seven-page draft agreement circulated at the COP26 The explicit reference to coal and fossil fuels -a first for any U.N. agreement -was a welcome breakthrough to most activists. And the proposal to speed up emissions reductions was seen as a necessary response to recent research showing that current pledges put the Earth on path to warm 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit), a full degree above the Paris Agreement's most ambitious goal. But both provisions could get watered down, or eliminated entirely, as diplomats huddle behind closed doors to shape an agreement all 196 countries would sign. Outside the negotiating rooms, disappointment with the draft's climate finance provisions dominated many discussions Wednesday. Though the document called for developed countries to double funds to help with adaptation, it did not not mention a clear financial mechanism for addressing irreversible harm caused by climate change. Nor did it offer details on what support rich nations would be expected to deliver beyond 2025 -a shortfall that could prove a key sticking point for countries most threatened by rising temperatures. "We should have been talking about increasing climate finance to align with the need, which is trillions of dollars," said Brian O'Callaghan, leader of the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project, which advocates for a sustainable response to the coronavirus pandemic. The draft text, he said, offers "only peanuts for developing countries." One Biden administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to speak publicly, said there had been progress on ensuring that wealthy countries deliver on the long-standing but unfulfilled promise to deliver $100 billion a year to help developing nations adapt to climate impacts and build greener economies. The draft agreement came on a day when Greta Thunberg and other youth activists implored the United Nations to declare a "Level 3 emergency" on climate change -the same level of urgency it gave to the coronavirus pandemic. "Many of us -especially those from small island states and indigenous communities -fear we will have become climate refugees by that time," wrote the group of petitioners, many of whom had filed a separate 2019 petition seeking action, which was later dismissed. "We have no time to wait." The day's official theme was transport, with a coalition of countries, states, cities and automakers signing an agreement to make all new vehicles carbon neutral by 2040 or sooner. Though California, Washington, Ford and General Motors all came on board, the United States was missing from the deal. At a later event, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced the United States aimed to help the aviation sector reach net-zero by 2050. Outside the conference centre, activists rang bicycle bells to protest the absence of cycling from the agenda. Yet the tug of war over the draft agreement continued to draw activists£nd negotiators' attention. Complaints came from some corners that the United States and the European Union weren't doing enough to shape an agreement for more aggressive climate action. There were whispers that nations that have traditionally balked at phasing out fossil fuels, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and others, would do so again. Questions swelled over whether small and economically fragile nations, which often negotiate as a bloc at these talks, would torpedo any deal that doesn't include more financial aid from the developed world. Britain's Alok Sharma, the president of COP26 , has maintained that he wants the summit to set the world on a more sustainable path. On Wednesday, he insisted that any final deal must be credible and meaningful. "We all know what is at stake in these negotiations and the urgency of our task. In very human terms, what we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren. And I know that we will not want to fail them," Sharma said. "So I request us all collectively to please roll up our sleeves and get to work." !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 The Daily Gleaner (Fredericton) \</doc>

The talk of phasing out fossil fuels has started to come up at the Conference Of Parties. Tzeporah Berman, who has been designing environmental advocacy campaigns and environmental policy for 30 years, was the guest speaker at Feb. 10's Southern Alberta Council on Public Affairs. Having recently returned from COP26 - which took place in Scotland - Berman reflected on this year's conference and one particular point which came up. "I would say over from COP26 , this is the first Conference of the Parties there has been included in the text a reference to a fossil fuel, which seems kind of crazy because we know the emissions trapped in our atmosphere blanketing the earth that are causing climate change come from three products, oil, gas and coal. But for literally decades there has been no reference to the need to wind down fossil fuels in order to ensure a stable climate," said Berman, who is currently the International Program Director at Stand.earth and the Chair of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative. "So there was a big debate about that at this COP26 and the result was coal was included as one of those inefficient fossil fuel subsidies and the need to wind them down." Berman said her work is around focusing on the need for planning. "We actually have to acknowledge what's happening and what the causes are in order to plan in a way that leaves no one behind. The debate about oil, gas and coal at COP this year was a bit of a breakthrough." Berman said the planet is already at about 1.2 degrees of warming, noting the fires and flooding in Alberta and B.C. in the past year. "We just lived through a heat dome in B.C. last year, which was terrifying, and hundreds of people died," she said. "So we're all starting to live the impacts of climate change now and every ton of carbon matters, every little bit of a degree matters." The other big issue is around technologies, said Berman. "A lot of the commitments by countries are based on over-estimations of how much carbon we can sequester by planting trees or how much carbon we can sequester from a carbon capture and storage." Berman said she's not someone who says those technologies shouldn't happen. "I think those technologies of sequestering carbon are really important, but it's important to take carbon that's stuck in our atmosphere now, out, not to justify polluting more. "What we've seen in our own countries and certainly the Alberta's government's climate plans, is this dependence on these technologies that are, right now, not working the way we hoped they would. They're expensive and they're going to take a long time to scale. We need to reduce overall emissions and production now if we want to have a stable climate. We also need to plant more trees and protect more forests and do more carbon capture and storage, but that has to be for taking pollution that is already trapped in our atmosphere, not to justify polluting more." The final big issue at COP was around money and equity, said Berman, such as issues of loss and damage and what wealthy countries are putting on the table to help the developing countries leap over the fossil fuel era and address the worst impacts of climate change. "The impacts of climate change in the global south are way more severe and the equity issues come into play because they're not responsible for the carbon that's trapped in our atmosphere today," she said. "It's actually the really wealthy countries who are more responsible. So the commitments on finance were about $20 billion short and slow. The commitments on adaptation were really low. In fact, climate finance to some of the most vulnerable nations, small islands, actually went down at COP26 . So this failure to provide loss of damage support for the global south will cost lives." Berman said she wouldn't say COP26 was a success, but it moved some issues forward. "It's a really critical question," she said. "I think in the last many years we've seen, under Premier Jason Kenney, a real polarization of these issues to such an extent that folks who worry about climate change and understand that we're going to have to move away from oil and gas are vilified, look at the Alberta inquiry and the war room and those things which have happened. "Working on these issues and acknowledging we're going to need to wind down oil and gas production and emissions doesn't make you an enemy of Alberta." Berman said what they're calling for is a plan. "We know Premier Kenney knows all of the major international economic and environmental agencies have put out reports saying the world is going to use less oil and gas in the future, that we need to get to net zero by 2050. "We have 50 countries who have committed to phase out the fossil fuel car, including our own. So as we start to electrify transport as people move more to renewables at scale, which are now cheaper than fossil fuels in almost every major market, we're going to use less oil and gas." Berman said no one is saying to turn off the taps overnight and everyone is out of work. "What we're saying is stop expanding oil and gas production. Let's put that money and energy into expanding electrification in renewables and systems that are cleaner and safer and let's make a plan for how many people are going to be employed in Alberta this year, next year and the year after if we're ramping down. "So by denying this is happening and just pushing to expand we're hurting the economic future of Alberta and workers and their families." \</doc>

New Brunswick must plan for coal phaseout and renew its focus on electricity, according to an expert, if it will meet new obligations Canada signed onto at the COP26 summit. At the latest United Nations climate conference, Canada agreed to come up with stronger climate targets by next year, phase out coal by 2030 and move to a near-zero electricity grid by 2035, among other items. Coal, in particular, she said, might pose a challenge for New Brunswick. Despite the 2030 deadline Ottawa has set, the province has asked for an equivalency agreement to continue burning coal at the Belledune Generating Station into 2040. "I think New Brunswick needs to prepare for the reality that its request to the federal government to burn coal beyond 2030 will not be approved," Comeau said, noting she expects that decision to come out in a few weeks. "What we're going to see there, I think, is pressure, as well as dollars, but pressure through regulations, something called a clean electricity standard, which will be putting extra pressure on New Brunswick to phase out all coal, oil and ... fossil gas, by 2035." Minister of Environment Gary Crossman and Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Mike Holland were not available for interviews. In a statement, Crossman said the province's commitments are "consistent" with the COP26 climate pact. "New Brunswick is a leader in climate change action. We have led Canada in reducing greenhouse gas emissions since 2005, having reduced our emissions by 38 per cent from 2005 levels," he said. "We are committed to going even further by reducing our emissions to 47 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, which will exceed the recently released national target of 40-45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030." Crossman added government will phase out coal "as soon as possible," and at the same time, "maintain a reliable electricity system and manage the impact on New Brunswick ratepayers." Comeau believes electricity should be central to New Brunswick's climate plan. "The demand for electricity is going to grow ... and they need to clean it up at the same time they're growing supply," she said. "The whole future of climate change action in New Brunswick, on the emissions side, is through electricity, so we need a vision for that, we need a strategy for that, we need policies, regulations, we need Electricity Act reform." People need to be engaged on reform and educated on what the changes mean, Comeau added. She noted Bill 77 as an example, which proposes updates to the Electricity Act without any formal public consultation scheduled. "Of all the provinces, New Brunswick is really bad at this, we need to do a much better job at actually engaging the public," she said. "They need to be part of the discussion about the kind of electricity system we want in the province, and the government is not doing that." But Comeau worries the province has little political will to mitigate climate change. "It continues to only see climate change through the lens of its emissions, which it thinks are in line with federal targets. It doesn't have any internal motivation to deal with climate change whether the federal government did so or not," she said. "Because we take this kind of weak, emissions focus, we think we're basically in line there, we're not actually preparing the province for decarbonization." !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Telegraph-Journal (New Brunswick) \</doc>

GLASGOW, United Kingdom - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed the world to have 60 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions covered by a price on pollution in 2030, during a speech at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow on Tuesday. Trudeau started second and final day at the annual climate negotiations by co-hosting a carbon pricing event, showcasing Canada's carbon price as one of the most ambitious and, in his words, and stringent in the world. He started the first day with a speech calling on the rest of the world to follow Canada's lead and negotiate a global minimum carbon price. Trudeau compared the idea to the 15 per cent minimum corporate tax more than 130 countries have now signed on to implement in a bid to stop big multinational corporations from avoiding taxes by funnelling their profits through low-tax countries. Hypocrisy in the air at COP26 : More than 200 private jets so leaders can talk emissions( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/world/hypocrisy-in-the-air-at-cop26-more-than-200-private-jets-so-leaders-can-talk-emissions https://nationalpost.com/news/world/hypocrisy-in-the-air-at- HYPERLINK cop26 -more-than-200-private-jets-so-leaders-can-talk-emissions ) Rex Murphy: Trudeau too busy saving the planet to raise the flag( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-trudeau-too-busy-saving-the-planet-to-raise-the-flag https://nationalpost.com/opinion/rex-murphy-trudeau-too-busy-saving-the-planet-to-raise-the-flag ) "It ensures those who are leading on pricing pollution are not unfairly penalized," he said. Carbon pricing has been a political minefield in Canada, with opposing conservative provincial premiers taking the fight against one all the way to the Supreme Court, which upheld the program. The Conservative Party nationally, long an opponent of the policy as a "tax on everything," is now itself engaged in an internal debate about the merits. Leader Erin O'Toole promised to implement a version of a carbon price in the recent election with a rewards-card like system. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said Monday that he thinks this COP meeting could be the one which sparks the start of a real negotiation toward a global price on carbon. He said there is a level of interest in the idea that he has never seen before. "So is it a done deal?" he asked. "Absolutely not. Could Glasgow be the moment that we actually start working on developing something like that? I think it has the potential to do that." Canada's carbon price started in 2019 at $20 a tonne and is set to rise to $170 a tonne by 2030. The current price of $40 a tonne adds about 8.8 cents a litre to gasoline, or about $3.50 more every time you fill you car with 40 litres of gasoline. But rebate cheques are included with tax returns to make the program revenue neutral. The idea is that a carbon price shouldn't leave families with less money, but provide an incentive to find ways to cut down on fossil fuel use by making it cost more. It also applies to natural gas, propane, jet fuel, and any other liquid fuel, based on the weight of greenhouse gas emissions produced when that fuel is burned. Canada's national price only applies in provinces which don't have an equivalent provincial policy in place - Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick. A separate policy for big industrial emitters uses the same price but is only charged on a portion of total emissions produced, rather than on the fuels those emitters buy to operate their machinery. The Citizens Climate Lobby says there 64 carbon pricing policies in place around the world, including a direct price on carbon emissions, and cap-and-trade type systems. More than two dozen are national policies, and the rest are subnational including state or provincial governments in the U.S. and Canada, and cities like Tokyo. The United States and Australia are the only two fully developed economies without some form of carbon pricing.

GLASGOW - Former U.S. President Barack Obama threw his support behind those on the frontline of global warming on Monday, calling for action by rich nations to end years of deadlock with developing countries over cash for climate change. At the start of the second and final week of the U.N. climate talks in Glasgow - known as COP26 - ministers got down to the detail of trying to honour promises to pay for climate-linked losses and damages, and to address how to help nations adapt to the effects of climate change. "We have to act now to help with adaptation and resilience," Obama told a meeting of island nations at the summit, adding that his views on the immediacy of the threat had been shaped by his experience growing up in Hawaii. The failure of rich nations to make good on promises to provide help for developing countries has fueled mistrust, and is seen as a major obstacle to progress in cutting emissions to limit the devastating impact of global warming. Online activist network Avaaz released a video showing Obama had made the same call for action not words to help poor nations as long ago as 2009, but with few results in the ensuing years. "Everyone knows what is to be done," said Kenya's Environment Minister Keriako Tobiko. "There have been too much and too many workshops, retreats and conferences. And it is always 'the time is now' 'the time has come'. Actually there's no more time, let's put the money on the table." At a U.N. climate summit 12 years ago in Copenhagen, rich nations promised to hand developing countries $100 billion a year by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change. The target was missed, and at COP26 richer nations have said they will meet the goal in 2023 at the latest, with some hoping it could be delivered a year earlier. In recent weeks and months rich nations including the United States, Japan, Spain and Italy have raised their "climate financing" pledges, but some still fall short of what international bodies say is a fair contribution. Ghana's Environment Minister Kwaku Afriyie said negotiations over funds for adaption and resilience in the nations hardest-hit by climate change were not reflecting the levels of ambition publicly voiced by developed countries. "It's very unfortunate and sad indeed," he said. The cost of both is huge, but it will be even higher unless the Glasgow talks can keep alive a goal that dates from U.N. talks in Paris in 2015 to keep global warming below 1.5 Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. Beyond the 1.5C level, the world risks devastating climate impacts. Obama said the Paris agreement he helped to broker had created a framework to tackle climate change, but too little had been done since then. "We are nowhere near where we need to be," he told the Glasgow audience, chiding the leaders of China and Russia, two of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, for failing to even attend the summit. Their "national plans so far reflect what appears to be a dangerous lack of urgency and willingness to maintain the status quo on the part of those governments, and that's a shame," he said. With activist Greta Thunberg already dismissing the talks as a "failure," richer nations need to firm up and make good on the many pledges they delivered in the first week of the conference, which is scheduled to finish on Friday. Underlining the difficulties, COP26 President Alok Sharma said there was a desire among parties "to continue technical work with a renewed urgency to make progress" on climate finance where there was "a large number of outstanding issues." "My priority now is pace," he added. "There needs to be a sense of urgency in all our negotiations." Potentially more problematic for rich nations than meeting the $100 billion goal is how they should compensate less developed countries for loss and damages caused by historic emissions, an area where concrete pledges have yet to be made. Sharma acknowledged that this was a historically polarizing issue, but said he believed "the mood music has changed somewhat." "There is now a practical recognition that action is needed on this topic in the face of growing impacts," he said. \</doc>

GLASGOW Britain called an end to the era of coal on Thursday, saying it had 77 signatories to a pledge to phase out the dirtiest of the fossil fuels that cause global warming, as a study showed carbon dioxide emissions had rebounded to near pre-pandemic levels. But the list omitted both India and China, which is home to almost half the over 2,600 coal-fired plants operating or under construction around the world, and the pledge held no commitment to stop financing new plants. COP26 conference in Glasgow of the challenge to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a study showed carbon dioxide emissions were back on the rise. The United Nations says a rise above 1.5C would trigger potentially irreversible climate impacts. Carbon dioxide emissions fell by 5.4 per cent in 2020 as economies ground to a halt, but the new report by the Global Carbon Project forecasts they will rebound by 4.9 per cent this year. "We were expecting to see some rebound," said the report's lead author Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate modelling researcher at the University of Exeter. "What surprised us was the intensity and rapidity." "It has 77 signatories, including 46 countries such as Poland, Vietnam and Chile, 23 of which are making commitments on ending coal for the first time," he said.

THE CONVERSATION This article was originally published on The Conversation, an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts. Disclosure information is available on the original site. -- Authors: Jennifer Baltzer, Associate Professor and Canada Research Chair in Forests and Global Change, Wilfrid Laurier University and Oliver Sonnentag, Associate Professor and Canada Research Chair in Atmospheric Biogeosciences in High Latitudes, Universite de Montreal Canada, along with more than 100 other countries, has committed at the UN climate conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ) to halt deforestation by 2030, as a way to preserve the forests that are key to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing global warming. Forests are the lungs of the planet. They take up vast quantities of carbon dioxide and lock it away in trees and soil. These processes have helped make this planet habitable and, more recently, mitigate the impacts of our reliance on fossil fuels. As ecosystem scientists, we think this pledge to end deforestation holds great potential. It is not, however, a new idea. At a UN climate summit in 2014, many of the same countries agreed to halt deforestation by 2030. It was a lofty goal, and it has been unsuccessful to date. Forest loss has increased by more than 40 per cent since the agreement. The current COP26 COP26 commitment is the focus on improving sustainability in the trades that have historically led to deforestation. Still Canada has some work ahead if it is to make meaningful progress on this new pledge, and not find itself in an ongoing situation of continued forest - and carbon - loss. It must also find a way to protect its primary forests, those that have not yet been affected by logging, mining or other human activity, as these intact forests best provide critical ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Forests slow down climate change Forests take up carbon dioxide (photosynthesis) and release it (respiration). The balance between this uptake and release determines the strength of the forest's "carbon sink," or how much carbon is stored within it. While taking up carbon dioxide, forests lose water through their leaves (transpiration). Deforestation affects these processes and can produce strong feedbacks to the climate system. Deforestation impacts the global carbon cycle - the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the Earth and back - by removing large quantities of carbon stored in the trees and increasing losses of stored carbon from the soil. If deforested areas do not recover, future uptake of carbon dioxide is also reduced. The loss of large tracts of intact forest can have important effects on water at the local and regional levels. Deforestation can reduce cloud formation and rainfall, increasing the risk or duration of drought in places that are already experiencing the effects of climate warming. Interpreting Canada's commitment Canada has some of the most carbon-rich forests in the world. Boreal forests hold on average more carbon than their tropical counterparts. Yet the scale of forestry and other extractive activities in Canada's boreal forests is vast. Remote sensing indicates that forestry activities impacted 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of forests annually between 1985-2010. This means that changes in land management decisions and the associated reforestation of disturbed landscapes in Canada's boreal region can play an important role in the country's climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. But three central challenges must be considered in the planning, implementation and accounting for Canada to meet or ideally exceed the ambitions of its COP26 commitment to end net deforestation. 1. Forest loss in Canada is complicated Human-caused climate warming is profoundly altering the frequency and extent of natural disturbances, such as fire or insects, in Canada. Specifically, boreal forest loss due to wildfire, permafrost thaw, drought and pest outbreaks is increasing. These forest losses are occurring in addition to forest harvesting and land clearing, and will continue to intensify as climate warming progresses. According to a recent report by Nature Canada, an organization that advocates for habitat and species protection, these natural disturbances are largely ignored in Canada's forestry carbon accounting, potentially underestimating Canada's forest carbon emissions by an order of magnitude. Many of these disturbed forest lands may recover naturally, but this is not guaranteed. There is increasing evidence that the boreal forest is becoming less resilient in the face of climate warming and associated disturbances. We may not be able to rely on the full recovery of forests and their functions as we have in the past. We need to account for these human-caused, climate-associated changes in addition to forest harvesting and land clearing in an honest and transparent way. 2. Underground storage is a slow process In boreal forests, 80-90 per cent of carbon is stored below ground, in contrast to most other forest ecosystems, where carbon is stored in the trees. Carbon recovery in boreal forests is not fast, nor is it as straightforward as replanting trees where deforestation and/or land degradation has occurred. Instead it requires the rather slow recovery of the processes that support peat accumulation and the large below-ground carbon stocks that characterize boreal landscapes. These remediation tools are under active development, and there have been some successes. The targeted protection of regions with deep peat deposits is of great importance and urgency. Some of the most carbon rich places in Canada include the Mackenzie River Basin and the Hudson Bay Lowlands, regions that are also rich in natural resources. 3. Deforestation is linked to extractive industries COP26 commitment by the Trudeau government will not stop these activities, nor will it protect Canada's old-growth forests. This commitment only requires that net forest cover remain constant, and the replanting of harvested forests is already common practice in much of Canada. There is, however, ample evidence of the impact of these extractive activities on the benefits and services provided by forests in Canada. For example, roads and seismic lines associated with forestry and oil and gas increase carbon loss and fragment the landscape leading to declines in species such as boreal caribou. For this commitment to have a meaningful impact, Canada must continue with reforestation and prioritize protection of its intact, primary forests. We can hope the Trudeau government will use this commitment as a push to rapidly transition away from extractive practices toward more sustainable economic activities, and dovetail these efforts with the goals of conservation and reconciliation. -- The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. -- This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Facebook advertisers promoted false and misleading claims about climate change on the platform in recent weeks, just as the COP26 conference was getting underway. Days after Facebook's vice-president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, touted the company's efforts to combat climate misinformation in a blog as the Glasgow summit began, conservative media network Newsmax ran an ad on Facebook that called man-made global warming a "hoax." The ad, which had multiple versions, garnered more than 200,000 views. In another, conservative commentator Candace Owens said, "apparently we're just supposed to trust our new authoritarian government" on climate science, while a U.S. libertarian think-tank ran an ad on how "modern doomsayers" had been wrongly predicting climate crises for decades. Newsmax, Owens and the Daily Wire, which paid for the ad from Owens's page, did not respond to requests for comment. Facebook, which recently changed its name to Meta, does not have a specific policy on climate misinformation in ads or unpaid posts. Alphabet's Google said last month it would no longer allow ads that contradict scientific consensus on climate change on YouTube and its other services, though it would allow content that discusses false claims. Facebook generally does not remove misinformation in posts unless it determines they pose imminent real-world harm, as it did for falsehoods around COVID-19. The company says it demotes posts ranked as false by its third-party fact-checkers (of which Reuters is one) and prohibits ads with these debunked claims. It says advertisers that repeatedly post false information may face restrictions on their ability to advertise on Facebook. It exempts politicians£ds from fact-checks. Asked about ads pushing climate misinformation, a company spokesperson said in a statement: "While ads like these run across many platforms, Facebook offers an extra layer of transparency by requiring them to be available to the public in our Ad Library for up to seven years after publication." U.K.-based think-tank InfluenceMap, which identified misleading Facebook ads run from several media outlets and thinktanks around COP26 , also found fossil fuel companies and lobbying groups spent $574,000 on political and social issue Facebook ads during the summit, resulting in more than 22 million impressions and including content that promoted their environmental efforts in what InfluenceMap described as "greenwashing." One ad paid for by the American Petroleum Institute panned over a natural landscape as it touted its efforts to tackle climate change, while BP America ran an ad detailing its support for climate-friendly policies in neon green writing. "Our social media posts represent a small fraction compared to the robust investments our companies make every day into breakthrough technologies aimed at capturing methane, advancing hydrogen and accelerating carbon capture," the API said in a statement, saying the natural gas and oil industry was committed to lowering emissions. BP said in a statement that it was "actively advocating for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing, through a range of transparent channels, including social media advertising." Oil and gas companies have placed ads across a broad range of other media properties ahead of and during the COP26 summit, including on podcasts, newsletters and through TV commercials. In Europe, Greenpeace and other environmental groups called last month for a ban on adverts and sponsorships by oil and gas firms. Facebook has started adding informational labels to posts about climate change to direct users to its Climate Science Center, a new hub with facts and quizzes which it says is visited by more than 100,000 people a day. "I'm not going to say we have it right at any moment in time," he said. "We continually re-evaluate what the state of the world is and what is our role, which starts with trying to allow people free expression, and then intervening when there are harms happening that we can prevent." He did not directly answer why Facebook had not banned all climate misinformation ads but said it "didn't want people to profit over misinformation." EMPLOYEES QUESTION POLICY The company's approaches to climate misinformation and skepticism have caused employee debate. Discussions on its internal message board show staff sparring over how it should handle climate misinformation and flagging instances of it on the platform, such as in a January post where an employee said they found "prominent results of apparent misinformation" when they searched for climate change in its video 'Watch' section. The documents were among a cache of disclosures made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who left in May. Reuters was among a group of news organizations able to view the documents. In the comments on an April post highlighting Facebook's commitment to reducing its own environmental impact, including by reaching net zero emissions for its global operations last year, one staff member asked if the company could start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from its platforms. Two external researchers working with Facebook on its climate change efforts told Reuters they would like to see the company approach climate misinformation with the same proactiveness it has for COVID-19, which Facebook cracked down on during the pandemic. "It does need to be addressed with the same level of urgency," said John Cook, a post-doctoral research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University who is advising Facebook on its climate misinformation work. "It is arguably more dangerous." Reuters !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Sun Media Corporation. All rights reserved. \</doc>

The delegates are trickling home and Glasgow's streets are clearing of protesters. Now, experts say, the real work begins of putting meat and bone to the pledges and commitments made by world leaders to keep global warming below catastrophic levels. "The next couple years are going to be the most important, fastest-moving period of carbon reduction in Canadian history," said Rick Smith, president of the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices. With the UN-sponsored COP26 climate conference coming to an end, the federal government has to put some specifics behind promises. Business leaders are looking for details on everything from when the commitment to cap fossil fuel emissions will kick in to regulations on methane releases to tax credits for carbon storage. "At the end of the day, it comes back to how you translate those targets into policy in Canada," said John Dillon of the Business Council of Canada. Dillon said he expects the climate discussion to broaden after Glasgow to include sectors such as construction, agriculture  even the military. "The military produces a lot of GHG emissions." "It takes time to adopt new technologies," said Jack Mintz, President's Fellow of the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. "The big question for Canada is how fast do you drive down fossil fuel investment in order to encourage more investment in renewables, without creating a lot of harm and cost. I don't think we have a very satisfactory answer." Different countries will have to agree on which approaches they'll take, Mintz said. Germany, for example, isn't keen on hydrogen fuels made from natural gas while Canadian producers are. But make no mistake, action is coming, said Mark Jaccard, an energy economist at Simon Fraser University. He said the recent federal election, in which a solid majority of Canadians voted for parties with strong climate policies, has given the federal Liberals a strong mandate to move. "It's a perfect time to go fast," he said. "I know there is going to be huge discussions inside government of how you actually do that. (But) you should see stuff pretty quickly here." Shane Moffatt of Greenpeace agreed the federal Liberals have a green light to go green  but he warned climate activists will have to keep working to ensure actual policy emerges. "One of the biggest outcomes from this COP is the sense of expectation and the momentum for more action now," he said. "There is lots of public support but connecting that public support with real policy changes is sometimes elusive." He notes Canadians broadly support conservation, but creating new protected areas remains slow work. As well, large international questions remain. For example, some sort of global trading system for carbon offsets to allow a country to get credits for helping another country reduce emissions hasn't gone much further than Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's suggestion that it would be a good idea. Dillon said many companies aren't waiting for governments and are moving ahead on their own. But they can only do so much on their own. "Some of the big, big investments will require more clarity from government," he said. Stand by, Smith suggested. "Glasgow lands right in the middle of this period of intense activity in Canada to finally put the pedal to the metal. It's going to accelerate what was going on already."

The Glasgow Climate Pact is a message to investors and executives that the march to net-zero is accelerating. The agreement, negotiated by almost 200 nations over two weeks, isn't the pact some were hoping for. But it sets out a vision that radically cuts back coal usage, eliminates fossil-fuel subsidies and commits governments to the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement. Skeptics argue the whole accord rests on a massive bet the world's biggest polluters will eliminate all their net emissions in the next few decades and say the recent surge in coal mining in China, India and Australia proves how hard this is going to be. But the outcome of COP26 "made it crystal clear to businesses that they need to move away from fossil fuels," said Nick Molho of Aldersgate Group, which represents firms worth US$740 billion pushing for sustainability. Businesses will travel in that direction whether or not governments back up their pledges with policies, he said. How quickly global business and finance move away from fossil fuels is still an open question. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday the Glasgow pact sounded the "death knell" for coal, but the final language was watered down to "phase down" unabated coal power after objections from India that were backed by the U.S. and China. The qualifications leave the door open for investment in some coal plants, especially if they're equipped to capture emissions. Boardrooms still have a long way to go. Only five per cent of the firms listed on major European stock indexes which have set targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 are on track to meet their goals, according to a study by Accenture. And they're the ones ahead of the curve. Green entrepreneurs in poorer countries face much higher funding costs. Many firms in China and India - two of the world's biggest polluters - have yet to lay out detailed carbon-neutrality plans. Many of these tensions can be seen in former Bank of England and Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney's drive to get the finance industry to cut their portfolio emissions to zero by mid-century. One of the biggest announcements at COP26 came when the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero said signatories overseeing about US$130 trillion would set clear targets and timelines for greening investments. The initiative was greeted with skepticism by some experts. Members didn't say how much money will be shifted into green activities and haven't agreed on a definition of net zero. But the strength of agreements like the Glasgow Climate Pact comes from governments united over a consensus, no matter how broad, that sets the foundation for investment and policy. Tesla Inc. may be a model for future game-changers. "For the first 20 years of the climate problem, it was governments subsidizing green technologies and making markets with regulation," said Nick Mabey of think tank E3G. "Then technology got in front of those regulations and now governments follow the technology and the markets." The challenge for is holding companies accountable. \</doc>

Great Ormond Street Hospital, in the heart of London, is affectionately known as GOSH. On the morning of Oct. 24, its excited team of riders gathered out front, mounted their bicycles, and headed for Granary Square to join health professionals (and a few former patients) from pediatric hospitals all over the UK on a cycling trip to Glasgow. Their purpose: to deliver some very critical documents to the world's leaders at COP26 on behalf of the global health community. Those same documents had already survived an 860-km bicycle trek from WHO headquarters in Geneva Switzerland, carefully protected from wind, rain, and sweat by "occasional cyclist" Dr. Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, head of the WHO's Climate and Health Program. With some relief, @DiarmidCL handed over the burden of responsibility to Health in the 21st century Dr. Finella Craig, a children's palliative care specialist at GOSH, the UK's equivalent of Sick Kids, and the second half of their journey began. So what are these documents? The first is a copy of the WHO's new report called "The Health Argument for Climate Action", prepared in consultation with the international health community. The second is the Prescription for a Healthy Climate, addressed to world leaders soon to gather at COP26 , and signed by groups representing 45 million health professionals from around the world. The team of riders will also deliver a copy of the latest Lancet Countdown report and a recent editorial published in 220 medical journals calling for emergency action on climate change for the sake of human health. An 840-km cycling trip requires both mental and physical preparation. "Green Machine" Dr. Ewan Wallace, a Glasgow specialist in pediatric anesthesia and chronic pain, began training by cycling to work and getting in as many miles as possible on the weekends. Pediatrician "Alex" found personal motivation in the knowledge that air pollution affects the health of children before they are born. Alex gave birth to her first child in a city with some of the dirtiest air in the world. @DrMarkHayden from GOSH gathered energy from conviction: "As an intensivist, I know that when someone's really sick, just like the planet, it's no good sitting around talking about it. It's no good making promises for the future, you need to take immediate action." @SustainaPhil, a charismatic sustainability officer from Sheffield, recruited members of his family to prepare refreshment pitstops along the way. Children's psychiatrist Dr. Catriona Mellor wrote a thought-provoking blog post for the British Medical Journal, called "The Climate Crisis: How do we show we care? @DrMikeMcKean, a children's cardiac care doc from Newcastle on Tyne in the north of England, booked a ticket to London and tweeted a photo of his bicycle securely strapped to the train's bike rack. #RideForTheirLives participants are scheduled to arrive in Glasgow on Oct. 31, the opening day of COP26 Their trip has raised awareness of the impacts of climate change and air pollution on children's health and demonstrated that the UK's pediatric health professionals care. Each kilometre they've ridden is also a demonstration of the dramatic health benefits of emissions-free active transportation. We can only hope world leaders are watching and listening. Dr. Elaine Blacklock (aka @KidsClimateDoc) is a Sudbury pediatrician, science writer and active member of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE). Dr. Blacklock is immersed in writing a book about climate change and our health. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Osprey Media Group Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

Officials from Indigenous Clean Energy (ICE) are playing a significantly differ- ent role this year at a major international conference. Instead of simply being attendees, ICE representatives will host three sessions at COP26 , the United Nations\' climate change conference, which began Oct. 31 and continues until Nov. 12. COP stands for the Conference of the Parties. The first COP conference was staged in Berlin in 1995. COP26 signifies the 26th year the event has been held.  It is the global meeting space for climate change, said Chris Henderson, the executive director of ICE. Henderson believes having ICE reps leading sessions at the conference is huge news.  It gives you a lot of exposure he said.  Everyone who is at the conference will see our program. The exposure you\' ll get is very high. About 20,000 guests from approximately 200 countries are expected to attend the conference. Those attending will include heads of state, climate experts, civil society groups and business leaders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is one of the more than 120 world leaders attending. ICE is a platform that advances Indigenous inclusion in Canada\' s energy futures economy. This is accomplished by providing Indigenous leadership and partnerships with governments, energy companies, utilities, cleantech innovators, development firms, capital markets and the academic sector. Henderson said ICE has enjoyed success with a number of different projects in Canada. And it only makes sense to explore whether that success can be extended beyond the country\' s borders.  The inevitable next step is can this knowledge be used elsewhere, Henderson said. Events at this year\' s COP will be held in two zones, the Blue Zone and the Green Zone. The Blue Zone is open to those members of a national delegation that are registered with the United Nations, UN workers or those employed by related organization or agencies, media or not-forprofit observer organizations. Members of the general public can attend Green Zone events. Those sessions will also be broadcast online via YouTube.  We\' re the only session the Canadian government has approved (for COP26 ), said Henderson, who has more than a quarter century of experience working with Indigenous communities on renewable energy projects. Henderson said ICE officials had submitted applications to host sessions at this year\' s conference earlier this year. Though approval was granted to present in the Green Zone a couple of months ago, ICE reps did not receive word about Blue Zone approval until recently.  It was kind of official only about two weeks ago, Henderson said, adding Canadian government approval undoubtedly assisted ICE efforts.  We were pretty confident we would get in though. ICE officials will host two sessions in the Blue Zone and one in the Green Zone. First up is a Blue Zone session titled Indigenous Clean Energy and UNDRIP. It will be held Wednesday, Nov. 3. This session will highlight various clean energy projects in Canada that have been Indigenous led or have featured Indigenous partners. Projects discussed will show how clean energy transition has already occurred and how it aligns with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The following day, Nov. 4, a Green Zone session will be held. Members of the public can watch it at 8:30 p.m. EST here: HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT6HckyhPWI https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT6HckyhPWI This session is titled Community Renewable Energy Microgrids (REMs) in Action. During this session there will be discussions on how Indigenous REMs can advance and integrate the Sustainable Development Goals put forth by the UN. ICE officials will also participate in a Blue Zone session on Thursday titled Global Renewable Energy Microgrids Strategy. This discussion will concentrate on Indigenous and/or community-led and partnered REMs, climate finance, policy mechanisms and utility regulations. Freddie Huppe Campbell is ICE\' s Global Hub program lead and has made the trip to Glasgow, Scotland for the conference. She feels it is important to get ICE messages out now.  We have an opportunity as a collective to live and act in a way that protects Mother Earth and sustains living beings for generations to come, she said.  There are countless examples and centuries of wisdom across the world that have provided us with road maps to reverse climate crises. It is no longer a question of why, when or how, but rather a choice \- now or never. Eryn Stewart, ICE\' s managing director of programs, has also made the trip to Glasgow. Henderson will be presenting at the conference virtually from his Ottawa home. \</doc>

OTTAWA - Environmental groups say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is sending a signal that combating climate change will fall to more than just one department in his government. Jonathan Wilkinson is being shuffled from environment to natural resources in a cabinet shakeup today and Steven Guilbeault will go to environment after spending the last two years as the minister of heritage. COP26 climate talks are considered crucial to the world's effort to fight climate change. Caroline Brouillette, director of domestic policy at Climate Action Network Canada, says Guilbeault won't take long to brief on the file because he has probably attended more COP meetings than anyone else in the Canadian delegation. Greenpeace Canada senior energy strategist Keith Stewart says Guilbeault and Wilkinson, whose background is in clean technology, will bring a one-two punch to environmental issues around the cabinet table. Both inside the Liberal government and outside of it, there is a desire to start responding to the climate change crisis with the speed, flexibility and total-government approach used as the COVID-19 pandemic hit. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 26, 2021. \</doc>

In December, I asked Peterborough's city council to support an action that I believe would greatly assist in the fight against local and provincial impacts of climate change. The idea is to ask the Government of Ontario to develop a plan to phase out all of Ontario's gas-fired electric power plants as soon as possible. I am not alone in this; more than 30 Ontario municipalities have made a similar request, including the County of Peterborough and Selwyn Township. Greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution from our fossil-fuel-fired power stations contribute directly to climate change. During the 12-year period ending in 2017, that GHG pollution dropped by 93 per cent. However, GHG pollution from the electricity system began to climb again in 2018. Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) is now predicting it will rise by a whopping 300 per cent by 2030. Almost all our need for replacement generation is to be met by ramping up production from gas-fired power plants to meet consumer demand. GHG pollution will climb dramatically. There's a better way. During the 2021 federal election campaign, the government promised to create a "clean electricity standard" that would lead to a 100 per cent net zero carbon electricity grid by 2035. How would this work in Ontario? Let's ramp up our investments in energy efficiency, made in Ontario renewable energy, and even surplus hydro power from Quebec. The result would be a successful phase-out of the gas-fired plants with their GHGs which would be a path toward a 100 per cent renewable electricity grid and lower electricity bills. The recent proceedings of the United Nations COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow made plain the practical and life-threatening urgency of the status of our environment. In Peterborough, we have taken some first steps in reducing GHGs and our carbon footprint. But there are still many actions we can and should act on locally, especially in areas such as energy efficiency for households and transportation. Ontario has promised to reduce coverall GHG pollution by 30 per cent by 2030. If acted on, the phase-out of our gas-fired electric power plants is expected to result in the achievement of that goal. Municipalities representing more than half of the total provincial population have urged the phase-out. It's the smart and right thing to do. Henry Clarke represents Monaghan Ward on Peterborough city council. \</doc>

CALGARY, AB, Nov. 5, 2021 /CNW/ - As the world gathers at COP26 to take action on the threat of climate changeand keep the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C within reach, TransAlta Corporation (TSX: TA) (NYSE: TAC) ("TransAlta" or the "Company") was pleased to participate at the Powering the World Past Coal event at COP26 , in Glasgow, Scotland. At the event, TransAlta and 27 new members joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance (the "Alliance") where the new members were announced by the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom, Co-Chairs of the Alliance. The Alliance is a global organization of governmental and private sector organizations working to take action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity generation and accelerate the energy transition. TransAlta's President and CEO, John Kousinioris, stated, "Our decision to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance is a natural extension of the Company's commitment to delivering clean energy solutions for our customers, strong returns for our investors, and reliable energy for the communities that we serve. Our growth plan will expand our renewable electricity fleet by two gigawatts over the next five years and deploy energy storage at a much larger scale. We look forward to continuing our contribution to global efforts to deliver an accelerated clean energy transition." TransAlta has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 61 per cent over 2005 levels and has a 2030 target that equates to a 70 per cent reduction compared to 2005 levels. TransAlta's transition away from coal-fired generation started in 2019 and by the end of 2021, the Company will end coal-fired generation in Canada. Through this process, TransAlta will eliminate 2,135 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity from its fleet and will have converted a further 1,259 megawatts to gas-fired generation, consistent with the regulatory frameworks set out by the governments of Canada and Alberta. The Company's sole remaining coal-fired unit in the U.S. will also cease operations at the end of 2025. By that time, the Company will have also delivered on its plan to grow its leading renewable portfolio by two gigawatts, which will result in 70 per cent of the Company's EBITDA being generated by renewables. The Company is well positioned to leverage its significant expertise across a variety of geographies and technologies. TransAlta's ongoing focus is to be a leading provider in the renewables space, bringing solutions that work for its customers and the communities that it serves.

"The world is on a catastrophic pathway to 2.7 degrees Celsius of heating," said UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres. "There is a high risk of failure of COP26 ." That's the global climate summit that meets every five years (but was postponed last year because of the pandemic) to plot a course away from climate disaster. And it really isn't looking good. COP26 started Oct. 30 in Glasgow, Scotland, with over 100 world leaders and 25,000 delegates in attendance, but much that should already have happened has not happened. The draft texts that are normally negotiated before such meetings are only half-done due to the pandemic. Neither China's President Xi Jinping nor President Vladimir Putin of Russia is even showing up. This meeting is the last chance to keep average global temperature below +1.5 degrees Celsius. That target was adopted at the last summit in Paris in 2015 because it would avoid the most extreme storms, floods and heatwaves. It would also not trigger the "tipping points", where some feedback in the climate system causes a sudden lurch upwards in temperature. Reaching that Paris goal, however, would require a 45 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. That's not unthinkable if we treated this as an existential emergency - it's only five per cent a year - but the grim fact is that we have never yet managed to cut global emissions at all. "We are not going to get to a 45 per cent reduction," admitted a UN official who understandably wished to remain anonymous, "but there must be some level of contributions on the table to show the downward trend of emissions." Why would a conference full of highly-educated, well-informed and mostly well-intentioned people behave like this? They are not wicked people and almost all of them do know the truth. They just cannot afford to get too far ahead of the people they lead. A majority of citizens in almost every country worry about global heating, but dramatic change isn't possible because it hasn't reached their "pain threshold" yet. That phrase acquired its political meaning during the American war in Vietnam. The idea was that a gradually escalating US bombing campaign would make the North Vietnamese government stop trying to reunite the country by force when the damage to North Vietnam reached its "threshold of pain". "Operation Rolling Thunder" lasted three years, but it never did find the Hanoi regime's pain threshold. Similarly, the accumulating damage to people and property done by various sorts of wild weather has not yet reached the population's pain threshold anywhere except for a few low-lying island countries that are already close to going underwater. It was always clear that the attitudes of people in the rich countries could not be shifted by images of other people in the global south suffering from climate-related calamities. Only when the catastrophes struck close to home would they take the message to heart - and frankly, many despairing climate activists were counting on that. That's why the killer wild-fires, heat-waves and floods of this year in the US, Canada, Germany, Greece and other developed countries led some people to hope that there would be a general mobilisation of public opinion in favour of climate action. There certainly has been some movement in that direction, but by the look of COP26 , probably not yet enough. On our current track, we will irrevocably commit to +1.5 degrees Celsius by 2029 or 2030, but the time lag with CO2 means that the immediate effects of even that abject failure might not be severe enough to shock a critical mass of people into action. So what can usefully be done while we wait for the heating to reach our collective pain threshold? The best hope at the moment is the Global Methane Pledge, whose supporters promise to cut their methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Methane has accounted for at least a third of the warming so far, but it allows for a quick partial fix for two reasons. It stays in the atmosphere a far shorter time than CO2 - eight years instead of 200 - so emission cuts show quick results. And one source of methane in particular is cheap, low-hanging fruit: the fossil-fuel industry. Just stop flaring unwanted gas and fix all the leaks in almost three million kilometres of gas pipelines, and the 30 per cent cut is a done deal. Not only that, it will practically pay for itself, since you can burn the saved methane. It will produce carbon dioxide, of course, but that's a 200-year problem and we need results now. Almost 40 countries have already made the methane pledge, including the US, the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Indonesia, Pakistan and Nigeria. We could even delay +1.5 degrees Celsius down into the 2030s, and something else might turn up by then. Grasping at straws, perhaps, but what's the better option? \</doc>

NEW DELHI (AP)  Setting net zero targets wasn't a solution and instead rich countries needed to acknowledge their  historic responsibility while assuring the interests of developing nations and those vulnerable to climate change, said India's federal environment minister Bhupender Yadav. He said that India was committed to  being part of the solution at the forthcoming U.N. climate summit at Glasgow, known as COP26 for short, but he added that fresh plans for cutting down greenhouse gas emissions would be announced at an  appropriate time and place. India is among the few countries that are on course to reach its targets for curbing the release of planet-warming gases. A UN-backed report published Tuesday said that the country had  significant room for more ambitious goals. But it has yet to provide an update to the U.N. climate agency. Asked about newer targets, Rameshwar Prasad Gupta, India\' s top environmental official, said that  all options were still on the table. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be attending a Group of 20 summit scheduled for this weekend in Rome, and then the COP26 at Glasgow. Yadav stressed that India had reached its targets without the promised financing from rich nations. The cost of meeting all of India's climate targets is estimated to be $2.5 trillion, and adapting key sectors like agriculture or fisheries would require $206 billion, a 2019 finance ministry document said. Although India is the third-highest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the Untied States, it has historically contributed to only 4% of total emissions since the 1850s. Gupta added that  net zero in itself isn't a solution, since cumulative emissions were the cause of the problem and not how much each country emits right now. Instead, he argued that countries needed to focus on how much carbon is put in the atmosphere while getting to that goal. He added that developing nations needed space to grow and assistance, and failing that they are faced with a choice of either compromising on development or relying on dirty fuels.  Without that it becomes extremely difficult, he said. But India's dependence on coal  its the world's second-largest user of the fossil fuel and it has vast reserves of it  is likely to continue. Electricity demand is likely to soar in India and while the overall share of energy from coal will keep coming down, weaning itself off the fossil fuel just yet would impact its energy security, said Gupta. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\' s Department of Science Education.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP)  Israel\' s energy minister, who uses a wheelchair, was able to attend the global climate summit Tuesday, after police prevented her from reaching the venue. Energy Minister Karine Elharrar arrived at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow alongside Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, using a ramp to enter the building, according to footage sent by Bennett's office.  Tomorrow the exact same thing will be here, he said, gesturing toward the accessible entrance.  It's very important, so is the message it sends, he said. A spokeswoman for Elharrar said Monday that she wasn\' t able to attend the conference after police officers at a checkpoint did not let her vehicle with the wheelchair through. Elharrar's spokeswoman Shaked Eliyahu said that even though conference organizers knew she required an accessible entrance, the minister\' s car was kept from approaching for two hours, after which she was offered a ride on a shuttle  which wasn\' t wheelchair accessible. The incident was an embarrassment to organizers of the high-profile event and prompted apologies from British officials.  We deeply regret that incident, Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC radio Tuesday.  What would normally happen in this situation is that Israel would have communicated that they had that particular need for their minister.  There was obviously something that went wrong in this instance and they weren\' t aware of that and so they hadn\' t made the right provisions at the particular entrance she was coming to." After the incident, Elharrar wrote on Twitter that  it\' s sad that the UN, which advances accessibility for people with disabilities, in 2021, doesn\' t see to accessibility at its events. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid tweeted that  It is impossible to safeguard our future and address the climate crisis, without first and foremost caring for people, including ensuring accessibility for people with disabilities.  -  -_Associated Press writer Sylvia Hui in London contributed to this report. \</doc>

A last-minute deal reached at the UN climate talks Saturday drew a mix of discouragement and determination from environmental groups and politicians in Canada. The Sierra Club's Canadian chapter said the deal marks a "disappointing end" to the two-week conference. "This final agreement is a small step, but not the leap we need," representatives said in a statement, calling the compromise "on trend with the divisive summit." "In the words of David Attenborough ... 'our motivation should not be fear, but hope.'" They and others cited the international goal to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial times. Green Party MP Elizabeth May said in a tweet from Scotland that the diluted language on coal marks a move to appease India, China and others. "The hope of holding to 1.5 degrees is barely alive. But hope is not lost," she wrote. The advocates' views reflected those of many states, as nation after nation complained on the final day of the UN talks the agreement did not go far or fast enough. They said, however, that it was better than nothing and provided incremental progress, if not success. Kathryn Harrison, a political science professor at the University of British Columbia specializing in environmental and climate change policy, said the commitments show progress, but that the globe remains on track for 2.4 C of warming this century. Nonetheless, the call for more ambitious near-term targets at next year's conference is "encouraging," she said. "It's also increasingly clear that greater climate finance for developing countries from wealthy, developed countries like Canada will be essential in achieving needed progress," she said in an email. The meeting has also sent a strong signal to Canada's fossil-fuel industry, whose exports Harrison warned are bound to decline after 2030 if countries keep their word on temperature goals. " COP26 finally called out the elephant in the room with more focus than at any previous COP on fossil fuels as the main cause of climate change," she said, pointing to oil and gas as well as coal. Canada has joined more than 20 countries in promising to end subsidies for fossil fuels projects overseas. And the deal itself calls for an eventual end of some coal power and of fossil fuel subsidies. The Canadian Press \</doc>

EVAN SOLOMON: Welcome back to the program. So Canada raced out of the COP26 gate with an ambitious pledge to cut at least 75 percent of methane gas and gas emissions by 2030. The prime minister reiterated his campaign promise to cap oil and gas emissions at a pace to reach net zero by 2050, but his COP26 announcements do not come with any details, and how are they going along in key provinces, in the prairies, that depend on oil and gas. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney says he wasn't even consulted on the PM's promise to cap oil and gas, and he thinks it's, quote, an attempt to leave oil and gas in the ground. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe responded, saying he hopes Justin Trudeau tells COP26 that Canada still has the most sustainable energy sector in the world. Do they support these oil and gas emissions caps? Well let's find out. Joining me now is Saskatchewan's Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre. Minister, a pleasure to have you on the program. What is your province's reaction to the big promises from Justin Trudeau? A cap on emissions in oil and gas, and a reduction of the methane gas emissions in that sector by 75 percent based on 2012 levels by the year 2030? BRONWYN EYRE (Saskatchewan Energy Minister): Well I guess first out of the gate there's a lot of confusion about what this will mean. There's deep frustration of course at having been not consulted. Again, we're getting used to it, but this was, you know, domestic policy announced at an international conference. I mean we had heard that emissions caps were a possibility, of course, during the federal election. Obviously we always hold out hope that, you know, another economic crippler won't come our way, but this is another body blow, and we've seen a number of them of course over the past few years, you know the cancellation of pipelines, the carbon tax itself, and Bill C-69. I think that as honourable partners in the federation, we would like to be part of the conversation, and to have been part of the conversation, but here we are. I think we... SOLOMON: Let me just say, Minister, I literally just had Jonathan Wilkinson on the program, he's now the minister of natural resources and the former environment minister. He said provinces like yours and Alberta shouldn't be surprised. We campaigned that we're going to put a cap on. We are still ready to negotiate the regulatory, so the actual targets, we still haven't negotiated with those, we're prepared to work with the provinces, and the regulatory mechanism they're going to use. So he said I don't really understand why the provinces are surprised. Plus the oil and gas sector itself has already pledged to be net zero by 2050. He says we're just negotiating the framework around promises the sector has already accepted. So what's the issue? EYRE: Well, I mean there's a net zero advisory board which has really nothing do with the provinces, and that's been the understanding that they would be somehow, you know, issuing the regulations, and consultations would be done through them to the regulations. There is a great deal of confusion, there's no question. As I say, it was mooted during the federal election, formally announced the other day. What it means is the question, and as I say the paradoxes around that. Minister Guilbeault has said this is about cutting emissions, not cutting production. But of course, if you put such a strict cap on emissions, as is being proposed here, of course that amounts to a cap on production, and so, you know, just by another means it is as is being said another form of national energy policy. Let's make no bones about this, and Minister Wilkinson did talk about the science. And again, I think that that's where a lot of the confusion lies, because if you look at the science, you know, oil and gas emissions in Canada have been relatively flat, that's a fact, since 2000. That's 21 years. And so production increases have been offset by 36 percent reduction on GHGs per barrel intensity. SOLOMON: Right. EYRE: So when you start saying about 40 to 45 versus that, no wonder there's confusion. SOLOMON: So I did ask Minister Wilkinson literally just before you were on the program, is this a cap on production by another means, that the cap on emission is so onerous that you're effectively going to stop investment, you're going to strand these assets, and essentially nothing's going to be produced. And he said I couldn't disagree more. The industry's already wanting a regulatory framework around their net zero promise, and he says this will simply spur innovation in the field, and actually may have the opposite impact. You clearly disagree. EYRE: Well wanting is a begging of the question indeed. I mean, yes, they have a very strong record on innovation, on green technology. I mean we often use the fact that if, if every oil and gas producing nation on the planet extracted oil and gas the way we do here in western Canada, global greenhouse gas emissions would instantly fall by a quarter from the energy sector worldwide. That's a fact. So if we're talk about wanting, I think part of it is the oil and gas sector says we are doing. And if you put a cap to 40, 45 percent on what we are doing, of course that is this agenda of such a rapid, glib just transition that of course it's going to lead to hundreds, of thousands of energy jobs lost, there's no question about that. So of course the sector is very, very concerned and confused. SOLOMON: Okay, well we don't know what exactly the cap on emissions is, and again I know the government's given a promise without any details. I know there's deep concern. I know Suncor, Cenovus, Imperial, they all have a promise to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Getting there is where the politics, the jobs, and the debate, and the much needed discussion is required. I can't tell you how much I appreciate you joining us, and please do it again, Saskatchewan Minister Bronwyn Eyre, really appreciate you joining us today, thank you. EYRE: Thank you. SOLOMON: Okay, so is you heard from the minister of natural resources and then the energy minister in Saskatchewan. I'm trying to get you all sides here. But stay with us. Is it time to raise Canada's flag after the prime minister ordered it lowered to half mast in the wake of the discovery of those mass graves at residential institutions? Conservative leader Erin O'Toole says yes. What about on Remembrance Day coming up in eight days? Should the flag at Canada's National War Memorial be raised and then lowered? We ask the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations Chiefs, Chief Bobby Cameron, next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \</doc>

Despite a worldwide normalization in videoconferencing brought about by COVID-19, nearly 10,000 more delegates are packing into Glasgow. Side streets around # COP26 ( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/hashtag/COP26?src=hash&;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/hashtag/ HYPERLINK COP26 ?src=hash&;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw HYPERLINK https://t.co/9NO83ydN0w ) - Ciaran Jenkins (@C4Ciaran) November 1, 2021( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/C4Ciaran/status/1455121067316555779?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw https://twitter.com/C4Ciaran/status/1455121067316555779?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw ) Ontario premier Doug Ford, of all people, is delivering( HYPERLINK https://www.cp24.com/news/ford-to-raise-ontario-minimum-wage-to-15-per-hour-in-january-sources-1.5647762 https://www.cp24.com/news/ford-to-raise-ontario-minimum-wage-to-15-per-hour-in-january-sources-1.5647762 ) on the longtime progressive wish to raise the province's minimum wage to $15. Of course, there are some pressing macroeconomic factors blunting the significance of the announcement. Canada is facing an acute labour shortage( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/executive/executive-summary/posthaste-the-labour-shortage-in-canada-is-getting-worse-companies-say https://financialpost.com/executive/executive-summary/posthaste-the-labour-shortage-in-canada-is-getting-worse-companies-say ) that has already caused many employers to raise starting wages above $15. Second, rising inflation is rapidly draining whatever extra purchasing power that $15 once held. With Ford's announcement, the minimum will rise to $15 from its current rate of $14.35. At an anticipated five per cent rate of inflation, that $15 will lose 75 cents of its value by this time next year. Net benefit to Ontario workers? Negative 10 cents. The U.S.-Canada land border officially opens on Nov. 8, but cross-border trips are expected to be severely hindered by a stubborn Canadian insistence to require negative COVID-19 tests from all returning citizens - an expense of up to $200 per traveller. Point Roberts, Wash. - an enclave community whose economy is almost completely dependent on cross-border money - has rolled out a desperate bid( HYPERLINK https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/point-roberts-trying-to-help-canadians-return-with-measure-to-cover-covid-test-costs https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/point-roberts-trying-to-help-canadians-return-with-measure-to-cover-covid-test-costs ) to keep the Canadian dollars flowing by covering the testing charges of Canadian travellers. It's not just Anglophones who are bristling at Quebec's new law that, among other things, would mandate the use of French in private workplaces. Leaders of Inuktitut-speaking communities in Arctic Quebec, among others, recently appeared at a government consultation to say that the bill would severely undermine efforts to revive Indigenous languages( HYPERLINK https://capitalcurrent.ca/quebecs-bill-96-highlights-minority-language-rights https://capitalcurrent.ca/quebecs-bill-96-highlights-minority-language-rights / ). "Now they're trying to say that their language is in jeopardy? I mean, welcome to my world," said Grand Chief Victor Akwirente Bonspille of The Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador. The People's Republic of China asked Canada to stop sending warships through the Taiwan strait at an informal gathering late last month( HYPERLINK https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-refrain-from-sending-warships-through-the-taiwan-strait-china-tells/ https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-refrain-from-sending-warships-through-the-taiwan-strait-china-tells/ HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/MichaelChongMP/status/1455597691937902593 https://twitter.com/MichaelChongMP/status/1455597691937902593 )" to sail the waterway, which is considered international waters. Speaking of the People's Republic of China, Beijing is currently on a crackdown to jail citizens who mock "heros and martyrs" from the country's past. So here's Mao Zedong as a kitty cat. COVID An incredible 27,000 federal civil servants and RCMP members may be headed out the door after passing a Friday deadline to show proof of vaccination. If Nov. 15 comes without those 27,000 either showing a vaccine card or signing an "attestation" of vaccination, they'll all be placed on unpaid leave( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/up-to-27000-federal-public-servants-miss-deadline-to-affirm-they-are-covid-vaccinated https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/up-to-27000-federal-public-servants-miss-deadline-to-affirm-they-are-covid-vaccinated ). With 267,000 total employees in the federal civil service and national police force, this would represent an immediate loss of more than 10 per cent of the work force. The airlines are also taking a significant hit on vaccine mandates. This week, Air Canada suspended more than 800 employees( HYPERLINK https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/air-canada-suspends-more-than-800-unvaccinated-workers-1.1675620 ) over their vaccination status, while WestJet suspended 300( https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/hundreds-of-westjet-employees-suspended-for-not-being-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-1.5647790 https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/hundreds-of-westjet-employees-suspended-for-not-being-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-1.5647790 ).

Don Braid isn't the first Albertan to notice that Trudeau's Glasgow promise conveniently lays a disproportionate share of Canada's emissions burden on Western Canada while leaving Central Canada free to build concrete plants and jetliners with relative freedom. "Psychologically, not to mention politically, that makes Liberal climate change action easy for other (read: not-Albertan) Canadians to live with and vote for," he wrote( HYPERLINK https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/braid-the-high-cost-of-regional-bias-in-climate-change-action https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/braid-the-high-cost-of-regional-bias-in-climate-change-action ).

He adds that the Alberta vote to end equalization might not have been a rejection of the practice, per se, but rather a shot at Quebec's penchant to collect Alberta money while openly disparaging the oil fields it came from.

GLASGOW - Do you know your GFANZ from your ISSB from your PPCA? Welcome to COP26 ! With truly global initiatives to slash the rate of planetary warming hard to come by, governments, companies and civil society groups are banding together in multiple smaller groups to try and accelerate change. Keeping track of the cornucopia of new clubs and alliances -each with its own, though sometimes overlapping, aims, is a headache both for outsiders and those inside the U.N. climate conference in Scotland. Governments have announced each alliance to great fanfare, but behind the scenes, they too are scrambling to keep up. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described updating an announcement repeatedly overnight as more countries were persuaded to join one of the pledges. Some environmental groups worried important substance was being dropped in such last-minute scrambles, with agreements sounding better than they may turn out to be in practice. "Assessing their true worth is hugely difficult, especially at speed during a COP meeting," Mohamed Adow, director of climate justice NGO Power Shift Africa, said in a tweet Thursday. "They are eye candy but the sugar rush they provide are empty calories," Adow said. Others saw the barrage of new partnerships and initiatives as evidence of greater engagement in an issue too long neglected. "We've never had as much corporate presence or commitment," U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said. GROUP OF GROUPS There's the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) -an umbrella group of clubs for insurers, banks, asset managers and other sub-sectors of the finance industry. They say they represent more than $130 trillion in assets, and will be under pressure to meet the need for an estimated $100 trillion in climate finance over the next three decades. U.N. climate envoy Mark Carney chairs that alliance and has also launched another -the Taskforce on Scaling up Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM) to boost private investment in voluntary carbon offset credits. John Neal, CEO at Lloyd's of London, admitted that anyone outside the finance world will be thinking "'I've got no idea what's going on'." "It's confusing," he said, but "I know it's not disingenuous." The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), backed by financial market regulators, was also announced on Wednesday and aims to standardize how companies should report on their climate risk exposure and sustainability practices. On Tuesday, some companies and governments pledged to use their spending power to fuel research and development of climate technologies under a U.S.-led 'First Movers Coalition' (FMC). Confused yet? Those groups are just about the money. On Thursday, themed "Energy Day" at COP26 , non-profit groups said they were busy just "untangling" announcements, such as Britain's 'Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement' representing various other energy pledges -some old, some new. Another new group of 20 countries and five development institutions promised to stop financing fossil fuels overseas it has yet to give itself a name. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Sun Media Corporation.

Renewable Energy Certificate market size was valued at US$12.7 billion in 2021, which is projected to reach US$100 billion by 2030The Company's MintCarbon.io platform has the capability of seamlessly facilitating the minting of RECs into NFTs as with carbon credits CALGARY, AB, April 20, 2022 /CNW/ - DeepMarkit Corp., ("DeepMarkit" or the "Company") (TSXV: MKT) (OTC: MKTDF) (FRA: DEP), a company focused on transitioning the global carbon offset market to the more accessible digital economy by minting credits into non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"), is pleased to announce that it has embarked on a strategic initiative to explore the minting of Renewable Energy Certificates ("RECs") into NFTs via its proprietary MintCarbon.io platform. RECs, also known as green tags or tradable renewable certificates, are non-tangible energy commodities that represent proof that one megawatt hour ("MWh") of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable energy source. The global REC market was valued at US$12.7 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach US$100 billion by 2030.1 By comparison, the voluntary carbon credit market surpassed $1 billion in market value in November 2021.2 The increase in demand for electricity around the world and company policies to reach certain renewable energy consumption targets, combined with the increase in renewable energy market share, are driving growth in the REC market. Until recently, the market's growth has been restrained by opaque regulations, general inaccessibility and the lack of awareness by developing countries that could benefit from a transparent and accessible platform like the MintCarbon.io platform. MintCarbon.io is expected to play an important role in assisting projects by providing an additional avenue of monetization, while better articulating a project's story and enabling new forms of engagement. Management Commentary "RECs represent a significant market segment for DeepMarkit. Based on input from our corporate development team, the MintCarbon.io platform's ability to seamlessly integrate RECs, combined with positive feedback received from renewable energy sector participants, make our decision to explore entering into this market an easy one, while remaining fully committed to our current carbon credit minting model," said Ranjeet Sundher, Interim CEO of DeepMarkit. ABOUT DEEPMARKIT DeepMarkit Corp. is a company focused on democratizing access to the voluntary carbon offset market by minting credits into non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"). Its common shares are listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the "MKT" stock symbol. DeepMarkit's wholly owned subsidiary, First Carbon Corp. ("FCC"), is a software infrastructure company operating in the tokenization vertical of the blockchain. FCC's primary asset, MintCarbon.io, is a web-based, software-as-a-service platform that facilitates the minting of carbon credits into NFTs (based on the ERC-1155 standard) or other secure tokens (based on the ERC-20 standard). MintCarbon.io is currently undergoing testing and FCC anticipates an official launch of the platform in the near future. On behalf of: DEEPMARKIT CORP.

CANBERRA, Australia (AP)  Australia will commit to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 but will not increase its goal for 2030 at an upcoming U.N. climate summit in Scotland, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday. Morrison\' s conservative Liberal Party-led government was narrowly re-elected in 2019 with a climate policy that opposed the 2050 net zero target adopted by the opposition center-left Labor Party. Morrison wrote in an opinion piece published Tuesday in Australian News Corp newspapers that his government will indeed commit to the 2050 net zero goal, but will not up its election pledge to reduce emissions between 26% and 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.  I said we would meet and beat this target and we will, Morrison wrote. Getting to the net zero commitment took political wrangling on the part of Morrison's ruling party, including winning the support of a rural-based junior coalition member  the Nationals party  with a number of concessions. One of them was that Resources Minister Keith Pitt, who maintains Australia will continue exporting coal for decades, was made the fifth Nationals\' Cabinet minister. Morrison on Monday announced Pitt\' s promotion. Morrison will announce further details of the agreement with the Nationals after they are explained to government lawmakers at a meeting later Tuesday at Parliament House. The conditions also include a government review every five years of the economic impacts of the net zero target outside major cities. The first assessment would be delivered in 2023, The Australian newspaper reported. Finance Minister Simon Birmingham described the reviews as a  health check on how various parts of Australia were being effected by the transition to net zero.  What it will do is focus the minds of the government of the day very clearly on where additional investments may be necessary to help ensure the transition, Birmingham told Australian Broadcasting Corp. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who will host the upcoming summit in Glasgow, Scotland, known as COP26 , congratulated Australia on its net zero ambition.  That was very difficult for Australia because Australia\' s very heavily dependent on coal, on lots of carbon-producing industries, and they\' ve done a heroic thing, Johnson said, referring to the 2050 commitment. However Australia is likely to be criticized in Glasgow for its relatively weak 2030 target. The United States has committed to reductions of between 50% and 52% below 2005 levels. Britain has pledged to cut emissions by 68% below 1990 levels. Australia is one of the world\' s largest exporters of coal and liquified natural gas. The nation is also one of the world\' s worst greenhouse gas emitters per capita because of its heavy reliance on coal-fired power. COP26 will assess progress since nations agreed in the 2015 Paris accord to limit warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The meeting in Glasgow is widely seen as the last chance to hold global warming to 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial levels. \</doc>

LONDON - Environmental campaigners urged Britain's Queen Elizabeth and other royals on Saturday to commit to rewilding their vast estates - from planting more trees to going organic - as Scotland prepares to host the COP26 global climate conference. Chris Packham, a well-known conservationist and broadcaster, along with several hundred schoolchildren and a jazz band marched through central London to Buckingham Palace to deliver a petition signed by 100,000 people. "This is not the time for talking about doing things anymore, this is the time to actually do them, so whilst they are saying the right things ... what better place to do the right thing than in your very own, very large, back yard." Rewilding is a conservation effort aimed at restoring natural processes and wilderness areas, and Packham said a transition on royal estates would involve using only organic materials, more tree planting and a reduction in deer numbers to allow regeneration. He added that practices like grouse shooting in which land is burned and drained and lead shot is used "are not compatible with some of the things that the royal family are saying about their genuine concerns when it comes to the environment and the bio-diversity crisis." The Royal Estates said it has a long history of conservation and biodiversity and was constantly looking for ways to make further improvements. The Queen, her son Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, and the heir's eldest son Prince William and wife Kate will attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) taking place in Glasgow in November, organizers said on Friday. World leaders are due to meet at the summit to try to flesh out commitments made in Paris in 2015 aimed at stabilizing the planet's climate and to speed up action to limit climate change.

COP26 president Alok Sharma says the clock is ticking for countries to commit to climate action, but consensus on critical issues hasn\' t yet been found.    What we're trying to achieve at Glasgow is in many ways harder than Paris, Sharma said. That\' s because years after the Paris Agreement was signed, there is still disagreement about how Article 6 should work, climate financing is lagging significantly, and every credible climate forecast shows the planet is rocketing into an era of climate breakdown with the off-ramps to a safe future whipping by.  After six years, we still have some of those difficult questions to answer, and we're essentially in the last half hour of the exam, Sharma said. Sharma said some areas of agreement were emerging, but declined to offer details ahead of the conference to avoid tipping negotiations one way or the other.  This is about building consensus, he emphasized. Taking place since 1995, the United Nations climate change conference  also known as COP, short for Conference of the Parties  brings policymakers, scientists, environmental activists, and climate experts together to negotiate agreements to reduce global warming. This year, COP26 will take place at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow, Scotland, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. The event has been called the  last hope for meeting the world\' s Paris Agreement goal, and is the first COP where countries are expected to put forward more ambitious targets to reduce emissions since Paris was signed. Canada has already submitted its revised Paris target, called nationally determined contributions (NDC), earlier this year when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the country\' s emissions target would jump from 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, to 40 to 45 per cent. Canadian Institute for Climate Choices senior research associate Caroline Lee said it was good Canada increased its ambition, but independent analysis has shown the target is still not aligned with meeting global climate goals. In fact, the independent Climate Action Tracker found Canada\' s updated target is in line with a catastrophic 4 C warming \- \- far higher than the 1.5 C agreed to in Paris.    It's great that we've increased the ambition of our mitigation targets, but it's still not enough, and I would say exactly the same thing when it comes to climate finance, Lee said. Canada has been tasked with helping close the climate financing gap, giving the country an outsized role in the COP negotiations. That also presents an opportunity for Canada to increase climate financing to its fair share, often calculated at about US$4 billion annually. Lee said rich countries\' delay in meeting the $100-billion climate financing promise    which was supposed to arrive by 2020 but will be years overdue  has real consequences for developing nations because, to varying degrees, the countries will rely on that money to bring down their costs of decarbonization, adding the late arrival has implications for trust building.  The longer it goes that developed countries don't fulfil this promise, the greater risk we have of eroding trust and goodwill across countries in these negotiations, she said, calling those the critical ingredients for successful negotiations.    Canada should be using its diplomatic influence to make sure that countries are making good on this commitment, she said. Despite expectations Costa Rica and Denmark will launch the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance at COP26 , and a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty gaining traction, both Lee and Sharma said they didn\' t expect fossil fuels to be a central part of the formal COP negotiations in Glasgow. Even though major commitments around fossil fuels are expected to be made at COP26 , those announcements are separate from formal negotiations. Still, they shouldn\' t be ignored by the Canadian delegation, Lee says.  The non-proliferation treaty, for instance, I think underscores this notion that a transition is happening globally, she said.    Canada needs to be taking a long, hard look at what the real prospects for continued oil and gas production are in a net-zero world and then looking at how our domestic policies might be in line or not in line  with that future. The International Energy Agency\' s latest report, released earlier this month, for the first time forecasts oil demand to decline in every scenario it considered. Depending on the world\' s climate ambitions, the pace it will decline varies, according to the IEA, but if the world is aiming to hold global warming to 1.5 C, demand has to fall now. \</doc>

NEW DELHI (AP)  Bangladesh, considered especially prone to extreme weather and rising ocean levels, plans to present its  climate prosperity plan to lessen the effects of climate change on the economy at the forthcoming U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, an official said. The plan envisions boosting renewable energy, making agriculture more resistant to climate shocks and finding solutions in nature, such as restoring mangroves to protect coasts from cyclones. The South Asian nation says it will encourage other similarly vulnerable countries to draft their own plans. Representatives of more than 200 countries will gather for the 26th U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP26 , from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 in Glasgow, Scotland, to discuss new targets for cutting or curbing the growth of emissions that contribute to climate change. With most of its 160 million people tightly packed into low-lying areas along the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to flooding, extreme weather and the loss of farmland to rising sea levels.  Hopefully, we\' ll be carrying this to COP26 , requesting all vulnerable countries to have their own prosperity plans looking toward their own issues, own problems and own resources, said Azad, the government\' s special envoy to the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of nations most vulnerable to climate change. The question of how climate change will impact its economy is key for the country that has emerged as one of Asia\' s fastest growing economies. Its gross domestic product has increased from $6.2 billion in 1972 to $305 billion in 2019. Some forecasts expect it to double in size by 2030, with the goal of becoming a higher middle-income country by 2031 and a developed one by 2041. But climate change could reverse this trend and presents an existential threat. Despite contributing a fraction of the world\' s emissions, a third of its population is at risk of from displacement by sea level rise. It is also at increased risk from severe floods, cyclones and heat waves.  We live with nature ... we can\' t change our inhabitants, Azad said. The question now is how Bangladeshis could best continue living in the delta, he said. Officials from the 48 countries that make up the Climate Vulnerable Forum said earlier this week that the recent U.N. science report stressed the urgent need to ensure that global warming doesn\' t increase beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Scientists say that goal is at risk unless emissions drop soon. Azad also called for governments to update emission reduction goals every year. He said that the rate of climate degradation and impacts of global warming were far outpacing efforts to combat it. Many wealthy nations are failing to meet targets for carbon reduction while major developing economies such as China are ramping-up the mining and use of coal to meet energy shortages, while insisting they remain on track for gradually reducing emissions. Azad said extreme weather had brought destruction not just to developing nations, but also to the developed world. The cost of failure at the upcoming climate talks would be  very devastating, he said. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\' s Department of Science Education.

To say the mood in Glasgow was tense in the months and weeks leading up to COP26 would be an understatement. Roads shut down, an abundance of police roamed the streets and my school - the University of Glasgow - sent multiple frantic emails warning students about incoming disruptions. A major transit crisis was barely avoided when a deal was reached with ScotRail workers, who were threatening to strike during the summit's full two weeks unless they received fair compensation. Janitors, education staff, the city's recycling services, among others, all planned to use the occasion to strike in hopes of gaining global recognition to their cause. The mood here was frightened - far from excited - and it all came to a head during COP26 . Small island nations like Fiji - whose very existence is in jeopardy with rising sea levels - had only limited representation due to pandemic-related restrictions. Promises made in 2015 by rich nations to better support developing countries adapt to a green economy are largely falling short, causing a real sense of pessimism regarding anything announced in Glasgow. The world needed a defining moment to address this crisis, but it was handicaped from the beginning. As a Canadian studying in Glasgow, I tried to expose myself to all the COP26 -related events over the past two weeks. I saw superstars in action like Greta Thunberg and Malala Yousafzai. I listened to experts discuss the lopsided effects a changing climate has on Indigenous peoples, women and farmers. I marched with protesters calling on world leaders to do more. While the message was clear that we need real action, there lacked a key component everyone needed: optimism. I've worked in Canadian politics at both the provincial and federal levels. I worked in media relations for almost two years for a large energy corporation. Both of my roles required me to develop key messaging, write speeches, draft media responses and other various communications-related tasks. One thing I learned during my short professional career is when an issue arises, how it's framed, how it's being addressed and what to expect next is vitally important. As I pursue my MSc in political communications, it's becoming even more clear how critical it is to clearly and firmly define climate-related issues and communicate them to the public. At this point in the politicization of the climate crisis, the world has moved past the framing aspect of the issue. It's clear that the real dangers of a changing climate are well understood and increasingly obvious. Shifting toward a green economy has now become a mainstream position for governments - of all parties, left and right - around the world. Environment ministers, climate reporters, international NGOs - both the public and private sector are reassessing how they address the evolving emergency. Even companies heavily implicated with global warming, such as Shell and BP, were in attendance in Glasgow, offering their perspective on what altering their business means for the world. COP26 made clear the world is entering a new phase in addressing and communicating the climate crisis. Leaders vary on how they approach the issue - U.S. President Joe Biden, for example, won't utter the words "climate change"' without using the word "jobs" in the same sentence. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has for months been rebranding the U.K. in the wake of Brexit as a global leader on an international crisis. There is now a global consensus on the need for climate action. The torch will soon be passed to a new generation of decision-makers and climate activists - and it's important to start looking at the bigger picture. Climate change is not something that will be fixed overnight. While activists are correct in being skeptical about promises made over the past two weeks, it's still an important starting point. COP21, which produced the landmark Paris Agreement, set ambitious and bold targets. As we eventually reach the time frames of lofty promises made by governments today, how we act tomorrow is the essential next step. The anxiety-ridden youth marching for more action will soon be the ones calling the shots. In fact, not only were millennials and members of Gen Z largely responsible for swaying the 2020 U.S. presidential election, those born between 1981 and 1996 recently ran for public office in the U.S. at record levels. Daphne Frias, a 23-year-old climate activist speaking at a panel in Glasgow on young women and the climate movement, summed it up perfectly by saying: "We always say our leaders have failed us. We are the new leaders. We are the ones who are going to make the decisions going forward." As the Glasgow summit comes to a close, there's a lot to look back on. While notable commitments were made, including a ban on deforestation, a pledge by rich countries to help South Africa transition away from its coal-heavy energy system and Canada's vow to ??put a cap on oil and gas sector emissions, there's still plenty of work to do. Regardless, the international attention COP26 received the past two weeks in itself shows how urgently climate action is now regarded. Activism works. The tens of thousands of people who marched in Glasgow and around the world have been heard. We have their attention - now, let's think ahead.

Starting on Sunday, world leaders, negotiators from 190 countries, British royals, official observers, journalists, activists, celebrities - and as many as 100,000 demonstrators - will descend on Glasgow, Scotland, to try to save the planet from runaway warming. What could go wrong? A lot. Even apart from possible failure of the talks. The COP26 climate summit, postponed last year because of the pandemic, is going forward despite a soaring spike in COVID in Britain, where case levels now rival last winter's peak. The British and Scottish governments, serving as hosts, are expecting up to 30,000 official attendees - who will be meeting indoors, huddling in tense talks, for hours and hours a day, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12 and potentially longer. It will be the largest ever summit hosted in Britain. Organizers are scrambling to make sure the conference does not morph into a superspreader event. The good news: They appear to have averted a rail workers' strike that would have brought Scotland's trains to a standstill. The bad news: Trash collectors are still threatening to strike - reviving images of mountains of rubbish during a 13-week strike in the 1970s. Not quite the earth-friendly image Scotland is going for. The most startling images from this week, though, were of Glasgow underwater - hit by torrential rain and floods that forced road closures and postponement of a light show at the botanic gardens. Trains from London to Glasgow were cancelled on Thursday. Instead travellers were offered "replacement bus service," some of the most dreaded words in the English language. Flooding in Glasgow isn't new. The site of the climate conference was severely damaged, and two people died, when the city was submerged in 1994. That was considered Glasgow's worst flood in the previous 106 years. And, as everyone attending the climate conference knows too well, those 100-year events become more frequent as the world warms. But to deal with extreme weather requires getting people to the conference. The logistics have been formidable, especially for delegates from countries with vaccines in short supply. Ocean Rebellion activists dressed as Boris Johnson and "Oil head" set fire to the sail of a small boat next to the River Clyde, opposite the Scottish Event Campus, where the COP26 will take place, in Glasgow, Scotland October 27, 2021. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to provide vaccines to all attendees who could not get them in their home nations. A spokesman from the Cabinet Office said Wednesday that doses went out to recipients in 70 nations, but he declined to say how many people had received them. "We are working tirelessly with all our partners, including the Scottish Government and the U.N., to ensure an inclusive, accessible and safe summit in Glasgow," said a COP26 spokesman, who following British protocol is not named. The British government has been criticized for being slow and disorganized, only getting the first doses out to delegations six weeks ago, in an accelerated schedule that would barely allow for four weeks between rounds. "We've heard from a lot of delegates who complain to us that they found the whole process very cumbersome. It's not clear at all how many people took advantage of the U.K. offer for vaccines," said Harjeet Singh, a senior adviser for Climate Action Network, in New Delhi. "A lot of attendees are concerned, you could say, even anxious, about COVID at the conference," Singh said. Quamrul Chowdhury, a climate negotiator from Bangladesh, said, "A lot of delegations have yet to be fully vaccinated. Maybe they have gotten one jab, but not two. The delays were a challenge." Chowdhury said he is vaccinated but still waiting for his visa to enter Britain and travel to Glasgow. "Maybe I will see you on Sunday," he said. "Or Monday."

(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) While vaccines are strongly advised, they aren't actually mandatory to attend COP26 . The Scottish government is requiring delegates to wear face masks indoors, to maintain social distancing and perform daily coronavirus testing before they enter the official "Blue Zone," where the summit will be staged. Anyone testing positive will be told to quarantine. But if home testing kits have a false negative rate of about 15 percent, as some studies suggest, that could mean quite a few infected individuals could walk into the summit each day. And the strict protocols against COVID in the Blue Zone may not extend to the large demonstrations that are planned just outside. "There is no public health expert in the world who would say there is no risk in the midst of a global pandemic to have tens of thousand of people descending" onto Glasgow, Scotland's health minister, Humza Yousaf, told the BBC. "There is absolutely a risk of COVID cases rising thereafter," he said, adding that it was worth it. "We will do everything we possibly can to make the event safe, because we recognize the climate emergency itself is the biggest public health emergency and crisis that we face globally," Yousaf said. Until recently, Britain required mandatory quarantines for all arrivals flying into England from "red list" countries. The government slashed the list from 60 countries to seven this month, leaving only Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Peru and Venezuela. At the same time, some countries are discouraging their citizens from traveling to Britain, given current coronavirus levels here. Morocco, which has had one of the largest COP delegations, has imposed a ban on flights to and from the United Kingdom. The U.S. State Department has a "do not travel" warning in place for the U.K. For those who can get to Glasgow, many will be shelling out quite a lot. Hotel rates quadrupled before selling out. Modest one-bedroom Airbnbs were listed at more than $1,000 a night. Vacancies are virtually nonexistent. "It is critical that Glasgow is ready for the influx of world leaders and others. We have heard reports of difficulties finding accommodation, concerned local businesses and reports of train strikes potentially disrupting travel," said lawmaker Pete Wishart, chair of the British parliament's Scottish Affairs Committee, which traveled to Glasgow on Monday to have a look for themselves. Wishart said Scotland must deliver "to the world-class standard that the circumstances demand. The eyes of the world will be on Glasgow." Scottish leaders have been looking forward to that attention. But strikes by the public workers who collect recyclables and trash could be an embarrassment. The city's move to pick up trash just three times a month have created overflowing cans and dumpsters, which is alleged to have fortified the city's already sizable rodent population. The Herald newspaper in Scotland reported that refuse workers have deployed a giant inflatable rat in demonstrations against work conditions and wage cuts. At least four rubbish collectors have reportedly been bitten. The leader of the Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, downplayed the rats, saying all big cities have their rodents. Aitken told the lawmakers visiting from the British parliament that Glasgow has struggled with services because the pandemic. But she said the city workers had spent 12,000 hours to tidy up Glasgow for COP26 . She said the city would be ready. \</doc>

Young people leading the global climate strike movement turned their backs on the United Nations\' COP26 youth day on Friday, instead bringing thousands onto Glasgow\' s street in protest. A tone of indignation ran through demonstrators in the crowd that snaked through the Scottish city hosting the two-week climate conference, but that was entwined with a collective sense of possibility, too.  It\' s really upsetting to see them make promises about fixing the planet and then they just go and they build something that is literally doing the opposite of that, said Jenny Gardner, a 16-year-old from nearby Loch Lomond who came with several friends, of the global leaders assembled about a mile away.  They say that they care, but they don\' t care, she said.  I think that\' s really infuriating and this is about rebelling against their empty words. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg chose Fridays as the day to regularly skip school to protest climate inaction back in 2018. The movement created in her wake, Fridays for Future, continues to draw supporters demanding urgent action to slow global warming. (A global day of action is planned for Saturday.) The stage set up at the march\' s end in the central George Square featured a string of Indigenous speakers from around the world, who detailed the disproportionate impact extractive industries funded by industrialized nations have on their lives. They included a climate activist from West Papua who said his father was assassinated by the Indonesian military for speaking out about the destruction of their South Pacific homeland, part of the island of New Guinea, the world\' s third-largest carbon sink.  This is what climate justice is about, the man said.  The climate crisis happens on Indigenous lands, and it is still happening there.  But we are not climate victims, he said to cheers from the crowd.  We are climate leaders. We know how to protect pristine land. The crowd and the speakers also represented labour, socialists and even medical students who pointed out the negative health impacts of a warming planet. Paccha Turner Chuji, a 21-year-old from Ecuador who lives in England, said she joined the march to support the international Indigenous movement, which is increasingly connected to climate justice movements  My aim is to support the amplification of Indigenous people\' s across the world because their voice and their knowledge is essential for the radical shift that the world needs to undergo, she said. Thunberg, who took the stage at the end of the event, said the people and regions most affected by the climate emergency remained on the outside of the policy response.  This is now a Global North greenwash festival, she said of the UN event.  A two-week long celebration of business as usual and blah blah blah. \</doc>

Steven Guilbeault has had a big week. The MP for the Montreal district of Laurier-Ste-Marie said he was "speechless" when the prime minister told him he would be Canada's next environment and climate change minister. And being sworn in on Tuesday was the realization of a 15-year-old dream. But Guilbeault sounds most moved when he talks about the moment he saw his name beside the title "Head of Canadian Delegation" for the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow, Scotland. Guilbeault has attended the annual conference 19 times, mainly in the backrooms as an activist, talking to the press and trying to put pressure on the leaders. "My first COP was the first one in 1995," Guilbeault told the Montreal Gazette. "And I have been on the Canadian Delegation before as a civil society representative. But the idea that I'm going to be leading our delegation now is very humbling. It's an extreme privilege, and it's a super important role to play." Of course, there are those who are not so pleased to see Guilbeault in this new role. This week, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney called Guilbeault an "absolutist" and his appointment "problematic." Federal Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole called him "out of balance" and "against everything," and Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre called him Canada's new "looney-left environment minister." Columnists have referred to him as a "militant" and a "Greenpeace prankster," as photos resurfaced of Guilbeault being arrested 20 years ago after climbing the CN Tower to draw attention to government inaction on climate change. Guilbeault said he regrets nothing about his past and still considers himself an activist. He doesn't flinch at the name-calling, and he looks forward to talking to Kenney and his other critics. "They are trying to make a point, and I am trying to get down to business," he said. "I've always shown that I'm willing to work with everyone and anyone who's interested in fighting climate change, regardless of where they are coming from, what industrial sector, what region of the country. If you want to work on climate change, I'll be happy to work with you." Guilbeault may call himself an activist, but anyone who has followed his career over the past three decades might be more likely to describe him, with respect, as a "climate geek." Through his years as a climate campaigner at Greenpeace and \'c9quiterre, as a columnist and commentator, as a consultant to a venture capital fund, and as an adviser to the Quebec, Manitoba, Ontario and Alberta governments, his focus has always been on climate change. He said he intends to use all that experience, but remain humble, in his new role at COP26 , which runs from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. "The best leaders in these forums are those who listen to what they're being told," by civil society and provincial leaders as well as Indigenous, labour and youth groups, he said. "All have something to contribute. I can tell you that at the time of the Harper government, there was not a lot of listening happening. There was a lot of, 'We know better than all of you, despite the fact that we've never paid any attention to this issue.'" Guilbeault is now preparing for more than 20 bilateral meetings at COP26 , including meetings with John Kerry, the U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, with environment ministers for South Korea and South Africa, and with the European commissioner for environment. His main focus will be to sell the idea of an international carbon price to as many countries as possible. Another priority is signing more nations to the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an initiative launched by Canada and the U.K. in 2017 to get countries to commit to ending coal power generation by 2030. At a virtual news conference on Friday, Guilbeault told reporters he would not be announcing any new emissions targets or measures in Glasgow. He will be confirming, "on a world stage," Canada's commitment, made last spring, to cut emissions to between 40 and 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. He will also be vaunting Canada's pledge to contribute $5.6 billion to a fund to help developing nations cope with climate change. Additionally, he will confirm the plan to cap and cut emissions from the country's oil and gas sector to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, a move no other oil-producing country has made. However, he will not be announcing new details on that cap and cut process, he said, before consulting widely at home after COP26 . The 2016 Paris Agreement aims to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees Celsius, to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Guilbeault said he is, nonetheless, "cautiously optimistic" about COP26 . HYPERLINK mailto:mlalonde@postmedia.com mlalonde@postmedia.com \</doc>

CALGARY, AB, Nov. 3, 2021 /CNW/ - "Canadian energy should stand as a model for progress on climate action this week in Glasgow", says Canada Action, a grassroots-built coalition. "Canada should be a preferred global supplier of our energy and other resources.We're a world leader in emission intensity reductions, water recycling, carbon capture utilization and storage, methane emission reductions, renewables, clean-tech and innovation. We're one of only a few global oil and gas producers with carbon pricing," said founder and spokesperson Cody Battershill. In response to the emissions cap announcement, Battershill pointed out that "Even before PM Trudeau's announcement, many Canadian Oil and Gas companies had announced their realistic, workable plans to achieve net zero. Emissions reduction has long been a central focus." "With global energy demand rising steadily - including for oil and gas - and with several West Coast Indigenous communities advancing LNG projects so that Canada's lowest-emission LNG reaches global consumers, this is an opportunity for Canadians to highlight their comprehensive ESG leadership." Battershill noted a continuing global energy crisis means COP26 should pursue a more inclusive energy strategy if only because reliable access to affordable energy underpins modern life for billions of people on the planet. "According to a study in the journal Science, if all global oil producers adopted Canadian flaring and methane standards, then the emissions from producing a barrel of oil would drop by 23 percent, equivalent to taking 100 million cars off the road," Battershill said. "There are many other examples of Canadian energy leadership on climate. Canada is among the first countries in which a majority of the oil and gas sector has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050. We're also one of the few oil-producing nations where detailed disclosures are publicly available on climate and environmental-related risks," Battershill added. Battershill added that, of the world's top 10 oil exporters, Canada ranks first on the following environment, social and governance indices: Green Future Index 2021 Democracy Index 2020 Environmental Performance Index 2020 Global Peace Index 2020 Global Press Freedom Index 2020 Rule of Law Index 2020 Social Progress Index 2020 Sustainable Development Index 2020 Corruptions Perception Index 2020 Women, Peace, Security Index 2019/20 "We hope the roughly 20,000 people descending on Glasgow during COP26 will recognize Canada'sworld-leading climate action not only on the energy front but also in forestry, mining, agriculture and other sectors in which GHG emissions continue to decline."

EDITOR: As individual consumers, far too many of us still recklessly behave as though throwing non-biodegradable garbage down a dark chute, or pollutants flushed down toilet/sink drainage pipes or emitted out of elevated exhaust pipes or spewed from skyhigh jet engines and very tall smoke stacks - even the largest toxic-contaminant spills in rarely visited wilderness - can somehow be safely absorbed into the air, water, and land (i.e. out of sight, out of mind). It's like we are inconsequentially dispensing of that waste into a black-hole singularity, in which it's compressed into nothing. If possible, every structure should independently harvest solar energy, at least as an emergency power storage system. There already are fossil-fuel-powered generator systems that engage once the regular electric-grid flow gets cut off, so why not use clean solar energy instead of the very old school and carbon intensive means? Furthermore, especially when considering most humans'very vulnerable over-reliance on electricity, it may no longer be prudent to have every structure's entire electricity supply relying on external power lines that are susceptible to being crippled by unforeseen events, in particular weather storms of unprecedented magnitude. Meanwhile, it seems to me that if the universal availability of green-energy alternatives will come at the profit-margin expense of traditional 'energy'production companies, one can expect formidable obstacles, including the political and regulatory sort. If something notably conflicts with corporate big-profit interests, even very progressive motions are greatly resisted, often enough successfully. And, of course, there will be those who will rebut the concept altogether, perhaps solely on the illogic that if it was possible, it definitely would have been patented and produced already and made a few people very wealthy. \</doc>

Satellite and AI-powered Platform to be Used by Utility, Energy and Other Companies to Measure, Enhance, Track, Report and Offset Biodiversity, Natural Capital, GHG Emission & Other Sustainability Metrics for Land, Air and Water SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 11, 2021 /CNW/ --AiDash, a leading provider of satellite and AI-powered operations, maintenance and sustainability platform, today announced the launch of its Intelligent Sustainability Management System (ISMS) to help companies achieve their sustainability goals including the 10 percent biodiversity net gain by 2030. The new ISMS SaaS solution, would enable customers like National Grid, a leading energy company, to meet the biodiversity net gain standards (BNG) and increase cost savings and other efficiencies by eliminating frequent land surveys that are currently performed manually. AiDash developed ISMSover the past 9 months, working closely with the National Grid Partners Innovation team. The unveiling today at 4 PM at the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow is led by Stephen Marland, Director of Innovation at National Grid Partners, alongside Abhishek Singh, CEO of AiDash. Organizations with large landholdings, such as National Grid and other utilities, energy, water and wastewater companies, face the challenge of using traditional on the ground surveying methods to accurately map the land type and understand and measure the biodiversity level of each habitat. The cost and process complexities of using these methods can often hinder the implementation of natural capital enhancement plans for progressive, environmentally conscious organizations. The UK's Environment Bill legislating the BNG, when approved, would further strengthen the planning powers in England mandating at least the 10 percent net gain in biodiversity for all new developments and raise the imperative of land sustainability across many sectors. In a recent survey by SAP and Oxford Economics, 50 percent of utility and energy executives said increased process complexity is a hindrance to meeting sustainability goals. "Sustainably responsible organizations are struggling to find integrated operations platforms that can help them stay on top of their goals and meet the regulations within their sectors," said Abhishek Singh, Co-founder and CEO of AiDash. "Existing tools and techniques lack the ability to analyze historical data and make data-driven environmental improvements. Our new platform solves this problem, allowing organizations to achieve resource efficiency and implement individual Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Any organization and/or government body with large land or water assets can benefit from ISMS." The ISMS 'Land' modulewould help customers reduce laborious fieldwork through the AI-backed image analysis for systematic mapping, planning and assessing land enhancements, and quantify biodiversity to plan sustainable land development and restoration initiatives based on the environmental value of varying habitats. The GHG emissions are measured across sources like well pads and gas pipelinesthrough the ISMS 'Air' module. "At National Grid, we are committed to improving the Environmental Value across our sites in the UK by 10 percent by 2026, from a natural capital and biodiversity baseline," said Prem Gabbi, Head of National Grid Property. "It's a crucial step in helping us achieve our regulatory obligations and enabling us to make our contribution towards addressing the biodiversity crisis and climate change. Collaborating with AiDash's satellite-powered Intelligent Sustainability Management System could enable us to make environmental surveys and audits, relatively seamless, while saving weeks of manual laborin the field work. This means we could efficiently leverage repeatable and transparent satellite data to design optimal strategies for enhancing the biodiversity across c.3500 hectares of non-operational National Grid land in the UK and regularly monitor improvements while reallocating internal resources." The AiDash Intelligent Sustainability Management System is officially launching today from 4 PM - 5 PM, local Glasgow time at SEC Glasgow, at the National Grid Green Zone booth at COP26 where National Grid and AiDash representatives will present the new system. About AiDashAiDash is an AI-first vertical SaaS company enabling satellite and AI powered operations, maintenance and sustainability for industries with geographically distributed assets.

On the heels of the world's largest climate summit, a provincial cabinet minister in Saskatchewan is glowing about the prospects of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). "At COP26 Keading appeared with energy ministers from Ontario and New Brunswick to tout their plans to roll out the reactors in coming years as Canada promises to wind down its carbon emissions. Alberta also signed on in April. Researchers say there's little doubt nuclear power will play a role in a low emissions future, but unknowns like public opinion may complicate matters. Saskatchewan plans to have its first reactor online by 2032, with three more to follow by 2042. Those reactors may be a helpful tool to fight climate change, but Saskatchewan shouldn't put all its eggs in one basket, noted Martin Boucher of the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy. Boucher said there's lower hanging fruit that could be considered without the lengthy development of a new technology  like making the housing stock more efficient and deploying more renewable energy sources. "If you're just looking at emissions and the best strategy to reduce emissions locally here in Saskatchewan, I'd be a bit skeptical in this approach," he said. A report this year estimated the reactors' impact on Saskatchewan's gross domestic product at $8.8 billion, while preventing 73 megatonnes of cumulative emissions the province would otherwise generate between 2027 and 2050. Kaeding told the panel renewable energy like wind and solar power would be supplementary sources, but wouldn't provide baseline power to the province. John Gorman, president of the Canadian Nuclear Association, said in an interview that the reactors are the path for Saskatchewan to meet emissions targets and to decarbonize sectors like mining and fertilizer production. "The question becomes, 'What's the magnitude of that? How much generation will we need from nuclear to reach our goals?' " said Dale Eisler, a senior policy fellow at the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy. "But I think there's there's little doubt that the magnitude of the challenge of net zero is going to require a role for nuclear power in the future." A survey Eisler and Prof. Margot Hurlbert reported in 2020 found Saskatchewan residents who were concerned about nuclear reactors typically cited issues around "risk and safety, the management of nuclear waste, lack of knowledge and the belief they were hypothetical and years from development." Nuclear energy nonetheless plays a role in future scenarios, according to Hurlbert, who has served as an editor and author for the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change and is the Canada Research Chair in Climate Change, Energy and Sustainability Policy. "But it's this public opinion and the unknown of the future on how we're going to transition and what exactly that energy and transportation infrastructure is going to look like going forward  that's the big, interesting discussion," she said. \</doc>

EVAN SOLOMON: The world continues its work to fight climate change. Environmental leaders, activists, and politicians from around the world are right now in the middle of the negotiations over the best way to fight climate change. I know the leaders have left, but many aren't. Have the participants risen to the critical challenge? Our next guest has been there representing the Assembly of First Nations at COP26 , and he joins us now. The Assembly of First Nations Nova Scotia and Newfoundland Regional Chief Paul Prosper. Chief, good to have you on the program. You're on the ground. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said cap on oil and gas emissions, cap on methane emissions. You know, there's an element on stopping certain logging of old growth forests. In your view, what has been the good, and what has been missing? REGIONAL CHIEF PAUL PROSPER (Assembly of First Nations Nova Scotia & Newfoundland): Well, obviously, there's a number of objectives yet to be achieved within the context of these discussions, issues around article 6, and financing, things of that nature which have been outstanding for a bit. Part of the good is the opportunity for the Assembly of First Nations as a party of the Canadian delegation, and having that sort of interplay and discussion with government officials, negotiators involved within the process, but also having that open dialogue with Indigenous people across the world, you know, who come together and share views and perspectives on climate change. So that in itself is quite a learning experience. SOLOMON: And what's missing? What do you want to see on the table, Chief? PROSPER: Well, it's important, I think, for state representatives and negotiators alike to understand some of the key issues related to Indigenous Peoples, human and legal rights that exist for Indigenous Peoples across the world, and so it's important when you start looking at carbon market mechanisms, and things of the like, to take that into consideration and provide necessary safeguards in order for Indigenous Peoples to be accounted for from a human and legal rights perspective. So that's an important component. And the other thing that I think is rather critical is to consider a First Nations lens when it comes to climate change. So that is sort of innovative and new ways to take into consideration the root causes of climate change from an Indigenous perspective, and to work on Indigenous sort of formulated solutions, because we're talking about a unique history, unique rights, and in order to come up with appropriate solutions, that certainly needs to be taken into account. SOLOMON: Regional Chief, just one last thing, the flags at Canada's federal buildings and the Peace Tower are flying at half mast obviously after the unmarked graves found at former residential institutions. Remembrance Day is coming up. CTV has just learned that they're going to be raised and then lowered again. No one is sure if they should be raised again after. What's your view on that? PROSPER: Well, you know, it's quite a thing, you know, with respect to the unmarked graves, and it's still outstanding in terms of the rising numbers in terms of deaths associated with residential school. That, combined with Remembrance Day, it's really a compelling sort of situation here. With respect to flags being lowered and then raised, I mean it provides an avenue for recognition. My father was a World War II veteran, and, you know, when he came back, you know, he wasn't afforded the same rights as his non-Aboriginal counterparts. And, you know, so there's a need for, and a time for reflection, that coupled with the mass graves and residential school is a really critical, and I think emotional moment for Aboriginal people, and non-Aboriginal people as well. So you know I recognize the need, and that type of recognition in terms of lowering the flag, I mean, and, you know, but we all need to take that into consideration in terms of remembering the contributions of Aboriginal people across this country. SOLOMON: Yeah, which were huge. By the way, thank you, your father, for his service in the country. Regional Chief Prosper, good to have you on the program, appreciate it. PROSPER: Thank you. Take care. SOLOMON: You too. That's Regional Chief Paul Prosper in Glasgow. Coming up next, to mandate or not to mandate healthcare workers. Should they be vaccinated against COVID-19? And the head of the Canadian Medical Association says yes, and that Ontario and Quebec are making the wrong call. Dr. Katherine Smart joins us next with her perspective. Stay with us.

Following the unprecedented heat dome that occurred in B.C. last June, which claimed hundreds of human lives, I feel compelled to write to emphasize the need for an all-encompassing approach to addressing the climate crisis. Climate change is a global threat that requires urgent response. According to the World Health Organization, between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year. The vulnerability to climate crisis is determined by exposure level to climate change, individual sensitivity, and prevailing adaptation mechanisms. Canada signed on to the COP26 (2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference) pledge to halt practices that increase greenhouse gas emissions. While appropriate, this only tackles an aspect of the vulnerability mapping: "exposure." Therefore, attention should also be geared toward strengthening adaptive systems to curtail the impact on high-sensitivity groups. Through policy and further stakeholder engagements, Canada's national adaptation strategy can be implemented to complement "net-zero" initiatives in the quest to mitigate the health impact of the climate crisis.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spent days telling world leaders to stop "quilting the Earth in a suffocating blanket of CO2" and to "get real" about their responsibilities to the planet. So the delegates at the Cop26 climate summit are entitled to raise an eyebrow at the news that their host will fly back to London by private jet when he leaves the conference in Glasgow later this week. The 640-km train journey from Glasgow to London takes just four and a half hours, but Downing Street said Johnson had "significant time constraints." which meant the train was not an option. The prime minister was accused of sending "completely the wrong message" on climate action, as private aircraft emit between 10 and 60 times as much carbon dioxide per passenger as scheduled flights, and up to 140 times as much diesel-powered exhaust. It came after other world leaders and delegates had been accused of contributing to a "climate disaster" by using hundreds of private jets to descend on Glasgow, as well as helicopters and motorcades. Well over 200 private aircraft are expected to land during the 13-day summit, though one estimate suggests the figure could be as high as 400. Small executive jets emit 10 times more greenhouse gases per passenger than scheduled flights, taking just six hours to generate as much CO2 as the average person does in a year. Environmental campaigners have reacted with fury, saying many of the journeys could have been undertaken on regular passenger aircraft, or even by train in some cases. "Private jets are a disaster for the climate. A single onehour private flight emits two tons of carbon emissions, which is a quarter of the carbon produced by the average European in a whole year," said Helena Bennett, senior policy adviser at Green Alliance. Around 30,000 delegates representing 197 countries are visiting Glasgow over the next two weeks, all of whom had a chance to set an example by using the most environmentally friendly form of transport available to them. In addition, the president travelled from Edinburgh airport to the summit in Glasgow in a motorcade of 22 cars, creating around four tons of CO2 for the 150-km round trip. The president's armoured limousine, nicknamed the Beast, manages just eight miles per gallon and emits 4kg of CO2 per mile. In contrast, a hybrid family car emits around 0.12kg per mile. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, also used a jet to get to the summit. She has used "air taxis" for more than half of her official trips abroad, including short hops to Paris and London from Brussels. Johnson flew to COP26 on a private jet from the G20 summit of world leaders in Rome, where he had lobbied fellow leaders on global warming. His spokesman said: "Obviously the fuel we use for this flight is sustainable and emissions are offset as well. "It's important that the prime minister is able to move around the country and obviously we have faced significant time constraints." !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

I followed COP 26 from Glasgow pretty closely. The Canadian contributions were large and worthy. The irrepressible Catherine McKenna, who insists on an outdoor swim wherever she goes, kept in touch via Twitter. She was once our minister of the environment, so she knows the issues and the players, and has become a freelance global activist on climate. She noticed, as did I, that while decision-makers are almost entirely old, male leaders of countries, real action is happening on the ground, and is young and female. Greta Thunberg led a march of 100,000 young people on the streets on Nov. 6. I was shattered by the photo by Alessandra Rizzo, a British photographer, of the men leaders, almost entirely in blue suits, white shirts and red ties, standing in rather assertive stances for what is called a "family photo" during the first week of COP26 . Only three women, as far as I could count. This cannot endure into the future. Not where life-changing decisions are being made. It was two weeks of tremendous learning. "Net zero" means that carbon emissions must be offset by equal amounts of natural or tech-driven carbon capture. And this is the nub of the great debate. What I discovered: China has a target year for net zero emissions of 2070. Its share of greenhouse emissions is 27 per cent of the global total. The U.S. has a target year of 2050, and it is responsible for 14 per cent of the bad stuff. But in the second week, China sent a message it wanted to engage with the U.S right away. Good news. These emitters are followed by the EU and then India, whose target year is 2070. Russia, Japan, and Canada are next. We set our target year at 2050. We are contributing 1.6 per cent of worldwide emissions. One good statistic is that 67 per cent of our power generation is now from renewables. The best newsletter I found is SIGNAL, put out by the group "GZERO," which has leadership from Ottawan Diana Carney (yes, the spouse of Mark Carney, who led the financial sector pledges). Banker Carney delivered as promised, a commitment of $130 billion dollars (U.S.) for projects to wean the global economy off fossil fuels. Then because promises are only promises until kept, and are seen to be kept, Chrystia Freeland, our finance minister, said that Canada will develop an accountability office in Montreal, to track and report on work done. Coal production came under fire; Michael Bloomberg pledged to help 35 countries end it. I find it hard to criticize money from the private sector. We are smart enough to discern when a company is just "greenwashing" itself. Another voice, a local boy making good, came to prominence: that of Dr. Christopher Lyon, son of Cheryl Lyon, whose new research paper is on lengthening the time-frame modelling to 500 years not just 80. In the good news column, Canadian Katharine Hayhoe, an evangelical Christian teaching in Texas and a renowned climate scientist, tells us that before the Paris Accord, we were headed for seven degrees warming. Now it is 2.7; still troubling. In fact, Week 2 was very sobering, as scientists crunched numbers. Moreover, only 14 per cent of Canadians talk about the climate crisis. We must increase that. "It's a bumpy road ahead," said Gerald Butts of Cape Breton. Let's equip ourselves for this road. Most of us can practise more frugality: cycling, using electric cars, installing solar panels, reducing meat-eating and beginning to love apartment-living.

The UN COP26 CALGARY, AB, Nov. 3, 2021 /CNW/ - As reported in the Daily Mail of Nov. 1, 2021, COP26 opened with a litany of melodramatic claims about an apocalyptic future due to climate change, but CLINTEL's open letter to world leaders of Nov. 2, 2021, slaps down this nonsense with 'climate reason' says Friends of Science Society. CLINTEL is the climate intelligence organization based in The Netherlands, with a network of more than 900 signatory scientists, engineers and scholars who reject the claim of a climate emergency. The CLINTEL message reads: Message of CLINTEL to National Politicians and World Leaders at COP26 (pdf) Hard facts show that global warming is NOT catastrophic, and therefore, there is NO climate crisis.Stop your fear-mongering messages. Fear leads always to wrong decisions and above all, it destroys the minds of our youth. Instead, inspire them with a positive outlook!The big climate picture tells us that we are slowly moving via ups and downs to the next ice age. The recovery from the Little Ice Age has been very beneficial for mankind and nature. Enjoy today's relatively benign climate! Sometime in the future we will again move to a colder phase and ultimately into the next ice age. The big climate picture also tells us that extreme weather,consisting ofheat waves and cold fronts, droughts and floods, hurricanes andblizzards, etc.is an integral part of the Earth's climate.Stop cherry-picking weather events that suit your fear-mongering agenda!Already for many decades, real-world observations show that IPCC's climate models seriously misrepresent unbiased science. The reality is that changes in the CO2 emissions have a negligible impact on the Earth's weather and climate. The reality is also that sea level rise has been stable and small for centuries. CO2is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth. It also benefits agriculture, increasing crop yields worldwide (see Figure 1 in pdf), enabling us to address global hunger.Please, stop slavishly following the Paris Climate Accord of 2015.It is fear-based and will only impoverish world nations. Instead,develop concrete climate adaptation plans,in collaboration with the regions. Global mitigation policies cost an exorbitant amount of money and they have never saved one life. National adaptation plans work,whatever the causes of climate change may be (see Figure 2 in pdf). Wind- and solar energy can play only a small role in the energy transition. Use clean fossil fuel power for the increasing energy needs, particular in developing countries. Meanwhile, cooperate worldwide to develop the nuclear power plants of the future, together with new storage and transportation technologies. It will result in prosperity for all.

Trudeau-COP, 4th Writethru COP26 talks begin in Scotland By Mia Rabson THE CANADIAN PRESS GLASGOW, United Kingdom - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the memory of Lytton, B.C., on Monday as he called for more global action in the fight against climate change and said Canada is starting to move on his election promise to cap emissions from the oil and gas sector. Trudeau gave a short speech Monday at the 26th meeting of the Council of Parties to the UN climate convention, known as COP26 in Glasgow. The 14-day talks are starting with a leaders' summit bringing together presidents and prime ministers from more than 120 countries to finalize how they'll actually meet the goals of the Paris accord. "In Canada, there was a town called Lytton," Trudeau said. "I say 'was' because on June 30, it burned to the ground." The Lytton fire occurred in a punishing heat wave that saw the town reach 49.6 C, the hottest temperature Canada has ever recorded. He said it's the kind of thing that could happen anywhere and another sign that it's time for the world to step up. "The science is clear: we must do more, faster," he said. "So that's the pledge and the call I bring to this historic meeting." COP26 is grappling with setting the rules for implementing the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement - the main one being to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to hold global warming to as close to 1.5 C as possible by the end of the century. That includes final agreements on what countries have to report about their plans, and their successes or failures at reducing greenhouse gases. Emissions like carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide, produced mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal, get lodged inside the atmosphere, where they trap heat and warm the planet. Some of the stickiest talks have to do with the responsibility of the biggest polluters and economies to both reduce their own pollution, and also help smaller and less developed countries adapt to and mitigate against a problem they are far less responsible for causing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at her last COP before she retires, told the conference the world is not where it needs to be yet to implement Paris, and there is a special role for developed countries because of their bigger responsibility for climate change to date. Germany, she noted, recently increased its emissions targets to 65 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2045. Those targets are more ambitious than Canada's new goal to get to 40-45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The targets of the European Union, United Kingdom and United States are also more aggressive than Canada's. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault, a longtime Canadian environmentalist, said Canada's new targets, just submitted to the United Nations in July, aren't going to be changed this week. The focus now is on implementing policies to actually meet them. Trudeau said Monday the government is now moving on its election promise to cap emissions from the oil and gas sector. The pledge made in September would see emissions limited to around current levels and ratcheted down every five years until they are carbon neutral by 2050. "We'll cap oil and gas sector emissions today and ensure they decrease tomorrow at a pace and scale needed to reach net zero by 2050," Trudeau said. "That's no small task for a major oil and gas producing country. It's a big step that's absolutely necessary." Guilbeault and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson on Monday formally asked the government's net-zero advisory board to help them accomplish this goal. "We seek your advice on key guiding principles to inform the development of quantitative five-year targets," the ministers wrote in a letter. "Your advice will also help inform the emissions reduction plan for Canada's 2030 target that we are committed to tabling in Parliament in the coming months." Catherine Abreu, executive director of Destination Zero and a member of the net-zero advisory body, said Canada's issue is that the promised cap does not specifically address production of oil and gas. "Canada has to grapple with production," she said while attending COP26 herself. Abreu said the least developed countries submitted a request to COP26 for the developed world to set a specific date for when fossil fuels will not be produced or burned anymore. Dale Marshall, national climate program manager with Environmental Defence, also said Trudeau's pledge fell short. "Focusing on emissions from oil and gas production but not production itself will allow oil and gas companies to keep putting forward false solutions, such as carbon capture and storage, fossil-based hydrogen, and far-off net zero plans, all while pumping out more and more atmosphere-destroying fossil fuels," Marshall said in a statement. "We cannot go from climate laggard to even the middle of the pack without curtailing oil and gas production, starting now." Guilbeault said the federal government does not have jurisdiction over production, but does have jurisdiction over pollution. He cited the recent Supreme Court decision upholding the federal carbon price as evidence that Canada can act to force emissions down. Alberta's premier, however, argued that any caps on emissions need to be set in consultation with the province. "I don't know why they would make an announcement like this without consulting with the province that actually owns the overwhelming majority of Canada's oil and gas reserve," said Premier Jason Kenney. Kenney told a news conference his government isn't necessarily opposed to an emissions cap, but "we need to know what the cap is." He urged the federal government to invest in technologies that cut emissions, repeating his call for $32 billion in public funding for carbon capture, storage and use facilities, which inject carbon dioxide deep underground. Trudeau also said Monday that $1 billion of Canada's promised $5.3 billion international climate financing will be directed to help less developed countries get off coal power. That announcement was welcomed by Mafalda Duarte, CEO of Climate Investment Funds, which works with development banks, governments and communities in developing countries to finance climate solutions. "Canada understands our climate future will be won in developing countries," she said. "Today's announcement from Prime Minister Trudeau is a strong signal of Canada's leadership in climate finance and represents a significant expansion of the country's 12-year partnership with the Climate Investment Funds." \</doc>

Queen Elizabeth II has hit out at world leaders who "talk" but they "don't do" on climate change, remarks that have been interpreted as expressing a degree of exasperation at possible no-shows for the upcoming COP26 climate conference in Glasgow. Her remarks weren't meant for public consumption - this is the Queen, after all, an expert at giving nothing away - but were picked up on a microphone. During the opening of the Welsh Parliament in Cardiff on Thursday, the Queen was talking to her daughter-in-law, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Elin Jones, the parliament's president officer. Her comments were picked up on a live stream, and although parts are inaudible, she can be heard talking about the climate conference. "Extraordinary, isn't it? I've been hearing all about COP," the Queen said, according to video and audio recordings analyzed by the Daily Mirror. "Still don't know who is coming ... We only know about people who are not coming. ... It's really irritating when they talk, but they don't do." Jones then replied: "Exactly. It's a time for doing ... and watching your grandson on the television this morning saying there's no point going to space, we need to save the Earth." "Yes, I read about it," the Queen said, smiling broadly. Prince William on Thursday said there should be more focus on fixing this planet than on space tourism. He is promoting his new Earthshot Prize for climate innovators, to be awarded Sunday. The 95-year-old monarch will attend the UN climate change conference, also known as COP26 , next month in Glasgow - along with senior members of the Royal Family. The White House on Thursday confirmed that President Joe Biden plans to attend the "leaders'summit" during first two days of the conference. Former president Barack Obama also plans to go, his office said Friday. Obama was president when the United States signed on to the Paris agreement and committed to reducing emissions that contribute to climate change. In Glasgow, he will meet with young activists and deliver remarks on "the important progress made in the five years since the Paris Agreement took effect" and the need for "more robust action going forward by all of us," spokesperson Hannah Hankins said. Several world leaders, however, have still not confirmed their attendance, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Canada's environment minister, Jonathan Wilkinson, was in Milan in September for meetings with his global counterparts to set the final agenda for negotiations that will take place at COP, but it's not certain he will still be in the role in November. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is to announce his new cabinet on Oct. 26. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who previously said he was unsure if he would attend because of COVID-19, confirmed his attendance on Friday. The Queen's remarks offer unusual insight into her thinking. It's extraordinarily rare to hear anything from her. She has given exactly zero interviews during her long reign and is supposed to remain politically neutral. The British prime minister meets with the Queen on a weekly basis, but traditionally those conversations stay private. Things do slip out, usually not intentionally. Former prime minister David Cameron was mortified when he found out there was a microphone recording his conversation about the Queen's reaction to the Scottish independence referendum. Other countries'leaders aren't bound by the same conventions. When Biden met the Queen at Windsor Castle in June, he relayed to reporters that she had asked him about China's Xi and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the Queen's comments on the COP26 conference should not have been publicized. Speaking to Sky News, he said, "I think comments made in private should stay private, but we all share the desire to see progress made and we know there will be hundreds of leaders coming to Glasgow for COP." "I don't think her comments were for broadcast," he added. The Washington Post !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

VATICAN CITY - The Vatican said on Friday its delegation to the U.N. Climate Change Conference ( COP26 ) in Glasgow will be headed by its secretary of state, meaning Pope Francis will not be going. Scotland's bishops had announced in July that the pope would, health permitting, attend the opening of the conference that runs from Oct 31 until Nov. 12. The Vatican had never said that he would attend and a Vatican source said that Friday's announcement that the delegation would be headed by Cardinal Pietro Parolin meant the pope would not be going. Sources have said the Vatican was surprised by the Scottish bishops' announcement on July 12, when the pope was still in hospital recovering from intestinal surgery, though Francis told a Spanish radio network last month that he would like to go. The 84-year-old pope left hospital on July 14 and after a period of rest he resumed his full activities, including a grueling trip to Budapest and Slovakia, and has appeared to be in very good condition. This week he presided at a major event with other religious leaders to bring attention to the environment and the dangers of climate change. A Vatican source said there was a possibility that the pope would address the conference by video or that Parolin would read a message on his behalf.

"The world needs clear and firm policies focused on responsibly sourced critical minerals, renewable green energy, resilient and sustainable battery supply chains, R&D and STEM education for the workforce. Nano One is committed to creating jobs and a clean energy economy locally and with those nations collaborating and actively participating in COP26 ." Nano One's patented One-Pot process and metal-direct-to-cathode technology (M2CAM) facilitate the production of LFP, nickel-rich (NMC), and manganese-rich (LNMO) lithium-ion battery cathode materials directly from low-cost and low-GHG intensity battery metals. The One-Pot process can leverage battery metal feedstocks that are available domestically without requiring the addition of costly refining infrastructure, and this removes barriers to adoption while eliminating complexity and environmentally wasteful steps common to offshore supply chains. "If we are to build a fully integrated and resilient battery supply chain here in North America," said Nano One CEO, Mr. Dan Blondal, "it must include responsible mining of battery metals, onshore refining, environmentally favourable cathode material production, and recycling. If we are to avoid the export of raw materials and technology to overseas markets, only to buy them back in value added batteries, then we must leapfrog and make redundant the wasteful, constrained and costly methods of making battery cathode materials that are entrenched in overseas supply chains." LFP production is free from the constraints of nickel and cobalt, and although its origins are deeply rooted in Canada, its growth over the last decade is almost entirely based in China. Recent LFP cell-to-pack innovations have driven costs down and enabled greater EV range, setting the stage for EV pioneers to shift to LFP as supported by several recent announcements. There has never been a greater imperative for a sustainable, responsible, and secure supply of LFP materials and batteries, to be established and supported in North America and Europe, proximal to where the EV's are manufactured. Mr. Blondal commented, "Canada has clean energy assets, responsibly sourced critical minerals and a rich history in LFP technology and manufacturing. By leveraging these opportunities with Nano One's simplified low-cost approach to cathode production, we seek to create a resilient value-added domestic LFP supply chain in a collaborative ecosystem with a smaller environmental footprint. Our investments in the lab, pilot and alternative feedstocks have added further value to our One-Pot technology, and this enables us to move quickly now that the North American opportunity is coming into focus. We look forward to sharing further advancements with our shareholders." Nano One is also pleased to announce it has become a member of Accelerate, Canada's zero-emission vehicle supply chain alliance. Launched in 2021, Accelerate is working with its members across the supply chain to create an industrial road map to ensure the growth and stability of Canada's zero-emission vehicle market. "Accelerate members, like Nano One, are crucial to ensuring Canada transitions from its industrial past to its industrial future," said Matthew Fortier, Accelerate CEO. "This week's progress at COP26 is another step towards securing a Canadian supply chain that will help produce a cleaner, more prosperous, more inclusive, and more sustainable Canadian auto industry." ### About Nano One Nano One Materials Corp (Nano One) is a clean technology company with a patented, scalable and low carbon intensity industrial process for the low-cost production of high-performance lithium-ion battery cathode materials.

LONDON - Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend the COP26 climate summit in person, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been told, The Times newspaper reported. Britain, which hosts the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26 , in Glasgow on Oct. 31-Nov 12, is seeking to get big power support for a more radical plan to tackle climate change. "It is now pretty clear that Xi is not going to turn up and the PM has been told that," The Times quoted an unidentified British source as saying. "What we don't know is what stance the Chinese are going to take." The Times said British organizers fear that Xi's decision to stay away could be a prelude to China refusing to set new climate change goals amid an energy crunch. The Chinese embassy in London could not be reached for immediate comment. Xi, China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, has not left the People's Republic since the beginning of the novel coronavirus pandemic. He has joined video calls with global leaders. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter so Xi's absence from discussions - either in person or via video calls - would mark a setback for Johnson's hopes of getting world leaders to agree a significant climate deal. Xi, 68, who has served as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, attended the 2015 Paris climate conference. Britain's Queen Elizabeth has been overheard saying that she was irritated by world leaders who talk about climate change but then do very little or nothing to address the crisis. "Extraordinary isn't it. I've been hearing all about COP," the 95-year-old monarch told Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the wife of her son, Charles, Prince of Wales and the presiding officer of the Welsh assembly. "Still don't know who is coming..." "It's really irritating when they talk, but they don't do," Elizabeth said in a conversation picked up by a microphone.

Most Ontario producers will not have heard of FAIRR (Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return). FAIRR is a collaborative investor network based in London, UK with $45 trillion ($45,000,000,000,000) under management and so its analysis and perspective may carry weight into the future. Each year FAIRR releases an assessment of the largest meat and dairy producers. It focuses on environmental, social and governance issues including methane, deforestation, feed innovation, alternate protein innovation, manure, water use, antibiotics, animal welfare and working conditions. Taking into account data on many factors, they rate protein businesses using an index. The latest report was released December 1, shortly after COP26 , the international climate change meeting held in Glasgow. There was a commitment by many countries at COP26 to a 30 per cent reduction in methane emissions with livestock producers a being clear group responsible to make this happen. First the good news: Canada's own Maple Leaf Foods scored in the top three meat and dairy firms analyzed. The big picture, though, should be cause for worry. Consider these quotes from Jeremy Coller, Chair of FAIRR: "...failures from methane to manure management underline e the growing sense in the market that cows are the new coal." He also poses the challenge e before us: "We are at an inflexion point and if we are to avoid the meat and dairy sector becoming a stranded asset, we must harness the leadership emerging in parts of the industry and transform the way our food, particularly protein, is produced." This may seem far away, but Ontario livestock producers sell to the companies that are being assessed and you can be sure that what they need to report on will eventually make it onto your to-do list to record and improve upon. \</doc>

LONDON - A coalition of more than 1,500 environmental groups called on Tuesday for major international climate talks due to begin next month to be delayed, saying access to them would be unequal. The talks are aiming to spur more ambitious commitments by countries to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and keep the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius during this century, in line with a 2015 Paris accord. Typically delegates from more than 190 countries attend the annual talks, yet with many countries grappling with COVID-19 and poorer nations struggling to access vaccines, they should be postponed, the Climate Action Network (CAN) said. The COP26 "Our concern is that those countries most deeply affected by the climate crisis and those countries suffering from the lack of support by rich nations in providing vaccines will be left out of the talks," CAN Executive Director Tasneem Essop said. COP26 host Britain said in June it would offer vaccines to delegates who need them and has since said vaccinations under this program would start this week. However, CAN said in a statement that Britain has been slow in delivering vaccines and many countries are likely to miss out as a result. The issue is made worse, it said, by the need for unvaccinated delegates to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days if they arriving from what Britain has identified as so-called red list countries. Britain's COP26 "Ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change are heard is a priority... if we are to deliver for our planet, we need all countries and civil society to bring their ideas and ambition to Glasgow," Sharma said in a statement.

GLASGOW, Scotland, Nov. 4, 2021 /CNW/ - The call for action on reducing emissions from coal-fired electricity generation has never been more urgent, with science showing that it is vital for countries do more and on a faster timeline to address climate change and keep the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5\'b0Cwithin reach. Ending coal-fired electricity is one of the single most important steps the world must take in the fight against climate change. Canada and the United Kingdom, as co-leads of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), continue to drive the global momentum towards that end. Building on Canadian initiatives announced earlier this week to accelerate the phase-out of coal-fired electricity, the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, today participated in the Powering the World Past Coal event at COP26 to announce 28 new members, bringing the global Alliance to a total of 165 members, with 50 sign-ups in 2021 alone. He was joined by the Right Honourable Greg Hands, UK Minister of State for Energy, Clean Growth and Climate Change, and Co-Chair of the Powering Past Coal Alliance; AlokSharma, COP26 President; Dr.FatihBirol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency; SelwinCharlesHart, UN Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Action and Assistant Secretary-General for the Climate Action Team; and ministers and business leaders from around the world. Canada is proud to welcome new members from around the world, including Chile and Ukraine. Several organizations from the private sector are also joining the Alliance: TransAlta, a major Canadian-based power generator and environmental, social, and governance service provider; Export Development Canada, the first export credit agency to join the Alliance; Vancity Credit Union, an independent Vancouver-based credit union targeting net zero by 2040; and the United Church of Canada's investment arm. These new members including businesses, provinces, and cities have committed to powering their operations without coal, restricting financing to new coal-fired power stations, and supporting clean power. Together, these Canadian members will help move markets and financial flows to cleaner energy choices. The Powering Past Coal Alliance is now home to over 30 finance members from all parts of the world, representing US$17 trillion in assets under management. Canada has already implemented a plan to phase out coal-fired electricity generation by 2030 and announced earlier this week a commitment to achieve a net-zero emissions electricity sector by 2035. This will help Canada reach net-zero emissions by 2050, since a net-zero electricity sector will allow Canada to decarbonize other parts of its economy. Phasing out coal also reduces exposure to harmful air pollutants, protecting human health by improving the quality of the air we breathe. To ensure a cleaner and healthier future for countries around the world, Canada announced earlier this week its intention to ban thermal coal exports by 2030. Ending thermal coal exports is the right thing to do the impacts of climate change are already being seen, with the most severe impacts happening in the developing world. Moving away from exporting thermal coal also makes good economic sense, as the costs of renewables and low-carbon energy options continue to fall. Recognizing challenges faced by developing countries in phasing out coal, the Prime Minister also announced at COP26 that Canada will provide up to $1 billion to the Climate Investment Funds Accelerated Coal Transition initiative. This investment will lead to the successful implementation of country-level strategies and associated kick-start projects, build support at the local and regional levels, and accelerate the retirement of existing coal mines and coal power plants, while enabling new economic activities and contributing to a socially inclusive and gender equal transition. In addition, the Prime Minister announced $25 million in funding to the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, a partnership with the World Bank. This will help develop and implement clean energy alternatives, and support low- and middle-income countries in the transition to a cleaner economy. Canada is proud to co-lead the Powering Past Coal Alliance. Through the Alliance, Canada is bringing together all those who have a role to play: finance, industry, labour, civil society, and subnational and national governments. Today's announcement of 28 new members is a meaningful leap towards a fairer, safer, healthier world. Quotes "Phasing out unabated coal-fired power is one of the most important steps that we can take to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.Any credible climate plan requires governments and businesses to eliminate coal emissions, and to do it on timelines that meet our established net-zero goals. Coal phase out is inevitable. It is now mainstream, it makes economic sense, and the transition is undeniable." The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Co-Chair of the Powering Past Coal Alliance "The Alliance is a fantastic example of how bringing together nations, regions, and financial institutions can drive change so we can consign coal to history and deliver the historic Paris Agreement. The increase in global commitments to phase out coal is a huge victory to celebrate at COP26 in Glasgow. Welcoming new members today such as Chile and Singapore will bring us another step closer to securing a greener future that is powered by clean, renewable energy." The Right Honourable Greg Hands, United Kingdom's Minister of State for Energy, Clean Growth and Climate Change, and Co-Chair of the Powering Past Coal Alliance "EDC is committed to playing an ambitious role in the transition to a low-carbon and clean energy-fueled economy, and we know this will require a global commitment to phasing out unabated coal power generation. We are proud of our longstanding efforts to phase out support for coal and to be the first export credit agency in the world to join the PPCA. We stand ready to work with like-minded organizations to build additional momentum towards a more sustainable future." Mairead Lavery, President and CEO of Export Development Canada "TransAlta Corporation's decision to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance is a natural extension of our company's commitment to delivering clean energy solutions for our customers, strong returns for our investors, and reliable energy for the communities we serve. Our company will end our remaining coal generation in Canada in 2021 and the United States in 2025. Our growth plan will expand our renewable electricity fleet by two gigawatts over the next five years and deploy energy storage at a much larger scale. We look forward to continuing our contribution to global efforts to deliver an accelerated clean energy transition." John Kousinioris, CEO of TransAlta Corporation Christine Bergeron, President and CEO of Vancity Credit Union Quick facts Coal is responsible for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and is the largest single source of global temperature increase.

Canada, along with more than 100 other countries, has committed at the UN cli- mate conference in Glasgow ( COP26 ) to halt deforestation by 2030, as a way to preserve the forests that are key to absorbing carbon dioxide and slowing global warming. Forests are the lungs of the planet. They take up vast quantities of carbon dioxide and lock it away in trees and soil. These processes have helped make this planet habitable and, more recently, mitigate the impacts of our reliance on fossil fuels. As ecosystem scientists, we think this pledge to end deforestation holds great potential. It is not, however, a new idea. At a UN climate summit in 2014, many of the same countries agreed to halt deforestation by 2030. It was a lofty goal, and it has been unsuccessful to date. Forest loss has increased by more than 40 per cent since the agreement. The current COP26 commitment is less ambitious  countries aim only to end  net deforestation, meaning harvesting and land clearing can continue so long as reforestation (replanting of trees) keeps pace. This falsely assumes that new forests serve the same function as old forests. That said, a major advance of the COP26 commitment is the focus on improving sustainability in the trades that have historically led to deforestation. Still Canada has some work ahead if it is to make meaningful progress on this new pledge, and not find itself in an ongoing situation of continued forest  and carbon  loss. It must also find a way to protect its primary forests, those that have not yet been affected by logging, mining or other human activity, as these intact forests best provide critical ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Forests slow down climate change Forests take up carbon dioxide (photosynthesis) and release it (respiration). The balance between this uptake and release determines the strength of the forest\' s  carbon sink, or how much carbon is stored within it. While taking up carbon dioxide, forests lose water through their leaves (transpiration). Deforestation affects these processes and can produce strong feedbacks to the climate system. Deforestation impacts the global carbon cycle  the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and the Earth and back  by removing large quantities of carbon stored in the trees and increasing losses of stored carbon from the soil. If deforested areas do not recover, future uptake of carbon dioxide is also reduced. The loss of large tracts of intact forest can have important effects on water at the local and regional levels. Deforestation can reduce cloud formation and rainfall, increasing the risk or duration of drought in places that are already experiencing the effects of climate warming. Interpreting Canada\' s commitment Canada has some of the most carbon-rich forests in the world. Boreal forests hold on average more carbon than their tropical counterparts. Yet the scale of forestry and other extractive activities in Canada\' s boreal forests is vast. Remote sensing indicates that forestry activities impacted 650,000 hectares (1.6 million acres) of forests annually between 1985-2010. This means that changes in land management decisions and the associated reforestation of disturbed landscapes in Canada\' s boreal region can play an important role in the country\' s climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. But three central challenges must be considered in the planning, implementation and accounting for Canada to meet or ideally exceed the ambitions of its COP26 commitment to end net deforestation. 1. Forest loss in Canada is complicated Human-caused climate warming is profoundly altering the frequency and extent of natural disturbances, such as fire or insects, in Canada. Specifically, boreal forest loss due to wildfire, permafrost thaw, drought and pest outbreaks is increasing. These forest losses are occurring in addition to forest harvesting and land clearing, and will continue to intensify as climate warming progresses. According to a recent report by Nature Canada, an organization that advocates for habitat and species protection, these natural disturbances are largely ignored in Canada\' s forestry carbon accounting, potentially underestimating Canada\' s forest carbon emissions by an order of magnitude. Many of these disturbed forest lands may recover naturally, but this is not guaranteed. There is increasing evidence that the boreal forest is becoming less resilient in the face of climate warming and associated disturbances. We may not be able to rely on the full recovery of forests and their functions as we have in the past. We need to account for these human-caused, climate-associated changes in addition to forest harvesting and land clearing in an honest and transparent way. 2. Underground storage is a slow process In boreal forests, 80-90 per cent of carbon is stored below ground, in contrast to most other forest ecosystems, where carbon is stored in the trees. Carbon recovery in boreal forests is not fast, nor is it as straightforward as replanting trees where deforestation and/or land degradation has occurred. Instead it requires the rather slow recovery of the processes that support peat accumulation and the large below-ground carbon stocks that characterize boreal landscapes. These remediation tools are under active development, and there have been some successes. The targeted protection of regions with deep peat deposits is of great importance and urgency. Some of the most carbon rich places in Canada include the Mackenzie River Basin and the Hudson Bay Lowlands, regions that are also rich in natural resources. 3. Deforestation is linked to extractive industries Mining, forestry, hydroelectricity and oil and gas are central to Canada\' s economy. The COP26 commitment by the Trudeau government will not stop these activities, nor will it protect Canada\' s old-growth forests. This commitment only requires that net forest cover remain constant, and the replanting of harvested forests is already common practice in much of Canada. There is, however, ample evidence of the impact of these extractive activities on the benefits and services provided by forests in Canada. For example, roads and seismic lines associated with forestry and oil and gas increase carbon loss and fragment the landscape leading to declines in species such as boreal caribou. For this commitment to have a meaningful impact, Canada must continue with reforestation and prioritize protection of its intact, primary forests. We can hope the Trudeau government will use this commitment as a push to rapidly transition away from extractive practices toward more sustainable economic activities, and dovetail these efforts with the goals of conservation and reconciliation.

Katarina Kuhnert sees first-hand what the climate crisis is doing to the landscape. She has used mapping tools to create models of landscape change for northern communities where temperatures are rising and melting permafrost is changing the landscape. Kuhnert, who divides her time between Inuvik and Waterloo, recently completed an internship as a graphic information science technician at the Aurora Research Institute, a branch of Aurora College. So when she was selected as one of four people to travel to Glasgow for a week as part of a 32-member delegation from the Lutheran World Federation to the COP26 international conference, she already had a heightened sense of urgency. The conference earlier this month disappointed many when a last-minute intervention by India and other countries meant the nations pledged to "phasing down" coal subsidies instead of "phasing out." But Kuhnert participated in a panel discussion, entitled "Energy Transitions - Deciding our Futures" that offered hopeful alternatives. One panellist from India described a large-scale transition to solar energy within his community in India, for example. Old Crow, Yukon is a remote Indigenous community that traditionally relied on diesel, flown in, for fuel. But now there is a massive solar energy project underway that takes advantage of the 24-hour periods of daylight in the summer. The community pledges net zero carbon emissions by 2030. "They are showing us the way forward," said Kuhnert. "I can look to my neighbours in Old Crow, Yukon, and be a bit humbled." Kuhnert herself gave a presentation entitled: "Energy Transitions and Colonial Reparations in the Mackenzie River Watershed." She emphasizes the importance of consulting Indigenous peoples when energy transitions happen. "We have to reject a colonial attitude toward energy." For example, the Hydro-Qu\'e9bec project to create hydroelectricity in James Bay did not consult Cree communities before beginning the development in 1971, she said. But Cree leaders responded by negotiating Canada's first northern comprehensive land claim, the James Bay and Northern Quebec agreement, which governed further development of the hydro project after 1975. "I lived in northern Quebec for four months, and met some of these leaders, and their story is really powerful," she said. At the conference, Kuhnert was also struck by the important role that each participant played, and how each of them mattered; politicians, experts, negotiators and the public who demonstrated "to remind us of the urgency that people are facing in their daily lives. "People are still facing dire circumstances," she said. "Each one of these different roles plays a part in pushing us in the direction we want to go for our collective well-being. "My hope is still greater than my despair, but my sense of urgency is increasing." \</doc>

Oak Hammock Marsh, Manitoba, Nov. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Now that COP26 has come to a close, work must begin on implementing the plans agreed upon by world leaders in the newly minted Glasgow Climate Pact. Here in Canada, the country's leading conservation organization has a running start. Ducks Unlimited Canada's (DUC) well-established work in key, carbon-rich landscapes is delivering the kind of nature-based solutions needed to achieve the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Section four of the pact recognizes the need for mitigation and emphasizes the importance of "protecting, conserving and restoring nature and ecosystems ... including through forests and other terrestrial and marine ecosystems acting as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and by protecting biodiversity while ensuring social and environmental safeguards." DUC is well-poised to answer this call. Earlier this year, DUC was the largest recipient in the first round of funding from the Government of Canada's new Nature Smart Climate Solutions Fund. The organization will receive $39.2 million to conserve and restore wetlands and grasslands across Canada. "Climate mitigation and adaptation is now a core element of our habitat conservation programming," says Larry Kaumeyer, DUC's chief executive officer. "For more than 80 years, Ducks Unlimited Canada has been working with governments, landowners, Indigenous Peoples, and industry to develop comprehensive, science-based solutions to conservation challenges. Looking ahead, one of our greatest opportunities exists in the boreal region of the country where large areas of wetlands remain intact." Last week, Kevin Smith, DUC's national manager of boreal programs, spoke to COP26 delegates and the public as part of a national panel on Canada's peatlands. He shared research that showed how these carbon-rich wetland ecosystems, which are scattered throughout the boreal region, are a nature-based solution to climate change and deserve enhanced protection. "Given that Canada has one-quarter of the world's carbon stored in its peatIands, and if Canada is going to reach net zero by 2050, we need effective nature-based climate solutions that keep the legacy carbon in the ground and peatlands continuing to sequester carbon," Smith says. "Canada has an opportunity to show global leadership and real progress towards collective climate goals." DUC is already making significant progress: more than 135.6 million acres have already been positively influenced in the boreal region to date, with the goal of conserving at least 660 million acres in the next 10 years. Projects such as the creation of the 10,000 square-kilometre Indigenous Protected Area Ts'ud\'c3\£9 Nilin\'c3\£9 Tuyeta near Fort Good Hope, N.W.T. are an example of the boreal program's role in uniting Indigenous communities, government and other land users in supporting collaborative management and protection of these ecologically indispensable regions. However, according to Smith, protection is only part of the puzzle. Sustainable land management and knowledge sharing are also key pieces needed to reach Canada-and the world's-climate action goals. "Sustainable land management can happen in a number of ways," says Smith. "This includes influencing higher certification standards for industries operating in boreal peatlands and forests, establishing direct industry conservation partnerships, and influencing the adoption of codes of practice, policies and regulation that help to maintain peatland function." DUC steps up in these areas as well, offering services to land managers and owners, and equipping them with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions on land use. Practitioner guides such as the Guiding Principles for Wetland Stewardship and Forest Management, and Wetland Best Management Practices for Forest Management Planning &; Operations were created by DUC's boreal program as the result of collaborative knowledge-sharing, and cumulative research on these sensitive areas, which Smith hopes will help with understanding the importance and value of these areas. "Conducting and leveraging research is critical for the development of nature-based climate solutions, as is raising awareness of the importance and role of peatlands in mitigating climate change," says Smith. -30- Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) is the leader in wetland conservation.

A commentary by a retired business leader who has been a director of five global corporations. Last year saw an intensification of the great march to "net zero," aimed at replacing the 84 per cent of global energy currently supplied by fossil fuels. This unrealistic objective saw actions ranging from the impractical to the hypocritical to the simply bizarre. Here is my list of what I'll call the fossil fuel follies: The Bizarre: The City of Paris celebrated the unveiling of a "monumental" artwork that consisted of the massive Arc de Triomphe being covered in a silver and blue fabric. Turns out that fabric was plastic, a product the French government is aiming to ban, and made from petroleum, which France wants phased out to achieve "net zero." Energy Ignorance: New York City has decided to combat global warming by replacing natural gas with electricity to heat new buildings. But half of New York's electricity is generated by natural gas and other fossil fuels. Scandinavian Hypocrisy: Norway has mandated that all new cars sold by 2025 must be electric. Meanwhile, the country produces four million barrels of oil per day and is developing new fields so that it can produce even more. The Hydrogen Charade: A Globe and Mail article published last August called hydrogen "the most abundant element in the universe." That's true for the universe, where hydrogen fuels stars including our sun. But the reality here on Planet Earth is that the usable hydrogen does not exist in nature. Usable hydrogen is manufactured in refineries fuelled by natural gas and coal. Hydrogen industry advocates try to counter inconvenient truth by pointing to electrolysis of water with electricity generated from wind and solar - an impractical and extremely costly approach to creating something that's supposedly abundant. Greenwashing by the Caisse de D\'e9p\'f4t: Quebec's provincial pension fund says it will divest its oil production assets by the end of this year. No mention of divesting assets that require oil to function, including airports, highways and marine shipping terminals. Cryptocurrency's Overlooked Environmental Impact: 2021 saw the Bank of Canada increase its work on the feasibility of adopting a digital currency. But there's no mention of examining the environmental impact of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies use the uber-complex blockchain technology. Minting new units of Bitcoin, for instance, requires a highly energy-intensive process called "mining." The electrical power required to mine a single transaction generates an average carbon footprint equivalent to processing over two million Visa transactions. Germany's Journey from Selfsufficiency to Russian Energy Hostage: Last year saw Germany complete the 11-year process of shutting down its zero-emission nuclear power plants. That incomprehensible decision was based on a plan to replace the nuclear with wind and solar, which, predictably, proved both prohibitively expensive and unreliable. That left no alternative but to import natural gas from Russia. But those supplies have proven inadequate. The ostensible solution is more Russian gas through Nord Stream 2, a new pipeline across the Baltic Sea. Last March, the German government approved the project, but the escalating Ukraine crisis has led to pressure from its NATO allies to cancel that approval. Now, just as freezing temperatures drive German natural gas prices up 10-fold, Russia has reduced deliveries. On Jan. 20, International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol stated: "I would note that today's low Russian gas flows coincide with heightened political tensions over Ukraine." It's breathtaking to think that this geopolitical mess started with the belief that wind and solar could be the answer to the country's energy future. Canada Leads COP26 - in the Size of its Delegation: Canada sent 276 delegates to the UN Climate Summit in Glasgow, more than host U.K. and twice as many as the United States. Our prime minister's entourage included his own personal videographer, photographer, speechwriter and a 17-person media team made up of press secretaries and communications directors. The number of emissionsintensive private jets required to transport this mega-team was not disclosed. All this ludicrous vanity-driven hype for a country that accounts for less than two per cent of global emissions. COP26 Hypocrisy: The main objective of COP26 was to "phase out" coal-fired power. But in the face of opposition from China and India, the world's two largest coal consumers, the language was changed to "phase down." China and India currently produce 36 per cent of global emissions. Fact-checked data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker shows China has 202 coal-fired power plants either under construction or pre-construction, while India has 74. The expected life of those coal plants is more than 30 years, which would negate the combined emissions reduction efforts of all other COP26 parties. If Canada were to disappear from the map, India and China's emissions growth would replace our emissions in less than a year. The years go by, but global dysfunction is perennial. Happy New Year, everyone! \</doc>

GENEVA - The World Health Organization and about three-quarters of global health care workers on Monday called on governments to step up climate action at the COP26 global climate conference, saying it could save millions of lives a year. The UN health agency's report on climate change and health calls for transformational action in every sector including energy, transport and finance, saying the public health benefits of ambitious climate actions far outweigh the costs. "The burning of fossil fuels is killing us. Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity," the WHO said on Monday. The WHO has previously said some 13.7 million deaths a year, or around 24.3% of the global total, were due to environmental risks such as air pollution and chemical exposure. It is not clear exactly how many of those are directly linked to climate change, although the WHO's Maria Neira said about 80% of the deaths from air pollution could be prevented through compliance with its guidelines. HYPERLINK https://healthyclimateletter.net https://healthyclimateletter.net "The actions called for in this letter - which are necessary although not sufficient to fully address the climate and health crises - will go a long way toward protecting people worldwide," the letter said. Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council recognized access to a clean and healthy environment as a fundamental right, adding its weight to the fight against climate change.

"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: Climate Leader." That's the headline Trudeau would no doubt like to see coming out of the latest Conference of the Parties, the international climate change conference in Glasgow known as COP26 . After a bruising federal election that saw him fail to achieve his desired majority, the PM is pulling out all the stops to brighten his shine on the international stage. But in doing so, he seems to have forgotten about his domestic audience - and the impact his words will have on the economy and affordability of life back home. In a two-minute address to world leaders on Monday, Trudeau reiterated his campaign commitment to impose a hard cap on emissions from Canada's oil sands. "We'll cap oil and gas sector emissions today and ensure they decrease tomorrow at a pace and scale needed to reach net-zero by 2050," Trudeau solemnly intoned. "That's no small task for a major oil and gas producing country. It's a big step that's absolutely necessary." And a big step that he took, apparently, without talking to the leader of the province that produces most of the oil and gas and emissions( HYPERLINK https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/trudeau-in-glasgow-should-champion-albertas-climate-change-efforts-rather-than-imposing-emissions-goals-says-kenney ), Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. Perhaps Trudeau felt safe doing so, considering Kenney's political capital is at an all-time low, but as the premier pointed out, the PM missed an opportunity to highlight efforts by the province and industry, which are doing their part fighting climate change. Kenney and Alberta Environment Minister Jason Nixon just announced a $176-million investment( HYPERLINK https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/alberta-investing-176m-of-tier-funds-into-carbon-cutting-projects https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/alberta-investing-176m-of-tier-funds-into-carbon-cutting-projects )by the government in its Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) fund, for projects expected to create about 5,600 jobs and cut nearly seven million tonnes of emissions by 2030 - something Trudeau neglected to mention to his audience in Glasgow. Then on Tuesday, Trudeau cohosted a carbon-pricing event( HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/trudeau-takes-carbon-pricing-debate-to-the-global-stage-at-cop26 https://nationalpost.com/news/trudeau-takes-carbon-pricing-debate-to-the-global-stage-at- HYPERLINK https://nationalpost.com/news/trudeau-takes-carbon-pricing-debate-to-the-global-stage-at-cop26 cop26 ) at COP26 and called for taxes to be put on 60 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. He cited Canada's carbon tax, which started at $20 a tonne in 2019 and is set to rise to $170 a tonne by 2030. The current rate of $40 a tonne adds about 8.8 cents a litre to gasoline, the cost of which is supposed to be offset with tax rebate cheques that make the program revenue neutral for most (but not all) consumers. Trudeau opined, "What a strong carbon price does, when it's properly designed, is actually drive those price signals to the private sector, transform the economy and support citizens in encouraging them to make better choices." But does it? In a study of 12 high-income OECD countries,( HYPERLINK https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-carbon-taxes-have-been-a-massive-failure-fraser-report https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-carbon-taxes-have-been-a-massive-failure-fraser-report ) the Fraser Institute found that, on average, 74 per cent of carbon-tax revenues went directly into general revenues, 12 per cent were earmarked for environmental spending and only 14 per cent were returned to taxpayers as rebates. While the Canadian version returns 90 per cent of revenues to citizens, business understandably complain that the remainder does not compensate them for their increased energy costs, which will be inevitably passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. For carbon taxes to truly be revenue neutral and discourage carbon use without crippling the economy, other taxes need to be reduced at the same time. But that hasn't happened under Trudeau's watch. Politics inevitably comes into play and trumps good economics - especially when it's so easy to score cheap political points at the expense of political rivals. If Trudeau really aspires to be Captain Carbon, he needs to take the politics out of climate change and focus on better solutions. Over the coming decades, Canada is attempting to square a seemingly impossible circle: continue producing oil and gas, maintain economic growth, increase its population through immigration, and reduce its overall carbon emissions, all at the same time. It's not as impossible as it sounds, if the government eschews penalties like production caps in favour of policy incentives: rewarding innovation, offsetting carbon prices through tax cuts, and - most crucially - engaging provincial governments and industry in the conversation. Unless Trudeau takes these actions at home, his words overseas amount to nothing more than hot air. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

(Bloomberg) - U.S. and European officials pushing for tougher climate action are worried the energy crunch that's snarling the global economy could also undermine crucial United Nations talks next month. Government officials speaking on condition of anonymity said they were concerned that the squeeze in energy markets, surging prices, and the resurgence of coal will cast a shadow over efforts to curb emissions when 197 countries meet at the climate change summit, known as COP26 , in Glasgow, Scotland. The risk is that the price spike makes emerging economies - for example India - more reluctant to ditch coal because that would threaten energy security, three government officials said. Whereas countries like the U.K. have tried to use gas as a so-called "bridging fuel" as they shift to lower-carbon options, the surge in prices makes that option less palatable - at least for now. The crisis has also thrown into sharp relief the volatility that can accompany renewable energies. COP26 President Alok Sharma has set a target for the summit to "consign coal to history" in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. He and U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for climate John Kerry have been urging countries including China, India and South Africa to end their reliance on the dirtiest fossil fuel. Even Europe is now burning more coal - making it harder for politicians in the region to preach to others. While the conversation about the need for more gas is unlikely to enter the negotiating rooms where officials discuss the minutiae of legal texts, it may seep into bilateral meetings between ministers, the leaders' summit at the start, or press conferences. One official said that would be unhelpful to furthering the argument to get off fossil fuels. Coal Demand The energy supply crisis is showing how difficult ending the dependence on fossil fuels would be. China is driving demand for coal as it tries to secure the fuel to keep the lights on and factories running. Europe, which remains reliant on gas supplies from Russia, is seeing its companies seeking more coal for electricity generation ahead of winter with gas prices at record highs and supply hard to come by. One official said that diplomats are likely to arrive in Glasgow with gas at the forefront of their minds, which could undermine the climate argument for emerging nations to shift away from coal. In the past, the issue may have been more easily sidestepped. Officials fear top gas-producing countries, such as Russia and Qatar, could also be emboldened to push their own national interests at COP26 , threatening the switch away from fossil fuels. "The key question is whether the spike in global gas prices makes China wobble on shifting away from coal," said Guy Newey, who was a political adviser to the U.K. government during the Paris climate summit in 2015. "You need to challenge the narrative that a low-carbon future is a high energy cost future." Some argue that the energy crunch underscores the imperative for countries to switch to renewable energy or nuclear power, because it will both cut emissions and boost security of supply. But clean electricity can be intermittent. Battery storage still hasn't taken off to ensure reliable supply, and hydrogen is too expensive for commercial use. "We need to now recognize that decarbonization will only work when you've much more fully decarbonized," said Bim Afolami, a member of Parliament in the U.K. "This shows being in a transition phase - a half in half out approach - leaves you vulnerable in this way." \£92021 Bloomberg L.P.

The continuing cheap talk from the NATO/UN leaders and PM Justin Trudeau isn't doing what is required in Ukraine. As for the UN, well that "ground-feeding" operation is nothing but a bunch of "useful idiots". Article 1 states the purpose of the UN - prevent/solve international disputes. The Russian veto of the UN Security Council motion to "end the conflict" on Feb. 25 has sealed the uselessness of the UN. Seems all that useless organization can do is screw up the world economy through COP26 , what a joke. It's time for some serious strategic planning and thinking, and it must be done now. Yes, sanctions are a good start, but more needs to be applied now. Whatever that plan is, keep your mouth shut, and do it. The Polish suggestion concerning the 29 jets, a good move, but not now the West slapping their lips screwed that up. Oh, let's not overlook Joe Biden's comment, "U.S. pilots will not move the jets," nobody asked the U.S. to fly the jets. Seems moving the jets into Ukraine is the issue. My take, NATO is using Article 5 as an excuse, a cop-out. The UN, all they can say is 2,000,000 people have left. DOUGLASS CASSELL The UN has shown itself to be nothing but a waste of time and money.

GLASGOW - Negotiators took the two-week UN climate talks in Scotland into an extra day on Saturday, wrestling with a fresh draft of an agreement intended to give the world a realistic shot at avoiding the worst effects of global warming. Alok Sharma, the British conference president, said he expected COP26 between the almost 200 countries present, ranging from coal- and gas-fueled superpowers to oil producers and Pacific islands being swallowed by the rise in sea levels. Like earlier versions, the latest draft attempted to balance the demands of climate-vulnerable nations, big industrial powers, and those whose consumption or exports of fossil fuels are vital to their economic development. Britain tried to unblock one of the thorniest issues by proposing mechanisms to ensure that the poorest nations finally get more of the financial help they have been promised to prepare for and manage increasingly frequent extreme weather. China, the biggest current emitter of the greenhouse gases responsible for manmade global warming, and Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, were seeking to prevent the final deal including language that opposes subsidies for fossil fuels, two sources told Reuters on Friday. However, Saturday's draft( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3_1.pdf https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3_1.pdf ), published by the United Nations, continued to single out fossil fuels - something no UN climate conference conclusion has yet succeeded in doing. It also urged rich countries to double finance for climate adaptation by 2025 from 2019 levels, offering funding that has been a key demand of small island nations at the conference. 'KEEPING 1.5 ALIVE' Developing countries want to ensure that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, pay more to help them adapt to its consequences. Adaptation funds primarily go to the very poorest countries and currently take up only a small fraction of climate funding. Britain also said a UN committee should report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion in overall annual climate funding that rich nations had promised by 2020 but failed to deliver, and that governments should meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance. The meeting's overarching aim is to keep within reach the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say that to go beyond that limit would unleash extreme sea level rise and catastrophes including crippling droughts, monstrous storms and wildfires far worse than those the world is already suffering. But national emissions-cutting pledges made so far would cap the average global temperature rise at only 2.4 Celsius. While there is little chance of that gap being closed in Glasgow, Sharma said he hoped the final deal would pave the way for deeper cuts. Liberian Nellie Dokie, 37, who lives in Glasgow and has been making a daily two-hour trip to cook for conference delegates, ventured her first peep into the main conference area on Saturday before delegates began a noon stock-taking session. "I want to be a part of history," she said. "I played a small part." 'WAIT AND SEE' U.S. climate envoy John Kerry also struck a positive note when asked late Friday whether he agreed with climate campaigner Greta Thunberg that COP26 was a "festival for 'business as usual'." "Obviously I don't agree," he replied, "and I think you will see that when you see what happens." Kerry helped to revive flagging hopes for the conference when he and Chinese negotiator Xie Zhenhua on Thursday announced the countries would boost efforts to preserve forests, needed to soak up and hold in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and to cut output of the second-most important greenhouse gas, methane. The White House said on Friday that U.S. President Joe Biden, who has succeeded in pushing $555 billion in climate measures through Congress in a post-pandemic recovery program, will hold a virtual meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday night, U.S. time. The newest draft of what many hope will be the final Glasgow agreement retained a significant demand for nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than every five years, as they are currently required to do. The European Union and Italy were drawing up a proposal to use Special Drawing Rights provided by the International Monetary Fund to help make sure the target of $100 billion in climate finance is met next year, an EU official said. But $100 billion a year is far short of poorer countries' actual needs, which could hit $300 billion a year by 2030 in adaptation costs alone, according to the United Nations, in addition to economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters. \</doc>

Environmental activists were hoping for more, but COP26 may have laid down a blueprint for a green future. Mike Anderson, chair of the St. Catharines Environmental Alliance, said a lack of concrete action coming out of the United Nations'Climate Change Conference that wrapped up last week was disappointing to see. However, Anderson said, there are some positives that came out of the meetings and there appears to be public momentum behind limiting the future effects of climate change. "Overall, the summit didn't succeed in helping us avert probably the worst effects of climate change,"he said. "There was too much 'we need to consider this'or 'we need to look into this further£nd not enough of 'we will do this.'"Anderson said the conference also failed to promise sufficient support to developing countries, which are more likely to feel the effects of climate change despite being among the lowest contributors. But on the positive side, Anderson said, agreements to curb methane emissions, phase out coal and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies are all steps in the right direction. "Probably the biggest one of those was the fact that there's been a clear signal that the era of coal is ending,"he said. Canada's environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, admitted that more needs to be done but said Canada has demonstrated "a way that ambitious action can be taken - by a major oil-producing nation that is home to some of the world's largest intact ecosystems." "But we know we need to do more and that the world needs to do more,"he added in his statement following the end of the conference. The overarching goal of the conference was to keep alive the target of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which is what scientists say must be done to stop the worst effects of climate change from happening. "Still, we're moving forward toward a spot where our planet will be two to two and a half degrees warmer by 2100,"Anderson said. In his statement, Guilbeault said that while they won't be able to win every battle in the fight against climate change, he has "never seen more momentum or desire to beat climate change." "Canada is at the forefront and countries are working to keep 1.5C within reach." Anderson remained hopeful that what was accomplished at COP26 can be furthered into more concrete action next year. "Hopefully they have they started to put together a framework or a blueprint that's going to take us forward,"said Anderson, who also criticized the conference as a whole for its carbon footprint in bringing thousands of bureaucrats together for the in-person meetings. ledwards@niagarathis week.com \</doc>

MONTREAL, Nov. 17, 2021 /CNW Telbec/ - With COP26 just coming to a close in Glasgow, only 25% of Canadians (and 36% of Quebecers) are of the opinion that this conference helped find solutions to climate change. Health care and the economy clearly remain the top priorities for the Canadian population, and 65% of Canadians are not prepared to pay a single cent more to fight climate change, according to a recent Ipsos poll carried out on behalf of the Montreal Economic Institute. Highlights: 43% of Quebecers want their province to develop its own oil resources, whereas 31% prefer to continue importing all the oil consumed in the province. This is particularly relevant this year given the Quebec government's intention to formally ban all oil and gas development in the province.As for oil imports, the provider of choice remains Western Canada. No less than 71% of Quebecers want their oil to come from the Western provinces rather than from foreign countries. 68% of Quebecers think that carbon capture technologies should occupy a bigger place in Quebec's climate change strategy. This proportion is even higher (80%) among those who said climate change was among their top three priority issues. "Clearly, Canadians do not believe that big conferences and good intentions will put an end to climate change. This makes perfect sense when you consider that the world's largest emitter, China, is consuming more coal than ever," says Miguel Ouellette, Director of Operations and Economist at the MEI. "The Quebec population, for its part, is very divided on the question of developing the province's oil resources, an activity that the government wants to ban permanently. Yet a non-negligible proportion of Quebecers prefer that we develop our resources rather than import all of the oil we consume," adds Mr. Ouellette. "It is interesting to see that 71% of Quebecers still see Western Canada as their favoured oil provider. This contrasts with what you hear from certain Quebec politicians and activists," points out Krystle Wittevrongel, Public Policy Analyst at the MEI. "If there is a new wrinkle, it's the emergence of carbon capture as a concrete solution to slow climate change. What is most striking is that it is those who are most concerned about climate change who are the most enthusiastic about these technologies," concludes Mr. Ouellette. The Ipsos online poll commissioned by MEI was carried out from October 29 to November 2, 2021, among a representative sample of 1,150 Canadians aged 18 and over. The poll is available on our website. The Montreal Economic Institute is an independent public policy think tank.

You may have noticed all the self-important politicians and assorted minions converging on Glasgow for COP26 , the United Nations'climate change conference. And maybe you wondered what empty promises they'd make next. Because at this point we do have quite the track record saying one thing and then ... waiting to say it again the next year. I know, we're supposed to remain hopeful. And for sure there are reasons not to despair, at least here in Ottawa, where our greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 15 per cent between 2012 and 2020. Who knows, maybe the idea proposed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this past week to put a global price on carbon is the right one. You'll forgive me for doubting. I have been disappointed before. After the speeches always come the negotiations behind closed doors so that serious officials can hammer out a way to make politicians'oft-vapid pronouncements come true. Or true-ish. And every year we say to ourselves, this is it, you know. Our last best chance to turn this climate thing around. Until the next year rolls in and we do it all over again. The 26 in COP26 Gone are the days of "youth wings" within established mainstream political parties. Youth today lead their own movements and groups, thanks very much. Like Sustainable Youth Canada's Ottawa chapter or the Youth Climate Lab, headquartered here on unceded, unsurrendered Algonquin Anishinabeg Territory. These are young people doing some of the work adults could do if only we cared as much as we say we do. There are also all those individuals and groups you hear about less often, of young people using art to create the change they want to see in the world. I've mentioned once before in this space the play "12" by a group of teenagers under the direction of my friend, the inspiring Kristina Watt. I have been following and supporting their work since 2019, and now two of my kids are part of their efforts, as youth photographer and sketch artist. There is no fame or money in that work. Just the satisfaction of knowing we're doing the best we can with the talents we have. "12" has gone through thick, thin and COVID waves since its inception in 2018 when Watt realized, through conversations with the young actors, that a major part of their souls, existence and stress "came from the looming fear about the planet and their future." That, by the way, was around the time of COP24. At COP24, there were big pronouncements about the certainty that we humans had only 12 years to prevent irreversible damage to the planet. That's how "12" got its name. The pandemic has wreaked havoc on performing arts but I'm delighted to say the actors have been in rehearsal since September and will be performing at the Ottawa Children's Festival later this month. The 2021, COP26 version of the play will be a little different than the older one. But the idea is the same as it ever was: it's about young people unleashing their power, their truth and essential voice. "I have the privilege and joy to allow the passions, fears and truth of young people to be seen, heard and hopefully respected," Watt says. "I admit I feel helpless at times, but with this work, I know that I'm doing something - and in particular, something for youth. I fiercely believe that they deserve it." Me, too.

As world leaders descend on Glasgow this week for the start of the 2021 UN Climate Conference, Alberta - the Canadian jurisdiction with perhaps the most on the line - will be watching. COP26 , as it is known, will be the most significant global climate change summit since Paris in 2015. That target led directly to a number of actions taken by the Trudeau government, including the introduction of a federal price on carbon and a clean fuel standard that is on the way. The federal government has since raised the bar for its own emissions reductions ambitions, saying it now aims for a 40 to 45 per cent reduction by 2035. To help meet that target, the government has announced five-year emissions reductions targets for the oil and gas industry as well as regulations around methane. These types of policy implications are the reason why many in Alberta - home to Canada's oil and gas industry - will be closely watching to see what comes of the Glasgow summit. "It's important. It does have influence on policy and the development of the resources," said Tristan Goodman, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, a lobby group that represents oil and gas companies. Goodman said while in the past, the oil and gas industry might have looked to the UN climate summits with a sense of trepidation, that's no longer the case. Since Paris, Goodman said, the industry has undergone a sea change in its understanding of the climate change issue, with many companies making netzero commitments of their own and investing in everything from hydrogen to carbon capture and storage to wind power. "Most of the energy companies in Canada, they know they're going through an energy transition. And they've moved well past acceptance of that, into looking at the opportunities," Goodman said. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers will send its own delegation to the Glasgow summit, including CAPP president Tim McMillan. However, neither Alberta Premier Jason Kenney nor any of his cabinet ministers will attend the climate summit. In an email, Environment Minister Jason Nixon said the UCP government is avoiding non-essential travel right now, adding: "One more politician flying into Glasgow is not going to make any meaningful difference." Nixon said Alberta takes climate change seriously, pointing to the province's own methane reduction targets as well as its ahead-of-schedule phase-out of coal-fired electricity. But he said Alberta, and the province's energy industry, are frustrated with Canada's "everchanging emissions targets" and needs clarity and predictability when it comes to climate policy. Gary Mar, president and chief executive of the Calgary-based non-partisan think tank The Canada West Foundation, said many Albertans are concerned that COP26 will mean an evermore aggressive push toward the total phase-out of fossil fuels. He said the energy industry is making real strides on emissions reductions, but it's foolish for anyone to suggest it can flip on a dime overnight or be replaced tomorrow by renewables. "You can't actually make a transition just by taking things away. You actually have to know what it's going to be replaced by," Mar said. Critics, however, say Alberta is not doing all it can on the climate front. The province doesn't even have an overall emissions goal in place, said Simon Dyer, deputy executive director of the Pembina Institute, a cleanenergy think tank. "Alberta is responsible for the largest proportion of Canada's total emissions, the oil and gas sector is the largest single economic subsector, so Canada cannot achieve the emissions reductions it needs to achieve without the jurisdiction that's responsible for the largest portion of those emissions," Dyer said. Dan Balaban, chief executive of Alberta-based renewable energy company Greengate Power, said Canada needs to use the Glasgow summit as a prompt to move past talk and into action. He said it's important to get government funds flowing to the renewable energy sector "And if we're going to achieve our net-zero ambitions, we need to make very clear who we intend to support." \</doc>

(Bloomberg) - The United Arab Emirates is unlikely to set a net-zero emissions target before the COP26 talks starting in October, dealing a potential blow to the climate event. While the country is considering such a goal, its extreme heat and dry conditions make reducing greenhouse gas emissions difficult because plenty of energy is needed for cooling and desalination, according to a senior Ministry of Climate Change and Environment official. "Don't expect us to announce anything by the COP26 , but we are considering a net-zero target like any other part of the world," Qais Al Suwaidi, head of the ministry's climate change department, said in an interview. No major OPEC producer has announced a net-zero target, and the UAE was among the most likely to do so before the COP26 in Glasgow. The U.K. and U.S. want governments to commit to deep emissions cuts. Zeroing them out in the next three decades is viewed as crucial to prevent temperatures rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. Other countries have rushed to announce climate targets without showing how they can be achieved or enshrining them in law, said Al Suwaidi. "There is a lot of talk: 'We can achieve net zero, we're going to do this, we're going to do that'," he said. "But then in practice we see contrary action. We like to do things differently." More time is needed for the UAE to carry out studies that will determine how quickly it can reach net zero, he said. Adopting stronger commitments wouldn't necessarily require the UAE to sell less oil, the bedrock of its economy. But setting a net-zero target for emissions produced within its borders would make the UAE an outlier among fellow producers and possibly lead others in the Persian Gulf to follow suit. The UAE's current targets are still ambitious, Al Suwaidi said. In December, it pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost 25% over 10 years, from a baseline that assumes moderate economic growth. The country, which is competing against South Korea to host the UN's COP28 event in 2023, is on course to surpass the target, said Al Suwaidi. \£92021 Bloomberg L.P.

The mission of the delegation is to create a plan for the cities of Aracuai and Itinga to achieve: //st (i) environmentally sustainable development and The plan will be presented to and is expected to be funded by global foundations and venture capital, introduced by Sigma. EPCM AND CONSTRUCTION The Company is negotiating an EPCM agreement for the engineering, procurement, construction of the Production Plant and associated infrastructure with Promon Engenharia Ltda. ("Promon") and Primero Group Ltd ("Primero"). Following successful conclusion of FEED, both remain engaged by Sigma and have been focusing on negotiating and securing the long lead items for the construction of the Production Plant. The Company is also in negotiations with the two finalist mining contractors of the selection process, which will build and operate the Company's first mine at the Project. The detailed design of the Production Plant is based on clean technologies including state of the art environmental circuits for water recirculation, dry stacking of tailings as well as six dense media separators ("DMS"), which do not utilize harmful chemicals in the production of high purity lithium materials. The DMS will be automated and digitally controlled electronically by an algorithm, developed to contemplate the specificities of the mineralogy in each of the company's mines. FILING OF PRELIMINARY BASE SHELF PROSPECTUS IN U.S AND CANADA The Company has filed a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus (the "Canadian Base Shelf") to qualify the distribution, from time to time over a 25-month period of up to US$250 million of the Company's debt and equity securities. The Canadian Base Shelf was filed in each province and territory of Canada, other than the Province of Quebec. The Company also filed a corresponding shelf registration statement on Form F-10 (the "U.S. Base Shelf") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System. The Canadian Base Shelf remains subject to completion or amendment. The U.S. Base Shelf has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. A copy of the U.S. Base Shelf may be obtained on EDGAR at HYPERLINK http://www.sec.gov www.sec.gov and a copy of the Canadian Base Shelf may be obtained on SEDAR at HYPERLINK http://www.sedar.com www.sedar.com . Securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted until a receipt for the final Canadian Base Shelf has been issued by the Canadian securities regulators and the U.S. Base Shelf has become effective. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Further, there shall be no sale of these securities in any province, state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such province, state or jurisdiction. ABOUT SIGMA LITHIUM: The Company is developing, with an environmental sustainability focused and ESG-centric strategy, the largest hard rock lithium deposits in the Americas, located in its wholly owned Grota do Cirilo Project in Brazil with the goal of participating in the rapidly expanding global supply chain of electric vehicles. The Company plans to produce 220,000/t annually of environmentally sustainable battery grade lithium concentrate (33,000 t of lithium carbonate equivalent in Phase 1 production), note based on the 2021 updated Feasibility Study Report. In Phase 2 production, if warranted after ongoing feasibility study, production would be increased to 440,000 t (66,000 tonnes of LCE) annually. The first and second phase of production for the Project will utilize as feedstock spodumene from the Project's own mines. Since 2018, the Company has been producing low carbon high purity lithium concentrate at an on-site demonstration pilot plant with the objective to ship samples to potential customers for product certification and testing. This pilot production has been an important part of the successful commercial strategy of the Company allowing it to ship samples of its low carbon "green &sustainable" high purity lithium to leading global potential customers, for product certification and testing. The Company is in pre-construction and detailed engineering of an environmentally friendly, fully automated, dense media separator production plant that applies proprietary algorithms to digitally control the dense media (the "Production Plant"). The Production Plant will be vertically integrated into the Company s mining operations, exclusively utilizing as feedstock the high purity spodumene ore with exceptional mineralogy from the Project. The Production Plant will process the spodumene ore into a high purity 6% battery-grade lithium concentrate engineered to the specifications of its customers in the lithium-ion battery supply chain for EVs. In order to secure a leading position supplying the clean mobility and green energy storage value chains, the Company has adhered consistently to the highest standards of environmental, social and governance practices, which were established as part of its core purpose at inception in 2012. Its production process will be powered by clean energy and the Company will use state-of-the art water recirculation circuits in its processing combined with dry stacking tailings management. The DMS process of the Production Plant does not utilize hazardous chemicals, as a result its tailings are 100% recyclable into ancillary industries, such as ceramics. The Company plans to achieve net zero carbon emission targets by 2023, partly as a result of its strategic decision to pursue generation of carbon credits through "in-setting" carbon credits (preserving and developing the agroforestry systems within its regional ecosystem). The Company is currently undergoing an independent assessment of its net carbon footprint, conducting an independent ISO 14000 compliant audit of its life cycle analysis together with an independent expert validation of its carbon credits generated by its internal preservation, reforestation, and compensation forestry programs. The Company expects to complete this workstream in the second half of 2021. Sigma has significant potential for additional future expansion and growth, as it owns 27 mineral rights spread over 191 km2 (which include mining concessions, applications for mining concessions, exploration authorizations and applications for mineral exploration authorizations). The Grota do Cirilo Project area includes nine past producing lithium mines.

"Build back better. Blah, blah, blah. Green economy. Blah, blah, blah. Net zero by 2050. Blah, blah, blah. Climate neutral. Blah, blah, blah." It has been a month since eco-warrior Greta Thunberg once again stormed the climate action stage and once again demonstrated the excoriating power of her straight talk. The platform was the Youth4Climate conference in Milan, but the target was unquestionably the looming global climate conference, COP26 , which starts on Oct. 31 in Glasgow. "This is all we hear from our so-called leaders: words," Thunberg went on to say. "We've had 30 years of their blah, blah, blah." That's the shrewdly placed soundbite against which the two-week summit will be measured: more words that drift far into the future? Or clear, measurable, near-term actions? Long-term promises have been the hallmark of the annual gathering, postponed last year due to the pandemic. Time for such smoke-blowing is up. As John Kerry, the U.S. special envoy on climate change, said this week, Glasgow is the "last best hope" to act now to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. "We have to get on the road here and we've been talking about it for 30 years," he told BBC News. Tragically, it's never been easier to itemize real world examples of a world on the brink. As sandstorms silt up croplands in Madagascar, the United Nations warns that the country is teetering on the edge of the world's first climate change famine, its starving population having done nothing to contribute to the climate catastrophe. The heatwave-trapping heat dome that clamped down on Canada's west coast and down the Pacific Northwest in July shot temperatures above 40 degrees C. and took hundreds of lives. Our oceans are hotter than ever in history. Scientists at the University of British Columbia have been documenting the monumental die-off of seashore animals along the Salish Sea coastline. Global warming will cause sea levels to rise by as much as a metre by century's end if greenhouse gas emissions aren't slashed, and fast, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A boldface headline in a recent report from the panel is useful: "Human influence has warmed the climate at a rate that is unprecedented in 2,000 years." The European Commission projects close to 100,000 yearly fatalities in Europe from extreme heat if global warming rises by three degrees Celsius by the end of the century. What is currently deemed a 50-year heatwave occurrence in Spain could occur annually, and lethally, in that scenario. And so on and so on. One hardly knows where to stop. When the United Nations launched its first Conference of the Parties, or COP, all those years ago, the scientific evidence was far less clear. In 2015, 191 countries, plus the European Union, came together at COP21 to sign a legally binding international treaty committing to more ambitious climate action to reduce emissions and adapt to climate impacts. The Paris Agreement was hailed for setting long-term goals directed at limiting the global temperature rise to well below two degrees while pursuing "efforts" to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees. Commitments - such a soft word - were to be reviewed every five years. Yet greenhouse gas emissions are rising and the world remains on course toward three degrees of global warming. Just this week the United Nations revealed that governments, despite their lofty "ambitions," still plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with the 1.5-degree target. No wonder Greta Thunberg is fed up with the rhetoric. On Wednesday she tweeted a link to that UN report. "It can no longer be possible for politicians to get away with ignoring the gap between their words and actions," she wrote. That's inarguable. The challenge for COP26 will lie in making a convincing case that fast action will at long last be taken. Saturday: COP26 Load-Date: \~October 21, 2021 \</doc>

The federal environment commissioner recently found that Canada's record on combatting climate change was the worst among G7 countries since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. This was attributed in part to the government's "policy incoherence," as seen with investments such as the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. These investments fit within a long-standing pattern of hefty federal support to oil and gas companies, mostly through federal agency Export Development Canada (EDC). At last count, this support, which Ottawa does not consider a subsidy, totalled an average of $13.6 billion each year from 2018 to 2020. This made Canada the largest provider of public finance for fossil fuels in the G20. The government recently acknowledged the problem, and has committed to "developing a plan" to phase out public finance for the fossil fuel sector. At the UN climate conference ( COP26 ) in November, Canada joined more than 30 countries in pledging to eliminate a portion of this finance - "direct" support for "unabated" fossil fuel energy overseas - by the end of this year. Uncertainties remain, however, as to how Ottawa will end up defining key terms, such as "abated," which is often used to describe projects with carbon capture. What's certain is that the pledge will cover a mere fraction of Canada's fossil fuel finance: roughly $1 billion, according to a preliminary government estimate. The commitment leaves intact the massive sums the government provides the industry , which in recent years has included billions in loans to projects such as the Trans Mountain and Coastal GasLink pipelines. The natural resources minister stated in November that a timeline for eliminating Canada's domestic fossil fuel finance would be announced "in the next few months." This timeline must at a minimum reflect the same urgency as the COP26 pledge. The International Energy Agency has warned there can be no new oil and gas fields developed if the world is to hold global warming to the critical 1.5 C threshold. Despite this, EDC has no plan to end its support for fossil fuels. It has committed to a moderate reduction of its support for oil and gas exploration and production, yet remains free to maintain or even increase its support for pipelines or refineries. The impact of Ottawa's commitments, regarding both the overseas and domestic components of its fossil fuel finance, will thus depend on the speed and robustness of implementation, and in particular on the presence of gaps in the government's plan that could allow EDC to continue propping up fossil fuel companies. Acknowledging a "climate emergency," as Parliament has done, means there can be no allowances for supporting new refineries or pipelines, whether for oil or gas. And it means that there can be no loopholes for supporting oil and gas companies that simply promise to capture their on-site emissions. Carbon capture does nothing to address these downstream emissions that constitute 80 per cent of oil and gas emissions. Far from being a climate solution, they warn, the technology "prolongs our dependence on (fossil fuels) at a time when preventing catastrophic climate change requires winding down fossil fuel use." It's time to end Canada's half-measures on climate. Ottawa must initiate a swift and complete phase-out of all public financial support for fossil fuel development of any kind, in Canada or abroad.

- Global coalition of more than 90 wind energy companies and associations releases COP26 Manifesto calling on governments to take eight concrete steps to get to net zero. - Annual wind installations need to scale up by four timescurrent levels to reach net zero by 2050; current projections will provide less than half what is needed. - Signatories include largest companies in the sector including Vestas, Siemens-Gamesa, Goldwind, Mingyang, Nordex-Acciona, Iberdrola, ENEL, SSE, Orsted, EDP Renovables, Equinor, Mainstream Renewable Power, Green Investment Group and DNV, as well as industry associations from Europe, Asia, North America, Latin America and Africa, including China, USA, India and the UK. - The world needs decisive action to combat the climate emergency. The wind industry has the tools available to achieve ambitious targets like a fourfold increase in the amount of wind energy deployed globally - this manifesto asks governments to help the wind industry get there. LONDON, Oct. 18, 2021 /CNW/ -- The wind energy sector has released a manifesto at the BNEF London summit calling on governments to "get serious" about the energy transition and work with the private sector to rapidly scale up wind and renewable energy installations. Wind energy is one of the fastest growing energy sources in the world, with a record 93GW of installations in 2020. However, current growth rates are falling behind a net zero trajectory and will only put us on-track for 43% of the wind capacity required by 2050, according to leading international energy institutions IRENA and the IEA. To get on-track, annual wind energy installations worldwide must quadruple within the next decade. More than 90 of the world's leading wind energy companies, led by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), including manufacturers, supply chain actors, investors and industry bodies from around the world have united to support this Manifesto. The eight actions being called for include: Increase wind power ambition and reflect this in updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), comprehensive national climate strategies and long-term energy plans. Commit to rapid phase out of coal-based generation now. Design and implement energy markets for the future. Implement streamlined and sensible permitting schemes for renewable energy projects to accelerate deployment and minimise project attrition. Initiate plans to rapidly build out clean energy grids and charging stations for electric vehicles. Develop cohesive and inclusive policies which dedicate public resource to the people-centred shift to a net zero economy. Align national and regional finance flows with benchmarks for a net zero, 1.5\'b0C-compliant pathway. Advance voluntary cooperation on carbon pricing under articles 6.2 and 6.4 of the Paris agreement. The renewables industry is already delivering decarbonisation of the global power sector. Wind power helps the world avoid 1.1 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions annually and already provides more than 1.2 millions jobs around the world, while transforming economies and communities for good. But the industry requires supportive policy frameworks to grow more rapidly. The Manifesto urges governments to work with industry to enact a shift in energy and economic policymaking to a "climate emergency" approach. "This Manifesto sets out the meaningful actions that governments need to carry out to realise the energy transition. Governments need to aim higher and deeper updating their NDCs to drive real change, cutting red tape and streamline permitting proceedures, and supporting vital investments in infrastructure. The recent volatility in global energy markets shows the importance of moving decisively to phase out of coal and other fossil fuel based generation and create energy markets which are fit for purpose for a clean and sustainable future." Rebecca Williams, Director of COP26 at GWEC, commented: "We already have the tools and the technology we need to tackle climate change. What we don't have yet is the unprecedented political will we need to make this happen. "Our Manifesto sets out eight clear actions policymakers and governments must take to seize the vast economic, environmental and social opportunities that wind energy provides, helping meet NDCs and achieve sustainable growth. World leaders gathering in Glasgow next month have a chance to get serious about driving the new era of renewable energy, not stifling it." About GWEC GWEC is a member-based organization that represents the entire wind energy sector. The members of GWEC represent over 1,500 companies, organizations and institutions in more than 80 countries, including manufacturers, developers, component suppliers, research institutes, national wind and renewables associations, electricity providers, finance and insurance companies. More: HYPERLINK https://gwec.net/ https://gwec.net/ . GWEC has established the Global Wind Energy Coalition for COP26 . It is a multi-stakeholder group of leading wind power company and associations from across the globe committed to ramping up wind power capacity to limit the dangerous impacts of climate change.

MILAN - European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans said he would visit Russia in the next few weeks to discuss climate action ahead of the U.N. COP26 summit in Glasgow. Russia, one of the world's bigger oil and gas producers, is coming under increased pressure to set a "net zero" emissions target before the conference which runs from Oct. 31 to Nov. 12. "When you talk to them they always have conditionalities and questions but they want to be part of the success of this," Timmermans told Reuters on the sidelines of a Pre-COP 26 climate meeting in Italy. "They have a lot to lose ... decarbonising their economy is challenging, but certainly not impossible." Russia has said it will cut its 2030 emissions to 70% of 1990 levels, a target it is expected to achieve because of de-industrialisation since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. Timmermans gave no more details on who he was due to meet during his trip to Moscow, but said he was more positive now than a few weeks ago on achieving success at the climate talks in Scotland since high emission countries such as Russia, China and Saudi Arabia were sending encouraging signals. "I think there is a general willingness even with those more reluctant on the issue to contribute to the success of Glasgow," he said. Climate and energy ministers gathered this week in Italy's financial capital Milan to lay the groundwork for COP26 . Asked about calls from some EU members for a more collective approach on issues such as gas procurement, Timmermans said the European Council would be looking at the energy markets and how they function at its meeting starting Oct. 21. Last week Brussels said it would produce a "toolbox" of measures EU countries can take to tackle energy price spikes without breaching the bloc's energy market rules. Spain and Italy, which have both introduced measures to curb rising power prices on consumer markets, have asked for the EU to play a greater role in areas such as buying gas. Timmermans said Europe's energy markets on the whole functioned well, adding policy could not be made only for extraordinary situations. "There's no positive effect as far as I can see in collective gas procurement but by all means let's look into it," he said.

GLASGOW, United Kingdom - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the memory of Lytton, B.C., on Monday as he called for more global action in the fight against climate change and said Canada is starting to move on his election promise to cap emissions from the oil and gas sector. Trudeau gave a short speech Monday at the 26th meeting of the Council of Parties to the UN climate convention, known as COP26 in Glasgow. The 14-day talks are starting with a leaders' summit bringing together presidents and prime ministers from more than 120 countries to finalize how they'll actually meet the goals of the Paris accord. "In Canada, there was a town called Lytton," Trudeau said. "I say 'was' because on June 30, it burned to the ground." The Lytton fire occurred in a punishing heat wave that saw the town reach 49.6 C, the hottest temperature Canada has ever recorded. He said it's the kind of thing that could happen anywhere and another sign that it's time for the world to step up. "The science is clear: we must do more, faster," he said. "So that\' s the pledge and the call I bring to this historic meeting." COP26 is grappling with setting the rules for implementing the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement  the main one being to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to hold global warming to as close to 1.5 C as possible by the end of the century. That includes final agreements on what countries have to report about their plans, and their successes or failures at reducing greenhouse gases. Emissions like carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide, produced mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal, get lodged inside the atmosphere, where they trap heat and warm the planet. Some of the stickiest talks have to do with the responsibility of the biggest polluters and economies to both reduce their own pollution, and also help smaller and less developed countries adapt to and mitigate against a problem they are far less responsible for causing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at her last COP before she retires, told the conference the world is not where it needs to be yet to implement Paris, and there is a special role for developed countries because of their bigger responsibility for climate change to date. Germany, she noted, recently increased its emissions targets to 65 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2045. Those targets are more ambitious than Canada's new goal to get to 40-45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The targets of the European Union, United Kingdom and United States are also more aggressive than Canada\' s. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault, a longtime Canadian environmentalist, said Canada's new targets, just submitted to the United Nations in July, aren't going to be changed this week. The focus now is on implementing policies to actually meet them. Trudeau said Monday the government is now moving on its election promise to cap emissions from the oil and gas sector. The pledge made in September would see emissions limited to around current levels and ratcheted down every five years until they are carbon neutral by 2050.  We\' ll cap oil and gas sector emissions today and ensure they decrease tomorrow at a pace and scale needed to reach net zero by 2050, Trudeau said.  That\' s no small task for a major oil and gas producing country. It\' s a big step that\' s absolutely necessary. Guilbeault and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson on Monday formally asked the government's net-zero advisory board to help them accomplish this goal. "We seek your advice on key guiding principles to inform the development of quantitative five-year targets," the ministers wrote in a letter. "Your advice will also help inform the emissions reduction plan for Canada\' s 2030 target that we are committed to tabling in Parliament in the coming months." Catherine Abreu, executive director of Destination Zero and a member of the net-zero advisory body, said Canada's issue is that the promised cap does not specifically address production of oil and gas. "Canada has to grapple with production," she said while attending COP26 herself. Abreu said the least developed countries submitted a request to COP26 for the developed world to set a specific date for when fossil fuels will not be produced or burned anymore. Dale Marshall, national climate program manager with Environmental Defence, also said Trudeau's pledge fell short. "Focusing on emissions from oil and gas production but not production itself will allow oil and gas companies to keep putting forward false solutions, such as carbon capture and storage, fossil-based hydrogen, and far-off net zero plans, all while pumping out more and more atmosphere-destroying fossil fuels," Marshall said in a statement. "We cannot go from climate laggard to even the middle of the pack without curtailing oil and gas production, starting now." Guilbeault said the federal government does not have jurisdiction over production, but does have jurisdiction over pollution. He cited the recent Supreme Court decision upholding the federal carbon price as evidence that Canada can act to force emissions down. Alberta's premier, however, argued that any caps on emissions need to be set in consultation with the province. "I don't know why they would make an announcement like this without consulting with the province that actually owns the overwhelming majority of Canada's oil and gas reserve," said Premier Jason Kenney. Kenney told a news conference his government isn't necessarily opposed to an emissions cap, but "we need to know what the cap is. He urged the federal government to invest in technologies that cut emissions, repeating his call for $32 billion in public funding for carbon capture, storage and use facilities, which inject carbon dioxide deep underground. Trudeau also said Monday that $1 billion of Canada's promised $5.3 billion international climate financing will be directed to help less developed countries get off coal power. That announcement was welcomed by Mafalda Duarte, CEO of Climate Investment Funds, which works with development banks, governments and communities in developing countries to finance climate solutions.  Canada understands our climate future will be won in developing countries," she said. "Today\' s announcement from Prime Minister Trudeau is a strong signal of Canada\' s leadership in climate finance and represents a significant expansion of the country\' s 12-year partnership with the Climate Investment Funds."

Climate scientist Saleem Huq says the world should prepare for a big letdown when the UN climate conference gets under way next month in Glasgow, Scotland. One of the major accomplishments of the Paris climate conference in 2015 was the promise that the world's richest nations would contribute to a $100 billion US fund that developing countries could draw upon to help speed up their economic transition away from fossil fuels. But six years later, that pot of money still doesn't exist. Have questions about climate science, policy or politics? Email us: HYPERLINK ask@cbc.ca Your input helps inform our coverage. "They just failed to do it," said Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development and a prominent voice on the topic in low-lying Bangladesh, which is especially vulnerable to climate-related emergencies such as floods and rising sea levels. "That strikes me as being totally incompetent and negligent." With time running out before the start of the 26th Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ), host Britain has delegated the difficult task of trying to wrangle the missing billions to Canada \'e2\€  and Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson in particular. Although he was re-elected in the Sept. 20 federal election, Wilkinson says he doesn't know if he'll be re-appointed to the environment portfolio in the upcoming cabinet. Regardless, he says he made the decision to head to Europe this week to try to twist some arms. The Italian city of Milan is hosting several crucial pre- COP26 gatherings this week, including a ministers meeting along with a summit of activists and youth leaders. "We're working right now to corral commitments from all countries so that we're making progress toward that $100 billion," Wilkinson told CBC News in an interview before flying to Milan. "I don't think there's been .. an organized effort to try to pull all of these threads together and to look at where we might find additional resources." Wrangling money COP26 organizers have set three key "deliverables" as the bar for success in Glasgow. In addition to the financing deal, there's the commitment of ambitious emissions reduction targets from each nation \'e2\€  especially the biggest polluters \'e2\€  to keep global warming to less than 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, as well as a timetable to make the burning of coal history. Of those three priorities, raising the transition money should have been the easiest, says Huq. According to an OECD analysis, the total amount pledged to date for the fund was last pegged at $79 billion. Last week, President Joe Biden said the U.S. \'e2\€  one of the world's largest per capita emitters \'e2\€  would double its own contribution to more than $11 billion. Huq said that falls short of what's required. The U.S. "owes probably five to 10 ten times more than it has given, in [light] of its own historic emissions." In June, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Canada would double its commitment to the international climate fund to $5.3 billion over five years. Wilkinson refused to name specific countries that he believes need to cough up more money, nor would he give an exact figure of what he's looking to raise. WATCH | Global inaction is a key concern ahead of COP26 : Huq is disheartened by the state of co-operation and the likelihood that the world's richer nations will deliver what they have promised. It's also clearly a worry for British Prime Boris Johnson, who vowed to make the Glasgow event a "turning point for humanity." His government has kicked the equivalent of $15 billion into the fund, but Johnson has said he sees only a 60 per cent chance that countries will come through with the outstanding money. Wilkinson said he believes predictions of the Glasgow summit's failure are premature. "The most important first step the world can take [in reducing emissions] is to accelerate the phase-out of coal, and certainly to stop the construction of new coal-fired power plants," he said. He noted that China, which releases more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than any other country, recently said it would stop financing new coal-power plants abroad. But to the disappointment of Glasgow organizers and climate campaigners everywhere, China still hasn't come out with a concrete timetable for reducing its own emissions to help hit the 1.5 degree target. A UN report earlier this month contained little in the way of optimism that the target is even reachable anymore. After examining the pledges made by nations so far, it concluded global emissions would be 16 per cent higher in 2030 than in 2010 \'e2\€  far off the 45 per cent reduction by 2030 that scientists say is needed. The question of inclusion The city of Glasgow, meanwhile, is slowly gearing up for its moment in the global spotlight. In the city centre, the 400-year-old Tolbooth Steeple has been transformed into a minute-by-minute reminder of what's at stake if COP26 fails to deliver. Glasgow's city council has beamed a projection of a countdown clock that ticks down the years, days and hours to when it will be too late to stop the planet from warming past 1.5 C, which is in less than seven years' time. If that happens, there's broad scientific consensus that the result will be more extreme weather events, drought, greater economic losses and destruction of marine life. There are ongoing concerns that the persistence of COVID-19 and the U.K.'s strict border measures will limit the participation at COP26 of many advocacy groups who claim they are already shut out of the formal talks. "We've got a situation where a lot of the people who should be at COP are not able to come," said Mim Black, a Glasgow-based climate justice activist. The U.K. has promised to ensure any official delegate in need of a government-approved vaccine to enter the country will get it, but Black says that pledge does not extend to thousands of activists and campaigners who also want to attend. Despite significant challenges, Wilkinson believes COP26 has the potential to build on the work of previous climate summits. "I don't think we're necessarily going to resolve everything at Glasgow," he said. "But I think what we need to do is show a big step forward in terms of global momentum. And I am very hopeful that we are going to see that, certainly on the international climate finance side of things." \</doc>

- New Sustainable Tourism Global Center (STGC) signals tourism's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions - Global sector figures join the STGC conversation at COP26 from former state presidents to leading institutions - STGC aims for greater collaboration between public and private tourism sectors to help reach net-zero, protect nature and support communities GLASGOW, Scotland, Nov. 3, 2021 /CNW/ -- A new coalition will accelerate tourism's transition to net zero, audiences at COP26 heard today. Ministers from major tourism destinations and leaders from international organizations have voiced their support to achieve a sustainable travel and tourism industry, through the Sustainable Tourism Global Center (STGC). The STGC is a multi-country, multi-stakeholder coalition\'e2\€ \£festablished to lead, accelerate, and track the tourism industry's transition to net-zero emissions, as well as drive action to protect nature and support communities. The tourism industry is highly fragmented, with developing countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) being most reliant on tourism for their economies. More than 40 million tourism businesses or 80 percent of the whole industry are small or medium sized. The STGC aims to support people and the planet by reforming tourism's contribution to climate change, in a bid to protect the environment and support those who need it most. At a special session on the future of the STGC at COP26 , His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism of Saudi Arabia, was joined by former President of Mexico and Chair of New Climate Economy, and the World Resources Institute, Felipe Calderon; David Livingston, Senior Advisor, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, and other leaders. The Center's strategy will be shaped by a coalition of governments, international organizations, academia, multilateral and financing institutions and industry associations. The countries invited to be part of this important coalition in phase one, are the UK, USA, France, Japan, Germany, Kenya, Jamaica, Morocco, Spain, and Saudi Arabia. These countries have prioritized climate, tourism and SMEs which will allow for synergies for this important initiative The top organizations that will help to shape the center and provide the services in phase one are WRI (World Resource Institute), UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), ICC (International Chamber of Commerce), WTTC (World Travel and Tourism Council), World Bank, and SYSTEMIQ. In addition to Harvard University, which will provide support to the STGC through research and capacity-building, while the UNFCCC will guide the Center to accelerate industry action on climate neutrality. The Center will deliver services and products across three core pillars, including knowledge creation and sharing, measurement and monitoring, and industry enablement. Across these pillars, the STGC will focus on at least in nine areas of industry support, including developing standards and resource provision for the tourism sector, capability building, and project funding and investment. The Center will be headquartered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and plans to open regional offices in other countries, with a strong multilingual online presence. Other countries and organizations will be invited to join in phase two. In addition, a group of global experts in tourism and climate is being assembled to support this important effort. His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism, Saudi Arabia, said: "The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the world the interconnectedness of humanity and nature, and the fragility of communities dependent on tourism to external shocks. We must act now to make the industry and local communities far more resilient and to help solve the challenge of climate change. That requires engaging with business, governments, and international organizations to accelerate action. Saudi Arabia is committed to contributing to this critical effort." President Felipe Calderon, Former President of Mexico and Chairman, World Resources Institute, said: "We share this initiative with global leaders who joined our mission to make tourism a lever toward achieving the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. There is a window of opportunity for business and governments to come together to drive these critical objectives, and the STGC will serve as a 'north star' to achieve this mission." Hon. Edmund Bartlett, Minister of Tourism of Jamaica, said: "The Government of Jamaica, as a Small Island Developing State and vulnerable economy, remains committed to resilience building for sustainable development, including through sustainable tourism. In this regard, Jamaica welcomes the opportunity to partner with the Sustainable Tourism Global Center to contribute to and benefit from this collaborative effort to secure a better planet for future generations." Janet Rogan. United Kingdom COP Regional Ambassador for Middle East and Africa, said: "We are proud to be hosting COP26 . Humanity has run down the clock on climate change. It is now time to take action. Tourism is a key sector that supports jobs and growth and we are pleased to be part of this important new initiative to accelerate the sector's transition to net zero." Her Excellency Fatim-Zahra Ammor, Minister of Tourism, Handicrafts and Social Economy Morocco said: "Under the guidance of his Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God bless him, The Kingdom of Morocco made sustainability one of the main pillars of its former sectorial strategies as well as its new development model. During the last two years, the whole world has been severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and tourism is one of the most affected sectors. It is crucial to join our efforts to build and co-design a sustainable recovery plan related to travel and tourism activities. The Sustainable Tourism Global Center is an important step towards this goal." Hon. Najib Balala, Cabinet Secretary of Tourism and Wildlife, Kenya said: "As one of Africa's most popular destinations for international visitors, Kenya has felt the full impact of the global tourism downturn as a result of the pandemic. We therefore agree that there is an urgent need for a new sustainable approach to global tourism. Along with our recently launched Wildlife Strategy 2030 which will ensure a thriving natural ecosystem under pressure from climate change, we are strong supporters of the Sustainable Tourism Global Center." Her Excellency Maria Reyes Maroto, Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, Spain said: " COP26 provides an ideal setting to confirm our commitment to help tourism contributing to the global challenge of climate change. As a world leader in tourism, Spain is promoting initiatives in sustainable tourism aiming to preserve the natural environment, to improve energy efficiency in the sector and to adopt the principles of the circular economy. This will accelerate the contribution of tourism to the green transition drawn by the European Green Deal. Spain is an active member in international initiatives such as Planet's Sustainable Tourism Programme, and it will remain an active partner working at a global level with other countries, in particular developing countries, as well as with international institutions and business representatives." Julia Simpson, World Travel & Tourism Council President and CEO, said: "At a time where leadership is most needed to address the climate emergency, we commend Saudi Arabia's initiative that will support the sector to achieve the global goals and ensure a sustainable future. WTTC is delighted to contribute to the Center through its unique data, research and expertise from businesses across the globe." John W. H. Denton AO, International Chamber of Commerce Secretary General, said: "I applaud the multi-country and multi-stakeholder effort to accelerate sustainability within the global tourism sector. Given the impacts of COVID-19 on the strength of the sector, partnerships will be vital to ensure small tourism operators can genuinely build back better and become a powerful force for local communities and our planet. "The International Chamber of Commerce as the institutional representative of more than 45 million companies in over 100 countries and as official UNFCCC Focal Point for Business and Industry looks forward to supporting the development of the Hub in the coming months and to connecting its work with our global business network, in particular the millions of small businesses in the tourism sector." Gloria Guevara, Chief Special Advisor to HE Ahmed Al Khateeb, said: "The tourism sector has been through so much throughout this pandemic and combined with the urgency of a response to climate change, it needs a global solution. SMEs in our sector like a travel agency or tour operator might not know their carbon footprint and how to contribute to the race to zero. Every time we go on holiday, we create jobs and reduce poverty, it would be great if we reach a point that the more, we go on holiday, the better it is for the planet. The multi-country, multi-stakeholder coalition will bring tourism's fragmented stakeholders together and provide knowledge to drive action now." Dr. Ramon Sanchez, Principal Investigator, Department of Environmental Health, Harvard University, said: "To create a truly sustainable global tourism industry, all community, business, and government stakeholders require the tools, frameworks, and best practices necessary to contribute to reaching this objective. The team at Harvard is excited to collaborate with the STGC on research that will play a critical role in building the foundation and driving the industry toward net-zero". Jeremy Oppenheim, founder, SYSTEMIQ, a global advisory and investment firm which specialises in Paris Agreement-aligned sectoral transformations and is supporting the STGC, said: "The STGC aims to bring together the many tourism-related sectors - aviation, hospitality, transport and catering services into a world-class, multi-stakeholder coalition that can help transform the industry especially SMEs, from one that generates 8% of global greenhouse emissions to one that is a driver of a net-zero, regenerative world." Niclas Svenningsen, Manager for Global Climate Action - United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change "Tourism is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change and one of the sectors that has most to contribute with to the 2030 sustainable development agenda. Climate action offers a win-win opportunity to recover economies, communities and countries in a sustainable and climate friendly fashion."

GLASGOW - UN climate talks in Scotland ended with a global agreement aimed at keeping alive hopes of capping global warming at 1.5 C, and so maintain a realistic shot at saving the world from catastrophic climate change. Alok Sharma, the conference chairman, was visibly emotional before banging down his gavel in relief to signal that there were no vetoes from the almost 200 national delegations present in Glasgow, ranging from coal-and gas-fuelled superpowers to oil producers and Pacific islands being swallowed by the rise in sea levels. The two-week conference in Glasgow, which extended into an extra day of tortuous negotiations, was the 26th of its kind but the first to call for a reduction in fossil fuels, which not only power much of the world's economy but are also the main cause of man-made global warming. There was last-minute drama as India, backed by China and other coal-dependent developing nations, raised objections to this part of the agreement and asked for the wording to be rewritten. The clause was hurriedly amended to ask countries to accelerate their efforts towards a coal power "phase down" instead of "phase out." India's environment and climate minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the revision was needed to reflect the "national circumstances of emerging economies." "We are becoming the voice of the developing countries," he told Reuters, adding that coal had been "singled out" during the COP26 talks while there was no similar call to phase out oil or natural gas. "We made our effort to make a consensus that is reasonable for developing countries and reasonable for climate justice," he said, alluding to the fact that rich nations historically have emitted the largest share of greenhouse gases. The one-word change in the agreement was met with dismay by the rich economies of the European Union and Switzerland, as well as by a large group of small island states, whose existence is under threat from rising sea levels. But all said they would let it stand for the sake of an overall agreement. "The approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today," said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. "They take important steps, but unfortunately the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions." 'DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT'Sharma had had the onerous task of balancing the demands of climate-vulnerable nations, big industrial powers, and those like India and China whose consumption or exports of fossil fuels are vital to their economic development. His voice broke with emotion after he heard vulnerable nations express their anger over the last-minute changes. "May I just say to all delegates I apologize for the way this process has unfolded and I am deeply sorry," he told the assembly. "I also understand the deep disappointment but I think, as you have noted, it's also vital that we protect this package." The overarching aim that he set before the conference was one that climate campaigners and vulnerable countries had found far too modest - namely, to "keep alive" the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to cap global warming at 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. The agreement in effect acknowledged that commitments made so far to cut emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases are nowhere near enough, and asked nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than every five years, as they are currently required to do. Scientists say that to go beyond a rise of 1.5 C would unleash extreme sea level rise and catastrophes including crippling droughts, monstrous storms and wildfires far worse than those the world is already suffering. But national pledges made so far to cut greenhouse emissions - mostly carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and gas - would only cap the average global temperature rise at 2.4 Celsius. 'THE ERA OF COAL IS ENDING'Jennifer Morgan, executive director of the campaign group Greenpeace, saw the glass as half-full. "They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending," she said. "If you're a coal company executive, this COP saw a bad outcome." Developing countries argue that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, must pay more to help them adapt to its consequences as well as reducing their carbon footprints. The deal gave the poorest nations more promises, but no guarantees, that they would finally get more of the financial help they have long been told they will get. It urged rich countries to double finance for climate adaptation by 2025 from 2019 levels, offering funding that has been a key demand of small island nations at the conference. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Sun Media Corporation.

GLASGOW, Scotland - They say the last best chance to save the planet is happening here, in a bland cavernous conference centre where Indigenous leaders in feather headdresses brush past Prince Charles and Wall Street money huddles with green hydrogen nerds. Inside the global climate summit known as COP26 , the vibe is pandemic meets the annual meeting of the World Geophysical Society. There's virtue signalling, greenwashing and speeches in sometimes half-empty halls. The pledges came fast and furious over the past week. About all the great things that will happen in 2030 or 2050 or 2070. Meanwhile, in the backrooms, the planet's actuarial accountants were toting up how many more gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents we can emit before the polar ice caps melt. Outside? There were 100,000 people in the streets of Glasgow on Saturday, marching through the wind and rain. Costumes and creative signs abounded: one man on stilts was bedecked in blue fabric and cloth sea creatures. Children held up a long piece of fabric meant to look like a caterpillar. Alice Francis and Malcom Strong, from southwest Scotland, arrived pushing a homemade "bulls--cart," complete with a trash bin, rake and real manure from their horse, Dougal. But hey, the negotiations are going well. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is cautiously optimistic. But hey, the talks are a failure. Swedish superstar activist Greta Thunberg thinks COP26 is a con. Inside the summit, masks. Negotiators drinking carbon-neutral coffee in sustainable blue coffee cups. Outside the summit, the comedic actor Rainn Wilson paid to have a melting iceberg shipped to Glasgow from Greenland. Little kids waved signs echoing Thunberg's disdainful refrain, "blah, blah, blah." What does COP26 After four years largely in absentia under president Donald Trump, the U.S. has reestablished a foothold at the conference under President Joe Biden. Like hand sanitizer, Kerry has been omnipresent. The old climate warrior said he'd never been to an environmental summit with "a greater sense of urgency" and "a greater sense of focus." Kerry has been coming to these shows since the first "Earth Summit" in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Hana Kidy, an economic liaison with the Liberian delegation, is at her first COP. "It feels awesome," she said. "It feels overwhelming. It feels intense. Mostly intense." Intense, but also not that intense? British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the summit it was "one minute to midnight." But he appeared to have time to take a short nap on camera. President Biden may have been resting his eyes, too. There have been long lines to get into the Blue Zone, the secure guts of the summit. You need a negative coronavirus test. The security guards check, usually. At the star-studded beginning of the week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's entourage was everywhere, rushing back and forth past the Scottish Larder and Grab &; Go, where participants could purchase overpriced egg mayonnaise sandwiches. Prince Charles moved more slowly, and with a smaller posse. Prince William had no posse at all - or if he did, it was very discreet. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin are no-shows, which means both fewer potential spoilers and lower expectations for what the summit might accomplish. Actor and climate activist Leonardo DiCaprio wouldn't miss it, though. He flew commercial to Glasgow, in coach. Al Gore was in the house, too. The former vice-president told the summit that satellites will serve as the new "neighbourhood watch" to monitor compliance with emissions pledges. Over beers, Ukrainian gas representatives pitched their products to Japanese firms. Titans of industry lurked behind closed doors. Bill Gates sat in a meeting room, hosting one journalist, then another, some of whom asked questions that made his leg tap impatiently. The Indonesian pavilion served a steady stream of hors d'oeuvres. The Australians had the best coffee. Or so our WhatsApp feed said. In the rain a few blocks away, tens of thousands thronged into Kelvingrove Park. Friends had to shout to hear each other over the chants and songs and wind. Hermione Spriggs, 33, revelled in the sodden chaos. "It's lovely being part of being part of this big blob of humans," she said. Spriggs, who runs tracking and foraging workshops in her native Yorkshire, was decked out in a costume made of netting woven with leaves and native grasses. Only her face was visible through the mass of green. When she's out in nature, she said, the outfit helps her blend in. "And it helps us stand out at a protest," she said. The virus is still in the game. Britain is facing a surge in COVID-19. Several conference-goers have been overheard muttering beneath their masks about the potential for a "superspreader" event of global proportions. But COP26 The menus at food stands in the conference hall list the carbon footprint of each item. For the carbon-conscious, a Scottish delicacy called "haggis, neeps and tatties" will set you back 3.4 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent, while the vegetarian version will ease your eco-guilt with only 0.6 kg. At the centre of the conference venue, countries and organizations have their own pavilions, where they highlight their efforts to cut emissions and the challenges they face. The pop-up hosted by Egypt, the largest oil producer in Africa outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, features a towering green replica of a windmill. At the pavilion hosted by Tuvalu, a low-lying mid-Pacific island nation particularly susceptible to sea-level rise, attendees gaped at a striking art installation. It depicts three polar bears wearing life preserver vests, standing on an iceberg, while a penguin hangs with a noose around its neck, a victim of despair. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

NEW DELHI (AP)  Only four Pacific islands will be represented by their leaders at upcoming U.N. climate talks in Glasgow because of COVID-19 travel restrictions, with most island nations forced to send smaller teams. The development has sparked fears that the voices of these countries  whose very existence is threatened by climate change despite contributing only a fraction of the world's emissions  may not be heard at the U.N. Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26 , which begins on Sunday. Small island nations were crucial in ensuring that the 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7-degree Fahrenheit) warming threshold was adopted in the 2015 Paris climate accord. Scientists now say that the world has already warmed nearly 1.1 C (2 F), and a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change earlier this year warned that the world would likely exceed the 1.5-degree threshold earlier than anticipated. The talks in Glasgow may be the  final opportunity for the world to try to limit warming to the 1.5-degree threshold, said Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji. Warming oceans are already bleaching coral reefs and climate disasters are becoming more frequent and severe, he added. "Our sovereignty and very survival are at stake, he said. Only Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu and Palau will be represented by their heads of state at COP26 . Other small island nations will be represented by ministers, officials from capitals or ambassadors in Europe or the U.S., said Fatumanva Luteru, the chair of the Pacific Small Island Developing States, a group of countries that operate as a bloc during climate negotiations, and Samoa\' s ambassador to the United Nations. Those living in the Pacific islands face unique challenges just in traveling to Glasgow. Few commercial flights are available and local delegations have had to plan their journeys as late as possible to minimize the time they spend in quarantine in transit countries, said Luteru. The expense of travel was another factor. With borders shut, COVID-19 cases have remained low across the Pacific island region. Many have been unscathed by the pandemic but have fragile health systems and there is fear that someone returning from overseas could introduce the virus to the islands. Tagaloa Cooper, the director of climate change resilience at the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme, said it was  inequitable that those most impacted by climate extremes would not be present at the summit.  We can\' t afford to be lost in the abyss. ... We can\' t afford to not be heard, she said. For some countries the 1.5-degree threshold marked an ambition, but for the Pacific islands it was a  compromise since they were already facing severe impacts from climate change. Failure to limit warming below that level could mean these countries will lose 30%-70% of their land-based economies and entire islands to rising seas, said Satyendra Prasad, Fiji\' s ambassador to the U.N. Not having all Pacific leaders present, or having  thinner negotiating teams, means it will not be possible for these countries to be physically present at all meetings during the summit, Prasad said. The small islands have a  disproportionately important role in global climate negotiations because they are the most vulnerable and their leaders have the  moral authority to urge greater climate action, since failure to do so is an existential threat to their countries, said Nigel Purvis, who was a U.S. State Department climate negotiator for the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations.  Their voice is truly important to securing ambitious outcomes in these negotiations, he said.  Failure isn't an option, said Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands. She said countries need to cut down their emissions, scale up financing to combat climate change and provide a clear roadmap for how vulnerable countries can access these funds.  Our islands, our heritage, our way if life is at stake, she said. ___ AP Science Writers Seth Borenstein in Washington and Victoria Milko in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\' s Department of Science Education.

With world leaders in Glasgow to negotiate around climate change at COP26 , some children went to great lengths to ensure politicians hear their message: take real action in order to save the planet and their future. Two siblings from Germany who call themselves the Climbing Kids, or @kletterkinder on Twitter, belayed down from the Clyde Arc bridge near the UN climate conference centre on Monday afternoon, dangling at least 30 feet above the river for quite some time as water rescue teams circled below. Police responded in force and closed the bridge to vehicle traffic as crowds of onlookers gathered along its railing after Zozo, 10, and her brother Kiwi, 12, unfurled a large white banner that read  Humanity is failing. In a video message recorded while hanging suspended in their gear, the children said humanity and politicians are racing to the brink of climate change.  We are failing to accept the reality of the climate crisis, Zozo said.  We are racing towards a wall, and our politicians are celebrating that they want to brake behind the wall. Adults may worry about high fuel prices, she said.  But we are worrying about what a collapse of human civilization means for our lives, Zozo added. Her older brother, Kiwi, noted a cascade of tipping points will be triggered once the 1.5 C threshold of global warming is reached.  Millions of people will die and billions of will lose their home or won\' t be able to feed their families, he said. The children were safely removed from the bridge, but two adults in their 40s were reportedly arrested in connection with the protest. It\' s not the first time the kids have employed their skills to push politicians to act, a spokesman for the children and their parents said. The brother and sister, and their parents, are very experienced, professional-level climbers, he said. The pair has staged a number of protest climbs at Berlin\' s iconic Brandenburg Gate during climate action strikes. At age 8, Zozo perched herself atop a lamp post at the COP25 conference in Madrid, Spain, in 2019, equipped with a flag emblazoned with renowned youth activist Greta Thunberg\' s famous question:  How dare you? Politicians have been saying they will take care of climate change since the last summit in Madrid, Kiwi said.  But they aren\' t, he added.  They are lying to us; they are still selling our future.  They are letting us sleep walk into the collapse of our own civilization.  That\' s how humanity is failing. We\' re failing as a species. Neither Zozo, Kiwi nor their parents could be reached for additional comment following the protest and before the publication deadline for Canada\' s National Observer.

Marc Morano will debunk COP26 climate extortion in his presentation "Green New Deal: The Great Regret" on Oct. 6, 2021, at 7 p.m. MDT for part two of Friends of Science Society's 18th Annual Event free, online. Developing nations were bribed into the Paris Agreement with promises of $100bn/year Green Climate Fund; Robert Lyman reports demands have escalated into climate extortion in the trillions. CALGARY, AB, Oct. 5, 2021 /CNW/ -As reported by the Victoria Times-Colonist on Oct, 1, 2021, Canada and Germany are pushing 'wealthy nations' for more climate money, and as COP26 approaches, climate activists are pushing for climate lockdowns and personal carbon rations, as Marc Morano reveals in his upcoming live stream "Green New Deal: The Great Regret" on Oct. 6, 2021, at 7 p.m. MDT on Friends of Science Society's YouTube channel. Morano is author of numerous popular books that skewer climate change hysteria, his most recent being "Green Fraud: Why the Green New Deal Is Even Worse than You Think". In his upcoming presentation, "Green New Deal: The Great Regret", Morano exposes the hypocrisy and hype of climate activists in an entertaining way, but he points out these ideologues are deadly serious and intent on imposing climate lockdowns as well as a personal carbon ration. Climate 'madness' in the media increases as the upcoming "26th Conference of the Parties" ( COP26 ) event nears, which runs from Oct. 31 to Nov 12, 2021, in Glasgow. In concert with the rising climate change hysteria in the media, participating nations are also raising the ante for their cooperation. Mark Carney, UN Special Envoy on Climate Change, has called for a $100 bn/year global carbon offset market, as reported by the Financial Times, Dec. 2, 2020. As Mark Schapiro noted in Harper's Magazine in Feb. 2010 in "Conning the Climate", carbon markets entail "the lack of delivery of an invisible substance to no one". Despite Greta Thunberg's vast global popularity and her association with the social engineering and carbon offset organization "We Don't Have Time", in April 22, 2021 testimony to the US House Subcommittee on Fossil Fuels and Climate Change, Greta admitted that her statements "Our house is on fire" and "I want you to panic" were simply metaphors and are not based on any science. (51:00 Rep. Norman) Thus, people should question COP26 demands to fund $100 billion that will be traded on an invisible substance that serves no purpose but would obviously be extracted from the pockets of COVID-impoverished and exhausted taxpayers. There is no valid science underlying the claim of an alleged "Climate Emergency" as shown by the Feb. 2021 work of Roger Pielke, Jr. and Justin Ritchie in "Distorting the view of our climate future: The misuse and abuse of climate pathways and scenarios". Greta's metaphorical claims, which have terrified millions of children and youth around the world, are at best, based on the implausible modeled scenario known as 'RCP8.5'. Without that scenario, there is no climate emergency and we do have time. Canadian energy economist Robert Lyman, former public servant of 27 years and 10 years a diplomat, reports in "Show Me the Money!" climate finance demands for developing nations have now far exceeded the already enormous $100 bn/year Green Climate Fund commitment promised during the Paris Agreement negotiations, to bribe developing nations to sign on. Lyman notes "demands for funding have greatly increased. India has demanded $1 trillion, and Africa has asked for an estimated $3 trillion to implement its emissions reduction plans by 2030." Referring to a COP26 document "A Five-Point plan for Solidarity, Fairness and Prosperity" Lyman points out that according to the plan the US might be on the hook for $80 billion per year, a far cry from the April 2021 commitment by U.S. President Biden to increase climate aid to $5.7 billion annually by 2024. Lyman goes on to say "Interestingly, despite its status as by far the largest GHG emitter in the world and one of its wealthiest countries, China was not identified as requiring any changes in terms of its emissions and climate aid targets." Following Wednesday's livestream, Friends of Science Society's two-part 18th Annual Event "Politicians Can't Stop Climate Change" can be viewed here. About Friends of Science Society is an independent group of earth, atmospheric and solar scientists, engineers, and citizens that is celebrating its 19th year of offering climate science insights. After a thorough review of a broad spectrum of literature on climate change, Friends of Science Society has concluded that the sun is the main driver of climate change, not carbon dioxide (CO2).

Four months after COP26 , the global energy picture has changed significantly -- and not in the direction that COP negotiators would have hoped. Far from declining, coal use globally surged to record levels over the winter, causing emissions to rise. And that was before Russia invaded Ukraine, causing a global energy crisis that has forced countries, especially in Europe, to look for ways to quickly wean themselves off Russian oil and gas, and reconsider timelines of commitments to cut the use of fossil fuels. A recent study by McKinsey & Co estimated that the road to net-zero will require $9.2 trillion of investment, every year, between now and 2050. However, a recent research paper in Nature found that, of the $14 trillion spent on economic stimulus in G20 countries in 2020 and 2021, only six percent was allocated to areas that would cut emissions. While that means investments fell well short of the $9.2 trillion required, it amounts to $840 billion - the most investments ever made into cutting emissions in such a short time frame. While the road net-zero will require significantly more investments, there are reasons to be optimistic. First, significant investments into alternative marine fuels for the shipping industry are increasingly being made in important trading zones. While the shipping industry only accounts for 3% of global carbon emissions, methane emissions from shipping increased by 150% from 2012 to 2018. Alternative marine fuels will help significantly reduce the industry's emissions. The Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCEZ) is one of the most important trading hubs in the world. The global ocean fleet is made up of 5,534 ships and the Suez Canal had over 18,000 ships pass through it in 2019 alone. Since COP26 , the SCEZ has signed an MOU for a $5 billion project with Norway's Scatec to build its first green ammonia plant, has agreed to build a $2.6 billion green methanol plant, and has signed an MOU with the EBRD to develop a national low-carbon hydrogen strategy that could help unlock Egypt's, and this important trading hub's, potential for a greener economy. Another important factor contributing to the optimism is how countries that are historical hydrocarbon producers are substantially increasing investments to foster their energy transition. This signals their understanding of the need to develop and produce climate-friendly energy sources as their reliance on hydrocarbons for state revenue and economic growth will not last forever. This week in Nigeria, the government, alongside the European Union and Germany, released the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). It aims to address bottlenecks in the renewable energy sector and enable the country to meet the targets of adding 9,000 megawatts of electricity from renewable sources to the national grid before 2030. The ESMP is a critical step for Nigeria's transition that simplifies the process of carrying out Environmental and Social Impacts Assessments, reduces costs for local developers, and promotes renewable energy production. In Brazil, an impressive and important milestone was recently reached. Renewable energy sources now account for more than 80% of the electricity matrix in Latin America's largest nation. This helps substantiate the country's green agenda reform goals and bodes well for its long-term growth. The UAE aims to become the first Middle Eastern country to be carbon neutral by 2050, with clean and renewable energy investments worth Dh600 billion ($163.5bn) planned over the next three decades. The country is building large-scale renewable energy projects, including the world's largest single-site solar power plant in Al Dhafra - a project that will use approximately 3.5 million solar panels to generate enough electricity for 160,000 homes across the UAE and mitigate 2.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. The country also plans to build the Mohammed bin Rashid Solar Park in Dubai with a 5-gigawatt capacity and is also constructing Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, the Arab world's first multi-unit operating nuclear plant. The global energy transition is often described by proponents as a quick one-stop solution and not as a transitional period that will likely get worse before it gets better. Despite the war in Ukraine, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the road towards net-zero. By Cyril Widdershoven for Oilprice.com COMTEX_404575728/2559/2022-03-22T06:27:46 \</doc>

GLASGOW, United Kingdom - Canada is set to take the first step towards capping emissions from the oil and gas sector today as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau starts two days of leaders' talks at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. This is the 26th meeting of the Council of Parties to the UN climate convention, known as COP26 . Trudeau is attending alongside more than 120 other world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Canada will not be increasing its targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions further than what was announced earlier this year. In July, Canada formally submitted its new target to the UN, which aims to have 40 to 45% fewer emissions than in 2005 by 2030. The previous target was a 30% reduction in emissions from 2005 by 2030. Trudeau's recent election platform included a number of new policies to reach that revised target, including a promise that oil and gas emissions will be capped and forced down until they hit net zero in 2050. A lack of regulations on oil and gas sector emissions has long been a sore spot between Canada's environmental groups and the federal government. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault told The Canadian Press before he left for Scotland that the government's new net-zero advisory body will be tasked with helping craft targets for the oil and gas cap. Today, he will send a letter to the advisory group to start the process. Trudeau arrives at COP from the G20 leaders' summit in Rome, where leaders agreed that global warming had to be limited to 1.5 C by the end of this century. However, they failed to agree on specific actions to make that happen. "There's no question that Canada and a number of other countries would have liked stronger language and stronger commitments on the fight against climate change than others," Trudeau said at his closing news conference. \</doc>

CALGARY - Canadian resource companies made a string of net-zero emissions pledges ahead of this week's climate conference in Glasgow, but analysts say investor pressure will now mount on those companies to also set and hit interim targets, even as the industry continues to meet rising demand for their products. Calgary-based pipeline giant TC Energy Corp. became the third domestic midstream company, after Enbridge Inc. and Gibson Energy Inc., to announce a net zero emissions target last week. The company also pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 30 per cent by 2030. A series of net-zero announcements in the Calgary oilpatch in October, including pledges by the country's four biggest oilsands companies, were timed ahead of this week's 26th Conference of the Parties ( COP26 ) global climate change conference in Glasgow, National Bank of Canada Financial Markets analyst Amber Brown said. "I look at the net zero pledge as they are aligning with the financial system. As more banks and asset managers pledge net zero, energy companies are aligning and saying they want to be part of the transition," Brown said, but added that more interim targets are expected from the oil and gas sector. "The near term targets are more about accountability," Brown said. "We will likely start to see more companies be held accountable for these near-term targets." "I think that would be a great goal for management teams to take because you would be tying the goal to the current management team, and then there's a lot of incentives for the current management team to get that done," said Stephen Ellis, energy and utilities analyst with Morningstar in Chicago, adding that would result in a higher chance of companies hitting their targets. Ellis said that Canadian companies are currently ahead of their U.S. competitors in making net-zero commitments and unveiling plans to curb emissions. He said the country's move towards a $170 per tonne carbon tax by 2030 creates a "much, much greater financial incentive" for Canadian players to get serious about emissions reductions than in the U.S. On Monday, Alberta announced $176 million in funding for 16 emissions-cutting projects in the province, including a hydrogen project near Edmonton. The funds will flow from the province's TIER program, which is a tax of heavy emitters in the province. Across sectors, Canadian firms have been trying to align themselves with the net-zero goal ahead of the conference. Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. and Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd. committed alongside 26 other large mining companies to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 on Oct. 5. The country's Big Six banks announced Oct. 15 announced they were joining the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which is a global banking alliance led by former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. "Banks and asset managers that have pledged (net zero) are currently trying to calculate the emissions in their portfolios and loan books," National Bank's Brown said. "They are going to set their own interim targets, so that creates even more pressure. It's kind of a double-whammy." On Wednesday, banks and asset managers representing 40 per cent of the world's financial assets pledged to meet the goals set out in the Paris climate agreement, as an alliance championed by former central banker Mark Carney swells under the gaze of a world increasingly alarmed by planetary warming. More than 450 firms representing US$130 trillion of assets now belong to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, almost double the roughly US$70 trillion when GFANZ was launched in April, according to a progress report published by the coalition on Wednesday. Signatories must commit to use science-based guidelines to reach net zero carbon emissions by mid-century, and to provide 2030 interim goals. GFANZ was created in April. Convened by the United Nations, the alliance comprises six groups spanning all corners of the financial industry. On Wednesday, the group announced that Michael Bloomberg, the owner and founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, will co-chair GFANZ together with Carney. One of GFANZ's key targets is for investment managers to "annually publish absolute emissions and emissions intensity in line with best practice and within a year of setting targets, disclose progress against a board-level reviewed transition strategy setting out proposed actions and climate-related sectoral policies." The pressure on Canadian companies to commit to interim targets is likely to rise further. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in Glasgow this week that Ottawa would put a cap on total oil and gas emissions in the country, which would become more stringent over time. On Monday, Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson sent a letter to the country's Net-Zero Advisory Body asking for input on how to "cap and cut emissions" from the oilpatch, which make up 26 per cent of Canada's total emissions. "We know the members of the Net Zero Advisory Body understand that climate change is not just an environmental issue, but a competitiveness issue for Canada's energy sector and for the workers who have depended on providing Canadian energy to the world for generations," the letter states, adding the government plans to present a 2030 emissions reduction plan to Parliament "in the coming months." Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault at COP26 Independent of government pressure, other financial institutions are expected to increasingly ramp up pressure on companies to reduce their emissions as well. Canadian pension plans including the Caisse de d\'e9p\'f4t et placement due Qu\'e9bec and the University of Toronto Asset Management Corp. have joined the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance, which have 2025 emissions reductions targets. The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan has also made a net zero commitment but hasn't joined the alliance. "They drive the agenda," said Jackie Cook, director of investment stewardship research at Morningstar. "Investors are putting themselves under a five-year cadence, it could be that they put companies under the same pressure," she said, adding that she expected companies would need to follow suit to align with their lenders or risk being frozen out of future lending. Cook also noted that both the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance and the Net Zero Asset Managers, a group that boasts US$33 trillion in assets under management and includes BlackRock, have made 2030 emissions reductions targets. Trudeau moves on pledge to cap oil and gas emissions as COP26 talks begin in Scotland( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/trudeau-moves-on-pledge-to-cap-oil-and-gas-emissions-as-cop26-talks-begin-in-scotland https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/trudeau-moves-on-pledge-to-cap-oil-and-gas-emissions-as- HYPERLINK cop26 -talks-begin-in-scotland Why Texas isn't ready for another deep freeze( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/texas-isnt-ready-for-another-deep-freeze https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/texas-isnt-ready-for-another-deep-freeze ) Exxon, Chevron target billions in buybacks as energy prices boost cash flow( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/chevron-crushes-estimates-as-gas-refining-spur-cash-flow-record https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/chevron-crushes-estimates-as-gas-refining-spur-cash-flow-record ) However, there is also a disconnect in the understanding of these targets that could create confusion both for financial institutions and resource companies. "Managers know they have the power to push for systemic change through more active ownership and advocacy - recognizing that their ability to meet targets depends on commitments and action by other financial system stakeholders," Morningstar's Cook wrote in a research note this week, noting that managers feel less equipped to commit to portfolio targets because corporate disclosure and emissions data is still weak or inconsistent. "It's likely that there will be wide variation between managers' action plans, from the portion of assets in scope for 2030 targets to the metrics used to track engagement progress and systemic impact," Cook said. COP26 is taking place against the backdrop of rising energy prices and crippling shortages in key geographies, especially Europe, which only compounds the challenge facing global leaders, notes Royal Bank of Canada. The absence of key leaders such as Xi Jinping of China and Russia's Vladimir Putin also dents the scope and scale of the commitment made by governments, resource firms and financial institutions. "Developing nations are also seeking significant financial assistance to help pay for emissions reductions programs and to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events," Helima Croft, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a report. "Advanced OECD nations have pledged to provide US$100 billion per year in climate finance assistance since 2009, but have consistently fallen short of that annual goal."

A group rallied at Saskatoon City Hall Friday to protest government inaction on climate change. The rally happened the same day the COP26 summit ended in Glasgow, Scotland. The group, made up of different community organizations and local people of all ages, said in a news release it feels quality of life for people is being increasingly threatened by a lack of action on climate change by every level of government. Its call to action was "Don't leave us behind," according to the release. SASKATOON, SK-NOVEMBER 12, 2021 - Tyler Krause, president of the Tesla Owners Club of Saskatchewan, writes his calculated gas savings per year on the back window of his Tesla. As COP26 wraps up, local organizations and community members gathered for a rally at City Hall in Saskatoon, SK on Friday, November 12, 2021. People attending were asked to wear masks, physically distance and stay home if they felt sick.

BOSTON - An upcoming United Nations climate summit will give world leaders a chance to push for standardized measures of areas like corporate carbon emissions, the head of the largest U.S. pension fund said on Monday. Marcie Frost, chief executive of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said she is optimistic leaders at the event known as " COP26 " will take an important step in slowing global warming by helping investors decide which companies to buy or sell. "When institutional funds like Calpers are making allocation decisions on this data, we believe that will be a bit of an inflection point," said Frost, speaking in an interview at ?the ?Reuters Impact conference. Currently investors are faced with a wide variety of ESG ratings systems from private companies to measure areas ranging from their greenhouse gas reduction targets to the diversity of their workforces. Corporations have space to offer statements that sound ambitious but don't stand up to scrutiny, Frost said. In some instances, "You ask three probing questions and it all rather dissolves," she said. Frost said it could still be a year or two before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission delivers official standards for how companies might report audited information. Other helpful steps would be if governments removed fossil fuel subsidies and adopted carbon pricing systems, Frost said. Some pension funds in other Democratic-led states have moved to divest from fossil fuels. Resisting such calls, Calpers instead has embraced a strategy of pressing for changes from within. Frost noted Calpers' role in the Climate Action 100+, an investor network created to pressure companies. It also backed the activist campaign that led to the election of new directors at ExxonMobil Corp this year.

JOYCE NAPIER: And welcome back. The global climate summit, COP26 , wraps up at the end of this week, and Justin Trudeau has already made several commitments, including promising to slash Canada's oil and gas sector methane emissions by 75 percent by 2030, and reiterating a campaign promise to cap oil and gas emissions. But will Canada's green pledges meet fiery resistance from western provinces? Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe tweeted out today that Saskatchewan needs to be a nation within a nation. How will the province flex those muscles? Let's find out. Joining me now is Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe. Welcome, Premier, always nice to have you on the show. Let me tell our views that you tweeted that Saskatchewan needs to be a nation within a nation. When the federal government implements policies that are detriment to our province, our government will continue to stand up for the people of Saskatchewan. What do you mean by that? SCOTT MOE (Saskatchewan Premier): Well, just precisely that. The most recent example, and there's been many, but the most recent example is this announcement that was made in Glasgow by the prime minister, and quite frankly his activist environment minister that he now has in place here. This is a policy that was made without any consultation, at least with province of Saskatchewan, zero, no phone call made, and no question asked as to, you know, what impact would this have on, you know, our economy, no economic analysis done, and what impact would this have on 30,000 Saskatchewan residents, families that rely on the energy sector here in this province to, for their livelihood? And the end result of a policy like this is really two-fold. One, Canadians are going to pay more for their gas because they're going to have to get it from other areas of the world, and, two, the world is actually going to have a higher greenhouse gas emissions footprint, because if you cap production in a place like Saskatchewan, where our emission levels are 25 percent below the global average, you essentially are going to be purchasing that oil from other areas of the world with a much higher emissions content, and so thereby our emission also go up literally by this really what is a wrongheaded policy. NAPIER: Is it possible, Premier, to sit down with Ottawa, with the prime minister, and have this conversation? MOE: One would expect that we would do that before they make the announcement, as to what the impacts are on people in Saskatchewan, which, you know, can still consider themselves Canadians. So we would have hoped that phone call would have been made before we had literally jet-fulls of federal folks going over to Glasgow and making an announcement like this. It has a very real impact on, like I say, 30,000 Saskatchewan families, it has a real impact on Canadians, and it is going to push the price of fuel up, and it has a real impact on global greenhouse gas emissions as it's going to push those up as well. We're going to end up, if you're not going to buy your energy from a place like Saskatchewan, you ultimately are going to buy it from beacons of democracy in the world, places like Russia for example. NAPIER: So in the huge delegation that Canada sent to Glasgow, to COP26 , were there any representatives from your province? MOE: No. NAPIER: So, you say now that you want, you know, flex your provincial muscle, have more autonomy, correct me if I'm wrong, for instance on taxation, policing, immigration, you know, how would that work? MOE: Well, it would work, you know, in the case of immigration, in exactly the same way that the federal government has an agreement with Quebec, for example, on immigration. Saskatchewan would like to mirror that agreement here. How it's working on our international relations is Saskatchewan has already opened up four international economic offices to advocate on behalf of the industries and the people that are working in our province, and also advocate and attract investment in the province of which we've been highly successful this past year with over $10 billion in industrial technology investment coming into Saskatchewan. We're going to open up four additional offices in the months ahead, and really, so what Saskatchewan is doing is we're making every effort to express our autonomy with any dealings that we have with the federal government, and moving into our space as a, you know, a powerful province in this nation. But most certainly, as we go ahead, we're going to have to make every effort to determine our own destiny, because what we see coming from the federal government is no consultation, and policies coming forward that are extremely impactful in a negative way to the people of this province. NAPIER: So a nation within a nation. How would you negotiate that? Would that be, I remember the constitutional negotiations. I'm a Quebecer. I covered it. How does this work in your mind, your nation within a nation? Who would you negotiate this with? MOE: Yeah, we may get to discussions with respect to the constitution that we have. How it will work in the early days is Saskatchewan is going to make every effort to ensure that we are taking up every jurisdictional place that we have right now as a province. For example, the development of natural resources is explicitly under the provincial jurisdiction, and we'll continue to ensure that that is the case in the months and weeks ahead, and we see, you know, the federal government has made this unconsulted announcement in COP, did not talk to at least the province of Saskatchewan, from what I hear hasn't talked to any other provinces, we most certainly are going to move into all of those spaces in as big a way as we can, and we expect to be able to move into spaces such as immigration, for example, in as large of a way as other provinces have, namely the province of Quebec. NAPIER: How far are you willing to go, Premier? NAPIER: Well, we are looking forward to that first ministers' conference. Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, thanks for taking the time to talk to us. Always a pleasure to talk to you, Sir. MOE: Thanks so much, Joyce. You have a great day. NAPIER: Coming up, the federal government spent billions on pandemic aid and stimulus. Have Canadians' appetite for big pandemic spending waned? Pollster Nik Nanos breaks down his latest exclusive poll for CTV's "Power Play" on pandemic aid next. Don't go away.

LONDON - Britain will relax some travel restrictions to help delegates attend the U.N. climate conference in Scotland later this year, including a shorter quarantine period for those from so-called "red list" countries who have been vaccinated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pushed for COP26 to be in-person rather than virtual, believing face-to-face negotiations will achieve more in the battle against global warming, which a United Nations panel said on Monday was close to being out of control. A COP26 official said the measures for the summit in Glasgow would strike a balance between allowing the talks to go ahead and protecting public health, with regular testing taking place. While many measures were based on current regulations, the official said, they would also include "specific arrangements" for Britain's traffic light system used to grade countries on their COVID risk for those arriving for the summit. "This includes a reduced quarantine period of five days for vaccinated individuals from red list countries," the official said. "There will be no requirement for self-isolation on arrival to the UK for those coming from amber or green list countries whether vaccinated or not." Unvaccinated people from red list countries would still need to quarantine for 10 days, the official said, adding delegates would be encouraged to get fully vaccinated, with Britain offering vaccines to all those registered. A government spokesperson said the report from scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) showing that greenhouse gas levels were high enough to guarantee climate disruption for decades proved COP26 was a "necessary event." "We know that achieving the ambitious global action needed to tackle climate change requires everyone sitting around the same table. To achieve this we have been working tirelessly to make arrangements for an in-person event," the spokesperson said. "We believe these arrangements strike a balance between allowing critical climate talks at this exceptional event to continue with representation from around the globe, while continuing to have measures in place to protect public health."

Canada is set to take the first step towards capping emissions from the oil and gas sector today as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau starts two days of leaders' talks at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow. This is the 26th meeting of the Council of Parties to the UN climate convention, known as COP26 . Trudeau is attending alongside more than 120 other world leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Canada will not be increasing its targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions further than what was announced earlier this year. In July, Canada formally submitted its new target to the UN, which aims to have 40 to 45 per cent fewer emissions than in 2005 by 2030. The previous target was a 30 per cent reduction in emissions from 2005 by 2030. Trudeau's recent election platform included a number of new policies to reach that revised target, including a promise that oil and gas emissions will be capped and forced down until they hit net zero in 2050. A lack of regulations on oil and gas sector emissions has long been a sore spot between Canada's environmental groups and the federal government. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault told The Canadian Press before he left for Scotland that the government's new net-zero advisory body will be tasked with helping craft targets for the oil and gas cap. Today, he will send a letter to the advisory group to start the process. Trudeau arrives at COP from the G20 leaders' summit in Rome, where leaders agreed that global warming had to be limited to 1.5 C by the end of this century. However, they failed to agree on specific actions to make that happen. "There's no question that Canada and a number of other countries would have liked stronger language and stronger commitments on the fight against climate change than others," Trudeau said at his closing news conference.

Nov. 1, the first day of the COP26 climate conference, could be considered as D-Day for climate. While there is optimism the urgent actions we need will begin as result, it is important to be aware of the other D-forces which have so far been preventing serious action: delay, deflection and even delusion. Using natural gas as a bridge to renewables may be necessary for a few more years, but we should be ramping up green energy much faster. Carbon capture and offsets are examples of delay or deflection, with limited contributions to decarbonization. Nuclear power, while having great potential, is too expensive (and scary for many people) to reduce GHG emissions significantly any time soon. Geoengineering is dangerous and delusional. Another example of deflection is focusing too much attention on individual behaviour; systemic changes are much more important. Therefore, we must all keep nudging our politicians for strong and effective climate policies. Canada and Alberta have among the highest per-capita GHG emissions in the world, both historically and currently, and therefore must act vigorously. I hope COP26 will reinforce our need to hold our policymakers accountable for representing the public interest rather than fossil fuel interests. Victor Dorian, Edmonton RCMP a dysfunctional institution Re. "Alberta police force could cost millions more," Oct. 30( HYPERLINK https://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/alberta-releases-study-into-potential-provincial-police-force ) This article fails to state the most important reason for Alberta to rid itself of the RCMP: Ask anyone familiar with its ways - Crown attorneys, defence counsel, judges - and you will hear unanimity on this; the RCMP is, and has been for a very long time (since at least the 1970s) a deeply dysfunctional institution, exemplified not only by misogyny and racism, but worse, the shocking suicide rate among its members. Roderick MacGregor, Ponoka Mounties already serving Alberta well The RCMP have been with us since 1873. Started with 300 members and has grown to more than 28,000. In 1905, when Alberta became a province they contracted them as their provincial police. They were at one time known only as provincial police but now their mandate is national, federal, provincial and municipal across Canada. They have a direct connection between municipal and territorial. They promote collaboration between all law-enforcement agencies in Canada and abroad to fight against global crimes. Provincial police would cost us more as feds help fund the present status. We taxpayers would be asked to foot the bill. Another referendum would have to be held as we taxpayers can't take anymore. What is the true reason to want to change something that is serving us well and good? Laurene Park, Edmonton New police force part of 'Conservative way' From 2010 until 2015 under Harper's administration (that included Premier Kenney), budget cuts to the RCMP and adjusted for inflation amounted to a 26-per-cent cutback. It's no coincidence that the Mounties killed in New Brunswick did not have carbines, body armour and training as recommended by the Mayerthorpe study. The "Conservative way" is to underfund a service, highlight the lack of service and then recommend a new service/solution that "could" be an improvement. D\'e9j\'e0 vu? No media report has made any reference to recruitment and training costs associated with the provincial police model. What additional expense might that accrue? Is Premier Kenney's obstinate vision to replace the RCMP with a provincial police force a legacy of misguided, budget-cutting strategies learned during his tenure in federal politics? M.L. Clark, Camrose Re. "Inquiry into climate activists a cynical ploy," Oct. 27( HYPERLINK https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-inquiry-into-anti-alberta-energy-campaigns-was-a-misuse-of-power https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-inquiry-into-anti-alberta-energy-campaigns-was-a-misuse-of-power Congratulations to Tim Gray of Environmental Defence Canada and Devon Page of Ecojustice for an excellent article regarding the $3.5-million Allan inquiry into anti-Alberta energy campaigns. It deserves some repetition. They note that oil and gas companies spend billions on furthering their own political agendas but the UCP government is silent on their funding sources. They conclude that the government is not concerned about international influence on politics but instead is "trying to delegitimize the right of those who disagree with them to participate in the normal functioning of policy development, public discourse and citizen engagement." Well said! And in his column of Oct. 22, David Staples struggled to maintain his usual tirade against environmentalists given the inquiry's finding of no wrongdoing, and was only able to lecture them on being transparent, like the corporations.

Today, the world celebrates Earth Day - a moment, perhaps, to acknowledge that for the health of our planet, less is more. The annual event is recognized as the world's largest secular observance, with over one billion people participating every year. The Earth Day organization advocates for individual action alongside global, national and local policy changes. It aims for co-operation that responds to climate change and environmental issues affecting resources and conservation. Each year the Earth Overshoot Day campaign calculates the renewable resources of the planet, from plants to fossil fuels, and how quickly humans are depleting what Mother Nature can effectively regenerate. In 2021, the cumulative renewable resources of the entire planet for one year were used up by the end of July. This year, North America exceeded its yearly stipend of what the planet could replenish in March. In fairness, the calculations are to make a point, as opposed to suggesting we are imminently doomed. (Although extreme weather events related to climate change, such as floods, heatwaves and drought, suggest that possibility is closer every day.) We have no one to blame but ourselves. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) estimates one million species are currently threatened with extinction due to human-caused activities. The desire for more is a vicious cycle that spurs a thirst for goods ranging from cars to clothes. This furthers the consumption of resources by industrial development, largely powered by greenhouse-gas-emitting fossil fuels. It's nothing we don't already know. What's different is the solution currently promoted by science. Kai Chan, research chair at the Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability at the University of British Columbia, recently wrote the answer to a world in which humans and nature are in sync starts with a transformative change that realigns the economic, political and societal. The IPBES has also advocated for a re-evaluation of ingrained practices such as consumerism that aid in contaminating nature and climate. There's hope. In December, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development published a guide on what becoming nature-positive means and how businesses can achieve it. Balancing human need with nature will be top of mind later this year, when governments around the world meet in Kunming, China for the final half of the United Nations Conference on Biodiversity (COP15). The first half was held virtually last fall. They hope to ratify agreements to create a nature-positive world by 2050 and conserve 30 per cent of the world's oceans and lands by 2030. If nature is allowed to thrive, researchers believe plants and trees could help absorb 30 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions needed to reach carbon neutral by 2050. Sadly, most of the countries meeting are the same ones that failed to do enough to save us from ourselves during COP26 , the recent climate change conference in Scotland. Perhaps after reflection, they've seen the error of their ways - and next Earth Day we'll reflect on how co-operation saved the planet. Jennifer Cole is a Vancouver-based freelance writer. \</doc>

World Vision predicts more than 300 million people could face food insecurity by 2030 20 million children are at risk of starvation in 43 countries 584,000 people are already living in famine-like conditions MISSISSAUGA, ON, Nov. 8, 2021 /CNW/ -A new report released by international aid agency World Vision says that millions of vulnerable children cannot affordfor climate change talks in Glasgow to fail, given how many are already on the edge of famine-like conditions. The reportClimate Change, Hunger and Children's Futures,studiesthe link between climate change and the risk of starvation,showsthe long-term consequences of malnutrition on children andcommunities, andfeatures whataffected childrensaythey need from global leaders. "Children across the world tell us they experience the devastating impact of climate change every single day and their warnings must be heard loud and clear by leaders at COP26 ," says Michael Messenger, President and CEO of World Vision Canada. "We hear heart-breaking stories of water becoming scarceandfamily livelihoods destroyed by recurring storms, flooding and drought, which can lead to life-threatening hunger and malnutrition.Children often face no choice but to drop out of school and are forced to work or marry by their parents who struggle to cope. "Forty-one million people in 43 countries are currently on the very edge of famine and face starvation. Millions of children are at risk of extreme hunger.We urge leaders to listen to the children affectedby climate change and to involve them as a central part of the solution as we work together to protect our planet's resources." When it comes to extreme hunger, starvation and famine, climate change is a major threat multiplier along with economic instability (aggravated by COVID-19) and, the biggest cause, conflict.The number of people who are facing hunger crises has, for the last five years, risen steadily for the first time in decades. Assuming the same trajectory experienced over the last five years, World Vision predicts that more than 300 million peoplewillbe facing food insecurity by 2030. "Conflict, COVID-19 and climate change are interacting to create new and worsening hunger hotspots and are reversing the gains families had made to escape poverty," said Lindsay Gladding, Director of Fragile and Humanitarian Affairs at World Vision Canada. "This is a children's crisis: millions of children are one step away from starvation and facing the threat of famine. Urgent life-saving action is needed NOW to prevent a humanitarian hunger crisis in which tens of thousands of children could die. Famine has no place in the 21st century and is entirely preventable. This is a do or die moment for the world's most vulnerable children."

A landmark report by climate scientists released Monday will ratchet up the pressure on world leaders to rapidly end the use of fossil fuels. The authors warned time is fast running out to stop global warming from exceeding 1.5C, the lower end of targets agreed to in the 2015 Paris Agreement. The report was signed off on by representatives from UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's nearly 200 member countries, a roster that includes climate laggards who haven't yet set targets for lowering emissions that are in line with Paris goals. Few diplomats or leaders from these countries, however, have so far responded publicly to the IP-CC's findings. Some of the most important readers of the IPCC's 3,949-page report - or at least the more manageable "summary for policy-makers" - will soon be headed to Glasgow, Scotland, for COP26 climate talks, also organized by the UN. In less than three months'time, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will host negotiations aimed at limiting global temperature rise, which is already causing wildfires and flooding around the world. Countries have agreed to submit new pledges ramping up their ambition before COP26 . At the moment, those voluntary pledges fall far short of keeping temperatures under 2C, let alone 1.5C, according to the UN. Johnson urged countries to end the use of coal power. "We know what must be done to limit global warming - consign coal to history and shift to clean energy sources, protect nature and provide climate finance for countries on the front line," he said on Monday in a statement. Coal has been a sticking point. India has been a key holdout, and China, the world's largest emitter, is also under pressure to announce a roadmap to making deep emissions cuts over the next decade. Its coal consumption is poised to hit a record this year, according to the International Energy Agency. Bloomberg !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

GLASGOW - Negotiators shuttled between delegations at the UN climate talks in Scotland on Saturday, seeking a deal to give the world a fighting chance of avoiding the worst effects of global warming, as the British host told them they had just hours left. Alok Sharma delayed a public meeting in the plenary hall, saying negotiators needed more time, but that he still intended to close the two-week COP26 conference, which has already overrun by a day, later in the afternoon. "At the end of the day, what is being put forward here is a balanced package, everyone's had a chance to have their say," he told the forum. The final deal will require the unanimous consent of the almost 200 countries present, ranging from coal- and gas-fueled superpowers to oil producers and Pacific islands being swallowed by the rise in sea levels. Like earlier versions, the latest draft of the conference agreement attempted to balance the demands of climate-vulnerable nations, big industrial powers, and those whose consumption or exports of fossil fuels are vital to their economic development. In particular, it retained a significant demand for nations to set tougher climate pledges next year, rather than every five years, as they are currently required to do - an acknowledgement that existing commitments to cut emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases are nowhere near enough. 'KEEPING 1.5 ALIVE' The meeting's overarching aim is to keep within reach the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But national pledges made so far to limit greenhouse emissions - mostly carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and gas - would only cap the average global temperature rise at 2.4 Celsius. While that gap will not be closed in Glasgow, Sharma said he hoped the final deal would pave the way for deeper cuts. China, the biggest current emitter of greenhouse gases, and Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, were seeking to prevent the final deal including language that opposes subsidies for fossil fuels, two sources told Reuters on Friday. However, Saturday's draft( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3_1.pdf https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CMA-3_1.pdf ), published by the United Nations, continued to single out fossil fuels - something no UN climate conference conclusion has yet succeeded in doing. Britain tried to unblock the issue of climate finance, always one of the thorniest, by proposing mechanisms to make sure the poorest nations finally get more of the financial help they have been promised. Developing countries argue that rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for heating up the planet, must pay more to help them adapt to its consequences as well as reducing their carbon footprints. MORE MONEY? The draft urged rich countries to double finance for climate adaptation by 2025 from 2019 levels, offering funding that has been a key demand of small island nations at the conference. Adaptation funds primarily go to the very poorest countries and currently take up only a small fraction of climate funding. Britain also said a UN committee should report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion in overall annual climate funding that rich nations had promised by 2020 but failed to deliver. And it said governments should meet in 2022, 2024 and 2026 to discuss climate finance. Even $100 billion a year is far short of poorer countries' actual needs, which could hit $300 billion by 2030 in adaptation costs alone, according to the United Nations, in addition to economic losses from crop failure or climate-related disasters. \</doc>

Another climate summit has come and gone. With all the expected last-minute drama, it seems to me the outcome was predictable. Yes, all 197 countries agree something must be done about climate change, even China got in on the action in a backdoor kind of way. Are all the countries, or major players, more importantly, going to make the drastic changes in their countries by 2030 they promised back in 2015? Hmmm let\' s see, has Canada made any drastic cuts so far? Nope. Awareness and carbon offsets just are not going to do it. It\' s going to take some brass youknow-whats to make the kind of changes that the planet needs, and I don\' t see many political leaders putting their political necks on the line to make them. Our dependence on fossil fuels, coal, etc., permeates every facet of our day-to-day lives. As a population, we don\' t even realize all the products we use that are just, for example, petroleum-based. Let\' s look at a few you may not be aware of:contact lenses, glasses, toothpaste, soap, shaving cream, perfume, cosmetics, combs, hand lotion, deodorant, pantyhose. Shall I go on? Are any a surprise? We are all culprits, sometimes not aware, but we need to educate ourselves and be more proactive. Recycle, be conscious of what you buy, walk to work, buy a hybrid or electric vehicle if you can, grow your own food, vote for green solutions when they come up. So many ways to make a difference and change. Now to get the bozos on the world stage leading our collective countries to actually do what they committed to. It\' s up to us, as well, to hold them accountable. I also think we need new players with fresh and innovative ideas in the political arena, that are not the paid-off puppets of the same old stagnated, guard. I\' d like to see more people in politics who talk plain, who actually answer questions, recognize differences and seek solutions that may be outside the norm, but look for innovative and inclusive solves. I want to see a politician say  I don\' t know, what do you think? How about this one? What about having a leader who is strong enough to work with all parties to tackle issues, instead of using our taxpayer money to argue, buy attack ads, and other such non-sense, how about once elected, everyone in office is mandated to work together to solve problems, like, starvation, clean water and pollution. Once in office, lose the party lines and get something done. I\' m sick of political jargon, hollow promises, and a myopic view of the world, and planet. Politicians should get a reasonable wage, no payoffs, no kickbacks, just get paid from one source, the taxpayer and that\' s it. Then maybe an unbiased eye can be turned to the larger problems of humanity. If they don\' t, I don\' t care how many COP26s, Paris Accords, or Three Amigo forays they spend gazillions of dollars on (and why aren\' t they just using Zoom like the rest of us?), they are blowing smoke and solving nothing. How much did all of them spend on opulent accommodations, private jets, etc., for all these meetings? If they had all stayed at the Holiday Inn I might have been impressed. Why not put that money they spent toward a solution to our endangered planet? Until they do, their citizens get to put up with ravaging wildfires, cyclone bombs, heat domes, rising seas, and conditions of such sickening proportions it boggles the mind. COP26 , smomp49.

LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday set out his ambition for a green revolution that he hopes will force Western economies to kick their addiction to fossil fuels. Britain at the end of the month hosts the COP26 U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, which aim to strengthen global action on global warming. "With the major climate summit COP26 just around the corner, our strategy sets the example for other countries to build back greener too as we lead the charge towards global net zero," Johnson said. Johnson, who once expressed skepticism about climate change, presented his 368-page net zero strategy as a document that would put the UK at the vanguard of green economies. "The UK leads the world in the race to net zero," he said in the foreword to the 'Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener'. "The likes of China and Russia are following our lead with their own net zero targets, as prices tumble and green tech becomes the global norm," he said. In 2019, Britain became the first G7 member to set a net zero emissions target for 2050, which will require drastic changes in the way Britons travel, heat their homes and consume electricity. The net zero strategy is essentially a series of long-term promises, some with caveats, to shift the world's fifth largest economy towards green technologies - from moving to clean electricity "subject to security and supply" to "setting a path" to low-carbon heating in British homes. It aims to secure 440,000 jobs and unlock 90 billion pounds ($124 billion) of private investment by 2030. It also aims to help Britain gain a competitive edge in low-carbon technologies such as heat pumps, electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage and hydrogen. The government aims to be powered entirely by clean electricity, subject to security of supply, by 2035. It aims to have 40 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power by 2030, as well as 1 GW of floating offshore wind. The government aims to deploy at least 5 million tonnes of CO2 a year of engineered greenhouse gas removals by 2030. "Current gas prices spikes underline the need to get off hydrocarbons as quickly as possible, but we will manage the transition in a way that protects jobs and investment, uses existing infrastructure, maintains security of supply, and minimizes environmental impacts," the strategy said. Gas and power prices in Britain have risen by over 250% this year, forcing some energy suppliers out of business and boosting consumer energy bills. Simone Rossi, chief executive of EDF in the UK, which operates the UK nuclear plant fleet said: "Rising gas prices are putting pressure on people's energy bills now, so we need to make urgent progress with building proven, low carbon energy generation that keeps costs steady and supplies secure." Many of the UK's nuclear plants are aging. Some are being decommissioned earlier than scheduled and EDF's new Hinkley Point C plant will not be online until 2026. EDF also plans to build a plant at Sizewell in Suffolk subject to the right investment framework. The government said it would secure a final investment decision on a large-scale nuclear plant by the end of this parliament. It will also launch a new 120 million pound "future nuclear enabling fund," for future nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors, with a number of potential sites such as Wylfa in north Wales. Earlier on Tuesday, Johnson announced nearly 10 billion pounds of private investment in green projects at an investment summit in London.

CALGARY, AB, Nov. 8, 2021 /CNW/ - The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) is calling for policy makers at COP26 to recognize the necessary role for natural gas and oil to meet growing global energy demand and the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Today countries around the world are struggling to provide their industries, businesses and citizens with affordable and reliable energy because they lack access to natural gas and oil. With this, we have seen a surge in coal use from both developing and developed nations along with increasing costs on food, electricity, travel and home heating. To achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, the world will need increased access to lower emission natural gas and oil, article 6 and industry's leading role in emissions reduction and clean-technology. It will be incredibly important for governments and the natural gas and oil industry to work collaboratively to ensure we meet our environmental and social outcomes. CAPP will offer the following virtual press conference hosted as a video webcast on a Cision platform to answer questions from media: When: Tuesday, November 9, 2021 ? 9:00 a.m. MST / 11:00 a.m. EST {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Speakers: Tim McMillan, President & CEO, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers Stephen Buffalo, President & CEO, Indian Resource Council of Canada {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Video webcast: Media is required to register with HYPERLINK elisabeth.besson@capp.cain {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) represents companies, large and small, that explore for, develop and produce natural gas and oil throughout Canada.

Canada's environment minister worked hard Wednesday to ensure any leaks about a controversial Atlantic oil project weren't coming from his office. Questioned about media reports of his ministry's impending approval of the Bay du Nord offshore drilling project while testifying Wednesday before the Commons Natural Resources committee, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault kept his responses nebulous. Asked by committee member and NDP MP Charlie Angus if the media reports were true, Guilbeault simply stated that no official announcement had been made. Norwegian energy company Equinor is behind the $12 billion megaproject - located about 500 km off the shore of St. John's, N.L., northeast of the Hibernia and Terra Nova offshore drill sites on Newfoundland's Grand Banks and Jeanne d'Arc Basin. Estimates say the deepwater project could produce 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and over its lifetime would yield at least 300 million barrels. On Wednesday, CTV reported approval of the project would be announced later that day after financial markets had closed. In a contentious exchange, Angus expressed his surprise at the news - telling Guilbeault he didn't recall reading anything in the government's climate plans about approving new oil projects. Guilbeault responded by admonishing Angus for not paying closer attention to government policy. "If you'd have read the climate plan attentively, you would have seen that the plan rests on a number of data sources, including the last study from the Canadian Energy Regulator that forecasts an increase in production in Canada," he said. Angus kept on Guil beault, pointing out both this week's landmark report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as remarks from Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres accusing world leaders of not following through on their promises to deal with the climate emergency. "He said government leaders are 'lying,' and the response will be 'catastrophic,'" Angus said. "Would you feel the UN (secretary) general would have been unfair in saying that government leaders who came to COP26 to make these promises are lying, and then go back and it's business at usual?" Guilbeault disagreed, insisting his government is following IPCC guidelines by capping emissions and putting a price on pollution. News that Bay du Nord approval was imminent was not well-received by Canadian environmental groups. Climate advocacy group Environmental Defence described any potential approval of the project as a "slap in the face." "Approving Bay du Nord is another leap towards an unlivable future," said spokeswoman Julia Levin. National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2022 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

"The world is on a catastrophic pathway to 2.7 C of heating," said UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres. "There is a high risk of failure of COP26 ." COP26 starts on Saturday in Glasgow with more than 100 world leaders and 25,000 delegates in attendance, but much that should already have happened has not happened. The draft texts that are normally negotiated before such meetings are only half-done due to the pandemic. Neither China's President Xi nor President Putin of Russia is even showing up. This meeting is the last chance to keep average global temperature below 1.5 C. That target was adopted at the last summit in Paris in 2015 because it would avoid the most extreme storms, floods and heatwaves. It would also not trigger the "tipping points," where some feedback in the climate system causes a sudden lurch upwards in temperature. Reaching that Paris goal, however, would require a 45 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. That's not unthinkable if we treated this as an existential emergency - it's only five per cent a year - but the grim fact is that we have never yet managed to cut global emissions at all. "We are not going to get to a 45 per cent reduction," admitted a UN official who understandably wished to remain anonymous, "but there must be some level of contributions on the table to show the downward trend of emissions." Why would a conference full of highly educated, well informed and mostly well intentioned people behave like this? They're not wicked people, and almost all of them do know the truth. They just cannot afford to get too far ahead of the people they lead. A majority of citizens in almost every country worry about global heating, but dramatic change isn't possible because it hasn't reached their "pain threshold" yet. That phrase acquired its political meaning during the American war in Vietnam. The idea was that a gradually escalating U.S. bombing campaign would make the North Vietnamese government stop trying to reunite the country by force when the damage to North Vietnam reached its "threshold of pain." Operation Rolling Thunder lasted three years, but it never did find the Hanoi regime's pain threshold. Similarly, the accumulating damage to people and property done by various sorts of wild weather has not yet reached the population's pain threshold anywhere except for a few low-lying island countries that are already close to going underwater. It was always clear that the attitudes of people in the rich countries could not be shifted by images of other people in the global south suffering from climate-related calamities. Only when the catastrophes struck close to home would they take the message to heart - and frankly, many despairing climate activists were counting on that. On our current track, we will irrevocably commit to 1.5 C by 2029 or 2030, but the time lag with CO2 means that the immediate effects of even that abject failure might not be severe enough to shock a critical mass of people into action. So what can usefully be done while we wait for the heating to reach our collective pain threshold? The best hope at the moment is the Global Methane Pledge, whose supporters promise to cut their methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. Methane has accounted for at least a third of the warming so far, but it allows for a quick partial fix for two reasons. It stays in the atmosphere a far shorter time than CO2 - eight years instead of 200 - so emission cuts show quick results. And one source of methane in particular is cheap, low-hanging fruit: the fossil-fuel industry. Just stop flaring unwanted gas and fix all the leaks in almost three million kilometres of gas pipelines, and the 30 per cent cut is a done deal. Not only that, it will practically pay for itself, since you can burn the saved methane. It will produce carbon dioxide, of course, but that's a 200-year problem and we need results now. Almost 40 countries have already made the methane pledge, including the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Indonesia, Pakistan and Nigeria. We could even delay 1.5 C down into the 2030s, and something else might turn up by then. Grasping at straws, perhaps, but what's the better option?

A week after the Glasgow climate conference opened, 100,000 demonstrators marched to denounce the delegates as frauds who would not impose the revolution required in fossil fuel elimination to save the planet. The inevitable Swedish teenage climate protester Greta Thunberg called it, "Two weeks of business as usual: blah, blah, blah." Fortunately, she is correct: the Glasgow commitments are not binding and no one will pay any attention to them. Our government leaders are sufficiently intelligent to know that drastic reductions of carbon emissions are not, in fact, desirable, but they are not sufficiently courageous to tell the truth to the vast, brain-washed, brain-dead number of deluded climate alarmists who have bought into the bunk that the end is nigh. After the usual cavalcade of world leaders inflicted themselves on each other in what amounted to a competition to utter the most fervent and sanctimonious promises about fighting climate change, U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson fell asleep, and upon awakening, departed. The promise: "King Coal is dead." But coal powers about 60 per cent of the electricity generated in China and 70 per cent in India, and is a principal export of Australia; coal isn't going anywhere. An agreement of 190 "partners" was portentously announced to get rid of coal. Most of the partners weren't countries. Of the 77 new "partners," just 46 were countries, only half of those were newly enlisted countries and 10 of those don't actually use coal. The national signatories in this mighty new partnership only account for 13 per cent of global coal output. Joe Biden treated the world to the usual bunk about an imminent "existential threat" to all mankind. In the 1970s, the "science" predicted a new ice age was on its way. It all changed radically, and when the '80s came, oceans were dying, rising water levels would submerge whole countries and droughts were going to ravage large parts of the world. In 2006, Al Gore said the world would pass a "point of no return" by 2016. In 2009, he said that in all likelihood, the entire polar ice cap would melt away by 2014. Of course, none of this has happened. The fact that Joe Biden slept through these jeremiads should afford us some confidence that we are not yet near the end of our ecological rope. Virtually every aspect of this orchestrated hysteria about the environment except the determination to monitor and research vigilantly is nonsense. Even taking the temperature of the earth is a good deal more complicated than it sounds and requires thermometers and other sensors all over the world - in the atmosphere, on land and in the oceans. Determining the weight to give to the results returned by these thousands of temperature recording devices is prone to error. Insofar as we are able to measure it, the world's temperature has risen only 1 C in the last 120 years. This inconvenient fact is apparently the principal reason that the hysteria about "global warming" gave way to the only slightly more composed universal disconcertion about "climate change" - a strategic retreat necessitated by the fact that the world is not growing warmer at a pace that poses the existential threat many climate alarmists would have us believe. Leftist politicians and commentators have taken to attributing almost all unusual phenomena to the climate: U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has represented virtually every tropical hurricane that has struck the United States for the last 20 years as a direct result of man-made changes to the climate, and the Democratic politicians of the western United States unfailingly impute to the same sinister source all forest fires, though most of them are generated by the imprudent left-wing policy of not removing dead trees, as they become tinder that can be ignited even by lightning. The current U.S. secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, even blamed the collapse of a condominium in Florida earlier this year on the climate. This levitation of public alarm over a phenomenon that has been way overblown is maintained by an unusually broad coalition of interests that promote it: from authentic traditional conservationist organizations venerating every aspect of the environment, from birds and bees to trees and all air and water, to the faddish left that is oppressed by guilt if not propelled by altruism, to the cynicism of the militant left that, having been rebuffed as Marxists in the Cold War, did a quick ideological costume change and returned to centre stage wielding ecology as a battering ram against capitalism in the name of saving the planet. At the Glasgow conference, government leaders have engaged in a fierce competition in dire dramaturgy over the "existential crisis." Two of the declared conference goals at Glasgow were achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century and assuring a commitment of the designated rich nations to give $100 billion a year to the designated poor nations so they may combat climate change. All of this is unutterable nonsense and impenetrable hypocrisy. Carbon dioxide is essential to the process of photosynthesis and to life itself. The effort to cut carbon emissions in half, as many countries have pledged to do, is undesirable in itself, and could only be achieved by the practical destruction of the petroleum industry, which is a great source of income for Canada. Such a policy is needless social and economic self-mutilation for this country. Of course we must continue to pursue cleaner air and water but that is entirely reconcilable with careful and vigorous oil and natural gas production and use. The whole concept of requiring the economically developed world to give $100 billion a year to the economically underdeveloped or mismanaged countries of the world is absurd. I believe in development assistance and the wealthy nations of the world certainly should assist less prosperous countries but in projects that generate economic growth and raise standards of living and are given in a proper spirit of fraternal internationalism, not an inundation of falsely extorted Danegeld that will be squandered in the boondoggles of phantasmagorical pseudo-environmentalists.

Some 30,000 heads of state, environmental activists, business leaders and journalists are expected to descend on Scotland on Sunday for a climate summit that comes as world leaders are running out of time to break away from fossil fuels and prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming. Climate scientists say this year's United Nations conference is critical if the world is to hold rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Beyond that threshold, the dangers posed by extreme heat, floods and wildfires increase exponentially. But the challenges are immense. Chinese President Xi Jinping is not expected to attend in person, despite running the country that ranks first in the world for carbon emissions. India, Russia and Australia, all major fossil-fuel producing countries, have not announced more ambitious goals to slash emissions, as is expected of all countries this year. Though the climate summit is held annually, diplomats and scientists say the decisions made in the next two weeks will be the most important since the Paris agreement of 2015. While many believe getting leaders together in the same room is key, hopes for a major breakthrough are dim. Whether the summit succeeds depends on global leaders' willingness to go beyond the progress they've already made and pledge further emissions cuts. What is COP26 The 26th gathering of the Conference of Parties, or COP26 for short, is unlike other global summits that are restricted to only the wealthiest and most powerful countries. Each year, this conference brings together the 197 nations and territories that signed onto the original 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the first global agreement to recognize the threat that human behaviour could pose to the climate. This year, the conference is being held in Glasgow, Scotland, from Sunday to Nov. 12. Leaders come to COP with their own ambitions, but the summit's overarching goal this time is to build off the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to report on their progress cutting emissions and to announce new climate targets every five years. The UN has no ability to enforce these pledges, and many countries have fallen far short of their promises. But peer pressure can be a powerful tool. Who will attend? There are essentially two conferences happening. The first is the official diplomatic meeting attended by more than 100 heads of state and their delegations who will conduct negotiations over emissions targets and financial assistance to help poorer countries cope with climate change. Outside of the diplomatic "blue zone" - so-named for the blue-coloured badges required to enter areas where intergovernmental talks are taking place - a second conference attracts the leaders of multinational corporations, bankers, celebrities and climate activists who hope to get face time with world leaders or at least their representatives. Leonardo DiCaprio, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are among those expected to attend. What are the disagreements? The fiercest debates will centre on whether wealthy countries are putting forward climate pledges that are ambitious enough to change the world's current trajectory, which is heading toward roughly three degrees of warming by 2100. China, in particular, is under pressure to put new limits on its domestic coal consumption. Though the country pledged to stop financing the construction of coal-fired power plants overseas, it continues to approve new ones at home that will ensure it burns a lot of coal for decades to come. Recent power outages and coal shortages have made it unlikely that China's leaders will abandon coal any time soon. Australia, one of the top producers of coal and gas, recently announced that it will pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison has balked at raising the country's emissions reduction goal for 2030 and is facing criticism for putting forward a plan that environmental advocates view as weak and overly reliant on new technology and consumer behaviour, rather than legislation. Money is also a recurring source of tension. Rich nations responsible for the bulk of the greenhouse gas emissions causing global warming have promised for decades to set aside money to help poorer countries transition away from fossil fuels and adapt to climate change. In 2009, the U.S. and other developed nations agreed that by 2020 they would provide $100 billion (U.S.) a year to developing countries, which are among the most affected by climate change. But wealthy countries have fallen short, failing to raise more than $80 billion annually. Just days before the start of the summit, Canadian and German diplomats announced they might be able to raise the money by next year and expressed confidence they would meet their commitment by 2023. How the group plans to make up for shortfalls is unclear. How much can COP26 really affect climate change? If the next two weeks result in a series of detailed climate pledges from countries responsible for the majority of carbon emissions, then the conference could have a huge effect - especially if countries follow through on those promises. But experts in international climate negotiations say that regardless of what happens in Glasgow, most of the work of pivoting away from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy will continue to be done at the national and local level rather than through international diplomacy. For this reason, the details of net-zero emissions targets announced by business and civic leaders before and during these conferences are closely scrutinized. "Ultimately, what really matters in most of the world is what happens inside companies," said David Victor, a professor of international relations at UC San Diego. "They're watching this whole process for direction of travel." Los Angeles Times \</doc>

In these last few days of the climate crisis summit in Glasgow, it's worth asking if this milestone gathering has yielded anything but cynicism. Significant achievements have been made at the COP26 summit. But as often happens at landmark gatherings of world leaders, protesters denouncing the event as a sham have obscured progress achieved by the delegates. COP26 has already been dismissed as a bust by cynics demanding a rapid end to fossil-fuel investment and use. That is an impractical goal, of course, given that the world still relies on fossil fuels for about 84 per cent of its energy needs. Yet COP26 Many of those are advancements on existing reforms and some are unprecedented. First, the further progress on earlier reforms. The work on existing reforms includes tighter co-ordination among governments, corporations and independent research bodies to better ensure that agreed-upon decarbonization targets are met. That work tends not to earn headlines, but it is the essence of summitry, which strives to achieve global consensus on proposed and achieved reforms that were developed by a host of reformers between summits. COP26 , who have long considered climate crisis as the greatest threat to the global financial system and thus to the world economy, have been pitching "stress tests" for financial institutions. The tests would determine if banks, insurers, pension funds and other financial asset managers have adequate capital to cushion the blow to their investment portfolios from devastating damage caused by global warming. That type of precautionary planning was successfully used in the early 2010s to prevent a recurrence of the catastrophic Wall Street meltdown of 2009 that put tens of millions of people out of work in North America and Europe in the resulting Great Recession. The tests are not a limited exercise in protecting the wealth of financial tycoons, as the cynics have described it. They are aimed at preserving the vast portion of the world's financial assets held by pension plans like the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and its hundreds of counterparts worldwide. Another overarching topic at COP26 has been guarding against "greenwashing," when enterprises aren't sincere in their stated goals of reducing their carbon footprint. That is best achieved with new, demanding standards of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reporting that are more consistent and comparable than the markedly different ways in which environment, social and governance (ESG) performance is measured among reporting institutions today. In the years since the Paris climate accords of 2015, proposed rigorous reporting standards have been developed among regulators and groups advocating for greater corporate and government transparency. Among those are new sets of strict disclosure standards proposed separately by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the International Financial Reporting Standards agency, which oversees accounting in most parts of the world. Canadian investors in the multitrillion-dollar market for ESG products today cannot be certain that they are comparing apples and apples in making investment decisions. Delegates at COP26 have begun the process of knitting those many proposed best-disclosure rules into a global standard. That initiative is long overdue. Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, has warned of the current "deficit of credibility and a surplus of confusion over emissions reductions and net zero targets, with different meanings and metrics." Jane Fraser, CEO of banking giant Citigroup Inc., told the COP26 summit that agreement on consistent sustainability standards "will make it much easier" for the bank's investing clients to commit to green projects. That "gold standard" on environmental performance reporting, as the COP26 delegates describe the goal they seek, would also prevent reported climate data from running afoul of traditional financial accounting rules. To this point, the candour of reporting institutions has been constrained by worries about the legal and regulatory liabilities to which they might be exposing themselves with full disclosure. Important as that work is, COP26 will be best remembered for its unprecedented advances. For instance, Canada and about two dozen other countries have committed to ending government financing of fossil fuel projects abroad in 2022. Not by 2030, but by the end of next year. At COP26 , the U.S. and Britain have sponsored a new fund to raise $500 million a year from the global private sector to finance the transition to clean energy worldwide. Additional governments are expected to sponsor similar funds, as the profit potential from clean tech becomes clearer. The challenge now is to co-ordinate the clean-tech funds to guard against duplication of effort. There is a need for specialized funds that finance promising clean-tech startups, and others that invest in commercializing university research. Other funds will invest in projects by which low-income countries can transition to clean energy and build infrastructure that protects against climate-crisis risks. One of the boldest COP26 initiatives is a new coalition to fight climate change consisting of 450 banks, insurers, pension funds and asset managers with combined assets of $130 trillion (U.S.), or about 40 per cent of the world's financial assets. The coalition, called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), says it is prepared to finance about $100 trillion worth of clean energy projects over the next three decades. That's about two-thirds of the estimated total cost of $150 trillion to keep the average world temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. GFANZ was unveiled at COP26 on Nov. 3 by Mark Carney, the UN climate envoy, and former head of the central banks of Canada and the U.K. GFANZ is one of the largest pools of capital ever committed to a single purpose. Carney, who assembled the coalition, will continue to recruit more signatories. In his view, cash-strapped governments can't finance the clean-energy revolution. Carney vows to "ruthlessly, relentlessly" monitor coalition members for adherence to their pledges. Coalition members include financial behemoths Citigroup Inc., BlackRock Inc. and Allianz SE. Among the members of the coalition's Canadian contingent are Canada's Big Six banks and Vancouver City Savings Credit Union (Vancity). "The money is here," Carney told the COP26 summit, striking an optimistic note. "But that money needs net zero-aligned projects and (then) there's a way to turn this into a very, very powerful virtuous circle." COP26 has revealed that there is more private-sector money than previously thought to supercharge the shift to clean energy. And also, that there aren't enough green technologies, projects and companies in which to invest. That could change if entrepreneurs and engineers can be freed up from developing the latest slightly improved smartphones, from the untested virtues of exploring the "metaverse," and from space tourism to meet life-and-death challenges here on Earth. We can only hope. Twitter: @TheGrtRecession \</doc>

LONDON, Nov. 12, 2021 /CNW/ -- The NDC Partnership has today launched the Partnership Action Fund (PAF), with at-launch commitments of $33 million that members will be able to access in order to quickly respond to a developing country's needs. By pooling funds and making them readily available, the PAF enables a wide range of Partnership members to respond rapidly to country needs, with funding deployed to amplify members' impact. The new funding comes as the members of the NDC Partnership announced they are ready to mobilize hundreds of millions of dollars to support the needs of developing countries to fast track the implementation of their NDCs to tackle climate change through sustainable development. The Partnership brings together 197 members the NDC Partnership mobilizes 98 developing and 18 developed countries and 81 institutions. Members work together to create and deliver\'e2\€ \£fon\'e2\€ \£fambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to achieve the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. Commenting on the launch of the Partnership Action Fund, Minister Pearnel Charles Jr, Jamaican Minister of Housing, Urban Renewal, Environment and Climate Change Co-Chair of the NDC Partnership: "Now that the NDC ambitions of developing countries have been raised we must mobilize funding and resources at speed and scale to turn words into action through implementation. Through the membership of the NDC Partnership we have already helped to mobilize over $1 billion to support developing countries in developing and implementing their NDCs. But there naturally remain gaps in the support that can be provided, and we must make sure that no country is left behind. The Partnership Action Fund ensures that no stone is left unturned, and countries can access the technical support that they need. I call on all our members to be ambitious in your actions and align your programs with the needs of the countries." Full announcement available here. About the NDC Partnership The NDC Partnership bringstogether 196 Members, 115 countries - 97 developing and 18 developed - and 81 institutional members countries, to create and deliver\'e2\€ \£fon\'e2\€ \£fambitious NDCs that help achieve the Paris Agreement and theSustainableDevelopmentGoals(SDGs).\'e2\€ \£fGovernments identify their NDC implementation priorities and the type of support that is needed to translate them into actionable policies and programs.\'e2\€ \£fBased on these requests, the membership offers a tailored package of expertise, technical assistance, and funding. This collaborative response provides developing countries with efficient access to a wide range of resources to adapt to and mitigate climate change and foster more equitable and sustainable development.

GLASGOW, United Kingdom - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will push the world to negotiate a minimum price on pollution at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow today. Trudeau will start his second and final day at the annual climate negotiations by co-hosting a carbon pricing event where he will showcase Canada's carbon price as one of the most ambitious in the world. He started the first day with a speech calling on the rest of the world to follow Canada's lead and negotiate a global minimum carbon price. He compares the idea to the 15-per-cent minimum corporate tax more than 130 countries have now signed on to implement in a bid to stop big multinational corporations from avoiding taxes by funneling their profits through low-tax countries. Carbon pricing has been a political minefield in Canada, with opposing conservative provincial premiers taking the fight against one all the way to the Supreme Court, which upheld the program. The Conservative Party nationally, long an opponent of the policy as a "tax on everything," is now itself engaged in an internal debate about the merits. Leader Erin O'Toole promised to implement a version of a carbon price in the recent election with a rewards-card like system. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said Monday that he thinks this COP meeting could be the one which sparks the start of a real negotiation toward a global price on carbon. He said there is a level of interest in the idea that he has never seen before. "So is it a done deal?" he asked. "Absolutely not. Could Glasgow be the moment that we actually start working on developing something like that? I think it has the potential to do that." Canada's carbon price started in 2019 at $20 a tonne and is set to rise to $170 a tonne by 2030. The current price of $40 a tonne adds about 8.8 cents a litre to gasoline, or about $3.50 more every time you fill you car with 40 litres of gasoline. But rebate cheques are included with tax returns to make the program revenue neutral. The idea is that a carbon price shouldn't leave families with less money, but provide an incentive to find ways to cut down on fossil fuel use by making it cost more. It also applies to natural gas, propane, jet fuel, and any other liquid fuel, based on the weight of greenhouse gas emissions produced when that fuel is burned. Canada's national price only applies in provinces which don't have an equivalent provincial policy in place - Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick. A separate policy for big industrial emitters uses the same price but is only charged on a portion of total emissions produced, rather than on the fuels those emitters buy to operate their machinery. The Citizens Climate Lobby says there 64 carbon pricing policies in place around the world, including a direct price on carbon emissions, and cap-and-trade type systems. More than two dozen are national policies, and the rest are subnational including state or provincial governments in the U.S. and Canada, and cities like Tokyo. The United States and Australia are the only two fully developed economies without some form of carbon pricing.

OMAR SACHEDINA: Good evening, everyone. As Canadians acclimate to a mid-autumn chill on this first day of November, world leaders in Scotland are at a high stakes summit to tackle a warming planet the United Nations warned we're hurtling towards a climate catastrophe, and that humans are digging their own graves by not acting fast enough. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau referenced this summer's record breaking temperatures in British Columbia at the global gathering. The province's coroner revealed today 595 people died because of extreme heat, the vast majority, 526 in late June and early July, when temperatures exceeded 40 degrees Celsius. CTV's senior political correspondent Glen McGregor is in Glasgow tonight with the urgent fight and the friction. GLEN MCGREGOR (Reporter): A parade of world leaders delivered the same dire warnings. BORIS JOHNSON (British Prime Minister): It's one minute to midnight on that doomsday clock, and we need to act now. JOE BIDEN (US President): Will we seize the enormous opportunity before us, or will we condemn future generations to suffer. MCGREGOR: In Glasgow, the historic city that saw the birth of the industrial revolution that began warming the world, leaders from more than 100 countries are under pressure to hit targets promised five years ago in Paris when they agreed to reduce emissions by 2030. Canada is a smaller player on this larger world stage. In brief remarks, Justin Trudeau used the example of the fire that destroyed a BC town after a record heat wave this summer. JUSTIN TRUDEAU (Canadian Prime Minister): What happened in Lytton can, and has, and will happen anywhere. How many more signs do we need? This is our time to step up, and step up together. MCGREGOR: Today his government announced it's acting on an election campaign promise to limit methane emissions from the energy sector. TRUDEAU: That's no small task for a major oil and gas producing country. It's a big step that's absolutely necessary. MCGREGOR: The government will consult with its net zero advisory panel on setting five year emission caps. STEVEN GUILBEAULT (Environment Minister): We are the only major producer of oil and gas in the world to have made such a commitment. MCGREGOR: Environmentalists, though, were disappointed. They say emissions from the production of oil and gas are only a small part of the damage caused by the use of fossil fuels. DALE MARSHALL (Environmental Defence): We need to stop investing in new oil and gas, and we need to stop approving projects. That's what Canada needs to do, starting today. MCGREGOR: Trudeau says Canada is also pledging more money to mitigate climate change in poorer countries, and help phase out the use of coal. But with the leaders of major emitters China and Russia not even attending this conference, there's lower expectations about getting the rest of the world onside to deal with a global crisis, Omar. SACHEDINA: All right, Glen McGregor in Glasgow. Load-Date: \~November 2, 2021 \</doc>

As the world moves on from the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, the signs of our predicament are everywhere. Where I live, torrential rains have flooded towns and valleys, stranding and killing people and animals, wiped out roads, bridges and railways and cut land access to Vancouver. A state of emergency was declared. Horrific memories of summer heat domes and wildfires are still fresh. This is a small corner of the world. But the signs are everywhere. We should never consider this as some kind of  new normal, and we must do everything we can to prevent it from getting worse. In light of that, was COP26 just more \' blah, blah, blah,\' or will it help us avert catastrophe? International gatherings and agreements are important but they alone aren\' t enough. COP26 was intended to finalize the Paris Agreement and get countries to accelerate climate action this decade. It\' s all proceeding as intended, but things get watered down during negotiations, and many of the agreed-upon measures are voluntary. Most world leaders are sincere in recognizing climate disruption for the crisis it is, and in wanting to address it. But until they recognize the urgent need to radically shift course and halt all new coal, oil and gas development, we\' ll continue to face ever-accelerating risks from flooding, heat, drought, wildfires, human displacement and more. Although many countries made some progress, including reducing or eliminating methane pollution, cutting fossil fuel subsidies abroad and reducing coal, oil and gas production, they came up short in many areas. Funding to help countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts \- most of which contribute least to the crisis \- is inadequate. Along with lack of recognition for Indigenous rights, COP26 was an epic fail for climate justice. In many ways, the agreements increase divisions among rich and poor countries and civil society and corporate interests, worsening the situation for those losing their lives, homes and livelihoods to climate change impacts. Despite limited measures to curb fossil fuel subsidies, governments around the world, including Canada\' s, will continue to bolster the industry with tax and royalty breaks and things like infra- structure purchases. Despite its failings, the climate summit did get politicians, bureaucrats, corporate executives and others to agree on important goals. Our government has made strong commitments. We need to make sure those words are backed with effective action, and we need to push for better. Canada must work quickly to update its climate plan, cap and ratchet down oil and gas emissions and develop a blueprint for a managed production decline. To confirm a true change in direction, our country must sign on to the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance and end public finance for oil and gas subsidies abroad by 2022. Canada must also bring in just transition legislation without delay to ensure workers affected by the necessary energy shift are given support and opportunities. Canada may only contribute around two per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions (not counting those from others burning the products we sell or producing abroad the products we buy), but we have the third-highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita, the third-largest known oil reserves and we\' re the world\' s fourth-largest oil exporter. What we do matters. COP26 and the Paris Agreement are part of the solution, but we need so much more. David Suzuki is a scientist, broadcaster, author and co-founder of the David Suzuki Foundation.

OTTAWA - Canada has two "very heavy weeks" ahead as the government gears up for negotiations at the United Nations climate change conference, says Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault. International officials are set to meet in Scotland starting Sunday as they try to ramp up efforts to curb global warming, with the risk of failure hanging over their heads amid mounting tensions over unmet funding promises. Guilbeault saidhe is "cautiously optimistic" about how talks will progress, citing a joint report from Canada and Germany this week that they expect rich countries to step up on a pledge to provide developing nations with $100 billion US in annual aid to tackle global warming - a decade-old commitment that has so far fallen short. "That being said, it's not always enough to show up. We can't always agree," he said at a virtual news conference Friday. "These are difficult negotiations. Everyone is not necessarily ready to do more or do more faster," he added in French. The UN summit, known as COP26 and delayed one year by COVID-19, is intended to finalize the rule book for the Paris accord, including how carbon emissions trading can work between countries and what each country has to report about progress toward climate goals. Major hurdles remain. Emissions from the burning of oil, coal and natural gas have continued to rise, except for a small dip due to the pandemic. Over the next decade, countries are slated to emit at least 28 billion more tonnes of carbon pollution each year than the cap required to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 C, a UN report said this week. The Trudeau government vowed in April to slash Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels within the next decade, aided by its carbon pricing regime. In the recent election campaign, the Liberals also pledged to reduce the oil and gas sector's methane emissions by 75 per cent below 2012 levels. On top of these promises, Guilbeault pointed to Canada's co-chairing with Germany of the UN task force on how to meet the summit's goal of massive climate funding for poorer states. "The international community had very little faith in us, and I think that is clear evidence that the situation has changed," the freshly appointed environment minister told reporters in French. The former Greenpeace activist noted he had been to many previous UN climate conferences, where he said Canada did not play a prominent role. Conservative MP Michelle Rempel Garner said Friday the country needs policies that help spur economic growth and lower greenhouse gas emissions in a way that "leaves no one behind." "Justin Trudeau could have appointed an environment minister that understands this point. Instead, Justin Trudeau appointed an ideological antienergy activist," the Calgary MP said in a statement, claiming that Guilbeault has fought "to shut down entire industries." NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called on the Liberal government to axe fossil fuel subsidies and raise its emissions reduction target for a second time this year to 50 per cent. The world's wealthiest countries failed to meet a 2009 goal to provide the developing world with $100 billion US in climate aid by 2020 - and won't get there for another two years, a new analysis showed Monday. The news threatens to cast a pall over the climate talks in Glasgow, which run this weekend through Nov. 12. \</doc>

COP26 is bearing down on us like a deadline for a major assignment - and we're the student who has frittered away the entire term. Now it's six hours to midnight and we have a sketchy outline, some useful notes from our nerdy roommate, and a big mug of coffee. Our intentions may be good but we've made the assignment a lot harder on ourselves. And while, yes, an extension may be possible, a deadline concentrates the mind wonderfully: there's still just enough time to do what we need to do - so long as we're smart, ambitious, and determined. Of course, the stakes are much higher in Glasgow than simply flunking a class. The IPCC report that came out in August made this crystal clear: Global warming is happening faster than expected. It's driving extreme weather on every continent. And the tipping points that would trigger far more destructive consequences are looming closer. Too many people living in Canada are already experiencing first-hand the destruction caused by climate change: floods, fires, heat waves. And because Canada is warming, on average, twice as fast as the rest of the world, the consequences of continued warming would be catastrophic. We are, quite literally, in the hot seat. To put it simply: action in Glasgow is imperative because a lot of people are going to die if we fail. This summer, 569 British Columbians died because of a heat wave, and that's climate change just getting started. The WHO predicts that climate change will kill at least 250,000 people a year after 2030 if nothing is done to dramatically reduce carbon pollution. Millions of people do not have to die. Getting serious at COP26 in Glasgow, rather than delaying another year or another decade, will translate directly into lives saved. Because here's the most important thing about this moment we're in, the autumn of 2021: the worst impacts of climate change can be still avoided, if we act fast. It's not too late to change course - though we are in a rapidly closing window. Projections in the IPCC report show with a high degree of certainty that if we hit net zero emissions globally by 2050, we could still limit warming to 1.5 C, avoiding catastrophic tipping points. The scientific consensus is clear: the faster we reduce our emissions, the cooler the planet will remain. But it gets a lot harder from here. Like the student with the big assignment and the looming deadline, we know now that we should have started working on this project ages ago. We should have started reducing our emissions in the 1990s, or even before, when we first began to grasp "the greenhouse effect," and what it would mean. In a recent analysis, climate scientist Zeke Hausfather makes the point that, "If emissions had peaked back in 2000 we would be skiing down a bunny slope toward 1.5 C. Today we face a double black diamond, and in a few years it will be a cliff." If saving lives isn't a sufficient incentive for Canada to make real change in Glasgow, what about jobs? Runaway climate change threatens Canada's prosperity: it's hard to hold down a job when your house has been destroyed by a wildfire, or to keep your business running when a flood sweeps through your town. Since 2010, the costs of weather-related disasters and catastrophic events have amounted to about five to six per cent of Canada's annual GDP growth, up from an average of one per cent in previous decades. And as an export-driven economy, Canada faces a sink-or-swim decade as the world rapidly decarbonizes. It's inevitable that we're going to see trillions of dollars in global investment moving away from high-carbon sectors. Canada doesn't want to be the guy behind the counter at Blockbuster, watching movies on his phone and wondering why the place is empty. Of course, climate-change policy, and climate itself, is not a light switch, or a pass-fail course. No one single event will change our planet's trajectory. But COP26 in Glasgow is, without question, a pivotal moment for Canada and the world. With a new federal government just elected on a clear and strong platform of accelerated climate change commitments, a new minister of environment and climate change, and a ticking clock, now is the moment for Canada to chart a more ambitious course.

Over the past decade, the global elite's obsession with climate change has taken away from the many other major problems facing the planet - shown most dramatically by the invasion of Ukraine. Western European leaders should have spent the past decade diversifying energy sources and expanding shale gas, instead of shutting down nuclear plants and becoming scarily reliant on Russia. But the looming war is far from the only thing they have managed to ignore. The biggest task facing humanity today remains lifting most of the world out of abject poverty. This can only happen by providing poor countries with comprehensive, reliable energy sources. That's how the rich world became prosperous, and it is how China lifted almost a billion out of poverty. Yet, while the world's rich countries are overwhelmingly powered by fossil fuels, the elite has worked hard to make these energy sources both more expensive and less available( HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/19-countries-plan-cop26-deal- https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/19-countries-plan- HYPERLINK cop26 -deal- end -financing-fossil-fuels-abroad-sources-2021-11-03/ ) for the world's poorest. Right now, we're still recovering from the worst pandemic in a century. Inflation, supply shortages, and possibly even recession loom over the global economy. Autocracies are reasserting themselves, while food crises are already being experienced by the most vulnerable. Tuberculosis, malaria and malnutrition - each effectively handled in the rich world - still claim millions of lives each year across poor countries. Yet major donors and development organizations have become increasingly focused on climate solutions instead. One month after Ukraine was invaded, the head of the United Nations - an organization focused on ensuring world peace - was instead warning( HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1114322 https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1114322 ) about "climate catastrophe( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1505914097262637058 https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1505914097262637058 )," and the "mutually assured destruction( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1505992640843685899 https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1505992640843685899 )" that fossil fuel "addiction" could cause. So how have the elites managed to get things so wrong? One reason is that for years, the media has portrayed climate change impacts as horrendous. Today, almost every natural disaster routinely gets blamed on the climate crisis, with every new hurricane held up as another exhibit of man's folly. Yet, hurricanes killed many more people in the past( HYPERLINK https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone ). A major scientific paper( HYPERLINK https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL095774#:~:text=Damage%20increases%20are%20largely%20due,and%20South%20Pacific%20TC%20activity https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL095774#:~:text=Damage%20increases%20are%20largely%20due,and%20South%20Pacific%20TC%20activity . ) from last month documents "decreasing trends" in global hurricane frequency and strength. The data shows that last year the world experienced fewer hurricanes than ever before( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/BjornLomborg/status/1482384323013709831 https://twitter.com/BjornLomborg/status/1482384323013709831 ) in the satellite era, and their combined strength was one of the lowest( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/BjornLomborg/status/1482384333029752840 https://twitter.com/BjornLomborg/status/1482384333029752840 ). The real impact from climate change is much more nuanced. The UN climate panel of scientists finds( HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/bjornlomborg/status/1329040799741456384 https://twitter.com/bjornlomborg/status/1329040799741456384 ) that a warmer world will mean fewer (good) but stronger (worse) hurricanes. In total, this will increase damages (bad), but because the world will also get richer and more resilient, relative damages will keep declining( HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378019300378 ), just slightly more slowly. This is a problem that we mustn't ignore. But it is far from a catastrophe. Global climate damage in per cent of GDP keeps declining and climate disaster deaths have dropped 99 per cent( HYPERLINK https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-activists-disasters-fire-storms-deaths-change-cop26-glasgow-global-warming-11635973538 https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-activists-disasters-fire-storms-deaths-change- HYPERLINK https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-activists-disasters-fire-storms-deaths-change-cop26-glasgow-global-warming-11635973538 cop26 -glasgow-global-warming-11635973538 For the best sense of what to really expect from a warming planet, we should turn to the damage estimates from the models used by President Joe Biden's Administration, and president Barack Obama's before that to set climate policy. This research reveals that the entire global cost of climate change - not just to economies, but in every sense - will be equivalent to less than a 4.0 per cent hit to GDP( HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162520304157 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162520304157 ) by the end of the century. Bjorn Lomborg: If you think today's energy prices are high, wait until net-zero( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/opinion/bjorn-lomborg-if-you-think-todays-energy-prices-are-high-wait-until-net-zero ) Bjorn Lomborg: IPCC global warming report is more chill than you have read( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/opinion/opinion-ipcc-global-warming-report-is-more-chill-than-you-have-read ) Bjorn Lomborg: Climate change and deaths from extreme heat and cold( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/opinion/bjorn-lomborg-climate-change-and-deaths-from-extreme-heat-and-cold ) Remember, by the UN's own estimates( HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378016300681 ) the average person in 2100 will be 450 per cent as rich as today. Global warming means she will be "only" 434 per cent as rich( HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162520304157 ). This is a problem, but - contrary to the histrionics - far from catastrophic. For wealthy countries, the narrow focus on climate objectives undermines future prosperity. The world already spends more than half a trillion dollars( HYPERLINK https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/ https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/ ) annually on climate policies, while rich-world government spending on innovation in such areas as health care, space, defence, agriculture and science has been declining as a percentage of GDP over recent decades( HYPERLINK https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/01/16/the-case-for-more-state-spending-on-r-and-d https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/01/16/the-case-for-more-state-spending-on-r-and-d ).

ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Energy ministers from across the developing world gathered in the emirate of Abu Dhabi on Monday and stressed the need for continued investment in fossil fuel production  a message just days after these same nations joined around 200 countries in accepting a compromise deal aimed at limiting rising global temperatures and curbing greenhouse emissions. Energy ministers from two key OPEC nations  the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia  pointed to the rising price of natural gas and the energy crunch this has created in Europe and China as examples of what happens when demand outstrips supply. They say this has raised the price of energy across the board, impacting oil prices now hovering around $80 a barrel.  After almost a decade of under-investment in our industry, the world has sleepwalked into a supply crunch. It is time to wake up, said Managing Director and CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company Sultan Al-Jaber. The remarks came at the start of the annual Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference. Al-Jaber argued over $600 billion annually will need to be invested in the oil and gas industry until 2030  just to keep up with expected global demand. Al-Jaber, who is also chairman of Abu Dhabi\' s renewable energy firm Masdar, said that while a future run on renewable energy is coming  it is not here yet and the world is still heavily reliant on oil and gas. President Joe Biden's administration, while rallying nations to shift away from burning fossil fuels, has simultaneously called on OPEC to increase production as prices climb for consumers at the pump, including singling out Saudi Arabia. Major oil producers in the OPEC+ group have so far refused to veer from their gradual approach of restoring production levels slashed amid the pandemic of 2020. UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei told The Associated Press that the OPEC+ group, which includes Russia and other non-OPEC oil producers, is relying on independent technical data that shows there will be a surplus of oil early next year. In 2022, in  the first quarter, we will have a surplus of supply than the demand," he told The Associated Press at the ADIPEC conference.  The balance will not be negative, (it) will be positive.  There is always a dialogue. I don\' t think the media is tagging it with the right name. It\' s called dialogue and discussions, he told journalists in Abu Dhabi. The deal reached in Glasgow, Scotland on Saturday by nations around the world contained a last-minute change that watered down crucial language about coal. Several countries expressed disappointment by the change promoted by India to  phase down, rather than  phase out coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, told the audience in Abu Dhabi that his nation was a the forefront of the energy transition and seemed to try and suggest India wasn't behind that change in wording. He also brushed aside criticisms of India's pledge to reach net-zero by 2070, which skeptics have described as making a mockery of the global effort to cut emissions.  Our per capita consumption of energy compared to global averages is about one-third, he said, but added the figure is quickly rising amid India's population boom and economic growth. Puri warned against an energy transition that results in unrealistically high costs for consumers. He said it was important that the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi was being held just after the COP26 summit in Glasgow so focus can be on  both on what the reality on the ground is and the need to manage the transition. \</doc>

Two months after the dreadful sham of COP26 , Western governments are still in denial about what actually happened: Net Zero's magical thinking met unyielding global energy realities and it lost, leaving the Paris Accord's climate ambitions withering on the vine. Ignore hyperbole and meaningless pledges and decode instead: India's "Net Zero-sure-but-only-in-2070," the deliberate, glaring absence of key political leaders, China's dictating the closing communiqu\'e9's impotent "phase down." Glasgow's message is unequivocal: governments representing a majority of the world's population put Western "climate leaders" on notice that the sustained use of hydrocarbon energy, which is indispensable for economic prosperity and political stability, is no longer up for discussion. Climate adaptation, not mitigation, is the new direction of travel, with the developing economies leading the way. As if to presage this message, in the months before COP26 , wind power's intermittency helped cause Europe's deepest energy crisis since 1945, rapidly causing global shortages and geopolitical flashpoints. This structural crisis continues to cause runaway energy costs for households and industry, bankrupting utilities, even as soaring LNG costs shutter Europe's fertilizer production, jeopardizing food security. The EU, faced with the spectacular failure of its market-distorting climate policies, straight-facedly reclassified LNG and nuclear as sustainable green energy. Just before COP26 In the United States, meanwhile, the Biden Administration's radical climate promises encountered reality checks throughout 2021. Sweeping emissions proposals that would have required closing 1,800 hydrocarbon-fuelled plants quickly evaporated. Wind power's catastrophic failure in Texas disrupted key industries across the country. In short order, 20-odd states secured injunctions to block Washington's anti-hydrocarbon policies, while warning financial institutions that their ESG rules put billions in state business at risk. Build Back Better climate provisions were throttled en route to the Senate, effectively dooming the entire Net Zero agenda. And mere days before COP26 , the world witnessed the spectacle of a hapless American president imploring OPEC+ to keep U.S. gas prices down by upping the cartel's output. The remarkable aboutface in Europe and Japan, the broadly entrenched opposition to climate policies in the United States and above all the developing economies'emphatic endorsement of hydrocarbons, together signal an inexorable transformation of the global energy landscape, relegating Net Zero to practical irrelevance. At COP26 After Glasgow, Net Zero's impact on voters has become impossible to ignore. Facts are stubborn things, and despite decades of alarmist messaging, voters are coming to realize that invariably doom-laden climate "science" is often political and that climate catastrophes are not unfolding as foretold. People's good sense is insulted when politicians and media routinely blame every conceivable weather event on man's climate sins. As people realize how directly Net Zero will hit them, they shorten their horizons. They also recoil as progressive politicians condone radical climate protesters breaking the law and manipulating the regulatory system to further their ideological goals. They increasingly understand that lofty climate theory jeopardizes indispensable economic development, threatens entire communities across key industries, impacts jobs and livelihoods and fuels inflation. Climate politicians beware: elections are won or lost in voters' wallets. Sooner or later, our politicians will need to accept that, post-Glasgow, they no longer have an internationally sanctioned rationale for radical anti-hydrocarbon politics, and that Canada, deeply dependent on its American, Asian and European economic ties, has no realistic option but to adapt to rapidly evolving global energy realities. Canadian governments are no longer in a position to pursue a dogmatic climate crusade without further jeopardizing Canada's international competitiveness and continued prosperity. When crucial partners around the world are fully focused on their energy-sourcing priorities we should not need a weatherman to tell us which way the wind is blowing - nor when in Western Canada the overwhelming majority of elected Indigenous leaders view long-term participation in a vibrant energy economy as a key contributor to prosperity for their peoples. Fulfilling those aspirations includes securing access to rapidly expanding Indo-Pacific markets for our energy resources. Post-Glasgow, Canada's energy assets will be even more valuable. Any government ignoring that reality risks provoking not just electoral pushback but national instability. This time jeopardizing the West's economic aspirations could inflame Indigenous and non-Indigenous sentiments in unison. The post-Cold War order that Western democracies have taken for granted is fracturing, with new alignments rapidly changing global dynamics, in particular where access to energy is at issue. A key concern for all advanced economies is politicians'inability to recognize the speed and extent of the shifts. Canada, in particular, is dangerously adrift, with no meaningful institutional understanding or credible political leadership to guide it through these defining changes. It took politicians years to finally abandon the moribund Kyoto Protocol. How long it will take them to deal with Glasgow's new realities and move Canada towards coherent adaptation policies that recognize hydrocarbons as an indispensable, longterm energy source and a cornerstone of our national prosperity, time will tell. The overarching question is how much damage high-minded political obstinacy will have done by then.

Will the BC NDP government's just-released climate action plan - dubbed "Roadmap to 2030" - gain much attention at the COP26 gathering in Glasgow? B.C. has one of the most ambitious and detailed plans to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and even further reductions in years after that. Things like raising the carbon tax, building more transit, increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles, reduction targets for methane and oil and gas emissions, and stricter rules for large industrial development are key parts of B.C.'s plan. The plan has the backing of a fair number of environmental groups and climate scientists, but it has also been scorned by others for not going even further and bringing in a road map that doesn't just look to 2030. View From The Ledge Yet, the NDP's position on fighting climate change reflects the needs of any government to balance taking action to curb greenhouse emissions with growing the economy. Many other world governments and leaders will be among the 20,000 or so people expected to gather in Glasgow for 12 days and nights of meetings, reception, politics and protests. I suspect most (if not all) of them will similarly take the position that their economic self-interest remains a top priority, even while tackling a complex task such as fighting climate change. Still, it is encouraging so many governments (and business executives and Hollywood celebrities) are getting together to focus on the most pressing issue of our time. Framed against that ambitious gathering is the fact the big GWG emitters like China, India, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Australia remain steadfast in their plans to essentially keep doing what they are doing, And many of these countries sing from a completely different song sheet when it comes to cutting emissions. For example, while 38 gigawatts of coal plants were closed last year in the U.S. and Europe, China is about to open 39 gigawatts of new plants. It all adds up to a maddeningly frustrating exercise that will likely result in no consensus being reached in Glasgow. But that doesn't mean governments of various stripes can't make some progress on their own. B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman is heading a small government delegation in Glasgow and I would not be surprised if he does not meet up at some point with Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, who ran for the presidential nomination on the climate change issue and who will also be in Glasgow. Inslee advocates working with other governments beyond a federal-federal partnership. Might we see some kind of joint B.C.-Washington state partnership down the road when it comes to fighting climate change? The various action plans and road maps lay out markers and targets that are off in the distance, as in years away. And more often than not the targets are often not met, thus making them less and less credible over time, at least in the eyes of some. Yet the need for them has never been more important. Let's see how B.C.'s plan fares in Scotland. Keith Baldrey is chief political reporter for Global BC. HYPERLINK keith.baldrey@globalnews.ca \</doc>

While reading an essay by American artist and writer Susan Cross recently, my thoughts went to the just-concluded COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. There, leaders from 200 countries gathered in the latest international effort to pull the world back from the brink of climate Armageddon. Cross'essay, from her book A Fleeting Presence, is about Neanderthals. Citing archeological evidence, Cross says popular culture's portrayal of Neanderthals as dim-witted, knuckle-dragging clods is wrong. Homo neanderthalensis was actually a very successful species of hominid, Cross says. They prospered in an inhospitable paleolithic environment with multiple ice ages. They hunted large game, ate a variety of plants, cared for the disabled, buried their dead, crafted stone tools, decorated themselves with shells and possessed some form of language. But here's what Cross says is especially important about Neanderthals, and why they have something to teach us about planet-friendly, sustainable living. Neanderthals endured for 250,000 years. That's 25 times as long as we, Homo sapiens, have been tilling the soil, manufacturing widgets and flirting with self-annihilation and planetary destruction. Neanderthals possessed "an immense contentment," Cross says, "a hard thing for a Homo sapien to comprehend." Hard, because we're captive to a "restless mind." We're obsessed with progress, profit and consumption. Unlike what Cross believes about Neanderthals, we don't know when enough is enough. Our obeisance to the growth imperative comes at a high cost. We've become chronically addicted to fossil fuels, the leading cause of global warming. "Keep 1.5 alive" was the COP26 's unofficial slogan. It means countries must commit to reducing global fossil-fuel emissions to net zero by 2050 - the date by which the UN has said further emissions will mean global average temperatures will rise at least 1.5 degrees C. above pre-industrial levels. Business as usual, climate scientists warn, will take the Earth up to and beyond 3 degrees C. of excess heating before this century's end, spelling planetary catastrophe. Opinions on what was achieved at COP26 are varied as an Internet search will reveal. But on the most critically important issue - hard commitments and rapid action to reduce fossil fuel emissions - many global environmental groups gave COP26 a failing grade. Leaders were criticized, for example, for not going far enough to reduce reliance on the world's dirtiest fuel, coal. China, India, Australia and other large coal burners blocked a tougher stance on coal emissions. There was some good news. There were important commitments to curtailing emissions of the especially potent greenhouse gas, methane. Some 100 countries pledged to begin restoring the world's seriously depleted forests by 2030. And 45 governments vowed action to shift to more sustainable ways of farming and growing food. Youth leaders attending the civil society segment of the conference were frank with their disappointment. Taking to her official handle on Twitter, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg wrote, "The # COP26 is over. Here's a brief summary: Blah, blah, blah." Referring to low-income countries that stand to suffer most from climate change, Kenyan youth leader Elizabeth Wathuti said, "The leaders'hearts, minds and decisions were not with us." Perhaps like Thunberg, Wathuti and other youth, Cross yearns for a simpler, more earth-centered time. "I'm tired of noise. I'm tired of artificial light. I'm tired of rapid and repeated change. I'm tired of progress. Tired of novelty. I'm tired of growth, growth, growth," she writes. Cross likes to imagine what is possible in a world kindled by "the immense continuity" of the Neanderthal way of life. She wonders whether her desire for an intact earth, daily living at a more relaxed pace and societies that place the spiritual above the material don't all flow from a Neanderthal lineage. Many of us carry Neanderthal DNA in our chromosomal strands. Neanderthals did go extinct. But the convergence of natural planetary events seems to have been the cause. Aggression by Homo sapiens may have contributed. I doubt whether global leaders attending COP26 had Neanderthals in mind. Maybe they should have.

As direct emissions continue to rise, the quarterly MSCI Net-Zero Tracker reveals publicly listed companies will burn through their 1.5\'c2\'b0C emissions budget within five years of COP26 MSCI releases the top 10 publicly listed companies with the largest footprint of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions NEW YORK - The Paris Agreement climate targets are increasingly out of reach as the world's publicly listed companies will cause global temperatures to rise by 3\'c2\'b0C, according to the latest MSCI Net-Zero Tracker( HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msci.com%2Four-solutions%2Fclimate-investing%2Fnet-zero-tracker&;esheet=52507175&;newsitemid=20211012005339&;lan=en-US&;anchor=MSCI+Net-Zero+Tracker&;index=1&;md5=a5b7164e7fea62a75f24a78bd3b0583b https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msci.com%2Four-solutions%2Fclimate-investing%2Fnet-zero-tracker&;esheet=52507175&;newsitemid=20211012005339&;lan=en-US&;anchor=MSCI+Net-Zero+Tracker&;index=1&;md5=a5b7164e7fea62a75f24a78bd3b0583b ). With less than 10% of public companies aligned with a 1.5\'c2\'b0C temperature rise threshold, the global carbon budget to limit global warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C will be exhausted by November 2026. This timeframe has moved forward by five months in just 90 days since the launch( HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msci.com%2Fdocuments%2F1296102%2F26195050%2FMSCI-Net-Zero-Tracker.pdf&;esheet=52507175&;newsitemid=20211012005339&;lan=en-US&;anchor=launch&;index=2&;md5=db0bd60b696bccb17454738034990380 https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msci.com%2Fdocuments%2F1296102%2F26195050%2FMSCI-Net-Zero-Tracker.pdf&;esheet=52507175&;newsitemid=20211012005339&;lan=en-US&;anchor=launch&;index=2&;md5=db0bd60b696bccb17454738034990380 ) of the Net-Zero Tracker in July. Henry Fernandez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, MSCI, comments: "The findings of the MSCI Net-Zero Tracker should dramatically increase the world's sense of urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As the extreme weather events of 2021 have reminded us, climate change is not a 'potential' problem 30 or 40 years down the road. It is a clear and present danger to our way of life right now. What we do over the next half-decade - and especially at COP26 in Glasgow - could make the difference between avoiding or experiencing the worst climate impacts. We urge firm action rather than words at COP26 to divert the world from an imminent crisis and chart a path toward a sustainable future." Emissions set to rise by 6.7% in 2021 The rapidly shrinking timeframe is being driven by the significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions from public companies as global economic activity rebounds. No sector or region is safe The Net-Zero Tracker also finds that less than half of listed companies are aligned with a 2\'c2\'b0C temperature rise. No sector or region is aligned with the 2\'c2\'b0C target. Even low emitting industries such as health care, information technology and financial services have outliers consuming a disproportionate share of their industry's remaining budget. From a regional perspective, although companies in developed economies are projected to become more carbon-efficient this century, every region is still emitting in excess. The problem is most extreme in Emerging Markets (EM) EMEA, where the implied temperature rise of listed companies is 4.8\'c2\'b0C, followed by EM Americas and EM Asia, which are set to rise by 3.8\'c2\'b0C and 3.4\'c2\'b0C, respectively. To address this, companies need to cut their absolute carbon emissions by 10% a year on average. However, from 2016 to 2020, less than a quarter of the world's publicly listed companies managed this feat. Major gaps in disclosure of emissions - the laggards revealed As investors and policymakers seek new levels of transparency on emissions, the latest Net-Zero Tracker shows: Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Gazprom PAO and Coal India Limited are the top three listed companies with the largest carbon footprint Shaanxi Coal Industry Company Ltd is the largest emitter to not disclose any of its greenhouse gas emissions GlaxoSmithKline plc, H&;M Hennes &; Mauritz and \'c3&;#8240;lectricit\'c3\£9 de France S.A. are listed in the top 10 companies that have published the most thorough emissions-reduction targets Gazprom PAO, A.P. M\'c3\'b8ller - M\'c3\£6rsk A/S and Toyota Industries Corporation reported additional scopes in the previous quarter and are now reporting all company emissions across most of the relevant categories (i.e., Scope 1, 2 and 3) Remy Briand, Global Head of ESG and Climate at MSCI, adds: "While it is encouraging that some of the world's largest listed companies are taking important steps by broadening their emissions reporting and setting decarbonization targets, the Net-Zero Tracker shows that major gaps still remain as many are failing to disclose this crucial information. Climate disclosures are critical for investors to help them assess the carbon intensity of companies, to model climate-related financial risk and the impact on the performance of portfolios, and to allocate capital accordingly. Without accurate disclosures, the chances of companies and investors reaching net-zero is a distant reality. We call on policymakers and financial regulators at COP26 to make climate-related disclosures based on international standards mandatory." About MSCI Inc.

At COP26 in Glasgow, signatories to the Paris Agreement increased their collective ambition enough only to limit warming to 2.4 degrees Celsius, a far cry from the goal of 1.5 degrees C beyond which the world is in store for much greater suffering and potential tipping points. Still, the COP26 outcome has significant implications for Canada. First, Canada must commit to deeper emissions reductions. Countries agreed to build on the momentum from COP26 by returning with greater ambition next year, but there is a big gap to fill. Post- COP26 , projected emissions in 2030 will be double what is needed for a path to 1.5 degrees C. International emissions trading rules finalized in Glasgow may offer a more cost-effective way to go beyond a 45-per-cent reduction in 2030. However, reliance on international credits risks delaying Canada's economic transition and hindering future competitiveness. If Canada embraces international trading, reliance on international credits by governments or firms should be limited to reductions beyond 45 per cent. Canada also must disallow pre-2020 credits, which lack credibility. Second, Canada must increase our contribution to global climate finance. Wealthy countries failed to fulfill their pledge to deliver $100 billion per year to developing countries by 2020. While progress was made on adaption funds for low-income countries, which suffer disproportionate impacts from warming we caused, at COP26 wealthy countries failed to make good on their promise, and continued to resist financing for unavoidable loss and damages. Emissions growth is now disproportionately coming from developing countries, led by electricity generation from fossil fuels. Having prospered by taking advantage of inexpensive fossil fuels, it is both a moral obligation and in Canada's self-interest to support a cleaner development path for low-income countries. Third, COP26 Fourth, the path emerging from Glasgow presents a stark warning for Canada's oil and gas exports. A recent International Energy Agency report projected global oil and gas demand under different scenarios. Under an existing policy scenario, corresponding to 2.7 degrees C of warming, the agency projects that Canada's oil exports would grow by 700,000 barrels/day by 2030 before declining thereafter. This is a baseline for comparison rather than a prediction, as it is implausible that there will be no policy change. IEA's announced pledges scenario, equivalent to 2.1 degrees C, anticipates that Canada's oil exports would decline by 2030, the only country's to do so. Canada's bitumen is especially vulnerable in a contracting global market because it is both more emissions-intensive to extract and more emissions-intensive to refine at destination. The 2.4 degrees C outcome of COP26 falls between those two scenarios, but net zero pledges and sectoral announcements in Glasgow offer a pathway to 1.8 degrees C to be locked in at COP27. The implication is that we have reached a tipping point for Canada's oil exports. There is of course no guarantee that countries will fulfill their promises of climate action. But if Canada counts on that in continuing to produce fossil fuels for export, we should not kid ourselves: We're betting on a frightening future for our children and grandchildren.

BRASILIA, Brazil (AP)  Brazil\' s President Jair Bolsonaro and Environment Minister Joaquim Leite both knew the Amazon region's annual deforestation rate had surged before the U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, but kept results quiet to avoid hampering negotiations, according to three Cabinet ministers who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Data from the National Institute for Space Research's Prodes monitoring system released Thursday showed the Amazon lost 13,235 square kilometers (5,110 square miles) of rainforest in the 12-month reference period from August 2020 to July 2021. That\' s up 22% from the prior 12-month period and the worst in 15 years. The three ministers as well as a coordinator at the space institute that compiles the data, all of whom spoke with the AP on condition of anonymity due to concern about reprisals, said the annual deforestation report was available on the government\' s information system before talks in Glasgow began on Oct 31. Six days before that, at a meeting in the presidential palace, Bolsonaro and several ministers discussed the 2020-2021 deforestation results and determined they wouldn\' t be released until after the climate conference, said the three ministers, two of whom were present. Later that same day, the government launched a program to promote green development. Official speeches resembled a dress rehearsal for efforts to project responsible environmental stewardship at Glasgow after two years of historically elevated deforestation. One of the two ministers who participated in the earlier meeting said the decision to withhold data was part of a strategy to recover environmental credibility abroad. This wasn\' t an intent to lie, the person said, but rather a means to highlight positive developments, particularly year-on-year declines seen in preliminary deforestation data for July and August from the so-called Deter monitoring system. Bolsonaro highlighted that same data when speaking at the U.N. General assembly in September. The Deter system in the two months since, however, has shown significant year-on-year increases. Deter data is released monthly and considered a leading indicator for complete calculations from the more accurate Prodes system, which is based on clearer images and released once yearly. Prodes generally tracks with the Deter data. Following release of the Prodes data on Thursday, Leite told reporters that the data doesn\' t reflect the government\' s heightened engagement in recent months. He led the Brazilian delegation to the U.N. climate summit. Bolsonaro, who has long championed development of the Amazon including the mining of Indigenous territories, skipped Glasgow altogether after attending the Group of 20 meeting in Rome. The press offices of the environment ministry and presidency didn\' t respond to AP emails asking when Leite and Bolsonaro were made aware of the 2020-2021 deforestation data, nor why its publication was delayed. In Glasgow, Leite announced Brazil\' s commitment to zero illegal deforestation by 2028, up two years from the prior goal, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030 as compared to 2005 levels. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry welcomed the announcements.  This adds crucial momentum to the global movement to combat the #ClimateCrisis, Kerry posted on Twitter.  Looking forward to working together! The latter goal has generated criticism that a recent change made to the nation\' s 2005 baseline means the supposed stepped-up commitment is roughly equal to a previous pledge. Leite also met with dozens of negotiators from other nations during the summit, seeking financing to expand Brazil\' s environmental protection capabilities. He repeatedly said developed countries need to contribute significantly more funds to poorer nations to aid their effective transition to greener economies. The summit ran until Nov. 12. Following release of the Prodes data on Thursday, the report\' s Oct. 27 date instantly drew the attention of environmental watchdogs who had accused the government of greenwashing during COP26 .  There should be sanctions. Brazil assumed a posture of lying during COP, trying to sell itself as a sustainable country, but deforestation is out of control, Cristiane Mazzetti, forest campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil, said by phone.  We had already sounded the alert before that leaders shouldn\' t buy the empty promises of a government that has acted proactively to weaken environmental protection. The episode also underscores a lack of transparency and the dismantling of environmental governance, according to Izabella Teixeira, a former environment minister under the Workers\' Party that opposes Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro spoke about deforestation during a live broadcast on Facebook on Friday evening, conceding that illegal deforestation occurs, but on a far smaller scale than reported by media.  We combat that. Some say \' Ah, but you have to combat more.\' Do you know the size of the Amazon? How can you take care of all that? the president said. He also said the solution is  simple : other nations not buying illegally felled timber from Brazil. \</doc>

Remember how bad B.C.'s wildfire season was this year? If somehow you'd forgotten, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reminded the world at the United Nations'climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday. In his address to the annual global festival of climate alarmism, Trudeau evoked the tragedy of Lytton, B.C., the small Interior community that was largely destroyed by a sudden flare-up during an intense heatwave in June this year. "What happened in Lytton can and has and will happen anywhere," Trudeau warned. Well, not exactly. Yes, British Columbia had a bad year for wildfires, but what about Alberta? We're right next door. If this were truly a global, permanent trend (and not merely a periodic regional phenomenon), wouldn't we likely have had a bad year, too? But we didn't. We had slightly more wildfires than in an average year, but they burned only about one-sixth as many acres as usual. Lots of little fires, not much damage. Hurricanes? While Atlantic hurricane season doesn't officially end until Nov. 30, there have been only six hurricanes this year and the latest one was in mid-September. Tornadoes? Fewer than average. But what about all those fires in California? Local and international leaders, like Trudeau, claimed they were signs of dangerous climate change. Then how to explain the fewer fires in Montana, Colorado, Idaho and other forested, mountain states? A roaring wildfire that consumes timber and houses makes for better news than a non-fire. Severe weather events that confirm the climate change alarmism get coverage. Statistics that don't feed the fear don't make headlines. But facts are unwelcome in Glasgow. As happens every year at these mega gatherings of world leaders, bureaucrats and environmental activists, the 25,000-plus participants are there to show how "woke" they are, not to find solutions. Far more virtue-signalling than solution-finding will occur, which is why it is the perfect venue for Trudeau. (P.S. For any Albertan who remained unconvinced that the federal Liberals are out to get Alberta, Trudeau announced Monday in Scotland that his government will impose a hard-andfast emission cap on Canada's oil and gas sector beginning immediately. No new development, no project expansion. At the same time, there will be no similar limits on Ontario's auto sector or Quebec's agriculture industry. Just oil and gas.) Trouble is, the extremist climate pledges of Trudeau and his "woke" counterparts from other countries, such as Britain's Conservative PM Boris Johnson, are easy to make but hard to follow up on with real-world policies. Yet rather than scaling back the rhetoric and looking for plausible solutions, Trudeau and Johnson and the others simply bang their gongs louder. As if the problem with past pledges was lack of volume rather than fanciful thinking. On Monday, Alberta's UCP government announced $176 million towards 16 projects that the government hopes will remove seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2030 - the equivalent of the emissions from electricity for 4.5 million homes. (There are 1.5 million homes in Alberta.) Included in the 16 real-world projects is money to allow CN Rail to convert some of its diesel locomotives to zero-emission hydrogen and a grant for a Calgary-based, Indigenous-owned concrete and asphalt recycling company to turn contaminated soil from construction sites into stone and sand building products. But like the Liberal versus Conservative vaccine mandates, the COP26 unreality will prevail in media coverage, elite opinion and social media, just as tough, absolutist talk about ironclad vaccine mandates does. There is no way hysterical climate alarmism will solve emissions problems. But climate extremism and "woke" speeches make better political theatre than practical solutions, so "progressive" politicians and commentators will continue to push alarmist junk rather than rational solutions. \</doc>

World leaders turned up the heat and resorted to end-of-the-world rhetoric Monday in an attempt to bring new urgency to sputtering international climate negotiations. The metaphors were dramatic and mixed at the start of the talks, known as COP26 . British Prime Minister Boris Johnson described global warming as "a doomsday device" strapped to humanity. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres told his colleagues that humans are "digging our own graves." And Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, speaking for vulnerable island nations, added moral thunder, warning leaders not to "allow the path of greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction." Amid the speeches, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his coal-dependent country will aim to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2070 - two decades after the United States and at least 10 years later than China. Modi said the goal of reaching "net zero" by 2070 was one of five measures India planned to undertake to meet its commitments under the Paris climate accord. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel avoided soaring rhetoric and delved into policy. "There's no more time to sit back," Biden said in a more measured warning that also apologized for his predecessor's decision to temporarily pull the U.S. out of the historic 2015 Paris agreement, something he said put the country behind in its efforts. "Every day we delay, the cost of inaction increases." One of the United Nations'biggest concerns is that some countries are more focused on amorphous long-term net-zero goals instead of seeking cuts this decade that could prevent temperature increases that would exceed the Paris goal. Modi also outlined shorterterm goals for the world's thirdbiggest carbon emitter: raising its goal for non-fossil-energy production, meeting half of its energy needs with renewable sources, cutting carbon emissions by 1 billion tons compared with previous targets and reducing the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% - all by 2030. While 2070 sounds far off for India's pledge, four outside experts from think-tanks and universities said India's new short-and long-term goals are significant, while not huge, because of that nation's development status. Ulka Kelkar, who directs India climate policy analysis for the World Resource Institute, said a lot depends on details, but the 2070 goal would be similar to the U.S. and Europe adopting net-zero goals 20 years ago. Still, European officials privately expressed disappointment at India's late target, but declined to comment publicly. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen touted already announced efforts to make Europe "the first net-zero continent" in the long-term and cut emissions 55% in this decade. She pushed for other rich countries to aid poorer nations as much as Europe does and put a price on carbon emissions because "nature cannot pay that price anymore." Bolivia President Luis Arce said the speeches from developed countries sought to portray them as climate change leaders "but this is far from the truth." He said rich nations need to face their historic responsibilities for causing the warming problem and not fix it by forcing rules on poor countries. The real solution, he said, "is an alternative to capitalism" and "unfettered consumerism." Johnson pointed out that the 130-plus world leaders gathered for the leaders'summit portion of the conference had an average age of over 60, while the generations most harmed by climate change aren't yet born. "Change is not going to come from inside there," Thunberg said. "We say no more blah-blahblah." The conference aims to get governments to commit to curbing carbon emissions fast enough to keep global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. The world has already warmed 1.1 C. Current projections based on planned emissions cuts over the next decade are for it to hit 2.7 C by the year 2100. Increased warming over coming decades would melt much of the planet's ice, raise global sea levels and greatly increase the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather, scientists say. With every tenth of a degree of warming, the dangers soar faster, they say. The other goals for the meeting are for rich nations to give poor nations $100 billion US a year in climate aid and to reach an agreement to spend half of the money to adapt to worsening climate impacts. But Mottley, of Barbados, warned that negotiators are falling short. "This is immoral and it is unjust," Mottley said. "Are we so blinded and hardened that we can no longer appreciate the cries of humanity?" "We are already gasping for survival," chimed in President Wavel John Charles Ramkalawan of the Seychelles, another island nation. "Tomorrow is not an option for it will be too late." Guterres struck an equally gloomy note. "We are digging our own graves," said the UN secretarygeneral. "Our planet is changing before our eyes - from the ocean depths to mountaintops, from melting glaciers to relentless extreme weather events." The speeches will continue through today, then the leaders will leave. The idea is that they will do the big political give-and-take, setting out broad outlines of agreement, and then have other government officials hammer out the details. But what will be noticeable are a handful of major absences. Xi Jinping, president of top carbon-polluting nation China, is not in Glasgow. In addition, the heads of Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa are skipping Scotland. That leaves Modi the only leader present from the so-called BRICS nations, which account for more than 40% of global emissions. \</doc>

Ontario Farmer Ottawa -While the COP 26 conference on reducing global carbon emissions didn't receive many rave reviews for its usefulness, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture thinks it provided some benefit for the agrifood sector. The conference in early November in Glasgow focused on international action to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Although its conclusion produced lots of pious calls for action from government leaders, no clear way forward emerged from it. However the Canadian Federation of Agriculture said there were encouraging signs that leaders recognized the farming sector can play a useful role in reducing carbon and methane emissions while enhancing their land's ability to be a carbon sink. "While COP 26 has received its fair share of criticisms, CFA believes that global agriculture is one of the primary and most powerful solutions to climate change. It is only through sharing, collaboration and a great deal of work that the world can come together to make real progress towards these goals." "Farmers are deeply invested in lowering their emissions, and strive to become a net-carbon sink through sustainable technologies and practices," CFA said. "But, like all ambitious goals, this will require support, infrastructure and immense collaboration to achieve." Farmers around the world face challenges producing food because of climate change, which makes their task "more difficult, unpredictable and costly. We recognize that at this moment agriculture is a large emitter, but we also know our industry has the unique ability to become a natural-climate-solutions provider and be a powerful ally in the fight against climate change." Farm groups from several other countries spoke to a panel during the conference about agriculture's ambition to deliver food security, resilience and mitigation in a changing climate. In the end, the Glasgow declaration at the end of the conference included a call to implement and redesign policies to promote and reward sustainable agriculture. CFA said, "This should significantly increase public and private investment into sustainability. It should also improve accessibility to those investments." Also figuring in the conference was the Kronovia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA), produced by various national farm organizations, which identified how agriculture can help reduce GHG emissions. "Through the KJWA, countries agreed to work together to make sure that agricultural development ensures both increased food security in the face of climate change and a reduction in emissions," CFA said. \</doc>

With the United Nations COP26 climate change summit scheduled for November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland, Sir Richard Attenborough was recently appointed "Peoples Advocate" by the British government. In that capacity, he addressed G7 leaders a few weeks ago, stating: "Now we are on the verge of passing tipping points, boundaries that, once passed, will unleash irreversible and self-amplifying change." Attenborough's sentiments were taken directly from his latest Netflix production, "Breaking Boundaries," released in early June, a documentary devoted to an outdated "tipping points" theory that has no basis in reality. Marketed as entertainment, it was an unforgettable gutpunch delivered by the renowned BBC broadcaster in a joint Netflix/WWF production seen round the world. Attenborough implied that the climate change explanation was supported by science. I knew it wasn't. I called him out on it and I wasn't alone. A controversy ensued. Seven months later, the BBC corroborated my account. An episode of an Attenborough-narrated television documentary called Seven Worlds, One Planet revealed the extent and scope of the deception in the Netflix sequence. As I'd suggested, polar bears had chased the walrus off the cliff and the Netflix producers had known it all along. Attenborough probably did, too. However, he found the emotional impact of the falling walrus scene too politically powerful to waste. Attenborough shamelessly narrated six more documentaries with even more outrageous claims about the prophesied harm the world faced if climate change was not addressed immediately, and told members of the UN Security Council that climate change was the biggest threat to global security the world had ever faced. In short, he leveraged the dying walrus narrative to kick-start an uncompromising climate change campaign. It has been an astonishing spectacle to witness and it isn't over yet. For the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, Attenborough has become the U.K. government's purveyor of tipping points and warnings that "there is only a decade to act" and launch a new industrial revolution that will bring greater equality. "We have reached our own political tipping point," says Attenborough in a COP26 video, implying the planet is set to unleash irreversible and self-amplifying catastrophe. The tipping point message, however, was on shaky ground when climate scientists first trotted it out. Then two studies published in 2011 showed that despite fears, such inevitable "boundaries" do not exist for Arctic sea ice: the very low summer extent that occurred in 2007 was followed not by continued decline but a quick recovery. For good scientific reasons, the same thing happened after the record-low ice extent in September 2012. It's now 2021 and despite lack of evidence to support it, Attenborough and a few other vocal climate change activists continue to peddle this scary-sounding "tipping points" idea. As I explain in my upcoming new book, Fallen Icon: David Attenborough and the Walrus Deception, the unique alliance formed in 2015 between Netflix, the WWF, Silverback Films, David Attenborough and the BBC to produce "Our Planet" was an auspicious beginning. The Netflix and BBC documentaries that followed - all on the same theme, many with the same executive producers, all narrated by Attenborough and based on the WWF's version of science - were filmed over the same period and released to correspond with the next UN COP meeting scheduled for the fall of 2020. To their consternation, the COP26 got postponed to 2021 because of the pandemic, which meant they had to stretch out their propaganda an additional year. Seven documentaries or series episodes, from "Our Planet" to "Breaking Boundaries" were released, starting with the horrifying falling walrus scenes orchestrated by the WWF and ending with what is essentially an advertisement for the "tipping points" concept that Attenborough is now pushing ahead of COP26 . When he agreed in 2018 to present the deceptive and emotionally manipulative falling walrus film footage as evidence of climate change - so typical of WWF promotional material but out of character for him - Attenborough seems to have abandoned his journalistic principles to achieve a political objective. Attenborough is not an advocate for the people, as he claims: he is an advocate for the climate change movement. Financial Post Susan J. Crockford is a zoologist and author of The Polar Bear Catastrophe That Never Happened, and Fallen Icon: David Attenborough and the Walrus Deception, coming later this summer. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

Some would say it was rather apt that the start of the COP26 climate conference was beset by extreme weather that left delegates facing train cancellations and long queues in the rain for security passes. Those arriving two days before the official start of the Glasgow climate conference suffered travel problems as wet weather meant trains were cancelled north of Preston and ticket-holders from London were re-routed via Edinburgh. Yesterday morning, Avanti West Coast trains to Glasgow were cancelled because of speed restrictions, with trains slowing to 5mph in key sections after heavy rains and rising water washed two bridges away in Scotland. Saleemul Huq, director of Bangladesh's International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said he had been delayed for two hours travelling between Edinburgh and Glasgow for COP26 on Thursday. "I got a stopping train that took ages to get into Glasgow. The driver kept apologizing for the delays and the floods. It was severe delays, that's all, but it did disrupt my ability to meet people and get into meetings on time," he said. He warned fellow delegates to "bring galoshes and weatherproof clothes", adding: "Any extreme weather event, like the floods around Glasgow right now, can credibly be attributed to have become more severe than usual because the global temperature (has risen more than) 1C since the industrial revolution due to emissions of greenhouse gases since then. There is no longer a purely natural event anymore."

Pita Ligaiula, a journalist at the Pacific News Service, said he had been forced to wait in the rain to register for the event. "They are not allowing any cars near the venue and we have to walk in the rain for about five to six minutes, plus there is no tent for us when it rains. Coming all the way from the Pacific, I thought the organizers should have done better," he said. !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

After Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made multiple policy announcements across the pond at the COP26 climate summit in Scotland, a new poll hints at how Canadians feel about those developments. Sixty-nine per cent of respondents to an online survey by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies say they support Canada's announcement at the summit that it will cap and reduce pollution from the oil and gas sector toward net zero by 2050. Some 65 per cent of respondents also say they support the government's new policy to stop exporting coal by 2030, a move which would end the trade abroad of about 36 million tonnes of the resource, currently 60 per cent of what the country produces. Sixty-one per cent also support Canada's recent policy announcement that it will halt subsidies that assist oil and natural gas companies to run and grow their operations outside the country by the end of 2022. Despite general agreement on these issues, Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque says Canadians from fossil fuel-producing regions including Saskatchewan and Alberta tend to agree less on policies related to climate change because those changes directly affect their economies. Meanwhile, respondents from Quebec led the other provinces in their support of Canada's recent climate policy commitments, followed by British Columbia. "In regions like B.C. or Quebec, we see that the level of agreement with reducing production and pollution is always higher because it doesn't directly affect the economy," said Bourque. He added one of the reasons why Quebec agrees more with these climate-related policies has to do with broad consensus in the province on reducing the use of fossil fuels. "There's no opposition to that. There's no voice that's speaking on behalf of the industry that's clearly being heard," Bourque said. Canadians were split on how they rate the country's effort to address climate change, with half agreeing that Canada has taken great strides and 40 per cent disagreeing. The survey also asked Canadians to share how their perception of climate change more generally. Three in four respondents said they believe there is still time to put measures in place to stop climate change, a rate that is about on par with a cohort of American respondents who answered the same question. Asked about how they feel about climate change, younger respondents report higher rates of stress compared to older cohorts, with 38 per cent of those aged 18 to 34 saying they are "very stressed." Those surveyed were more mixed on former environmental activist Steven Guilbeault's fitness as Canada's environment minister, with almost half saying he's a good choice and a third saying they don't know. Bourque said he was surprised there was not more resistance from respondents to Guilbeault's nomination, because the poll question mentioned the minister's past as a Greenpeace activist. "Even when we include that into the question, people are either waiting to pass judgment or don't see really much of a problem with it," said Bourque.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau left the COP26 climate summit on Tuesday touting Canada's record on climate change, but he was unsuccessful in getting other countries to follow Canada's lead on a carbon tax. Trudeau made several high-profile commitments at the leaders'portion of the summit, which ended Tuesday. Following up on an election commitment, he promised to immediately cap oil and gas sector emissions, which are responsible for 26 per cent of national emissions, and require lower emissions in five-year intervals, starting in 2025. He also pledged to lower methane gas emissions from the energy sector by 75 per cent before 2030 and signed onto a global pledge to reduce deforestation. Trudeau said all countries should consider using carbon pricing to reduce their emissions. "We're making big decisions at home and encouraging people around the world to do more as well, as climate change doesn't recognize borders," he said. "We know there are many different approaches that every country is going to have to take to reduce emissions to decarbonize their economy to get to net zero. And carbon pricing is one of the most effective and cheapest ways to get there." Trudeau said only about 20 per cent of global carbon emissions are taxed, a figure he believes should rise to 60 per cent by 2030. But many nations, including heavy emitters India, China and the United States, have no tax on pollution. "We should be ambitious and say, as of right here today, that we want to triple that to 60 per cent of global emissions should be covered by a price on pollution in 2030," he said. The COP summit is an annual event with the goal of getting countries around the world to reduce their carbon emissions so the Earth doesn't warm by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Over that temperature, it is feared humanity will not be able to avoid the worst implications of a warming planet, such as floods, droughts and massive wildfires. U.S. President Joe Biden chided Chinese President Xi Jinping for his decision not to attend in person. "It's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China - with respect to China not showing up," Biden said at a news conference. "The rest of the world is gonna look to China and say, what value added are they providing? And they've lost the ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at COP, the same way I would argue with regard to Russia." Biden has put an aggressive plan for climate change in front of Congress, but it doesn't include a carbon tax. India committed at the summit to be carbon-neutral by 2070, but hasn't offered a detailed plan on how it will achieve that goal. More than 100 countries joined a U.S.-and EU-led effort to cut emissions of methane 30 per cent by 2030 from 2020 levels. Trudeau said he is confident other countries will realize that carbon pricing is the easiest and most efficient way to bring down emissions. "As people look at the hard work of reducing emissions, they'll realize that not putting a price on pollution in their jurisdictions is going to mean having to do more, more expensively, in more complex ways, in other parts of their economy." He said the work the G20 recently did to set a minimum corporate tax proves that countries coming together to solve a common problem is possible. "A few years ago, nobody would have even imagined that we could set a global minimum corporate tax. Suddenly we have." The Trudeau government's carbon tax began at $20 per tonne in 2019 and will eventually rise to $170 per tonne by 2030. The current price of $40 a tonne adds about 8.8 cents a litre to gasoline, or about $3.50 more every time you fill your car with 40 litres of gasoline. The prime minister insisted that the increase will lead to consumers making more energy-efficient choices and companies introducing more electric vehicles and other carbon-neutral products. The Liberals committed during the election to look at carbon border adjustments, which would see higher polluting countries pay more to import their goods into Canada. He said it only makes sense that countries would have to pay more if they are competing against Canadian firms with higher environmental standards. "We are right now competing with aluminum from around the world that can be sold at even cheaper prices, because it is done in dirtier ways with significantly lower labour standards." Trudeau also said nuclear energy can be a significant part of Canada's green transition, as well as the transition for other countries. New Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault was asked about his support for nuclear on Monday and he didn't endorse the energy source. He said that renewable energy like wind and solar were coming down considerably in price. Conservative MP Dan Albas said the minister should have been clear in his support. "Conservatives believe that nuclear energy is essential to lowering GHG emissions in Canada and taking action on climate change. By failing to clarify his position, Minister Guilbeault calls into question the safety and relevancy of nuclear energy and the countless Canadians that it employs," he said in a statement. Trudeau said he fully supports the work being done in several provinces on small modular nuclear reactors and believes the world should look at all zero-emission energy sources. "We're going to need every different alternative to be pursued and explored fully as we try to get off fossil fuels," he said. "Canada has a strong history in nuclear and we will continue to look at all ways to make sure we're preventing this planet from hitting the catastrophic climate change level." !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Sun Media Corporation.

By Beh Lih Yi KUALA LUMPUR, June 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United Nations climate chief said on Thursday a "significant amount of work" remains to be done ahead of November's COP26 summit in Britain, with developing nations warning issues of finance and vaccine inequity could derail a successful outcome. At the end of three weeks of mid-year climate talks, held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Patricia Espinosa called on countries to overcome their differences and work together in the remaining months before the key COP26 negotiations in Glasgow. She said governments had "engaged effectively," despite the challenges of virtual working, and made advances in several areas, including common time-frames for emissions-cutting goals and transparency in how countries report their climate action. There are still divisions on the rules governing how global carbon markets will work, the U.N. climate body noted - and higher-level political guidance will be needed, Espinosa said. Efforts would continue to "ensure maximum progress before COP26 ," she added. "So much is at stake," said the top U.N. official. "I urge us to rise to the challenge of our time, to get the job done, to overcome our differences, to fulfill our promises." The June talks were the first official U.N. climate negotiations to be held since the end of 2019, due to delays caused by the pandemic. The COP26 "We must achieve success at COP26 ," Espinosa told journalists on Thursday. "It is a credibility test for our fight against the climate emergency - it is central to a green recovery and it is an affirmation of multilateralism when the world needs it most." STUMBLING BLOCKS Many nations have yet to submit stronger climate action plans that were due last year under the Paris accord but thrown off course due to the pandemic. Emissions reductions promised by governments are still a long way from what is needed to meet the Paris goals of limiting global warming to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius and ideally to 1.5C above preindustrial times, the United Nations has said. But a failure by wealthy nations to deliver on longstanding climate finance pledges to help poorer, vulnerable countries shift to renewable energy and adapt to climate change impacts are casting a shadow over the U.N.-led process. The pandemic has also thrown another spanner in the works with many developing nations struggling to secure access to vaccines, after supplies were mostly bought up by rich countries. That means many delegates do not know whether they will be able to attend the COP26 summit in person. As the conference host, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this month his government was exploring with the United Nations how to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to accredited delegations who would be unable to get them otherwise. "The road to COP 26 remains nebulous - COVID-19 remains a serious concern for many of us," Diann Black-Layne of Antigua and Barbuda, representing the 44-member Alliance of Small Island States, told the closing session of the June talks. The group is also still waiting for major progress on climate finance, she added, calling for a "new, scaled-up finance goal" at COP26 for climate-vulnerable nations. Sonam P. Wangdi of Bhutan, who chairs the 46-member group of least developed countries at the U.N. talks, agreed that delivering on climate finance is "critical" to ensure success. Rich nations have come under fire for not yet meeting a promise to raise $100 billion a year from 2020 to help poorer countries tackle climate change. G7 leaders were criticized for not offering a clear roadmap on how that pledge would be met at a summit last weekend, although Germany and Canada committed fresh money. This month's U.N. climate talks did not produce formal decisions because of their virtual nature, with some delegates struggling with technical difficulties. To push the work forward faster, Alok Sharma, the UK official who will preside over COP26 , plans to bring ministers from more than 40 countries together in London in late July. Archie Young, Britain's lead climate negotiator, said he had heard "very clearly the desire for more clarity" on issues around vaccinations and logistical arrangements for COP26 . Sharma said London was working with partners on a plan to offer vaccines to all accredited COP26 delegates - including government officials, representatives of green groups and media - and he hoped to set out the details "shortly."

As world leaders gather in Glasgow this week for the COP26 summit on the global climate crisis, the absence of China's president, Xi Jinping, has not gone unnoticed. China's would-be president for life did not even deliver a speech by video. Instead, he sent a mere written statement bereft of any concrete commitments. There has been abundant speculation about why Xi hasn't travelled outside China for the past 21 months. The COVID-19 pandemic only partly accounts for this self-isolation. More to the point, Xi's absence in Glasgow can conceivably be attributed to his refusal to brush elbows with U.S. President Joe Biden and other members of the democratic camp. Indeed, doing so would suggest that Beijing is giving in to external pressure to adjust its policies, in light of how it has made collaboration with the United States on climate change contingent on Washington ending its criticism of China's destabilizing behaviour and domestic crackdown. Beijing's strongman is unyieldingly committed to a world view that has hijacked co-operation with the world's second-largest economy and rising superpower on matters that affect us all. Unless the West abandons its pressure on Beijing to act responsibly at home and abroad, the world will be taken hostage by a party apparatus that gives precedence to ideology over the universal good. Xi's star outside China has dimmed considerably in recent years, largely the result of Chinese military assertiveness in the East and South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, Beijing's coverup of the origins of the COVID outbreak, and its rampant human rights violations in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Hong Kong. There is no doubt, therefore, that Xi would have been an outlier - and perhaps even shunned - at Glasgow. And for the head of an ultra-personalistic authoritarian party-state, such humiliation cannot be countenanced. With China inflexible in its ideology and led by a president who cannot stand losing face on the international stage, the question arises as to whether the democratic camp, of which Canada is a proud member, might also want to consider making its chumminess with China more conditional. On matters of global - and vital - importance, such as climate change, all governments should be able to set aside their differences, and Ottawa should have no compunction in collaborating with Beijing on this issue even if we have serious differences over human rights, democracy and territorial ambitions. However, on matters of a less planetary scale, especially activities that serve as platforms to propagandize in favour of Xi's highly repressive regime, the democratic camp should really ask itself whether it wants to be complicit. If Xi is willing to let his ideological differences with the West get in the way of his country's participation in efforts to secure a decent future for the generations to come, then why should we, in the democratic camp, legitimize his dogmatism and authoritarianism by participating in the Beijing Winter Games - an event that the communist regime will assuredly exploit to the hilt to promote its disturbingly Orwellian system? By hijacking co-operation on combating climate change, Beijing seeks to condition us into abandoning the liberal-democratic rules of the game that have defined us for several decades. It wants us to be silent on the excesses of its ideology, and to look the other way as it subjects hundreds millions of its own citizens - ethnic minorities chief among them - to treatment that hearkens back to Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet Gulag. However much Beijing and its propagandists seek to discredit research into what has been going on in Tibet and Xinjiang, evidence of systematic human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing is now incontrovertible, the result of decades-long research by dozens of Western and Chinese academics and journalists. That, alone, should compel our governments to question the wisdom, and the very morality, of giving face to a regime that orchestrates such abominations. We can't afford not to combat climate change; but we can certainly afford to be a no-show at next year's despotic games. J. Michael Cole is a Taipei-based senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute and a former analyst with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. \</doc>

How are we to assess the outcome of COP26 in Glasgow? It would be reasonable to conclude that it was both triumph and disaster - triumph, in that some notable steps forward have been taken; and disaster, in that they fall far short of what is needed. It remains very doubtful whether our divided world can muster the will to tackle this challenge in the time left before the damage becomes unmanageable. Climate Action Tracker has provided a helpful summary of where we are: on current policies and actions, the world is set for a median increase in temperature of 2.7 C above pre-industrial levels; with the targets for 2030 alone, this would fall to 2.4 C. Full implementation of all submitted and binding targets would deliver 2.1 C, and, finally, implementation of all announced targets would deliver 1.8 C. Thus, if the world delivered everything it now indicates we would be close to the recommended ceiling of a rise of 1.5 C. Skepticism is fully justified. According to Climate Action Tracker, only the EU, U.K., Chile and Costa Rica now have adequately designed net zero targets. Announced improvements in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) since September 2020 will lower the shortfall in the reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases required by 2030 by just 15-17 per cent. More than half of this reduction in NDCs comes from the U.S., whose future policies are, to put it mildly, uncertain. New sectoral initiatives will lower 2020's shortfall in the reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2030 by 24-25 per cent. Announced reductions in methane emissions and deforestation would be particularly significant, if delivered. But the reduction in deforestation is doubtful. In any case, the shortfall stays large. Nevertheless, the picture is not entirely bleak. Net zero commitments now cover 80 per cent of total emissions. The 1.5 C ceiling is also a clear consensus. Another good signal is a joint declaration between the U.S. and China, since nothing can be achieved without these two countries. The final declaration also includes a commitment to "accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies." This is far too little. But it is a first in climate agreements. Yet, if the world is to make the recommended reductions in emissions by 2030, much more needs to happen. One possibility is new commitments in the followup COP, which will be in Egypt next year. This is to be the first of a series of annual high-level meetings in which countries will be asked to improve their promises. Another possibility is a more active private sector. On this, the main news is the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). According to Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and of the Bank of Canada, its aim is to "build a financial system in which every decision made takes climate change into account." GFANZ consists of the world's leading asset managers and banks, with total assets under management of US$130 trillion. In principle, the allocation of such resources toward the net zero objectives would make a huge difference. But, Carney notes, US$100 trillion is the "minimum amount of external finance needed for the sustainable energy drive over the next three decades." This is daunting. Needless to say, while it is possible to prevent businesses from doing profitable things, it is impossible to make them do things they consider insufficiently profitable, after adjusting for risk. If they are to invest at the necessary scale, there must be carbon pricing, elimination of subsidies to fossil fuels, bans on internal combustion engines and mandatory climate-related financial disclosures. But there must also be some way of getting vast amounts of private investment into the climate transition in emerging and developing countries, apart from China. GFANZ calls for the creation of "country platforms", which would convene and align "stakeholders - including national and international governments, businesses, NGOs, civil society organizations, donors and other development actors - ... to agree on and co-ordinate priorities." A big and controversial issue will be risk-sharing. The public sector should not take all the risks and the private sector all the rewards from the energy transition. Much attention is devoted to the failure of developed countries to deliver the promised US$100 billion a year in finance to emerging and developing countries. This is symbolically important. But, as Amar Bhattacharya and Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics note, it is small change: "Altogether, emerging markets and developing countries other than China will need to invest around an additional US$0.8 trillion per year by 2025 and close to US$2 trillion per year by 2030" on climate mitigation and adaptation and restoring natural capital. About half of this must come from abroad, mainly from private sources. Yet the official sector, too, must do more. In this context, it is a real pity that greater advantage is not being taken of the recent issuance of special drawing rights. Of the total allocation of US$650 billion, some 60 per cent will go to high-income countries that do not need it and a mere 3 per cent to low-income countries. It is planned to on-lend US$100 billion of this from high-income to developing countries. This should be far more, to help deal with the legacy of COVID-19 and the climate challenge. In sum, if we compare the global discussion today with that of a decade ago, we have come a long way. But if we compare it with where we need to be, there is still a frighteningly long way to go. It is too soon to abandon hope. But to be complacent would be absurd. We need to act powerfully, credibly and quickly and, not least, we must agree to do so together. The task is great and the hour late. We can no longer sit and wait. Financial Times !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved. \</doc>

(Bloomberg) - The world's multilateral development banks must boost their green ambitions to stop carbon emissions from soaring in the most powerful economies, according to the Climate Transparency Report 2021. Covid-19 lockdowns caused carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector to fall 6% in 2020, but a rebound of 4% is projected across the Group of 20 nations this year. Argentina, China, India and Indonesia are expected to exceed their 2019 emissions levels before next year. Governments channel financing through multilateral development banks, or MDBs, by providing direct funding and encouraging private investments. Steering this money away from high-carbon assets is crucial for meeting the Paris Agreement's goals, according to the report. Organizations such as the World Bank are under pressure from the United Nations to accelerate the green transition. They've been criticized for not doing enough to encourage more capital investments from the private sector to accelerate the transition to clean energy. Earlier this year, the G-20 called on MDBs to align their activities and investments with the 2015 Paris accord before high-stakes global climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, kick off at the end of this month. They also were urged to provide new financial tools and funding instruments to boost green activities. "The pace is falling short of the mission at hand," Angela Picciariello, senior research officer at global affairs think tank Overseas Development Institute, said at a press conference. It's not just about money. Access to technology is a major issue, said Erik Berglof, chief economist of Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. "MDBs must become a platform to help bring together technology providers and those who use them," he said. MDBs should work with financial institutions and companies to reduce their carbon footprints, Berglof said. While MDBs have made commitments to become Paris-aligned, meeting those obligations will be a "very difficult process" requiring drastic changes, he said. There has been some progress. In May, the Group of Seven nations pledged to stop using public financing for new coal power plants, while the U.S. stepped away from gas projects through MDBs. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development vowed to stop investing in upstream oil and gas projects by the end of 2022 to align. China also committed to stop building coal plants overseas. But G-20 nations are responsible for 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With COP26 just over two weeks away in Scotland, the report urged countries whose targets don't align with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels to submit stronger ones. "G-20 countries are really late. Late with 2030 climate targets, fossil fuel phase-out plans and climate finance packages," said Laurence Tubiana, chief executive officer of the European Climate Foundation. "The G-20 needs to move mountains." \'c2\£92021 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg.com( HYPERLINK http://www.bloomberg.com http://www.bloomberg.com Load-Date: \~October 14, 2021 \</doc>

Three arrested at Vancouver rally UN Secretary General says temperatures on course to rise more than 2 C COP26 to accelerate climate action already underway in Canada, experts say Here's your weekly update with everything you need to know about climate change and what B.C. is doing to address the climate and ecological crises for the week of Nov. 1 to Nov. 7, 2021. This week the dominant climate news continued to be the COP26 Climate Conference in Glasgow, which wrapped up Friday. World leaders met to discuss how to create a zero carbon future and avert the catastrophic damage scientists say will occur if global warming exceeds 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.

This is an increase of 3.0 MtCO2e since 2007, the baseline year. B.C.'s net emissions in 2019: 67.2 MtCO2e, an increase of 1.5 MtCO2e since 2007. B.C.'s 2030 target: 40 per cent reduction in net emissions below 2007 levels. B.C.'s 2040 target: 60 per cent reduction. B.C.'s 2050 target: 80 per cent reduction. Canada's 2030 emissions target: Between 40 and 45 per cent reduction. Canada's 2050 emissions target: Net-zero. (source: B.C. and Canada governments) Climate change quick facts: The Earth is now about 1.1 C warmer than it was in the 1800s. Human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by nearly 49 per cent above pre-industrial levels starting in 1850. The world is not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change. 2015-2019 were the five warmest years on record while 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record. On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, temperature could increase by as much as 4.4 C by the end of the century. In 2019, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs. Carbon dioxide levels were 148 per cent of preindustrial levels. Emissions must drop 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 C and 2.7 per cent per year to stay below 2 C.

Now, experts say, the real work begins of putting meat and bone to the pledges and commitments made by world leaders to keep global warming below catastrophic levels. "The next couple years are going to be the most important, fastest-moving period of carbon reduction in Canadian history," said Rick Smith, president of the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices. With the UN-sponsored COP26 climate conference coming to an end, the federal government has to put some specifics behind promises. Business leaders are looking for details on everything from when the commitment to cap fossil fuel emissions will kick in to regulations on methane releases to tax credits for carbon storage. "At the end of the day, it comes back to how you translate those targets into policy in Canada," said John Dillon of the Business Council of Canada. Dillon said he expects the climate discussion to broaden after Glasgow to include sectors such as construction, agriculture - even the military. "The military produces a lot of GHG emissions."

The Local News Data Hub at Ryerson University compared temperatures from 1951-80 with projections for the period 2051-80 using data from ClimateData.ca , a national data initiative bringing together scientists from university, government and private-sector organizations. The results for 30 cities and towns show that in most locations there will be fewer days when the thermometer drops below zero. Residents accustomed to deep-freeze cold will encounter temperatures below -15 C less often. Sweltering summer heat above 30 C will be more common. The projections show that: . Vancouver residents who weathered a brutal heat wave this past summer should expect more hot days. In the 30 years between 1951 and 1980, local temperatures rose above 30 C for just one day per year on average. But in the decades after 2051, this will increase to three to 12 days per year on average. . Winnipeg's "Winterpeg" reputation will suffer. By 2051-80, there will be only six to 19 days per year on average when temperatures will be colder than -25 C. That's down from an annual average of 33 days per year for 1951-80. Meanwhile, summer temperatures above 30 C that used to make an appearance for 12 days per year will scorch the city for 27 to 50 days by mid-century. . Other famously cold cities such as Yellowknife, Dawson City in the Yukon, and Churchill, Man., which used to experience just over 80 days of extreme cold per year on average, could see that fall by as much as half by 2051-80. For Dawson City, that means 44 to 58 days per year on average when it will be below -25 C. Churchill can expect 34 to 59 extreme cold days. Yellowknife will experience 44 to 62 such days.

"Temperatures are still on course to rise well above 2\'c2\'b0C. That is a disaster. We need more ambition and more action. Every country, city and company must decarbonize by 2050 or earlier - with verifiable and aligned 2030 targets, credible and clear measures, and maximum urgency," he said. Guterres said climate risk must be systematically integrated into all decision-making processes and financial flows. "Fossil-fuel subsidies - especially coal finance at home and abroad - must end once and for all," he said. "Private sector finance must be aligned with a credible net-zero, resilient and sustainable development pathway. And we must ensure that our transition to net zero is just, equitable and inclusive."

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the memory of Lytton, B.C., on Monday as he called for more global action in the fight against climate change and said Canada is starting to move on his election promise to cap emissions from the oil and gas sector. Trudeau gave a short speech Monday at the 26th meeting of the Council of Parties to the UN climate convention, known as COP26 in Glasgow. The 14-day talks are starting with a leaders' summit bringing together presidents and prime ministers from more than 120 countries to finalize how they'll actually meet the goals of the Paris accord. "In Canada, there was a town called Lytton," Trudeau said. "I say 'was' because on June 30, it burned to the ground." The Lytton fire occurred in a punishing heat wave that saw the town reach 49.6 C, the hottest temperature Canada has ever recorded. He said it's the kind of thing that could happen anywhere and another sign that it's time for the world to step up. "The science is clear: we must do more, faster," he said. "So that's the pledge and the call I bring to this historic meeting." COP26 is grappling with setting the rules for implementing the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement - the main one being to reduce greenhouse gas emissions enough to hold global warming to as close to 1.5 C as possible by the end of the century. That includes final agreements on what countries have to report about their plans, and their successes or failures at reducing greenhouse gases. Emissions like carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide, produced mostly from burning fossil fuels like oil, natural gas and coal, get lodged inside the atmosphere, where they trap heat and warm the planet. Some of the stickiest talks have to do with the responsibility of the biggest polluters and economies to both reduce their own pollution, and also help smaller and less developed countries adapt. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at her last COP before she retires, told the conference the world is not where it needs to be yet to implement Paris, and there is a special role for developed countries because of their bigger responsibility for climate change to date. Germany, she noted, recently increased its emissions targets to 65 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030, and to be carbon-neutral by 2045. Those targets are more ambitious than Canada's new goal to get to 40-45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. The targets of the European Union, United Kingdom and United States are also more aggressive than Canada's. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault, a longtime Canadian environmentalist, said Canada's new targets, just submitted to the United Nations in July, aren't going to be changed this week. The focus now is on implementing policies to actually meet them. Trudeau said Monday the government is now moving on its election promise to cap emissions from the oil and gas sector. The pledge made in September would see emissions limited to around current levels and ratcheted down every five years until they are carbon neutral by 2050. "We'll cap oil and gas sector emissions today and ensure they decrease tomorrow at a pace and scale needed to reach net zero by 2050," Trudeau said. "That's no small task for a major oil and gas producing country. It's a big step that's absolutely necessary." Guilbeault and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson on Monday formally asked the government's net-zero advisory board to help them accomplish this goal. The Canadian Press \</doc>

Turning this global institutional context into an effective global response to climate change requires ambitious national action.

Fortunately, the Paris Agreement infrastructure and approach provide some mechanisms to encourage this.

Despite recent reports of government decisions to shutter coal-fired power plants in Canada, the United States and the European Union, coal remains the source of almost 40 per cent of the world's electricity. In the past two decades, the capacity for coal-powered electricity has doubled to about 2,050 gigawatts, with another HYPERLINK https://globalenergymonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/China-Dominates-2020-Coal-Development.pdf 247 gigawatts in planning or under development in China alone . President Xi Jinping said in late September that China would stop building coal-burning power plants overseas, but China, India, South Africa and Turkey remain large consumers of thermal coal, the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions. To meet the 1.5 C limit on global warming, HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-worlds-coal-power-plants thermal coal use would need to drop by about 80 per cent by 2030 . With the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/glasgow-climate-change-conference United Nations-led climate talks in Glasgow ( HYPERLINK COP26 ) here, there's a way for governments to work with industry. One paragraph in the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/convention/application/pdf/english_paris_agreement.pdf Paris Agreement lays the groundwork for an international emissions-trading system that could bring an end to the production of coal-fired electricity. How would it work? Emissions-trading mechanisms have gained popularity since they were established in 1997 in the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol . They give incentives to participants to find innovative ways reduce their carbon dioxide emissions and offer the option to trade excess carbon with other countries. The success of international carbon trading has been mixed due to issues such as oversupply and a lack of accounting rules. The Paris Agreement seems to have a solution for this problem, as countries agreed to reduce their national emissions by setting climate targets, known as Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement says that countries can use "internationally transferred mitigation outcomes" (ITMOs) - traded emission reductions generated by one party - towards the nationally determined contributions of the acquiring party. This means two countries could collaborate to reduce global carbon emissions and meet their NDCs. Read more: What is COP26 ? Here's how global climate negotiations work and what's expected from the Glasgow summit For example, countries A and B could create an agreement that makes it easier for country A to switch from coal-powered electricity to the cleaner sources that are produced by country B. Not only does country A reduce its emissions, allowing it to meet its NDCs, but the agreement also leaves country A with ITMOs to sell, which country B could then purchase. Could Canada benefit? Canada aims to reduce its emissions to HYPERLINK https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Canada%20First/Canada%20First%20NDC-Revised%20submission%202017-05-11.pdf 40 per cent, relative to 2005 levels, by 2030 . Based on the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/224829 2020 National Inventory Report Canada's oil and gas sectors HYPERLINK https://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/can-canada-expand-oil-and-gas-production-build-pipelines-and-keep-its-climate would have to drastically reduce their emissions for the country to have any chance of meeting its NDC targets. Given Canada's ambitious commitments, the use of ITMOs gives Canada a viable opportunity to achieve its targets through international co-operation. For instance, natural gas consumption continues to grow in emerging economies. China, for example, has committed to increasing its natural gas consumption by 15 per cent in 2030 and switching to gas HYPERLINK https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/file-uploads/China%20Nat%20Gas%20Commentary_CGEP_June%202018_FINAL.pdf in industry and buildings HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ngib.2020.04.003 half of its domestic consumption HYPERLINK https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2021/10/19/chinas-energy-crisis-deepens-with-potentially-fatal-consequences/?sh=3c87fe371163 recent energy crisis Natural gas production in Canada will HYPERLINK increase around 20 per cent over the next 20 years, while domestic consumption is predicted to decline . This leaves opportunity for considerable growth in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. A bilateral agreement between China and Canada, for example, could allow Canada to export LNG to China to displace coal use. This would allow China to achieve its NDC targets. Writing the rule book The rules are still a work in progress. The rule book for emission reductions is expected to be completed at the UN-led climate talks in Glasgow in November. HYPERLINK https://www.climatefinanceinnovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Climate-Finance-Innovators_Article-6-piloting_State-of-play-and-stakeholder-experiences_December-2020.pdf waste management to transportation HYPERLINK https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/news/chile-and-canada-partner-reduce-emissions-waste-management-sector Canada-Chile Program Many questions regarding the benefits of the transfer of carbon reductions remain, including whether governments should support transfers between companies. The rules should guarantee "environmental integrity." This means that any ITMO exchange should make sure there have been environmental gains - that the reduction in greenhouse gases would not have occurred without the transaction - and that it does not lead to HYPERLINK https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2018.1521332 more greenhouse gas emissions The accounting and quality of emissions, how they are transferred and the lasting mitigation effects may help address environmental integrity. The rule book writers must also define how emissions are reported and create transparent registries to make sure emissions reductions are not counted twice. Some see Article 6.2 as a HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/how-emissions-trading-at-paris-climate-talks-has-set-us-up-for-failure-52319 way to fail , as it has good ideas but unclear rules. There should be clear incentives for countries to set ambitious targets HYPERLINK https://theconversation.com/the-paris-climate-agreement-needs-coordinated-carbon-prices-to-be-successful-60781 without compromising competitiveness What are the next steps? The negotiations at COP26 will be critical for governments to revise and co-operate to work towards their targets. The HYPERLINK latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report calls for urgent global climate action, and ITMOs provide a promising opportunity that allows countries to collaborate to achieve their climate targets. Industry and government must partner to create models that incentivize the creation of carbon trading mechanisms to transfer ITMOs, while also creating economic and environmental benefits. HYPERLINK https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CORSIA/Pages/default.aspx Corsia, a market mechanism developed by the UN International Civil Aviation Organization , is leading the way. It seeks to make all growth in international flights after 2020 carbon neutral. Up to today, Corsia has 81 participant countries that account for 75 per cent of emissions in the international aviation industry. For Canada, where 2030 climate targets are rapidly approaching, it is essential for the government to leverage ITMOs to work together with industries and collaborate on solutions that support a future transition with cleaner energies. Setting short-term and long-term goals that include the transfer of ITMOs particularly in the oil and gas industry and to collaborate on solutions that support a future transition with cleaner energies will be vital for Canada to achieve its climate goals.

By Megan Rowling BARCELONA, July 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In 2015, years of efforts by small island nations worried about being swallowed up by rising seas as the planet heats paid off: they got world leaders to aim for a global warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius in the Paris Agreement on climate change. Their campaign slogan - "1.5 to stay alive" - however, is now being reshaped by others as an increasingly urgent plea to "keep 1.5 alive." Half a decade on, much of the world is under siege from warming-fueled floods, heatwaves and wildfires, in countries from China to Germany to the United States, with impacts arriving faster than scientists had predicted. Today the Earth's climate has already warmed by 1.2C above preindustrial times - and ahead of November's COP26 U.N. climate summit the 1.5C goal has become a rallying cry for politicians and activists who fear it may be slipping out of reach. "There is still time to put a safer 1.5C future back within reach - but only if every major economy commits to meaningful (emissions) reductions by 2030," he added. Under the Paris accord, about 195 countries agreed to a goal of limiting global warming to "well below" 2C and to "pursue efforts" towards 1.5C, with each government committing to do what it could to collectively put the world on the right path. A 2018 report from the U.N. climate science panel then identified the "clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems" of sticking to warming of just 1.5C and warned the dangers of missing that goal included increasing hunger, poverty and migration. But to meet the target, planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use and other human activities need to fall by 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach "net zero" by mid-century, the report said. Those revisions were originally due by the end of 2020 - though the deadline was postponed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Now, with just over 100 days until the start of the COP26 summit in Glasgow on Oct. 31, pressure is growing on countries that have so far failed to step up, including Australia, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, India and Indonesia. Kerry noted this week that by the close of a U.S.-hosted climate summit in April, countries representing 55% of global GDP had announced emissions-cutting commitments for 2030 consistent with the 1.5C goal. But "we simply cannot keep 1.5C within reach ... without bringing the remaining 45% onside," he added. 'AGGRESSIVE DIPLOMACY' The challenge now is winning those needed commitments in a very short window of time, analysts said. Italy, hosting a G20 ministers' meeting this week, said it was struggling to broker a joint statement on climate commitments among countries, with major emerging economies reported to be pushing back against tighter emissions goals. "The minimum we need to see now is some aggressive diplomacy around the world for big emitters to come with much bolder action," said Rachel Kyte, dean of The Fletcher School at Tufts University and a former World Bank climate envoy. "Finance for developing countries is key," she told journalists this week. Host nation Britain has emphasized that progress at COP26 will be hard if rich governments fail to meet a promise to raise $100 billion a year between 2020 and 2025 to help developing countries adopt clean energy and adapt to a hotter world. Leaders of the G7 group of wealthy nations vowed in June they would work to meet the finance pledge, while Kerry said this week it should be delivered well before COP26 . But who will provide the additional $20 billion or so needed - based on the latest figures, for 2018 - remains unclear. Unless the issue is resolved ahead of COP26 , the shortfall could wreck the talks' aim of keeping the 1.5C goal in sight, said Nick Mabey, CEO of think-tank E3G. Without the funding promise being honored, there would be little chance of pressing middle-income countries for bigger emissions cuts, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Alok Sharma, the senior British official leading climate diplomacy for COP26 , said earlier in July that keeping 1.5C alive "is possible, but with COP just months away all of us are going to have to redouble our efforts." Ministers from more than 40 countries, attending a two-day meeting convened by Sharma starting Sunday, will likely be pressed for ideas on how to close any emissions reduction gap left at the end of COP26 , in order to stick to the 1.5C goal. "You can't carry on talking about keeping 1.5 within reach when there is not a plan to do it," Mabey said. OVERSHOOT? Potential ways to bridge the gap could include phasing out coal power, switching all vehicles to run on clean electricity and ending the destruction of forests that absorb carbon - three areas Britain wants to see progress on at COP26 . "No one believes we're going to limit warming to no more than 1.5," James Dyke, assistant director at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute, told a recent discussion at London Climate Action Week. He blamed an over-reliance on technology and market fixes to reduce emissions, saying lifestyle changes are what is needed to solve the climate crisis. "The best we're offering is an overshoot and then a recovery - and that's going to hand on a vast debt to our kids," he added.

Long-time environmental activist David Suzuki made an extreme statement over the weekend about what could happen if politicians and global leaders don't act to reverse climate change. "There are going to be pipelines blown up if our leaders don't pay attention to what's going on," he told an Extinction Rebellion Vancouver Island protest in Victoria on Saturday. He made the statement not as a threat but a warning. "My whole message here? It is that so long as we cling to the models or systems that we've built our laws, our politics, and our economics as being more important than everything else? We're hooped," CHEK News( HYPERLINK https://www.cheknews.ca/david-suzuki-says-pipelines-will-be-blown-up-if-leaders-dont-act-on-climate-change-915197 https://www.cheknews.ca/david-suzuki-says-pipelines-will-be-blown-up-if-leaders-dont-act-on-climate-change-915197 / ) showed him saying. "People in Extinction Rebellion are saying we're headed in a direction of extinction and we're rebelling against it. That's why I'm here." In the protest that organizers called a Funeral for the Future, hundreds marched in the wake of catastrophic results from extreme weather last week in B.C. and following a disappointing COP26 gathering. They urged governments to do something about the ongoing climate emergency. "What has just happened with the unprecedented rainfall and floods and Premier Horgan has the temerity to come back and say, well, six months ago, nobody could have predicted this," said Goodeve. "Well, yes, they could. The scientists have been telling us for over 30 years the consequences of unbridled expansion of fossil fuels and the continued investment in fossil fuel infrastructure, and not addressing the root causes of the climate crisis."

"We cannot go on having a food chain that is 6,000 or 7,000 miles long," he said. "We're a northern country, why the hell are we able to buy fresh tomatoes and lettuce and fresh fruit 12 months a year? We've got to start living in a way that reflects the place that we live," and not use emissions-causing transport to get such produce to Canada. Suzuki did not attend this year's COP26 conference, because, as he told CTV's Your Morning( HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQJZd7L2zww https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQJZd7L2zww ), not only does he not want to fly anymore, but also because "it's the 26th conference," he said with some emphasis. "For the first time in 26 meetings, they've got fossil fuels actually in their documents this year. Is this progress?" The lack of movement by Canada on the environmental front continues to fuel his passion. "Canada has made promise after promise after promise to reduce or cap our emissions," he said. "We have never ever even tried to meet the promises we've made. "It's all negotiations and horse-trading," he said. "The largest delegation of people that have official status there are the 503 delegates from the fossil fuel industry - that's more than all of the representatives of the eight countries most heavily impacted by climate change." !@COPYRIGHT=\£9 2021 Postmedia Network Inc.

Good morning! As global leaders descend on Glasgow, Scotland, to talk climate change at the COP 26 event, they may have knee-capped the convention already. At the G20 summit - that was supposed to highlight the seriousness of climate change crisis and set the stage for a robust conversation around energy transition at the United National Climate Change Conference -, the world's biggest oil and gas consumers issued a lukewarm final statement to limit global warming, offering few concrete commitments and angering climate activists. "The disappointment relates to the fact that Russia and ... China basically didn't show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change," U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also noted that "Canada and a number of other countries would have liked stronger language and stronger commitments on the fight against climate change than others... but we did make significant progress on recognizing 1.5 degrees is the ambition we need to share." These shortcomings will come in sharp relief during COP26 , where countries are hoping to take measures that will make a dent in soaring global emissions. But even as energy transition remains a critical issue, the short-term energy challenges are also mounting for the global economy, with winter set to see energy prices soar and create hardship for millions of consumers across the world. Some industry executives worry that persistently high energy costs could trigger social unrest.( HYPERLINK https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/energy-squeeze-will-trigger-unrest-says-blackstones-schwarzman https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/oil-gas/energy-squeeze-will-trigger-unrest-says-blackstones-schwarzman ) The soaring energy prices have left major energy consumers with the awkward position of asking oil producers to raise output at forums largely focused on moving away from fossil fuels. The United States and other major consumers are reportedly pressuring Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers to raise production to calm prices that have climbed above US$83 per barrel. "I do think that the idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is not, is not, right," Biden told journalists Sunday at a news conference in Rome following the Group of 20 leaders summit, just before he flew to Glasgow to attend the event. As such, while many focused on climate change will be hobnobbing in Glasgow, energy observers will be eyeing the November 4 virtual meet between OPEC, Russia and their allies, together called OPEC+. Analysts expect the group to stick to a plan to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in December. Oil prices surged 11 per cent in October alone, but OPEC+ remains cautious as the group does not see clear skies ahead for the market, and are reluctant to flood the market, fearing yet another price plunge. "We don't take things for granted, we still have COVID," Saudi Arabia's energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, and de facto leader of the OPEC+ group of major oil exporters, said last week. "We are not yet out of the woods," he said. "We need to be careful. The crisis is contained but is not necessarily over." A key question is whether the heat from Washington will be sufficient to incentivize the Saudi leadership to open the taps to cool off prices, noted Helima Croft, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, but notes there is lack of conviction in markets. "While crude oil prices have run white-hot over the past several months, sentiment among certain corners of the oil investor community have turned more cautious," Croft said in a note last week. _____________________________________________________________ Was this newsletter forwarded to you?

While world leaders including our prime minister again spoke words that sounded good, the sad reality is that the outcome of the COP26 talks leaves the world unable to see a path to keeping global warming to 1.5 C. Canada pledged to stop giving our hard-earned tax dollars to fossil-fuel projects overseas, while continuing to pump billions into the oil and gas industry here in Canada. If the fossil-fuel industry were a country, they would have had the largest delegation of any country at the talks. Why would anyone believe that their goal was anything other than to water down any agreements that would negatively affect their bottom line? Meanwhile, COP26 gave B.C. an award for "most creative climate solution" while the province continues to subsidize the fossil-fuel industry, grant logging rights to vast tracts of disappearing forest and pour billions upon billions into a boondoggle dam that floods a fertile valley and displaces people who produce food. While COP26 Their solution to the lack of progress? Hold another meeting. In the meantime, the subject of climate change disappears from the news cycle. \</doc>

The placards held by climate activists weekly on James Street have been replaced, for the most part, by a display of signs and shoes due to the pandemic, but that doesn't mean efforts ceased. In 2021, Climate Action Parry Sound members kept an eye on COP26 , marked larger international protest and added joined Muskoka events when possible. Moving into 2022, though, the group has plans to grow and keep the issues in the forefront of the community's mind ahead of the June 2 provincial election. Frank Thompson first planted himself outside the local office for Parry Sound-Muskoka's MPP in 2019. Thompson is the one, said Merry Bridges, now keeping abreast of the dreary and ever-growing piles of literature and news articles related to the climate crisis. "What I'm increasingly aware of if the massive problem - the increase ... in feedbacks which are apt to prove disastrous," said Thompson. "But - if you are looking to see lights in all this - the lights keep leaking through from people around the world who know about this and are persisting in sprite of climate change." Despite the ongoing natural disasters being linked to climate change in Canada and around the world, Climate Action Parry Sound members are hopeful. "We saw in COVID-19 (that political) partisanship went by the wayside as it does in an emergency," said Ken Christenson. "(The climate) emergency has not been treated as a true emergency. It hasn't been treated the way COVID has been treated - the COVID crisis is actually the blueprint on how we should be treating this." While there are things the average person can do, the group says, it's the leaders who need to step up. "People have buildings to build and groceries to sell and farming to do. And only a small percentage of people are ever going to understand the crisis of either COVID or of climate change," said Christenson. But, while world leaders gathered 2021, pledges and efforts to then were described by youth activist Greta Thunberg as "blah, blah, blah." "I think Greta has said it all," said Thompson. COP26 and the Stop Ecocide movement (to add the destruction of the environment to the International Criminal Court 's purview the same as genocide and war crime) as true efforts to move efforts forward. There's a reason keeping up with literature and daily news related to the climate crisis falls to Thompson, said Bridges. "There is a high burnout with this because it's so difficult to keep facing it. And we, ourselves, find that," she said. "Sometimes it's just really difficult to keep looking." Christenson described local support as "steady," with plans to grow it. "We want to get more seniors involved because we have the time and we have the responsibility ... to be involved more than youth," said Christenson. With a provincial election, Climate Action Parry Sound would like the changing environment to be top of mind at the ballot box. "Our government needs to help citizens do what they need to do (for the future); we can't afford to do what we need to do to get off gas and oil (without government support)," said Bridges "Basically, all the noise we make isn't about putting pressure on each other, or Parry Sounders to feel guilty when they see us on the street. It's trying and make enough noise to get our government to be honest and act on this in a way that is going to matter." STORY BEHIND THE STORY With news of COP26 and Climate Action Parry Sound's weekly protest since 2019, we decided to check in and see what is in store for 2022. Lead \</doc>

GLASGOW, U.K. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed the world to have 60 per cent of the world\' s greenhouse gas emissions covered by a price on pollution in 2030, during a speech at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow on Tuesday. Trudeau started his second and final day at the annual climate negotiations by co-hosting a carbon pricing event, showcasing Canada\' s carbon price as one of the most ambitious and, in his words, stringent in the world.  What a strong carbon price does, when it\' s properly designed, is actually drive those price signals to the private sector, transform the economy and support citizens in encouraging them to make better choices, he said. He started the first day with a speech calling on the rest of the world to follow Canada\' s lead and negotiate a global minimum carbon price. Trudeau compared the idea to the 15 per cent minimum corporate tax more than 130 countries have now signed on to implement in a bid to stop big multinational corporations from avoiding taxes by funnelling their profits through low-tax countries.  It ensures those who are leading on pricing pollution are not unfairly penalized, he said. Carbon pricing has been a political minefield in Canada, with opposing conservative provincial premiers taking the fight against one all the way to the Supreme Court, which upheld the program. The Conservative Party nationally, long an opponent of the policy as a  tax on everything, is now itself engaged in an internal debate about the merits. Leader Erin O\' Toole promised to implement a version of a carbon price in the recent election with a rewards-card like system. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said Monday that he thinks this COP meeting could be the one which sparks the start of a real negotiation toward a global price on carbon. He said there is a level of interest in the idea that he has never seen before.  So is it a done deal? he asked.  Absolutely not. Could Glasgow be the moment that we actually start working on developing something like that? I think it has the potential to do that. Canada\' s carbon price started in 2019 at $20 a tonne and is set to rise to $170 a tonne by 2030. The current price of $40 a tonne adds about 8.8 cents a litre to gasoline, or about $3.50 more every time you fill you car with 40 litres of gasoline. But rebate cheques are included with tax returns to make the program revenue neutral. The idea is that a carbon price shouldn\' t leave families with less money, but provide an incentive to find ways to cut down on fossil fuel use by making it cost more. It also applies to natural gas, propane, jet fuel, and any other liquid fuel, based on the weight of greenhouse gas emissions produced when that fuel is burned. Canada\' s national price only applies in provinces which don\' t have an equivalent provincial policy in place  Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick. A separate policy for big industrial emitters uses the same price but is only charged on a portion of total emissions produced, rather than on the fuels those emitters buy to operate their machinery. The Citizens Climate Lobby says there 64 carbon pricing policies in place around the world, including a direct price on carbon emissions, and capand-trade type systems. More than two dozen are national policies, and the rest are subnational including state or provincial governments in the U.S.and Canada, and cities like Tokyo. The United States and Australia are the only two fully developed economies without some form of carbon pricing. \</doc>

COP26 If you don't know the lingo, COP26 is a United Nations meeting dealing with climate change, the 26th edition of the "Conference of the Parties" - the "parties" being the signatories of the 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It can be hard to see the usefulness of these big, splashy conferences - but the bits and pieces of commitments and promises and deals and accords and data-sharing do eventually make a difference to the global trajectory on carbon emissions. The goal in all this is to keep global average temperatures from warming more than 1.5 C. Or, if we blow that, 2 C. If we continue adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere at current pace, warming will outpace even a 2 C jump, and create all kinds of problems - problems we can avoid if we are smart. But to keep the atmosphere from warming too much, it's not just the atmosphere we have to think about. #TheOceanIsMissing One of the most interesting parts of the conference to watch for Canadians - especially Atlantic Canadians - is an emerging concern about the ocean's rate of carbon absorption. Simply put, the ocean might be slowing or stopping soaking up CO2 from the air. That has enormous implications for policy-makers. To get a sense of this issue, I talked to Dr. Anya Waite. Dr. Waite is a Canadian oceanographer who grew up in Halifax, earned a PhD at UBC, then spent most of her career overseas. Then, she got the "call to come home," as she calls it. Since 2018, she's been working in Halifax as scientific director of the Ocean Frontier Institute. That institute connects Dalhousie University, UPEI and Memorial University, bringing together a swath of interdisciplinary ocean research, with the goal of putting Canadian ocean science and innovation on the global stage for the global good. Other universities across Canada and indeed the world also connect to the institute. (Note for New Brunswick readers: you may notice one Atlantic province absent from this institute - ours - but rest assured, UNB is taking steps to collaborate with institute, Dr. Waite says.) As head of the institute, Dr. Waite is working to bring attention to what she calls the single greatest miscalculation in climate policy: the changing ocean carbon dioxide cycle is missing from the models. Sinks and sources Since the industrial revolution, the oceans have been a carbon sink: they absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the air. That's not news. But the broader climate science community often assumed the oceans'contribution on this front is constant - and that's not necessarily true. "When we talk about climate targets, what we noticed is the climate targets are all talking about a land-based net zero. It's a human target, therefore land-based, right? But no one was talking about the fact that the ocean carbon sink is changing," Dr. Waite says. "So, the implicit thing in all those climate targets is that the ocean is going to continue to absorb carbon the way it has in the past. And there's already evidence of that changing. There's good evidence to suggest it's going to change more in the future - and in fact it's not going to go in a way that it's going to continue to absorb, it's likely to become less absorbent." That contains a kernel of bad news: if oceans soak up less than projected, it means more CO2 in the atmosphere, which means more warming. "It's a huge gap that policy-makers simply haven't taken into account. If we do not understand the changing ocean baseline in carbon absorption, we'll not reach our climate targets." Targets and models We want strong targets on carbon emissions that limit warming to 1.5 or 2 C. But modelling underpins our understanding of how much carbon dioxide we can still emit before we'll trigger that level of warming - and those models, while sophisticated and largely trustworthy, do not adequately consider the changing role of the ocean as a carbon "sink." "Even the IPCC" - the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - "didn't get this quite right," she says. "They did talk a little about how there's a gently declining absorption of carbon in the ocean, but there's not good enough observation to really make the models robust. ... On top of that, they missed this whole piece: that the whole global ocean circulation is changing because of climate change, and that may reduce the carbon sink. One of the big places that's happening is in the North Atlantic, so right in our backyard, the Labrador Sea, Baffin Bay. "The North Atlantic absorbs about 30 per cent of all the carbon the ocean absorbs. ... The Gulf Stream shoots up north, cools rapidly, and then sinks down several thousand metres in the deep sea, carrying with it the surface carbon dioxide. And those deep carbon sinks are potentially slowing due to Arctic ice melt and the slowing of the Gulf Stream." The Gulf Stream as we know it might stop existing, Dr. Waite says. "If that happens, nobody is going to get to their climate targets with the current plan. And nobody's acknowledging this huge uncertainty that we don't know enough about to define." What to do with a 'huge uncertainty' The solution to a lack of knowledge - especially a data gap with huge implications for policy - is to do more quality research, quickly. The tools and tech for such research are already available, Dr. Waite says. "All we really need is to have it rolled together into a good plan, and to have nations step up and invest." "What we've suggested is the perfect place to start is the deep carbon sinks right adjacent to Canada. ... Canada could therefore step up in the leadership role and very quickly - because this is in the eye of a number of other nations - get an international consortium put together of strong observing nations to resolve this and get the information right onto the desktop of policy-makers." A contribution that matters Cynics often note how little it matters what New Brunswick does to reduce carbon emissions. In my view this attitude misunderstands the distributed yet individual nature of our responsibility for collective problems. And, it also misses the opportunity: while New Brunswick's carbon emissions won't make or break global targets, Atlantic Canada could take a central role in the gathering data that could and should shape the emissions targets of every country. It's an opportunity for our region. "Atlantic Canada is poised to become the hotspot for ocean tech, not just in Canada but globally," says Dr. Waite. "That's the kind of profile that we can bring to COP." She's optimistic the conference will accomplish something meaningful - people all over the world are noticing the changing climate, she says, and that means there's more momentum at the political level to find solutions. She sees a key role for Canadian science to inform those solutions. "We want to make sure that Canadian research and Canadian observation capacity is supported by Canada, and we also want to make sure we take our place - our rightful place - globally, in the conversation."

Activists shift focus from coal to gas production  Extinction Rebellion to launch more London protests next month  International school strike planned for September 24 By Arthur Neslen BRUSSELS, July 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Climate activists will try to shut down gas terminals and protest fracking plans in several countries this weekend, as a post-lockdown push to influence the agenda ahead of November's COP26 climate summit in Scotland kicks off in earnest. The school strikes and city-stopping actions that pushed global warming to the top of the political priority list before the COVID-19 pandemic are also set to resume in coming weeks. The grassroots Extinction Rebellion group has said it will launch two weeks of actions against new fossil fuel investments in London next month. The Fridays For Future student movement, meanwhile, has called a global school strike for Sept. 24, which falls during the U.N. General Assembly where leaders will discuss their responses to climate change. "Global citizens are at the beginning of an escalation of actions and activities that will be culminating at the COP (climate summit)," said Asad Rehman, a spokesman for the COP26 Coalition, an umbrella for unions, aid agencies, faith and green groups working on climate justice. A global day of protest for climate equity will take place on Nov. 6 in the middle of the COP26 summit, added Rehman, who is also director of anti-poverty charity War on Want. However, coronavirus, cost and climate change concerns will prevent some activists from traveling to the main demonstration in Glasgow, where the conference will take place. This weekend, up to 3,000 activists from Germany's Ende Gelaende, a green civil disobedience movement, plan to blockade the Brunsbuttel liquefied natural gas terminal in a bid to stop operations. "It's going to be the biggest mass action since the lockdown began," said spokeswoman Ronja Weil. Campaigners will also take to the streets in a dozen countries including Argentina, Ireland, Bolivia and Canada. In a strategic shift, they are targeting gas rather than coal plants, and linking actions in the Global North and South. Their target, according to Esteban Servat, who co-initiated the Shale Must Fall group which called this weekend's protests, is European multinationals "that are doing abroad what they cannot do at home - namely fracking." Servat, an Argentinian scientist, says he fled his country for Germany because of "intense persecution and death threats" after leaking a government report that linked contaminated water tables to fracking. Another protest at Scotland's Mossmorran gas plant complex on Sunday aims to "amplify the struggle of local communities," which have to contend with pollution, noise and gas flaring, said Benji Brown, a spokesman for Climate Camp Scotland. "Even where I live in Edinburgh, which is 20 miles away, you can see (the plant) light up the sky at night," he said. The action also intends "to create space for the climate movement in Scotland to regroup and rebuild momentum in the run-up to COP26 ," he added. COP26 host Britain is putting pressure on other countries to commit to ending the use of, and funding for, coal power. But natural gas - a less carbon-intensive fossil fuel - is being supported by some governments as a "bridge" to a cleaner energy mix. ONLINE COLLABORATION Around the world, COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions have pushed much climate activism online since early 2020. But while governments have since made fresh promises to green their economies, climate-heating emissions are still rising. At the same time, headlines about heatwaves, floods and wildfires have flashed by with dizzying speed, as climate change impacts accelerate. "There is a growing frustration about the lack of adequate climate action, which has been hidden by the pandemic," said Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network Europe. Vaccine inequity and online link-ups during the pandemic have spurred greater coordination between activists in wealthy nations and developing countries, he added. "This global movement will use the COP26 momentum to bring climate action and equity back to the forefront, in whatever way necessary," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But the pandemic is still shaping how protests happen. Extinction Rebellion spokeswoman Nuala Gathercole Lam said the pandemic had been "a big obstacle" - although the group has continued to mount actions like a blockade of print works used by Rupert Murdoch's News UK group in 2020. FOSSIL FUEL FINANCE As Britain's COVID-19 restrictions have eased, Gathercole Lam said "fresh waves of climate activists" were getting involved as the group prepares to take to the streets again in the week of Aug. 23 to oppose fossil fuel finance. Despite a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) calling for an end to new fossil fuel investments, about $600 billion has gone into new gas fields, pipelines and LNG facilities under development, according to analytics firm GlobalData. That is fueling fears that the chances of pegging global warming to the Paris climate accord's most ambitious limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times may be dwindling. To meet the goal, emissions would need to fall by 7.6% every year until 2030, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. While greenhouse gas emissions did drop by about 6% in 2020 due to the global economic disruption caused by the pandemic, the IEA expects them to rise again to a record high in 2023. Since last year, gas has been responsible for more European emissions than lignite coal, according to an analysis of EU Emissions Trading System data by the Ember think-tank. Extinction Rebellion's Gathercole Lam said members would next month demand an end to "all new investment in fossil fuels immediately." "We'll be in the City of London where much of the money flows into the fossil fuel industry, taking action there," she added. (Reporting by Arthur Neslen. Editing by Megan Rowling.

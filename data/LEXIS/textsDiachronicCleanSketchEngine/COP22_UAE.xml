Naser Al Wasmi MARRAKECH // As the world embraces renewable energy, the UAE and the GCC should not stop producing oil, academics at the United Nations conference on climate change say. Instead, oil should be used for its chemical components as burning it is waste of its potential. During the 22nd conference of the parties signed up to the UN\' s framework convention on climate change ( Cop22 ) academics from the University of Sheffield in England offered their perspectives on the GCC\' s food and water security problem. Professor Duncan Cameron, professor of plant and soil biology at the university, said: "Oil is a phenomenal chemical resource, this is where the environmental movement has got it wrong. "It\' s the chemical basis for the modern world, which is why it\' s such a waste. It\' s absolutely criminal that we burn oil. "For feedstock, for plastics, for pretty much every chemical process that gives us our current modern standard of living, it is derived from oil. So why the hell would we burn it and create two problems \- releasing CO2 and diminishing the resource that we rely on for the majority of our modern chemistry?" he said. Prof Cameron and colleague Prof Tony Ryan are conducting research into using petrochemicals to create a plastic material that shares the properties of soil. They have also been working on a project that uses petrochemicals as the building material for greenhouses, using its properties to shade plants from the intense summer sun. By using solar energy, they are able to turn plastics that were used in greenhouse building to other uses. Less than two per cent of Gulf region\' s land is arable. The result is that the UAE is almost entirely reliant on other countries to feed its population, importing approximately 90 per cent of its food. The solution to growing produce in the desert involves greenhouses and other artificial environments. The problem, they said, was that keeping greenhouses cool in desert heat is energy intensive. "The Gulf has an excess of sunshine, and we need to learn to use the sunshine to grow food," said Prof Ryan, the founding director of the Grantham Centre for Sustainable Futures. "Once we can do that, using oil for building and the Sun for energy, we begin unlocking technologies that allow for sustainable food production." Prof Ryan said water demand could be met by making sure that desalination was powered by solar energy, once the process was efficient enough. This would allow oil to be used elsewhere. "But if we can make it rain with solar energy, we can be a lot more efficient." HYPERLINK mailto:nalwasmi@thenational.ae nalwasmi@thenational.ae \</doc>

Marrakech, Nov 16 (Petra) -- Deputizing for His Majesty King Abdullah II, Minister of Environment, Yaseen Al Khayyat, participated in the 22nd Marrakech Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) in the Moroccan city of Marrakech. Al Khayyat, who chaired the Jordanian delegation to the 11-day conference, said Jordan is determined and willing to play an essential part in that global effort to address climate change, as the Kingdom has always been a pioneer in embracing global values of development, human rights, peace and sustainability. He added that Jordan is currently facing an extraordinary challenge that is unique in its geopolitical setting, as the Kingdom's population has increased suddenly by about 20 percent, due to the influx of refugees fleeing from the outrageous conditions caused by conflicts in Syria. Despite such challenges, Al Khayyat noted, Jordan is still determined to achieve the target set by its NDCs, and to continue on the path of climate friendly sustainable development. In the energy sector, he added, Jordan is working relentlessly to diversify energy sources and it's well on the track "with our 2020 goals with 20 percent share of electricity generation mix comes from renewable sources." The minister underlined that Jordan already faces severe water scarcity with a per capita share of 125 cubic meters per year, thus Jordan's challenge in sustainable water is an issue of a national security dimension. COP22 Al Khayyat noted that Jordan will enhance its efforts in mitigation in the context of sustainable development, poverty eradication, and "Leaving No One Behind," calling on creating a reliable global financing mechanisms for climate actions. //Petra// AF \</doc>

This in turn, strengthens the UAE's global competitiveness, especially in renewable energy and green economy technologies and products. Dubai has a comprehensive vision for a sustainable future, which is pivotal to the success of building a green economy. There are several strategies launched by our wise leadership to create an attractive environment for investment. The Dubai Plan 2021 aims to make the Emirate the most business-friendly city and preferred investment destination in the world." "The National Innovation Strategy launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, aims to make the UAE one of the most innovative countries in the world. The Dubai Innovation Strategy, approved by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Dubai Future Foundation, aims to transform Dubai into the most innovative city in the world. The Dubai Future Accelerators initiative will create an integrated global platform to shape the future of Dubai's strategic sectors, build economic value by accelerating businesses, embracing futuristic technologiical solutions and attract the best minds from around the world to experience and apply their innovations in Dubai. The Demand Side Management Strategy aims to reduce energy and water demand by 30% by 2030. The Carbon Abatement Strategy aims to reduce carbon emissions by 16% by 2021. The Smart Dubai initiative, launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, aims to transform Dubai into the smartest and happiest city in the world. The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 aims to diversify the energy mix so clean energy will generate 7% of Dubai's total power output by 2020, 25% by 2030 and 75% by 2050. Dubai focuses on energy security and sustainability," added Al Tayer. Al Tayer noted that the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 consists of five main pillars: infrastructure, legislation, funding, building capacities and skills, and an environmentally-friendly energy mix. The infrastructure pillar includes initiatives such as the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is the largest single-site solar park in the world. It will produce 5,000 megawatts by 2030, with a total investment of USD 13.6 billion (AED 50 billion). The solar park will save approximately 6.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually. The infrastructure pillar also includes the establishment of a free zone called Dubai Green Zone, dedicated to attracting Research and Development (R&D) centres and emerging companies in clean energy. The second pillar focuses on the establishment of a legislative structure supporting clean energy policies through the Shams Dubai initiative, to support the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy. For funding through the Dubai Green Fund, the third pillar covers financing solutions for investment in R&D on clean energy and its applications. This includes the establishment of the Dubai Green Fund, which is worth AED 100 billion. The fourth pillar aims to develop skills through global training programmes in clean energy, in cooperation with international organisations and institutes, as well as R&D centres. The fifth pillar is focused on creating an environmentally-friendly energy mix, based on the agreed targets. All these ambitious development strategies and plans aim to improve the economy and attract investment into development projects that provide opportunities in support of the new growth cycle of Dubai. DEWA's five-year investment to achieve these strategies is worth AED 65 billion. "To realise DEWA's vision to become a sustainable innovative world-class utility, and in line with our 2021 strategy that supports the Dubai Plan 2021, we are working closely with our partners to implement major pioneering electricity and water infrastructure projects. This will ensure economic, environmental and social sustainability, and make Dubai the smartest, happiest, and most sustainable city in the world. DEWA promotes partnerships between the public and private sectors. We adopt the Independent Power Producer (IPP) model in our strategic projects, to enable investors to establish long-term partnerships that are mutually beneficial. Through this model, Dubai previously set a world record in the cost of solar energy after it received a globally-competitive price of USD 2.99 cents per kilowatt hour (kW/h), for the 800MW third phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. This has helped to reduce the costs of such projects globally, amidst increasing competition, especially for the projects that come after DEWA's announcement of this price," said Al Tayer. "Based on the IPP model, DEWA also received the lowest bid at USD 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour for the 2,400MW Hassyan clean coal power plant. The plant is the first-of-its-kind in the region and is fully-compliant with set international standards. We are also working on expanding the M-Station power production and water desalination plant. The project contract is worth AED 1.47 billion (USD 400 million) and will be completed in 2018. These future projects and programmes are promising opportunities for investors in the green energy sector." "DEWA has allocated over AED 2.6 billion to support electricity, water, and renewable energy infrastructure projects, to host the best World Expo in Dubai in 2020, with a focus on renewable energy sources. The World Expo will be connected to the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which will provide it with 200MW of power. This supports the World Expo's theme of 'Connecting Minds, Creating the Future' and its three sub themes of Sustainability, Mobility, and Opportunity. DEWA is building three 132/11 kilovolt (kV) substations with 45 kilometres (km) of high-voltage (132kV) cables. The substations has been named Sustainability, Mobility, and Opportunity. The total cost of the electricity projects will be AED 420 million. DEWA is also building water transmission networks with pipelines that are 600 and 1,200 mm in diameter, pumping stations and distribution networks. With a planned budget of AED 515 million, these projects will increase water-flow rates and ensure an adequate water supply to meet increasing demands," added Al Tayer. Al Tayer invited Moroccan companies to participate in the Water, Energy, Technology, and Environment Exhibition (WETEX). "For the last 18 years, DEWA has organised WETEX, under the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Minister of Finance, and President of DEWA. WETEX has become a leading international platform, bringing together 1,900 exhibitors and over 23,000 visitors who represent the biggest international companies and organisations, and experts in energy, water and the environment from 46 countries. "WETEX facilitates the exchange of experiences and best practices, while showing the latest developments and technologies. The event coincides with the World Green Economy Summit (WGES). Over three years, the summit has attracted prominent experts in green energy, sustainability, and climate change. The summit has succeeded in consolidating Dubai's leading position globally by attracting over 40 supporting partners and sponsors. It has gathered over 80 world leaders and representatives of public and private organisations and financial institutions, to exchange ideas and knowledge. The summit, which was attended by over 2,500 people, resulted in important recommendations, including the third Dubai Declaration, which emphasises the continuous efforts to create an even smarter, greener, and happier Dubai, and make it a global hub for green economy. The Dubai Declaration summarises the achievements made during last year, and commitments for the future, focusing on three main areas: making Dubai a global hub for green economy, developing international green partnerships, and green finance," said Al Tayer. Al Tayer highlighted the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO), which was launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum at the World Green Economy Summit 2016, with the support of the Government of Dubai, and in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). WGEO, which will be based in Dubai, aims to take a pioneering role to promote green economy through dialogue, partnerships, and exchanging expertise with countries, the public and private sectors, organisations, UN agencies, financial institutions, and civil society to achieve the green economy objectives. The organisation will be a platform for developing new solutions for climate change, sustainable energy, and other water-related and environmental challenges around the world. "As part of Dubai's efforts to become the smartest and happiest city in the world, and to achieve the Smart Dubai initiative launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, DEWA launched a number of leading initiatives. These include Shams Dubai, which encourages building owners to install photovoltaic panels on rooftops to generate solar power and connect it to DEWA's grid. We have implemented many projects through this initiative. The second initiative is the Smart Applications and Meters, and the third is the Green Charger to establish the infrastructure for electric-vehicle charging stations. To date, DEWA has established 100 charging stations across Dubai. The smart grid supports Dubai's target to reduce energy consumption by 30% by 2030. DEWA's smart grid strategy contains 11 programmes with a total investment of USD 2 billion up to 2020," added Al Tayer. "Our strategy involves moving from a carbon-intensive economy to a greener one, through the Dubai Green Fund, which is worth USD 27 billion, and encourages green investment and green growth. DEWA established Etihad Energy Services Company (Etihad ESCO) to boost energy performance contracts by providing financial organisations the opportunity to invest in energy-efficient projects. Financial institutions can become active partners in the sustainable development vision of Dubai, with plans to retrofit over 30,000 buildings to make them energy-efficient in the first phase of this project along with our Demand Side Management programmes at a cost of AED 30 billion bringing returns of AED 82 billion and a net profit of AED 52 billion, as we place great importance on environmental issues that contribute to the sustainable development of the UAE. We place great importance on environmental issues that contribute to the sustainable development of the UAE. Through the Emirates Central Cooling Systems Corporation (Empower), the world's largest district-cooling services provider, we highlight the benefits of district cooling for the public and private sectors around the world, as there is an urgent need to consolidate efforts to address the challenges facing the energy sector and create new business opportunities in renewable and clean energy. The UAE Water Aid Foundation (Suqia) was launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 2015, to help millions of underprivileged people, who are in desperate need of drinkable water around the world." "We always look forward to adopting the best electricity and water technologies and promoting partnerships with the private sector around the world. We are sure that such partnerships with international companies are important for both parties as DEWA gets the best modern technologies, while those companies have strategic opportunities to continue enhancing their technologies. We are confident that Moroccan companies can play a major role in the energy, electricity, water, and green building sectors in the UAE, and in Dubai in particular," concluded Al Tayer. Thiaw commended Dubai's achievements in water and clean energy and the solar power projects that have contributed to its social and economic development.

Amman, Nov.21 (Petra) -- A Russian official said that his country is working on developing its nuclear power plants using the advanced technique of the pressurized water reactor. These remarks came during an international meeting that took place at UNFCCC COP22 on climate change in Morocco on November 17. The meeting tackled Russia's policy in combating climate change and contribution of modern technologies to the development of low-carbon energy sector. First Deputy CEO for Corporate Development and International Business of ROSATOM State Corporation, Kirill Komarov, spoke about the role of nuclear power in achieving objectives of Paris Agreements and its benefits that prevent emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere. 'We promote in Russia and abroad NPPs based of VVER technology which is safe, mature and one of the most referenced globally. Our recent project is the 6th unit of Novovoronezh NPP that was put into operation in August this year in Russia. We are proud that today it is the first and the only successfully implemented project of NPP of so called Generation 3+. So, thanks to VVER designed NPPs built in the world 15 Gt. of CO2 hadn't been emitted globally. Such volume of ??2 could be emitted by 40 coal TPPs of 1 GWe (each) during 60 years. The current contribution of nuclear to low carbon electricity generation in Russia is 48%. It is our contribution to the low-carbon future of the planet'. He also noted that nuclear industry bears heavy responsibility: 'We must have safe NPPs and effective system of management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. ROSATOM's latest innovations including closed nuclear fuel cycle on 'fast-neutrons' technologies, REMIX fuel and Gen. 3+ reactors with the first reactor of this type put in operation in Russia allow to cope with these tasks successfully'. The event was attended by H.E. Dr. Hakima El Haite, Minister Delegate in Charge of Environment at the Ministry of Energy, Mining, Water and Environment of Morocco. She pointed out the importance of interaction between governmental and non-governmental actors to prevent the consequences of climate change. According to the Minister, the Russian Federation is an example of a country where state and business work jointly and successfully in this direction. Earlier this day a press-conference with Kirill Komarov and Agneta Rising, Director General of the World Nuclear Association took place on the sidelines of COP22 . The press-conference focused on the role of nuclear energy in achieving objectives of Paris Agreements and global reduction of CO2 emissions. In particular, Mrs. Rising noted: 'Because the Paris Agreement calls on countries to have greater ambition we believe it is vital that we aim to decarbonize the electricity generation sector by 2050, with nuclear energy working in harmony with other low carbon forms of generation. Parties should follow Russia's example today and give an equal emphasis to nuclear as a solution as they do to other mitigation options' - she added. Komarov stressed that atomic energy and renewables can't be set against each other. 'We are sure that the future of the energy industry is in diversified balance of low-carbon technologies that provide price affordability, safety of deliveries and minimum impact on the environment'. In proof of his words Komarov told about current ROSATOM projects in wind power generation. The total amount of investments made by ROSATOM here exceeds 1 billion Euro. Jordan has signed an inter-governmental agreement with Russia's Rosatom company to build and operate the kingdom's first nuclear power plant to be operational during 2024-2025. //Petra//S Kh \</doc>

If Iran were to transition to a fully renewable electricity system today, it would see financial gains as early as 2030. This is the finding of researchers from Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), whose study shows thatmajor oil-producing countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Iran, could commercialise their renewable energy resources within the space of just two decades. According to the study, a fully renewable electricity system would be roughly 50% to 60% cheaper than other emission-free energy options for MENA countries. For example, new nuclear power costs approximately $116/MWh to produce, while the cost of fossil-CCS option is estimated at $127/MWh. The cost of fully renewable energy electricity, meanwhile, should come in at around $42-63/MWh, based on financial and technical projections for the year 2030. [[banner]] The study also notes that the cost of wind and solar electricity could fall as low as $39 to $58/MWh, if different energy resources were connected to a 'super grid' that allowed the transmission of high volumes of electricity across longer distances. To fully transform its electricity system to renewables, Iran would reportedly require 49GW of solar photovoltaics, 77GW of wind power, and 21GW of hydropower. The scientists also presented a renewable oil refining scenario in which fossil fuels are replaced with synthetically produced technology from carbon dioxide, water, and electricity. With the use of the said power-to-fuel technology, a 100% renewable system can still use carbon fuels and chemicals for aviation, materials, and medicine. Those sectors are said to be the most difficult to decarbonise because batteries are too heavy for powering airplanes, and carbon atoms are needed in plastics and chemicals like solvents and medicine. The results were published at the 11th International Energy Conference, held in Iran, and presented during COP22 , in Morocco.

Low natural gas and electricity prices have created a tough competitive environment for renewable energy, but this has remarkably had little impact on the momentum of alternative energy growth, finds a new Deloitte report entitled,  Alternative Thinking 2016: Five game-changers that are powering the future of renewable energy. The report identifies the important trends and opportunities in the renewable energy industry. It also presents  what if scenarios that may propel the renewable power sector forward, outpacing current projections.  Alternative energy is at a tipping point, said Salam Awawdeh, Partner and Middle East Energy & Resources Leader at Deloitte in the Middle East.  The growth we have seen over the past few years since we last published the report is now ready to be propelled forward as a result of these game-changers. Especially in the Middle East, Solar friendly policies across all parts of the solar value chain (investors, solar developers, construction contractors and technology manufacturers) have contributed enormously to solar industry growth in many jurisdictions; Jordan, UAE and Egypt amongst others. Enthusiastic effort is invested in realignment of relevant energy strategies as many were considered when Brent crude exceeded $105 per barrel, and emphasis was put on the lower cost-recovery tariffs guaranteed by technologies such as renewables, oil shale or nuclear. The large drop in oil prices, if sustained, would considerably reduce generation investment cost recovery. And a spell over effect, it may reduce the opportunity cost of switching away from traditional fossil fuels, and make some technologies almost cost-comparable to traditional ones \- at least in the short term. According to the report, the convergence of forces driving renewable energy forward has created a momentum that is likely irreversible for the industry. These five game-changers include: Regulatory reform and public policy support: Far-reaching regulations at global, national and local levels are driving increased adoption of renewable energy. This includes the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference as well as adoption of state and provincial regulations to protect the environment. Corporate commitment: A significant number of large global companies have launched a movement to generate all of their energy from renewables in the next two decades. In the US alone, 58 leading multinational corporations have signed on to the Renewable Energy Buyers\' Principles1, an initiative that aims to make renewable energy easier for companies to procure at a large scale. Financing innovation: Investors now understand renewables as an asset class and are more confident in investing in them, while new financing vehicles have lowered the cost of capital and improved access to it. Giving companies the opportunity to reduce their tax burdens bolsters the trend of corporations investing in renewables by making the overall financial proposition even more attractive. Energy storage: Energy storage technology is advancing and making renewable energy more viable by eliminating the issue of intermittency. Grid integration: Once the nemesis of utilities, a host of new technologies are quickly making integration of intermittent power sources into the electricity grid a problem of the past. With the capability to manage electricity flows in different directions, the system operators have the ability to manage production and supply in real-time. Though the traditional barriers of cost, intermittency, and grid integration are still present, they are not seen as deal-breakers in the long run, according to the report.  Growing pains are inevitable, but they are surmountable for renewable energy, Awawdeh added.  First-movers such as Denmark, Germany, China, the UK, the US and Spain have addressed them, and the results of recent regulatory initiatives suggest that many other nations now believe it is necessary to do so. This indicates that perhaps alternative energy has not just entered the mainstream, but is quickly becoming the norm itself. \</doc>

Nov. 15 -- HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer announces global launch of WGEO at COP22 in Marrakesh At the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech: HE Dr. Thani Bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment has announced that the UAE is now the first member of the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO). HE Al Zeyoudi added: "'A Green Economy for Sustainable Development' initiative launched in 2012 and Green Agenda 2015-2030 set the course for our economic growth ambitions, social development priorities and environmental sustainability goals." "The advancement of the UAE's green economy efforts couldn't have been made without the strong support from the UN and relevant international organisations. Most notably, the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP), the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)," Dr. Zeyoudi added. "I am confident that through WGEO, we will have significant impact on knowledge and experience sharing which would help to overcome common challenges and to ensure successful achievement of our common green economy goals," Dr. Zeyoudi added. Dr. Zeyoudi made these remarks during the announcement of the global launch of WGEO at the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) in Marrakech, Morocco. On his part, HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO) and Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, has stated that WGEO, which was launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai at the 3rd World Green Economy Summit in Dubai, will support the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and increase global awareness on climate change to enhance the shift towards a green economy. The announcement was attended by HE Sheikh Sultan bin Hamdan Al Nahyan, Advisor to the UAE President, HE Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, UAE Minister of Energy, HE Dr. Thani Bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, HE Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), HE Suhail Matar Al Ketbi, the UAE Ambassador in Morocco, Mohammed Abunayyan, Chairman, ACWA Power, and representatives of the UN agencies, the public and private sectors, financial institutions, non-profit-organisations, and civil society organisations. "It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the global announcement of the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO). This great initiative, came under the wise vision of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, as an international organisation during the third World Green Economy Summit (WGES) in Dubai on 5 October 2016 and it is supported by the UAE and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). I would like to thank the United Nations for its pioneering role in raising global awareness about climate change," said Al Tayer. "Launching WGEO at this time reflects the relentless efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals outlined in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WGEO will also play an instrumental role in mitigating climate change, as it serves as a mechanism for generating new solutions for sustainable energy, water and other environmental challenges, thereby lowering the risk of green economy investments, and supporting international cooperation in innovation, technology and finance. As Dubai is emerging as a global hub for green economy, we are celebrating today the announcement of the global launch of the WGEO and I would like to take this opportunity to give you a glimpse into the efforts of the UAE to become a green economy," he added. "To meet the environmental challenges facing most countries in the world and to spread a culture of sustainability, we must have a global movement towards a green economy. These principles are firmly embedded within the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 for clean energy to provide 7% of Dubai's total power output by 2020, rising to 25% by 2030, and 75% by 2050. The strategy consists of five main pillars: infrastructure, legislation, funding, building capacities and skills, and an environmentally-friendly energy mix. The strategy is underpinned by an expected investment of USD13 billion in the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is the largest single-site solar park in the world, with a planned capacity of 5,000 megawatts by 2030," he added. "These efforts culminate today in this announcement pertaining to the World Green Economy Organisation, which will be permanently based in Dubai to pioneer a new approach to promoting green economy, by bringing together governments, the private sector, foundations, United Nations agencies, banking systems and society, to unite to achieve green economic goals and serve as a catalyst for generating new integrated solutions to climate change, sustainable energy, water and other environmental challenges around the world. In line with its global mandate, WGEO will significantly contribute to the implementation of the Paris climate agreement (COP 21) to shift to a green economy, a low-carbon economy that is climate-resilient, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive. WGEO will bridge the gaps between countries in innovation, technology and finance. It will provide technical assistance to countries who can benefit from Dubai's green economy model, as well as models from other countries whose economies demand the development of strong, robust and diverse green strategies for the future," he added. "WGEO will also benefit from technical support from the UNDP office in the UAE, as well as advisory support services from UNDP's Arab States Regional Centre. Moreover, WGEO will serve as a global platform to accelerate the shift towards a green economy. The WGEO's mandate blends with the UAE's green and sustainable development strategy, exemplified by the 'Green Economy for Sustainable Development' initiative launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, for the UAE to be among the world's leading countries and a global hub for the export and re-export of green products and technologies. We welcome the collaboration with the United Nations Development Program to strengthen the WGEO's position as a reference point for a green economy, to support productive dialogue between countries on best practices for a green economy, provide technical support, and help the green economy to create jobs," he added. He emphasised: "We remain committed to our continued development of innovative business models for energy and transport, such as power-purchase agreements for solar energy, which have already resulted in lowering the price of solar power per kilowatt hour." "We are proud to say that WGEO will join the global efforts to combat climate change at COP 22 . The UAE's efforts to support the transition to a green economy are underlined by its contribution and commitment to reduce carbon emissions, which formed the basis of the historic Paris Agreement, signed at the Paris Climate Conference and committing to cap the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and limit the increase to 1.5C. It is pertinent that the launch of WGEO is aligned to the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to develop the Dubai Green Free Zone, which will be dedicated to attracting mature and emerging companies in clean energy. The Dubai Green Free Zone will become a global hub to attract R&D and innovative clean energy companies. It also supports the launch of the 27 Billion US dollar Green Energy Fund, which reflects Dubai's efforts to support local, national and international projects to achieve a green economy. I would like to extend my good wishes for the success of COP 22 , and I hope to meet you in Dubai during the World Green Economy Summit 2017," concluded Al Tayer. "Once operational, the World Green Economy Organisation can serve as a new platform for green, low-carbon, climate resilient solutions in developing countries, building on UAE's role as a new global partner for climate action," said HE Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme. WGEO will strengthen cooperation among world countries in green economy. When he launched WGEO at World Green Economy Summit 2016, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, emphasised that the organisation will fulfil its mission to promote green economy regionally and globally, support dialogue among countries, while providing them with consultation and financial, moral, and technical support. It will be a major point of reference for research and studies on clean energy and the protection of humans and the environment. It is expected that the new organisation will be supported by many countries and international organisations. Many countries will join the organisation, which is supported by Dubai Government in cooperation and partnership of UNDP. World Green Economy Summit 2016 was held under the patronage of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. It concluded by announcing the 3rd Dubai Declaration, which emphasised Dubai's ongoing efforts to be a smarter, greener, and happier city, and to claim its position as a global hub for green economy. Dubai Declaration also includes establishing a green projects zone, provide job opportunities in green economy areas, and promote the position of the new World Green Economy Organisation, which will be based in Dubai, as a main reference for green economy.

UAE/ Rhodes conference/ Security/ In a statement delivered at the two-day Rhodes Conference for Security and Stability, which concluded on Friday in Greece, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation for Political Affairs, Ahmed Abdul Rahman Al Jarman, reiterated the UAE's condemnation and rejection of all forms and manifestations of terrorism, regardless of their sources, places or perpetrators. He stressed the need for concerted regional and international efforts to fight terrorism, implement the relevant resolutions and recommendations of relevant regional and international organisations and back the United Nation's global strategy for fighting terrorism. Outlining the UAE's intensified efforts in containing tensions and crises in this region and beyond, the official noted that the country seeks to consolidate its humanitarian, relief and development aid programmes, effective participation in peacekeeping missions, protection of civilians and refugees and reconstruction in areas hit by conflicts. He said these efforts reflect the UAE's commitment and dedication to the achievement of the noble goals of preserving international peace and security. Combating terrorism should be carried out as part of a commitment to international law, the rule of law and protection of human rights, he said. "An over-arching approach featuring combined regional and international efforts needs to be embraced to fight the phenomenon of terrorism while at the same time its root causes should be addressed." The official further noted that the relevant global strategy should take into account the nature of extremism, which spilled over the national borders of countries to become a global phenomenon, and extremist groups' exploitation of unsolved conflicts in the Middle East. "Due to the importance of education for fighting extremism, the UAE hosted the Hedaya centre to counter violent extremism and established the Muslim Council of Elders to address the roots of sectarianism." He noted that the UAE and the US established the Sawab Center to promote tolerance and counter online extremist propaganda. As part of efforts to develop its national policies and legislative and executive regulations to eliminate terrorism and protect the youth from being fooled into extremism and violence, the UAE enacted a federal law to combat terrorist crimes and punish those convicted of abetting or carrying out terrorist acts, he added. To further promote the values of tolerance, moderation and coexistence, the UAE also enacted a federal anti-discrimination law. Speaking on the issue of refugees, he said it is escalating day after day and the international community should act in an effective and serious manner to prevent further escalation. "We call for joint efforts, especially because in the near future the situation in the region and the whole world will be critical, which requires further regional and international coordination and cooperation to find solutions to the current conflicts in the region. In this field, the UAE provided humanitarian assistance worth US$1.1 billion since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, launched several projects to protect refugees in Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan and signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Greece to establish shelters for Syrian refugees in Greece." Speaking on the issue of climate change, Al Jarman noted that the UAE is among the first nations participating in relevant negotiations and that it closely cooperated with the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference , held in France, and regional and international partners to contribute towards the successful conclusion of the Paris climate change agreement, which was backed by all governments as it draws a clear path to a sustainable future by reducing carbon emissions, encouraging economically-feasible solutions, accelerating the growth of renewable energy projects and boosting energy efficiency technologies. He also noted that Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week 2016 was a forum for procedures designed to translate the Paris agreement into effective procedures. Al Jarman concluded the statement by stressing that the government of the UAE will continue its policy of enhancing international security and peace, solving international conflicts through peaceful means including international law and a comprehensive preventive strategy to preempt conflicts and achieve security, economic prosperity and sustainable development. The UAE delegation to the Rhodes Conference for Security and Stability included Ambassador to Greece, Sultan Mohammed Al Ali. \</doc>

Schneider Electric recently announced its decision to join the Science-Based Targets initiative in order to align its objectives of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions with the recommendations of scientists on the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change to limit global warming to a maximum of 2\'b0C. The initiative, jointly supported by the Carbon Disclosure Project, United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and WWF, calls on businesses to develop objectives that are consistent with the \' two degree\' trajectory specified by the Paris Agreement (COP21). During COP21 held in Paris in December 2015, the first-ever universal climate agreement was unanimously adopted. Schneider Electric, in line with the Science-Based Targets Initiative, has pledged to fulfil 35% absolute CO2 reduction in scopes 1 & 2 by 2035 (baseline 2015) and 53% absolute CO2 reduction in scopes 1 & 2 by 2050 (baseline 2015). These are the minimum targets set, corresponding to a 2.1% year-on-year emission reduction from 2015. These targets will support the objective of achieving carbon neutrality for Schneider Electric and its ecosystem by 2030. The company has set up a dedicated carbon committee to drive these commitments. On the eve of the COP21, as part of its efforts to advocate energy efficiency, Schneider Electric stepped up its sustainable development objectives with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality for the company and its ecosystem over the next 15 years, through its products, solutions, R&D and industrial operations. Schneider Electric reinforced its commitments to sustainability at the Marrakech Climate Change Conference ( COP22 ) that concluded in Morocco, in November 2016 as an official event partner. \</doc>

UAE / COP 22 ABU DHABI, 6th November, 2016 (WAM) -- The United Arab Emirates, UAE, will participate in the meeting of parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to discuss how to advance international action to combat climate change. Morocco is hosting this year's conference from 7th to 18th November in Marrakech. During the UNFCCC's 22nd 'Conference of the Parties' ( COP 22 ), countries will set a road map to implement last year's Paris Agreement to address climate change. "Through Cop 22 "We also want to see a more coordinated approach to make ambitious targets and measures more effectively action on the ground in the UAE." Despite the country taking significant steps towards prioritising climate change, such as establishing the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, ratifying the Paris Agreement and announcing the development of the country's first National Climate Action Plan, Alam said more had to be done to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. He said the EWS-WWF will be attending the conference where they hope to work with government, business and civil society parties to drive action on climate change. Cop 22 follows last year's landmark Cop 21 agreement in Paris in December, during which 196 parties signed to pledge progressive policy actions to tackle climate change. \</doc>

Henrik Raber discusses the growth of green bonds and how they could develop throughout 2017 Green finance continues to feature strong- ly as policy makers push for more sustain- able energy sources in an era of growing concerns over climate change. Consequently, green bonds \- which are bonds that fund environmentally friendly businesses and assets \- have emerged as a key financing tool that is driving the global economy\' s transition to a greener future. Green bonds in numbers Last year was a record year for green bonds. Globally, the market saw some $86bn worth of issuances \- more than double the $42bn issued in 2015. And with the growth in volumes, the market also saw shifts in issuer profiles. Geographically, developing markets in Asia, predominantly China, became a key driver of volumes, accounting for 43 per cent of global green bonds issued in 2016. This was a marked growth from 10 per cent in 2015. Volumes from Chinese issuers alone grew from 7 per cent of total volumes in 2015, to 36 per cent in 2016, bolstered by accommodative regulations after the country\' s policy makers laid out clear guidelines on green bonds. Similarly, Indian issuers drove vol- umes to meet the ambitious renewable energy targets set by the country's cur- rent government. Encouragingly, the mix of green bond issuers continues to grow, add- ing breadth and variety to the mar- ket. Besides existing issuers (particu- larly developmental organisations), 2016 also saw new corporate entrants from developed markets (e.g., Apple, Toyota, Hyundai, Iberdrola) and emerging econ- omies (e.g., Hero Future Energies and Axis Bank from India, China Industrial Bank, Bank of Qingdao and Xinjiang Goldwind from China, and Bancolombia from Columbia). This trend highlights the growing acceptance and comfort among issuers toward green bonds. Green developments in the Middle East The Middle East continues to make good progress towards green growth and a low-carbon economy, providing signifi- cant opportunities for green bonds as a source of financing. The UAE recently announced its Power Plan 2050, which aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 70 per cent, increase clean energy use by 50 per cent and improve energy efficiency by 40 per cent by the middle of the century. This integration of renewable, nuclear and clean fossil energy will require an investment of Dhs600bn ($163.3bn) over the next 33 years, equivalent to an annual spend of more than Dhs17bn ($4.6bn). In Saudi Arabia, the kingdom has projects in the pipeline that are estimated to be worth between $30bn to $50bn by 2023, with the first clean energy projects set to add 10GW of capacity, mostly via wind and solar installations. Similarly, Jordan is planning 300MW of renewable projects this year. These project plans are clear signals of the direction and opportunities for green financing in the region. The Middle easT conTinues To Make good progress Towards green growTh and a low-carbon econoMy, providing significanT opporTuniTies for green bonds as a source of financing. Outlook in 2017 We expect 2017 to be another exciting year for green bonds, with market observ- ers expecting issuance volumes to top $100bn. The Conference of the Parties 22 ( COP22 ) conference in Marrakech last November showed that countries are now explicitly linking green bond plans to the delivery of national climate change plans. Poland has since become the first government to issue a green bond, which took place last December, and France has announced its intentions to issue a multi- billion euro-denominated green bond this April. Sweden is looking at ways to pro- mote the green bonds market, and devel- oping countries such as Nigeria are also in early stages of discussion to raise green financing with proceeds to fund solar power, transport, and forestry projects. As green bonds become more main- stream, we can also expect innovation to be as much a part of 2017 as it was in 2016. Last year we saw the first ever green Masala bond by NTPC and Asia\' s first green cov- ered bond by Bank Of China, showcasing the variety of formats available. On the back of all this activity, the market will be waiting to witness further financial innovation to fund the rapid expansion of renewables.

The Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week in Masdar City on 'Global Action Day', 16 January, and the 'World Future Energy Summit' from 17 to 19 January was being attended by the SABIC delegation. By providing the delegation with information about several up-and-running initiatives that are helping to promote the Kingdom's reputation as a regional leader in responsible and sustainable development, SABIC strengthened Saudi Arabia's participation in Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW). "Saudi Arabia is quickly emerging as a regional leader in sustainability," said Yousef Al-Benyan, vice chairman and CEO, SABIC, who is leading the company's delegation. "At SABIC, we are proud that some of our most important initiatives have helped progress on this journey, including the 'Home of Innovation', which is promoting sustainable downstream development, and the world's largest CO2 utilisation plant." "Examples such as these not only prove that Saudi Arabia places a great importance on sustainable development, but also that we have been working hard for many years to put practical solutions in place. This is 'Chemistry that Matters' to the long-term health of our society," Al-Benyan added. The Saudi delegation was building on the GCC's highly successful participation in the United Nations' Conference of Parties ( COP22 ), held in Morocco in November 2016. ADSW is a global platform to address the interconnected challenges that affect the widespread acceleration and adoption of sustainable development and clean energy. Because of its emerging regional sustainability leadership role as highlighted in the Saudi Vision 2030 and its advances in renewable energy, Saudi Arabia is a 'country of focus' for the event. Saudi delegates will highlight the country's major initiatives on 17January, during two panel discussions. During the panel entitled 'transforming the energy sector in Saudi Arabia to enable Vision 2030', Fahad Al-Sherehy, leader, SABIC T&I, will represent the company. The 'Home of Innovation', a project to foster downstream development through collaboration and innovation is one of the SABIC sustainable initiatives showcased at the event. Designed to achieve net-zero energy in the demanding climatic conditions of Saudi Arabia, the facility includes a demonstration house. The company achieved this efficiency by integrating innovative solutions in collaboration with industry-leading partners. Including many that reduce energy and water use, the home has over 200 advanced systems, materials and products. It would reduce CO2 emissions by the equivalent of six coal-fired power plants, if all homes in Saudi Arabia were as efficient as this demonstration house. At its manufacturing affiliate United in Jubail, SABIC has also built the world's largest CO2 capture and utilisation plant. Before purifying and distributing it to a network of affiliates to produce valuable products such as fertilisers, the plant is designed to capture up to 500,000 tons of CO2 from the production of ethylene glycol annually. While increasing efficiency and lowering costs, the project reduces emissions. SABIC's qualified sustainability solutions, which create less CO2 emissions than traditional materials during production or save more in other lifecycle phases, are featured prominently at the conference, including a wide range of solutions for use in transportation, construction, medical devices, electrical and electronics, clean energy, packaging, and agri-nutrients. By enabling the creation of productions that are lighter, stronger, thinner, more durable, better insulated or more easily manufactured, these solutions pass suitability benefits to customers. In 2026, SABIC's manufacturing operations utilised 3.3 million tons of CO2. SABIC is on the right path to meet ambitious targets to reduce green-house gas, energy and water intensities by 25 percent and material loss intensity by 50 percent by 2025 \- from the levels in 2010. Al-Benyan said: "Sustainability is helping SABIC to emerge as a global leader in the petrochemicals industry. Embedding sustainable practices in our global operations has resulted in many benefits such as energy savings, improved resource efficiency, technological innovation and cost savings."

Paris and Casablanca-based architects Oualalou + Choi in collaboration with French architect St\'e9phane Malka have designed a series of temporary structures at the COP22 Climate Conference in Marrakech, Morocco. Using traditional construction techniques, the designs respond to the country's architecture and climate. [caption id="attachment_52109" align="alignnone" width="450"] Image by Laurent Clement.[/caption] The buildings will be reused after the conference and distributed to local associations as a message of sustainability promoted at the event. One of the installations, entitled Ark22 (The Gateway), is made of identical wood elements without using any trimming or architectural sliding, sourced from local forests. The stacked timber modules have dual functions: concealing the interior and protecting it from the hot sun. Conceived as a "pointillist composition" measures 12 metres in height and 50 metres in length. [caption id="attachment_52111" align="alignnone" width="450"] Image by Luc Boegly.[/caption] The installation's construction method allows visitors to view its various appearances depending on where it is viewed from. [caption id="attachment_52112" align="alignnone" width="450"] A translucent and waterproof tented structure covers 12,000 square meters of space.[/caption] A large arch has been cut out of the centre of the structure's main fa\'e7ade which creates a dramatic opening, consisting of a layered composition of elevations. [caption id="attachment_52113" align="alignnone" width="450"] Image by Laurent Clement.[/caption] The installation will be completely dismantled after the summit and rebuilt within the city.

Global Summit ABU DHABI,13th December, 2016 (WAM) \- The Global Summit Of Women Speakers Of Parliament concluded today in Abu Dhabi issuing Abu Dhabi Declaration with a commitment to contribute to the realisation of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, the results of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The conference also stressed its willingness and duty to work together to address the challenges as well as conviction of the parliamentarian, that they must form a united front and work towards a better future with the other branches of power, the private sector, civil society and the community at large. Below is the full text of the Declaration: "We, women Speakers of Parliament from more than 30 countries, met on 12 and 13 December 2016 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, for the Global Summit of Women Speakers of Parliament, organized by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the UAE Federal National Council for the purpose of shaping the future of parliaments for a better world. (i) Affirming the 38 provisions of the Declaration of the Fourth World Conference of Speakers of Parliament entitled Placing democracy at the service of peace and sustainable development: Building the world the people want; and reiterating the principles and recommended actions of the summary report of the Tenth Meeting of Women Speakers of Parliament entitled Innovating for Gender Equality: Making development, peace and democracy a reality for women and men, (ii) Cognizant of the challenges our world is facing today, and of the geopolitical, socio-economic, environmental and technological megatrends, which are accelerating the pace of change, and which are likely to affect quality of life for generations to come, (iii) Committed to contributing to the realization of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, the results of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, (iv) Also committed to contributing to the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as to addressing all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, (v) Emphasizing that today's megatrends are intertwined and interdependent, and that tackling them requires a holistic approach, which encompasses geopolitical, socioeconomic, environmental, demographic and technological responses, (vi) Stressing our willingness and duty to work together to address the challenges we face, as well as our conviction that parliamentarians must form a united front and work towards a better future with the other branches of power, the private sector, civil society and the community at large, (vii) Asserting that solutions to the challenges that our world faces cannot be realized without democratic governance, respect for human rights and the achievement of gender equality at all levels throughout the world; and recalling that the attainment of gender equality is not only a question of human rights but also a matter of efficiency that would harness all the potential and talent required for innovation and transformation, (viii) Recognizing that young people should be included as active participants in the decisions we make, (ix) Convinced of the need to take account of the interests and aspirations of future generations in our parliamentary work, and committed to working for change through collective action, We stand: (1) "United for Shaping the Future" by committing to work together and forge partnerships across government, the private sector and society at large in order to address the challenges that our world faces; We agree that: (2) Peace and security. Our parliaments are crucial in the promotion and maintenance of peace and security. As representative institutions, through their legislative and oversight functions, they can take effective measures to prevent violence and conflict as well as to promote conflict resolution through peaceful means, including dialogue and reconciliation, with full respect for international law. Inter-parliamentary dialogue and cooperation can advance peace across nations. Winning the war on terrorism will require parliaments to come together and work with governments, civil society - including youth -, religious groups and leaders. Promoting peace and security is underpinned by democratic governance and institutions, the protection and promotion of human rights and the values of tolerance, inclusiveness, diversity, equality and dialogue. (3) Inclusive society. Regardless of gender, age, race, class, geography or religion, inclusive societies should empower their members. Marginalization can lead to violent extremism and even terrorism. While the world has made progress, much work remains to be done on every front, especially in the critical area of gender equality. To achieve a more inclusive society, parliaments must be more proactive in addressing discrimination and eliminating violence against women and girls. They should ensure that every woman, child and adolescent across the world survives, thrives and reaches their full potential. They should promote girls' education. Parliaments must also advance tolerance, economic equity, equal access to education and employment, women's economic empowerment, and equal participation in the political process, including decision-making institutions. (4) Economic prosperity and well-being. Megatrends across many sectors affect economic prosperity and well-being. Such trends include transformative innovation in science and technology, changing geopolitical landscapes, resource scarcity, insecurity, hyper-urbanization and aging populations. Major challenges for the global economy continue to include: high and persistent unemployment rates, especially among young people; high indebtedness in developed and developing countries; slow growth; and rising inequality. As such, parliaments need to develop holistic frameworks and action plans that tackle these challenges, address inequalities, take advantage of the opportunities created by the megatrends mentioned above and promote equitable and sustainable economic growth across and within nations. (5) Climate change and resource scarcity. Our parliaments can and should promote the ratification of the Paris Agreement and take all necessary action to implement it. They should implement the IPU Parliamentary Action Plan on Climate Change. Parliaments must enact practical and appropriate legislation and establish regulatory frameworks to progressively reduce their nations' carbon footprints, while continuing to grow their economies and to create opportunities for all, including the most marginalized. Through their legislative and oversight work, parliaments must promote the innovation needed to provide clean energy on a massive scale. They must contribute to protecting and ensuring the rational use of water resources. Parliaments must also consider legislation that will protect natural habitats, biodiversity and the overall ecosystem. Internationally, parliaments need to ensure funding that will preserve and rehabilitate the carbon sinks of the world. (6) Citizen participation. Parliaments now have tremendous opportunities to dramatically increase citizen participation through mobile communication platforms and social media; but they also need to enact appropriate legislation and work with governments and the judiciary to limit the abuse of mobile communications for criminal purposes or by terrorist organizations for political gain. (7) Advancing tolerance. Intolerance leads to violence, discrimination and terrorism. Parliaments can and should contribute to promoting tolerance through: legislation, policy-making and parliamentary debates; and by working with governments, the judiciary, civil society and religious leaders. Parliaments should lead by example, by acting with propriety as representative and inclusive institutions in their composition, processes and procedures. (8) Innovations in science and technology. Our quality of life could improve significantly as a result of scientific and technological innovation. However, this could come at a significant cost, unless parliaments begin to find ways of addressing the ethical and moral implications of technological advances, including: human rights such as privacy; global issues such as security; economic issues such as the digital divide leading to a larger knowledge divide; and employment such as humanoid robots replacing humans. We commit to: (9) Placing the well-being of our people, peace, prosperity, and the integrity of both our planet and humanity at the core of our parliamentary strategic objectives, and making them central to our development efforts; (11) Using the opportunities offered by the digital era to open up parliaments, engaging citizens in parliamentary processes and increasing international cooperation so as to narrow the digital divide between developed and developing countries. (12) Proposing to the IPU to consider an international parliamentary declaration on tolerance aiming at promoting and upholding human values and the principle of tolerance to advance peace and security and combat terrorism and violent extremism; (13) Working with all stakeholders, executive bodies, private sector and civil society representatives, especially young people, in order to implement the Sustainable Development Goals, which is our agenda for the future; (14) Sharing knowledge and experiences so as to promote democratic standards, tolerance and mutual respect, and to prepare for the future; Action imperatives: (15) Focusing on the future. (a) Encourage the IPU to consider establishing a structure on the future which would assess future changes and global trends as well as their impact on people's live, and which would mobilize efforts of parliaments and stakeholders in responding to these challenges; (b) Consider establishing in every parliament an appropriately resourced structure for horizon-scanning, such as a committee on the future and/or administrative unit on the future, which would inform parliament's legislative and oversight work regarding the implications of megatrends that affect our world, and which would act as a means to ensuring a better quality of life for future generations. (16) Strategic planning. (a) Develop new or modify existing strategic plans to better meet the challenges of the future, in light of the megatrends and challenges that we face today and are likely to face in the future.

Environment Ministry and GGGI With the UAE having recently concluded its participation in climate talks held at COP22 in Marrakech, the seminar titled 'Building on the UAE Innovation Week', was attended by over 45 students from various academic backgrounds who took the opportunity to engage with local and international experts on innovation and to hear the latest trends both in the UAE and around the world on the fight against climate change. In the face of global climate change, resource scarcity and environmental degradation, the government of the UAE has begun the transition to an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable development model by adopting a national green growth plan that emphasises opportunities for a prosperous, inclusive and climate-resilient future. The environment ministry is in the final phases of drafting the National Climate Change Plan, which will chart the path of climate change mitigation and adaptation. "The UAE recognises the importance of students and young people in coming up with innovative responses to climate challenges," said Dr. Thani Al-Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment. "Engaging with young people and hearing from them is a priority for our leadership. They are creative and tech-savvy and we must harness their energy to achieve our goals of a sustainable economic and environmental future for our nation." The seminar comes as part of the Green Growth Youth Programme, which kicked off in 2015 with an introductory workshop and continued in 2016 with a number of student internships at GGGI's office in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi. "Engaging the youth in green growth and climate change subjects is one of the most important aspects of the GGGI programme in the UAE," said Dr. Frank Rijsberman, Director General, GGGI. "We are very happy to achieve concrete progress since the launch of the youth programme last year. Building on the accumulated efforts, GGGI UAE will continue to invest in the coming years in youth training and internships," he said. \</doc>

UAE / Marrakech MARRAKECH, 14th November, 2016 (WAM) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) joined the Mission Innovation countries which came together today here at the UN climate change conference, COP22 , in Marrakech, Morocco, to report on developments one year on from its launch. Mission Innovation, a consortium of 20 countries each pledging to double their research and development (R&D) spending on clean energy technologies. It aims to reinvigorate and accelerate global clean energy innovation with the objective to make clean energy widely affordable. In addition, a number of innovation challenges were launched to target development of energy technologies that will accelerate the clean energy transition. Innovation Challenges are global calls to action aimed at accelerating research, development, and demonstration (R&D) in technology areas where MI members believe increased international attention would make a significant impact in shared fight against climate change. Dr. Mattar Al Neyadi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Energy, said the UAE backed the Mission Innovation's initiatives which would contribute to employ innovation in clean energy through a public-private partnership on research and development (R&D). He stated that last year seven challenges were defined, notably Affordable Heating and Cooling of Buildings Innovation Challenge with the objective to make low-carbon heating and cooling affordable for everyone. 'Globally, buildings account for almost a third of final energy consumption, with space heating and cooling, and the provision of hot water, accounting for approximately half of this consumption. The ultimate goal of the affordable heating and cooling of buildings Innovation Challenge is to develop core building heating and cooling systems and measures to improve building envelopes that deliver affordable heating and cooling without the carbon emissions,' he said. Cooling currently represents a smaller proportion of global energy demand, though it is an area of significant future growth, with an 80 percent increase in space cooling demand anticipated by 2050 in emerging and developing economies. Increasing global temperatures resulting from the effects of climate change will also contribute significantly to this growth, he noted. Outlining the UAE's efforts in this respect, he explained that Estidama, an Abu Dhabi building design methodology for constructing and operating buildings and communities more sustainably, has reduced gas emissions by up to 35 percent. He added that Al Safat, a Dubai green building rating system, aims to reduce the consumption of electricity by 20 percent, water consumption by 15 per cent, carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent and waste by as much as 50 per cent. \</doc>

Climate change will be the world's biggest challenge over the next decade, according to a global survey of young people carried out by Masdar, the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company. Unveiled at COP22 Carried out earlier this year to coincide with Masdar's 10-year anniversary, the survey spoke to nearly 5,000 Post-Millennials in 20 countries across the Middle East & North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Europe and Asia. The survey clearly illustrates the level of concern among young people about climate change, with 40% of those interviewed naming it among the biggest challenges facing the world in the next decade, ahead of the economy (34%), terrorism (32%), poverty & inequality (29%) and unemployment (29%). Eight in ten (83%) Post-Millennials also said governments need to listen more to young people about sustainability. A similar number (80%) believe current leaders have not done enough to protect the environment. Almost two in three (59%) said they are interested in working or studying in an area related to sustainability. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said: "There is huge demand among our youth for corporate and public investment in clean technology and renewable energy. The winners in the green economy will be those who can harness this youthful idealism and combine it with regulations, long-term investment, cultural change and political action." The survey found that around half of Generation Z (46%) have chosen to spend more money on products from a company that behaves sustainably, and 31% have boycotted a company that they perceived as following unsustainable practices. Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO of Masdar, said: "Over the last 10 years, the clean energy industry has become one of the world's most exciting and dynamic growth markets. As we look ahead, the findings of our global survey provide an important insight into the action required to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy and clean technologies."

Aug. 23 -- In April, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), a United Nations body, released its latest 'Status of the Global Climate' report, which detailed the string of climate and weather records that were broken in 2015 worldwide. Given the upward trend we've seen in recent years, it's unsurprising that 2015 shattered all previous records, including global temperature records, with exceptional rainfall, devastating droughts, unusual cyclone activity and intense heatwaves around the world. "The year 2015 will stand out in the historical record of the global climate in many ways," said WMO experts. These shocking statistics serve as a timely and critical reminder of the sheer scale of destruction climate change is having on our planet and the stark outlook for its future. It is imperative that action is taken now. Finding solutions to these problems is not always clear, particularly when improving energy security and addressing climate change may seem to be two conflicting goals. Countries are challenged with achieving reliable and affordable energy supplies, while at the same time reducing emissions into the atmosphere. In December 2015, a historic agreement to combat climate change was reached at COP21, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. For the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, all 195 country members reached a universal agreement on climate change, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2C. As a member of the UNFCCC, the GCC has pledged to implement a number of green initiatives to drive the global green agenda which include; renewable energy initiatives, R&D in technology, water conservation and energy efficiency improvements. More recently, in April this year, representatives of States from all around the world, visited New York to sign the original text of the Paris agreement on Climate Change which was first adopted at December's Conference of the Parties (COP) 2015. Some 171 countries signed the landmark deal, which sets the ambitious goal of limiting warming to below 2 degrees Celsius; a record number for a new international treaty. The participation of states this time around was truly overwhelming and proved the willingness of parties to commit to common processes which will in turn lead to the agreement at an international level. However, for the agreement to come into force, 55 states need to accept the agreement and those 55 ratifications need to come from States that represent 55% of total greenhouse gas emissions. This is also against the World Bank's estimate that over the next 15 years, the global economy will require $89 trillion in infrastructure investments and $4.1 trillion in incremental investment for the low-carbon transition to keep within the new international sub-2 degrees Celsius goal. Following the landmark Paris COP21 meetings, a further meeting of the Conference of Parties ( COP22 ) with the UNFCCC will be held in Marrakech, Morocco, in November this year, at which many of the top decisions struck in the French capital will be fleshed out into action plans. This includes continued work on the determined commitments for reducing country carbon emissions and an even stronger emphasis on the action plans for regions, cities, businesses and the civil society, where the World Green Economy Summit 2016 will be a key contributing platform. For two years now, Dubai has hosted the World Green Economy Summit (WGES) to continue its steady and forward march aiming to achieve its ambition to become "The Global Capital of the Green Economy", facilitate a platform for green leaders to come together to discuss partnerships and develop cleaner and green initiatives to create a sustainable future. This year WGES 2016, under the new theme of 'Driving the Global Green Economy', will help the region follow up on commitments made through the Dubai Declaration and create strong links to the UN Climate Agreement 2015 and the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 following the directions set at COP22 in Marrakech. Dubai is taking major strides to drive the green economy, with a series of initiatives announced over the past 12 months. In November 2015, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, announced the launch of Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which sets a target for the provision of 7 per cent of Dubai's energy from clean energy sources by 2020, increasing to 25 per cent by 2030 and 75 per cent by 2050. To further the region's green economy, DEWA announced in January 2016 that it has opened consultancy tenders for a Dh100 billion green fund - the Dubai Green Fund. As part of the region's wider green energy investment programme, the "Dubai Green Fund" will provide financing for investors in Dubai's clean energy, and affirms the Emirate's commitment towards pioneering green initiatives and sustainability. In addition to the Green Fund, Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050 will also see the planned capacity of Dubai's Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park upgraded to 5,000 megawatts from 3,000MW previously. The Solar Park, which is the largest single-site strategic renewable energy project of its kind in the world, is a testament to the region's commitment to building and developing a greener economy, to achieve the UAE Vision 2021 of a truly sustainable environment with the lowest carbon footprint in the world. We are very proud of the UAE's achievements. We have accomplished significant success in photovoltaic energy. Energy, sustainability and new sources of power are all themes that are on the global agenda, as the world faces growing challenges with fluctuating oil prices. We have identified sustainability as a key theme in our upcoming Dubai Expo 2020 in recognising the undisputable fact that all economies have to focus on green strategies. 2016 is a pivotal year for Dubai and its continuation of green industry development. With the announcement of Dubai's Clean Energy Strategy 2050, the initiatives related to water and energy management programmes will get additional momentum and really showcase the regions ability to have a green voice on a global level. This year, Dubai's World Green Economy Summit (WGES), will be the perfect platform for the region to showcase how far it's come in just two years and shine a spotlight on exciting plans for the future.

World Green Economy Summit / launch The 2016 Summit is its third edition and is a leading platform for sustainability and the green economy and runs in conjunction with the 18th session of Water, Energy and Environment Exhibition (WETEX) and Dubai Solar Show 2016. The summit's opening ceremony will present a comprehensive update on the implementation and achievements of the previous Dubai Declaration, pave the way for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, and outline the expected contributions of WGES 2016. Throughout the two-day event, delegates in the field of green economy will collaborate on topics that are on the top of the global agenda, including renewable energy, green funding, innovation, smart technology and cities, and more. The summit will also host a plenary session titled "The Road to COP22 in Marrakech: Bringing the Paris deal from agreement to action", expected to establish the foundations for further progress in climate change mitigation to be made. "Under the wise leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed the UAE's 2021 Vision stipulates six priorities areas, among which achieving sustainable development in parallel to economic and social development is key. The green economy forms a core pillar of this priority area, and requires collaboration between top decision-makers and experts in the public and private sector. To this end, the summit, which aims to make Dubai the Global Capital of the Green Economy, has established itself as the leading platform for environmental and economic development, which falls directly in line with the UAE's efforts to achieve this vision," Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Managing Director and CEO of DEWA, and Chairman of WGES, said while commenting on the progress made thus far. "Such progress in a two-year time frame is considerable, and has set the stage for even greater success via the WGES summits. With this in mind, WGES 2016 aims to achieve strategic objectives that complement the key commitments contained in Dubai Declaration: to help promote Dubai's position as a global capital of green economy and sustainable development; to raise the profile of key issues such as Clean Energy, The Green Fund and the development of a dedicated Green Business Zone; and to maintain WGES as the premier international platform for Green Economy. With the guidance of its wide leadership, the UAE has already achieved many milestones in its mission to driving the global green economy \- and through the WGES platform and other initiatives, it is clear that the path to make Dubai the capital of this economy is not only achievable, but within reach," he added. \</doc>

Up to 600 mosques in Morocco will be refurbished based on 'energy-saving' contracts in partnership with departments from the German government. The project forms part of Morocco's aims to generate employment, especially with regards sustainability as the country prepares to host the COP22 summit this November. According to a statement released by Germany'sFederal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the programme will support Morocco "in modernising the energy use of itsmosques". Technology expected to be used for the project includes LED lighting, photovoltaic systems,and solar water heaters. The statement continued: "The idea is to use mosques as a startingpoint for the diffusion of these technologies, hereby creating amarket for private services in the field of energy efficiency thatcould afterwards be enlarged towards other public buildings insectors such as education or health. "With such market development[s],the government [of Morocco] aims to boost the creation of greenjobs." The refurbishment and sustainability model implemented for the mosques will be "transferred to two further public sectors", BMZ has confirmed. The following pages outline the intricacies of Morocco's programme to refurbish its mosques. [[banner]] NEXT PAGE: MEET THE CLIENTS [[page-break]] Who is involved? BMZ's statement listsMorocco's Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment as the programme's lead executing agency. Supporting partners include the country's Ministry of Islamic Affairs, National Agency for the Development of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, and state energy investment company Soci\'e9t\'e9 d\' Investissements \'c9nerg\'e9tiques. The project's term isJanuary 2015 to March 2019, at a total cost of $5.58m (EUR5m). [[banner]] NEXT PAGE: CONTRACT TERMS [[page-break]] Contract terms Under the 'energy-saving' contract model,Moroccan companies will bear the financial and technicalrisks of the installations. In the programme's first phase, at least 600mosques across Morocco will be equipped with LED lighting,photovoltaic systems, and solar water heaters. UK daily Guardian reported that the Moroccan ministry of Islamic affairsis "underwriting" the contract, and will pay up to "70% of the initial investment costs in a partnership with the German government". BMZ said in its statement thatthis contractual framework means service providers are paid from the savings they achieve. [[banner]] NEXT PAGE: TRAINING AND O&M [[page-break]] Training Education and training will form a key component of the programme between Morocco and Germany. "It will be necessary to train Moroccancompanies and their employees," BMZ's report stated. "Indeed, demand for services inthis area remains low, and only a few local companies providethem, often with a workforce that lacks the skills to plan, installand maintain plants appropriately. "The project also aims to raiseawareness for efficient energy and renewable energy amongdecision makers, multipliers \- such as imams and teachers inmosques, as well as the broad public." Training modules will also be offered on managementand marketing skills so local companies can boost the national uptake of sustainable technologies, BMZ confirmed. These training sessions are also expected to aid local companies as they perform installation and maintenance works on public buildings. [[banner]] \</doc>

Saudi Aramco showcased a range of sustainability initiatives \- including clean energy technology and carbon management solutions \- at the state-of-the-art Saudi Pavilion in the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week 2017, held during 12-21 January 2017. "Our presence here is to support the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's aspiration in tackling climate change and meeting its sustainable goals. Our goal is to present a suite of technologies and initiatives that are market relevant and acceptable energy solutions, which helps to address Kingdom and global challenges and aspirations for a cleaner future," said Ahmad O Al Khowaiter, chief technology officer, Saudi Aramco. Saudi Aramco's presence at the event was in line with the Kingdom's energy transformation agenda, which will see them working with relevant stakeholders in driving forward a solid and sustainable energy framework to meet the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement, which was ratified by Saudi Arabia in 2016 prior to COP 22 . Al Khowaiter also participated in a panel session titled 'The Role of Technology and Innovation in Enabling the Energy Sector Transformation,' which was within the work stream 'Focus on Saudi Arabia: How Economic Transformation Will Fast-track Investment in Renewables'. During the session, Al Khowaiter explained in great detail about the company's pivotal role in improving energy efficiency in the industry. "Efficiency is clearly the key to achieve sustainable energy solutions. We at Saudi Aramco view sustainability as a strategic research area to produce cleaner energy technology," Al Khowaiter said. "We are also committed to explore the vast potentials of renewables such as wind and solar. It will take time as we find the right economics, but we are surely getting there," Al Khowaiter added. Al Khowaiter said that ultimately, the goal is to close the carbon cycle by using all available resources whether hydrocarbon-based or alternatives. "We see CO2 as a future feedstock for the world; plants convert CO2 from the atmosphere to sustain life as we know it, and our emphasis should be on closing the carbon cycle through innovative solutions," Al Khowaiter observed. Al Khowaiter said Saudi Aramco is playing a significant role for the Kingdom by investing in scalable solutions, turning emissions into value-added products, and leveraging its long standing expertise in minimising greenhouse gas emissions. Earlier, Saudi Aramco announced a renewable energy milestone with the commissioning of the Kingdom's first wind turbine in Turaif. The project, developed in partnership with GE, marked a turning point in the Kingdom's plan towards realising the 9.5 gigawatt national renewable energy target defined in Saudi Vision 2030.

Dubai Municipality/climate change The Dubai Municipality's climate change policy is an extension of the initiatives and projects undertaken by the emirate at the corporate level to adapt to the impact of this phenomenon and support the process of transforming Dubai into a low-carbon green economy, Hussein Nasser Lootah, Director General of Dubai Municipality, said on the occasion. The municipality has become one of the first government entities to produce a corporate climate change policy that will make Dubai number one in all fields, he noted. The policy outlines the main climate change issues which must be addressed, targeting both the reduction of emissions (mitigation) and adaptation to the impact of climate change with regard to all operations and activities of municipality services at the level of the emirate. This policy is also in conjunction with many other programmes and initiatives adopted by the municipality in dealing with climate change, which includes the Car Free Day initiative, Blue Carbon Project, Coastal Protection Project, as well as projects concerned with the extraction of methane gas from the landfills, and waste-to-energy, he said. The policy was developed using examples of international best practices, he revealed. "These were not only from government sources, but from climate change policies of large international private sector corporations such as Intel and the Coca-Cola. Their corporate policies have paved the way for the implementation of many successful programmes and initiatives for climate change mitigation and adaptation," Lootah said. The policy is in line with the Dubai Strategic Plan 2021, launched by the Executive Council of Dubai, headed by H.H. Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council. It is also aligned with the UAE Vision 2021, which acknowledges that effects of climate change caused by human activities may already be occurring and could get worse in the future. The vision expects the UAE to find ways to adapt to the expected impact of climate change by reducing vulnerabilities (weaknesses) by increasing the flexibility of communities, and environmental and economic systems, including the productive sectors and vital infrastructure. The policy is a commitment of the government to take all necessary measures to protect the environment and conserve the natural resources of the emirate from the impacts of climate change, stated Alia Al Harmoudi, Director of the Environment Department. Its main objectives are to spread awareness and knowledge about climate change, increase institutional capacities to manage this phenomenon, and facilitate collaboration amongst local and federal authorities to combat climate change, she added. The launch of the policy is also in conjunction with the preparations in the UAE and the Emirate of Dubai for its participation at the 22nd Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention of the Parties on Climate Change ( COP22 ), which will be held in Marrakech, Morocco from 7th to 18th, November. \- AAMIR \</doc>

UAE and Norway / aid NEW YORK, 23rd September, 2016 (WAM) \- The UAE and Norway today convened top development and humanitarian actors to spearhead greater health services for women and children in humanitarian settings, under the Every Woman Every Child Everywhere initiative. Globally, over 50 per cent of preventable deaths of mothers and children under the age of five occur in disaster and conflict situations. As part of the meeting, held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and two summits on refugees and migrants, Reem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemi, Minister of State for International Cooperation, also announced a new aid package to Yemen that will mainstream maternal and children's health in emergency response. "The statistics alone provide a moral imperative for action, but there is a longer-term rationale that we in the UAE know first-hand from our own national experience, and that is, healthy, educated, empowered women lead to healthy, educated, empowered societies," Al Hashemi said. "We are honoured to work with Norway and the humanitarian and development communities on ensuring health services for women and children in all settings. A country or region will never get back on its feet when preventable deaths of children and their caregivers are a standard part of life," she stated. A coalition of around fifty of the largest and most innovative humanitarian and development organisations, the Everywhere initiative was launched in Abu Dhabi two years ago under the patronage of H.H. Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, Chairwoman of the General Women's Union (GWU), Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation (FDF) and President of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood. At its most recent meeting in Abu Dhabi earlier this year, the partners defined a minimum package of health services that should be provided to women and children in humanitarian settings and deployed simultaneously with education, energy, water and sanitation, and food, among other basic services. The initiative also works with development actors to plan for women and children when humanitarian situations arise, and promotes models where women are used as first-responders and equal decision-makers in humanitarian response. The initiative is co-chaired by Her Royal Highness Princess Sarah Zeid of Jordan and Kate Gilmore, the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights. "Everywhere's advocacy has broken new ground in terms of awareness, and we now need to ensure that reform happens on the programmatic level," Al Hashemi said. "The co-operation between Everywhere in the UAE and Yemen will provide concrete lessons on how humanitarian operations can be designed, executed, and evaluated for performance on women and children's health," she added. The UAE's new humanitarian package for Yemen includes $10.8 million for health services through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). It complements Everywhere's success in including humanitarian situations in the WHO-led Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health, which is backed by the multi-billion dollar Global Financing Facility. "The Everywhere initiative has made remarkable progress in such a short time since its launch in Abu Dhabi," said Lana Nusseibeh, the UAE's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations. "It identified a major gap in the architecture of humanitarian and development interventions, and we are already seeing a shift, with humanitarian situations and their prevention now becoming an explicit part of the UN global approach on health and women for the first time." Norway and the UAE announced that they would continue the work stream with a focus on the growing presence of female and child refugees in urban areas, linked to October's UN summit on sustainable cities (Habitat III), and on climate impacts on women's and children's health, linked to the COP22 climate negotiations in November. Speakers at the event included Elhadj As Sy, the Secretary-General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC); David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee (IRC); Kevin Jenkins, President and CEO of World Vision; Kyung-wha Kang, Assistant Secretary-General, UN OCHA; Sarah Fountain Smith, Canada's Assistant Deputy Minister of Global Affairs; Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank; Pierre Krahenbuhl, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA); and Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director-General of WHO. Deputy Foreign Minister Tone Skogen represented Norway, one of the most prominent donors to international health and gender equality efforts. The UAE and Norway are consistently ranked among the top three most generous donors globally. \</doc>

Morocco has lifted a ban on calls made through mobile internet connections, its national telecoms regulator said, as reported by Reuters. The Telecommunications Regulatory National Agency (ANRT) had previously said telecom services such as phone calls need licences whether they are Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or others. "The decision (to lift the ban) comes after the ANRT's evaluation of the telecom national and international markets, the legal context and taking into consideration the requirements to develop a sector that benefits customers," the regulator said. The ban affected the two most-used applications in Morocco Skype and WhatsApp, along with Facebook and Viber and other providers of VoIP services. Lifting the ban came as the kingdom prepares to host the 2016 United Nations climate change conference and only few days after the head of ANRT was sacked. Mobile phone market penetration is running at around 140 percent of Morocco's 34 million population, and the country had 10 million Internet subscribers by the end in 2015, up more than 60 percent from 2013. \</doc>

UAE becomes first country to join World Green Economy Organisation MARRAKESH, Morocco, 16th November, 2016 (WAM) -- Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, has announced that the UAE is now the first member of the World Green Economy Organisation, WGEO. Al Zeyoudi said, "The Green Economy for Sustainable Development initiative launched in 2012, and the Green Agenda 2015-2030, set the course for our economic growth ambitions, social development priorities and environmental sustainability goals. The advancement of the UAE's green economy efforts couldn't have been made without the strong support from the UN and relevant international organisations. Most notably, the Global Green Growth Institute, GGGI, the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP, the Green Growth Knowledge Platform, GGKP, the Partnership for Action on Green Economy, PAGE, the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, and the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA. "I am confident that through WGEO, we will have significant impact on knowledge and experience sharing which would help to overcome common challenges and to ensure successful achievement of our common green economy goals," he added. Dr. Zeyoudi made these remarks during the announcement of the global launch of WGEO at the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties, COP 22 , in Marrakesh, Morocco. Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, World Green Economy Organisation and Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, said that the WGEO, which was launched by President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum at the 3rd World Green Economy Summit in Dubai, will support the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and increase global awareness on climate change to enhance the shift towards a green economy. The announcement was attended by Sheikh Sultan bin Hamdan Al Nahyan, Advisor to the UAE President, Suhail bin Mohammed Al Mazrouei, UAE Minister of Energy, Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, Suhail Mattar Al Ketbi, the UAE Ambassador to Morocco, Mohammed Abunayyan, Chairman of ACWA Power, and representatives of the UN agencies, the public and private sectors, financial institutions, non-profit-organisations, and civil society organisations. "It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the global announcement of the World Green Economy Organisation. This great initiative came under the wise vision of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, as an international organisation during the third World Green Economy Summit, WGES, in Dubai on 5th October 2016, and is supported by the UAE and the United Nations Development Programme. I would like to thank the United Nations for its pioneering role in raising global awareness about climate change," said Al Tayer. "Launching WGEO at this time reflects the relentless efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals outlined in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WGEO will also play an instrumental role in mitigating climate change, as it serves as a mechanism for generating new solutions for sustainable energy, water and other environmental challenges, thereby lowering the risk of green economy investments, and supporting international cooperation in innovation, technology and finance. As Dubai is emerging as a global hub for green economy, we are celebrating today the announcement of the global launch of the WGEO and I would like to take this opportunity to give you a glimpse into the efforts of the UAE to become a green economy," he added. "To meet the environmental challenges facing most countries in the world and to spread a culture of sustainability, we must have a global movement towards a green economy. These principles are firmly embedded within the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 for clean energy to provide 7% of Dubai's total power output by 2020, rising to 25% by 2030, and 75% by 2050. The strategy consists of five main pillars: infrastructure, legislation, funding, building capacities and skills, and an environmentally-friendly energy mix. The strategy is underpinned by an expected investment of US$13 billion in the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is the largest single-site solar park in the world, with a planned capacity of 5,000 megawatts by 2030," he added. "These efforts culminate today in this announcement pertaining to the World Green Economy Organisation, which will be permanently based in Dubai, to pioneer a new approach to promoting green economy by bringing together governments, the private sector, foundations, United Nations agencies, banking systems and society, to unite to achieve green economic goals and serve as a catalyst for generating new integrated solutions to climate change, sustainable energy, water and other environmental challenges around the world. "In line with its global mandate, WGEO will significantly contribute to the implementation of the Paris climate agreement, COP 21, to shift to a green economy, a low-carbon economy that is climate-resilient, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive. WGEO will bridge the gaps between countries in innovation, technology and finance. It will provide technical assistance to countries who can benefit from Dubai's green economy model, as well as models from other countries whose economies demand the development of strong, robust and diverse green strategies for the future," he added. "WGEO will also benefit from technical support from the UNDP office in the UAE, as well as advisory support services from UNDP's Arab States Regional Centre. In addition, WGEO will serve as a global platform to accelerate the shift towards a green economy. The WGEO's mandate blends with the UAE's green and sustainable development strategy, exemplified by the 'Green Economy for Sustainable Development' initiative launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, for the UAE to be among the world's leading countries and a global hub for the export and re-export of green products and technologies. We welcome the collaboration with the United Nations Development Program to strengthen the WGEO's position as a reference point for a green economy, to support productive dialogue between countries on best practices for a green economy, provide technical support, and help the green economy to create jobs," he added. He continued, "We remain committed to our continued development of innovative business models for energy and transport, such as power-purchase agreements for solar energy, which have already resulted in lowering the price of solar power per kilowatt hour. "We are proud to say that WGEO will join the global efforts to combat climate change at COP 22 . The UAE's efforts to support the transition to a green economy are underlined by its contribution and commitment to reduce carbon emissions, which formed the basis of the historic Paris Agreement, signed at the Paris Climate Conference and committing to cap the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 Degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and limit the increase to 1.5 Degrees Celsius. It is pertinent that the launch of WGEO is aligned to the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to develop the Dubai Green Free Zone, which will be dedicated to attracting mature and emerging companies in clean energy. The Dubai Green Free Zone will become a global hub to attract R&D and innovative clean energy companies. It also supports the launch of the 27 billion US Dollar Green Energy Fund, which reflects Dubai's efforts to support local, national and international projects to achieve a green economy. I would like to extend my good wishes for the success of COP 22 , and I hope to meet you in Dubai during the World Green Economy Summit 2017," concluded Al Tayer. Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, said, "Once operational, the World Green Economy Organisation can serve as a new platform for green, low-carbon, climate resilient solutions in developing countries, building on UAE's role as a new global partner for climate action." WGEO will strengthen cooperation among world countries in green economy. When he launched WGEO at World Green Economy Summit 2016, H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, emphasised that the organisation will fulfil its mission to promote green economy regionally and globally, support dialogue among countries, while providing them with consultation and financial, moral, and technical support. It will be a major point of reference for research and studies on clean energy and the protection of humans and the environment. It is expected that the new organisation will be supported by many countries and international organisations. Many countries will join the organisation, which is supported by Dubai Government in cooperation and partnership of UNDP. The World Green Economy Summit 2016 was held under the patronage of H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and it concluded by announcing the 3rd Dubai Declaration, which emphasised Dubai's ongoing efforts to be a smarter, greener, and happier city, and to claim its position as a global hub for green economy. The Dubai Declaration also includes establishment of a green projects zone, provision of job opportunities in green economy areas, and promotion of the position of the new World Green Economy Organisation, which will be based in Dubai, as a main reference for the green economy. \</doc>

Oct. 5 -- The World Green Economy Summit (WGES) 2016, held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, is set to open tomorrow (05 October 2016) at Dubai International Convention and Exhibitions Centre in New Za£beel Hall 6. The 2016 Summit marks the third edition of the Summit, the leading platform for sustainability and the green economy. The Summit's opening ceremony will present a comprehensive update on the implementation and achievements of the previous Dubai Declaration, pave the way for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, and outline the expected contributions of WGES 2016. Throughout the two-day event, delegates in the field of green economy will collaborate on topics that are on the top of the global agenda, including renewable energy, green funding, innovation, smart technology and cities, and more. The Summit will also host a plenary session titled "The Road to COP22 in Marrakech: Bringing the Paris deal from agreement to action", expected to establish the foundations for further progress in climate change mitigation to be made. H.E. Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Managing Director and CEO of DEWA, and Chairman of WGES, commented on the progress made thus far: "Under the wise leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the UAE's 2021 Vision stipulates six priorities areas, among which achieving sustainable development in parallel to economic and social development is key. The green economy forms a core pillar of this priority area, and requires collaboration between top decision-makers and experts in the public and private sector. To this end, the World Green Economy Summit, which aims to make Dubai the Global Capital of the Green Economy, has established itself as the leading platform for environmental and economic development, which falls directly in line with the UAE's efforts to achieve this vision." H.E. Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer added: "Such progress in a two-year time frame is considerable, and has set the stage for even greater success via the WGES summits. With this in mind, WGES 2016 aims to achieve strategic objectives that complement the key commitments contained in Dubai Declaration: to help promote Dubai's position as a global capital of green economy and sustainable development; to raise the profile of key issues such as Clean Energy, The Green Fund and the development of a dedicated Green Business Zone; and to maintain WGES as the premier international platform for Green Economy. With the guidance of its wide leadership, the UAE has already achieved many milestones in its mission to driving the global green economy - and through the WGES platform and other initiatives, it is clear that the path to make Dubai the capital of this economy is not only achievable, but within reach." Among the objectives for WGES' 2014 inauguration was to define the elements of green economy and lay the foundations for long-term success. The Dubai Declaration was announced at the Summit's conclusion with this in mind - a series of commitments with various components, adapted further after each summit, and which continues to be delivered against. Dubai has since supported top international organizations in the Road to Paris, the process for which was actually initiated at WGES 2014, continued at WGES 2015, and concluded at COP 21 with the historic signing of the Paris Climate Agreement with the UAE's key contributions. Further, innovation was put at the forefront of all activities in the Declaration, and various initiatives have subsequently launched, including smart apps, the implementation of electric vehicles in Dubai, and the announcement of Dubai as the host of the Solar Decathlon in 2018 and 2020, the latter coinciding with Dubai World Expo. Finally, the Declaration stipulated that a plan be drawn out to establish a public-private partnership platform (PPP) to facilitate matchmaking relevant to green economy, which has been achieved, and that an annual report on the green economy to showcase and track Dubai's progress be published, for which the third edition is currently in the pipeline. For the 2015 summit, the goal was to build upon common commitments and event outcomes - collaborating for green economy solutions, and employing bottom-up advocacy to reach a global climate deal. The second edition of the Dubai Declaration therefore, focused on three major areas. The establishment of Dubai as the international capital of the green economy remained a top priority, and following, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050. The ambitious strategy envisages every roof in the Emirate equipped with solar panels by 2030, and aims to provide 7% of Dubai's energy from clean energy sources by 2020, 25% by 2030 and 75% by 2050, by which time Dubai is planned to become the city with the lowest carbon footprint. The strategy is the first of its kind in the region, and cements the UAE's legacy in sustainability. Additionally, global partnerships were prioritised, and Dubai's own experiences and relationships through WGES helped guide the UAE's essential negotiations at COP 21. Finally, green funding continued to play a critical role, and work has since been initiated on the Dubai Green Energy Fund and the development of an international green finance network, which will accelerate green projects and investments in Dubai and beyond, with more to come in WGES 2016. WGES 2016 is hosted by the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), under the umbrella of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, in collaboration with World Climate Ltd, international partners, and supported by the United Nations. The Summit runs in conjunction with the 18th session of Water, Energy & Environment Exhibition (WETEX) and Dubai Solar Show 2016.

ABU DHABI, 23rd August, 2016 (WAM) \- With the cost of solar energy plummeting, the World Future Energy Summit 2017 (WFES) will showcase an unprecedented range of financially profitable clean energy solutions, opening up opportunities for green tech companies as the MENA region moves to achieve ambitious sustainability targets. Figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that the installed cost of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) solar generation in the UAE fell around 75 per cent between 2008 \- the year of WFES' first edition \- and mid-2014, dropping from US$7 per watt to less than $1.5 per watt. In late 2014, bids to build a 100MW PV project in Dubai broke world records for cost-competitiveness, with the lowest bid at US5.8 cents per KWh. By June 2016, a Masdar-led consortium won the bidding for phase three of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park with a levelled cost of electricity of just US2.99 cents per KWh. Masdar CEO, Mohamed Al Ramahi, said, "The MENA region's appetite for investment in renewables has grown with the decline in cost and advancement in technological efficiency. This has further driven the growth of the market. Renewable energy is now an efficient and commercially attractive means to address growing energy demand. Regional leaders such as Masdar, and platforms such as the World Future Energy Summit, which is held during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, the largest sustainability gathering in the region, have been helping to drive the industry forward and reinforce the business case behind diversifying our regional energy-mix." WFES was created to drive the business of clean energy, offering a marketplace where suppliers of new technology can connect with buyers. Since 2008, the economics of that marketplace have changed dramatically, and WFES 2017 brings together solutions that are not only sustainable, but are increasingly the more cost-effective option. That is especially true when the long-term returns required for new-build infrastructure are factored in. Part of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) from 16th to 19th January, and hosted by Masdar, WFES 2017 will bring together ADSW's theme of 'Practical Steps Towards a Sustainable Future', with the WFES goal, 'Sustaining the Clean Energy Consensus, Empowering New Players'. Deals made at WFES have been at the centre of a surge in renewables across the MENA region, particularly solar power. Some of the key projects in the GCC include a 100 MW utility-scale plant due to open in Mecca in 2018, Kuwait has signed a contract for a $385 million, 50MW plant; in Abu Dhabi the Shams concentrated solar power (CSP) project went online in 2013. Scheduled to follow the 2016 COP 22 meeting in Morocco and annual sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, WFES 2017 will bring together the world's leading renewable energy professionals, policy makers, innovators and investors. The 2016 edition hosted 30,000 attendees from 150 countries, and 600 exhibiting companies. Along with WFES itself, the four-day exhibition and conference programme now features five co-located events highlighting targeted aspects of sustainability. Each event makes a strong business case for innovation within its field. Among these, International Water Summit (IWS) in partnership with ADWEA emphasizes water security issues, while EcoWaste, in partnership with Tadweer, offers solutions that turn environmental waste into a valued resource. For 2017, WFES Solar Expo and WFES Energy Efficiency Expo are being expanded as co-located events, showcasing the latest in solar technology and smart building solutions. The WFES Sustainable Transport Zone will also return, offering the latest solutions in energy-efficient vehicles. WFES, the centrepiece exhibition, will be the largest-ever gathering of renewable energy and sustainability experts in the Middle East and North Africa, hosting prominent global thought leaders from the public, private, and academic sectors. WFES 2016 hosted a record 1,735 executive buyers from 1,322 companies and 75 countries. \</doc>

Ahmed bin Saeed / Private Sector Platform' of WGEO DUBAI, 12th February, 2017 (WAM) -- H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, has launched the Private Sector Platform of the World Green Economy Organisation, WGEO. The launching ceremony was attended by Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, Suhail bin Mohammed Faraj Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy, Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of WGEO, and Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, along with several VIPs, guests, dignitaries, experts and energy specialists. In his keynote speech during the event, Mr. Al Tayer said, "It is my pleasure to welcome you to this event, just a few months after the global launch of the WGEO. This great initiative comes under the wise vision of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan as it was launched by Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, during the third WGES in Dubai. "The UAE joined the organisation as its first member during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties, COP 22 , which was held in Marrakech, Morocco, in November 2016. This reflects the UAE's efforts to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, 2030 and the Paris Climate Agreement. The organisation plays a pivotal role in limiting climate change as well as finding innovative solutions to the challenges related to sustainable energy, water and the environment in general. "WGEO through its seven platforms aims to develop innovative solutions to climate change, as well as other challenges facing the environment and society. This initiative is in line with global agendas and the UAE's 'Green Economy for Sustainable Development' initiative, which was launched by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid. It's not a secret the organisation's essential role is to reduce the investment risks in the green economy sector, and support international cooperation in innovation and funding. "Today we are proud to launch our 'Private Sector Platform', which is the first initiative under the World Green Economy Organisation, in alignment with its first pillar. "The platform we are launching today aims to help WGEO to take on a frontline role by establishing partnerships as well as enabling dialogue and knowledge exchange among countries, public and private sectors, United Nations Agencies, financial institutions and civil organisations, to accelerate transition to green economy. "The role of the private sector in this transition is of crucial importance in establishing a strong foundation for a healthy and diversified economy. WGEO aims to catalyse the private sector towards a greener economy that achieves sustainable development. "This new platform will help forge world-class partnerships, helping us build capacity and develop key opportunities for partnerships between private and public sectors across the region and internationally. "Today, we give great importance to enhance our societies in terms of sustainability and equality. Leaders of the world are working to launch programmes targeting various segments of their societies to raise awareness on the importance of energy conservation and green initiatives which will help all nations and people," he added. "The development of policies and programmes provides the necessary political direction and support, creates the right conditions and sets the stage to transition into a green economy. That being said, the private sector must now strive to transform green credentials into a global marketplace for trade and investment. The mobilising of private funds furthermore represents a key to unlocking green growth and scaling up green investment which will help meet global climate and environmental goals. "The 'Private Sector Platform' will therefore create pathways to green development by facilitating the adoption of green innovative technologies, products and services on a global equilibrium. The private sector is increasingly seeing the opportunities that come along with 'green growth' and this platform will provide the prerequisite channel for a vibrant private sector engagement. "The focus on adopting a green lifestyle is going to be a key aspect of the new platform. We are determined to exceed the level of developing innovative important initiatives. We want to make sure these initiatives are applicable in everyday life so that future generations can benefit from our actions today. We also need to focus on opportunities to develop joints projects internationally. "Like many of you here today, we believe in the collaborative process. If we are committed to accelerating innovation that will drive the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals, an initiative adopted by world leaders in September 2015 and implemented at the start of 2016 with more than 150 countries pledging to mobilise efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities, and tackle climate change, then we have to work in co-operation within this Private Sector Platform with dedication and determination. "WGEO appreciates Dubai's endeavours to be the global capital of green economy. We believe Dubai's relentless efforts will help limit the effects of climate change, as well as boost measures towards finding innovative solutions for the sustainable energy and water challenges, and other environmental challenges, which fall under the key responsibilities of this organisation. Being based in Dubai, WGEO is counting on Dubai's role as a commercial bridge between the East and West," Al Tayer concluded. UNDP Administrator, Helen Clark, said, "It is an honour to be present here today to mark the launch of the Private Sector Platform of WGEO. This event comes at an opportune moment as we meet to reconfirm commitments to a green and sustainable economy at the start of a New Year." She added, "UNDP is pleased to be associated with this ground-breaking initiative to support WGEO develop capacities in the coming years leveraging on the support of the private sector." The transition to a green economy is a challenging move for any country, a process that calls for multiple approaches and several catalysts. WGEO's initiative to launch the Private Sector Platform today reinforces its determination to persevere in following its green goals. Following speeches by official dignitaries, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, accompanied by the official guests, launched the Private Sector Platform of WGEO. Representatives of the private sector were also invited on stage to demonstrate their commitment and pledge their support to the newly launched Private Sector Platform of WGEO. The event ended with a brain storming session which was attended by Dr. Thani Al-Zeyoudi, Saeed Al Tayer and Helen Clark, along many other experts and energy specialists. The brain storming session revolved around discussions pertaining to environmental challenges and listed suggestions for developing creative and applicable solutions that can help WGEO achieve its goals to preserve and create a clean and green economy for generations to come. \</doc>

#UAENationalDay45: WAM Report / Sustainability and the Environment ABU DHABI, 30th November, 2016 (WAM) -- On the occasion of the 45th National Day celebrations of the United Arab Emirates, the Emirates News Agency, WAM, has issued a series of reports regarding the achievements of the state over the past year. In part eleven, we examine the UAE's achievements in the field of sustainability and the environment. The UAE's commitment to the environment and sustainability goes far beyond that of other countries. The nation hopes to provide a global model for energy and environmental stewardship. It is implementing ground-breaking renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes and is committed to reducing carbon emissions. In accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UAE is a 'non Annex 1' country, and not obligated to reduce its emissions. The state has, however, chosen to implement actions to slash its carbon emissions, including monitoring and tracking greenhouse gas, GHG, emissions and assessing policies for reducing them. In addition, the UAE is committed to expanding the role of low-carbon technologies in the economy and investing in renewable energy and nuclear power. At the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2015, the UAE affirmed its plan to generate 24 percent of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2021. In order to reduce its carbon footprint, the UAE monitors the emission of gases that lead to the greenhouse effect and has reduced its per capita carbon emissions. Due to concerns about climate change, the UAE commissioned international studies to assess the effects of rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the resultant changing weather patterns. The UAE is also committed to reducing emissions from flaring, which involves burning off waste gas or oil during petroleum testing or production. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC, now has zero-flaring as a strategic objective. The UAE has launched several innovative programs to increase energy efficiency. In 2014, Dubai launched the "Smart City" strategy, focusing on 1,000 government services and development in six main areas including transportation, infrastructure, communications, financial services, urban planning and electricity. The strategy lays out steps toward optimising energy, smarter transport and recreational areas. Demand-side management of electricity will play a role, as will increased public transportation. The Dubai Government has issued a set of "Green Building Regulations" for private sector construction in order to reduce energy and resource consumption as well as improve public health and general welfare. The code is mandatory for all new buildings. The UAE's largest emirate, Abu Dhabi, has committed more than US$15 billion to renewable energy programmes through the Masdar Initiative. Masdar underscores twin commitments to the global environment and diversification of the UAE economy. It focuses on the development and commercialisation of technologies in renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon management and monetization, water usage and desalination. Reflecting the UAE's commitment to sustainability, the International Renewable Energy Agency opened its permanent headquarters in Abu Dhabi's Masdar City in June last year. The initiative's partners include some of the world's largest energy companies and elite institutions: BP, Shell, Occidental Petroleum, Total Exploration and Production, General Electric, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Rolls Royce, Imperial College London, MIT and WWF. With the prospect of clean technology as a motivator, Swiss engineer and businessman, Andre Borschberg, and Swiss psychiatrist and aeronaut, Bertrand Piccard, co-piloted the Solar Impulse 2 to make the first circumnavigation of the Earth by a piloted fixed-wing aircraft using only solar power to draw the world's attention to clean technologies. Abu Dhabi was Solar Impulse's host city for the ground-breaking adventure, and the Solar Impulse team was hosted by Masdar, the UAE's clean energy firm, for testing, training, and community engagement ahead of the trip. On 9th March, 2015, Piccard and Borschberg began their quest, departing from Abu Dhabi. The aircraft was scheduled to return to Abu Dhabi in August 2015 after a multi-stage journey around the world. By June 2015, the plane had traversed Asia, and in July 2015, it completed the longest leg of its journey, from Japan to Hawaii. During that leg, however, the aircraft's batteries sustained thermal damage that took months to repair, and Solar Impulse 2 resumed the circumnavigation in April 2016, when it flew to California. It continued across the US until it reached New York City in June 2016 and later that month, the aircraft crossed the Atlantic Ocean to Spain. It stopped in Egypt before finally returning to Abu Dhabi on 26th July, 2016, more than 16 months after it had left, completing the approximately 42,000 kilometre (26,000 mile) first ever circumnavigation of the Earth by a piloted fixed-wing aircraft using only solar power. Just as Solar Impulse 2 highlighted the potential benefits of clean energy, solar power in the UAE has the potential to provide most of the country's electricity demand. While being a major oil producing country, the UAE has taken steps to introduce solar power on a large scale and is planning to generate the vast majority of its electrical energy by 2050 from solar and nuclear sources. Abu Dhabi's Shams solar power station, a 100-megawatt (MW) concentrated solar power (CSP) plant near Abu Dhabi is the largest CSP plant outside the United States and Spain and is expected to be followed by two more stations, Shams 2 and Shams 3. Masdar City in Abu Dhabi is designed to be the most environmentally sustainable city in the world. The city relies entirely on renewable energy. Power is generated by a 10 MW solar PV power plant located on site and 1 MW of rooftop solar panels. Originally planned to have all rooftop panels, it was found easier to clean the sand off ground mounted panels at a single location. The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy aims to provide 7 percent of Dubai's energy from clean energy sources by 2020. It will increase this target to 25 percent by 2030 and 75 percent by 2050. The first phase of the proposed 1,000 MW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park was the 13-megawatt (DC) solar farm constructed by First Solar in 2013. It uses 152,880 FS-385 black CdTe modules and generates about 24 gigawatt-hours per year. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is one of the world's largest renewable project based on an independent power producer (IPP) model. Besides the three phases that consist of solar farms using PV technology, the long-term project will also include concentrating solar power (CSP). The total capacity of the entire project is planned to reach 3,000 MW. The 200-megawatt second phase of the project attracted worldwide attention, as the winning bid of the tender set a new record-low tariff of only US Cents 5.89 per kilowatt-hour. This is about 20% lower than any previous, unsubsidised power purchase agreement the world has seen before. The PPA is set to a 25-year time frame. In parallel to the utility-scale projects of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, DEWA, launched a net metering scheme to encourage companies and private individuals to install solar power on their roofs. While the scheme is currently voluntary, solar panels are to be made mandatory for all buildings in Dubai by 2030. The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, ENEC, is working to deliver safe, clean, efficient nuclear energy to the United Arab Emirates - energy that is needed to support the UAE's social and economic growth. Energy demand in the UAE is growing at an annual rate of about 9 percent, three times the global average. Developing a reliable supply of electricity is critical to the future growth of the nation, and ENEC is taking on this challenge, with a target of delivering electricity to the UAE grid in 2017. By 2020, it is projected that nuclear energy will produce nearly a quarter of the nation's electricity needs. In August 201, ENEC announced the successful installation of its Unit 3 Steam Generators, SGs, marking another milestone in the development of the UAE's first nuclear energy plant. Steam Generators play a key role in the conversion of energy generated by nuclear fission into electricity which will eventually power homes and businesses throughout the UAE. The heat generated from the nuclear reaction turns water into steam, which is then used to spin a turbine and generate electricity. In September, it was announced that the most recent marine environmental survey off the coast of the Barakah nuclear energy plant showed the presence of several marine species as a result of the artificial reef which was created there in 2014. A diverse and abundant marine ecosystem has taken root there, including more than 63 marine species utilising the breakwater habitats, and 35 marine species utilising the artificial reef habitat. In the breakwaters, these marine organisms including a variety of species of algae, invertebrates, species of fish, and one species of marine mammal. A restriction on marine activities, particularly fishing, means that the breakwater provides a favourable habitat for priority species such as the orange-spotted grouper, locally known as the hamour, the near-threatened Indian Ocean Humpback Dolphin, and the critically endangered Hawksbill Turtle. These at-risk species were all observed in the protected area off the coast of Barakah. The construction of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant commenced in 2012 and all four nuclear reactors will be operational in 2020. At its full operational capacity, the facility will deliver up to a quarter of the UAE's electricity needs and save up to 12 million tons in carbon emissions every year. The project as a whole is now over 66% complete. In July 2016, the Environment Agency- Abu Dhabi, EAD, was advised by the Indian Ocean and South East Asia, IOSEA, MoU Secretariat, of the inclusion of Bu Tinah shoal in the IOSEA Marine Turtle Site Network as an important site for marine turtles. The Secretariat is part of the United Nations Environment Programme's Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific based in Bangkok, Thailand. Of the seven species of marine turtles in the world, two can be found in Abu Dhabi's waters: the critically endangered Hawksbill turtle, and the endangered Green turtle. In Abu Dhabi, turtles nest on at least 17 offshore islands from mid-March to mid-June and EAD's aerial and field survey findings indicate that about 5,750 sea turtles inhabit Abu Dhabi's waters during the winter season and 6,900 during the summer season. The Bu Tinah shoal and its surrounding waters are strictly protected from human activities such as fishing. In spite of the harsh temperatures and high salinity, its habitats and species, including coral, seagrass, mangroves, Green and Hawksbill turtles, dolphins and many species of birds, continue to thrive, making the island an important location and a living laboratory for climate change studies. The shoal is also home to one of the most charismatic but endangered marine mammals, the dugong. In March, Earth Hour 2016 achieved outstanding results across the UAE, and in Dubai, Earth Hour activities saw a 222MW reduction in the consumption of electricity, and a reduction of 96 tonnes in carbon dioxide emissions. This reflects Dubai's commitment to protecting natural resources and reducing the country's carbon footprint. Government organisations, private companies, universities, schools and individuals also took part in a host of family and entertainment activities to spread environmental awareness. The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 aims to transform the emirate into an international hub for clean energy and green economy, making Dubai the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world by 2050. To celebrate World Wildlife Day on March 3rd, Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority, TCA Abu Dhabi, teamed up with Emirates Park Zoo to organise special activities to boost awareness about wildlife amongst the emirate's schoolchildren as well as UAE society in general. World Wildlife Day is a special initiative of the United Nations to celebrate and raise awareness of the world's wild animals and plants. This year it ran under the theme, 'The Future of Wildlife is in our Hands', and promoted understanding of conservation on a local and global scale. Agriculture and the practice of farming in the UAE: In July, the Al Gharbia Region in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi proudly hosted the 12th edition of the world renowned Liwa Date Festival, an annual gathering to celebrate the date harvest, Emirati heritage and the agricultural riches of Abu Dhabi. Since its launch, the Festival has been instrumental in transforming the date and palm tree into a symbol of Emirati perseverance in the past, a source of wealth in the present, and a guarantee of prosperity for the future. As food security becomes even more important in the region, the UAE leads the way in alternative farming methods, such as hydroponics, and is actively involved in organic farming. This year, it was announced that the UAE is now producing almost 10 percent of national requirements, including tomatoes, strawberries, lettuce, aubergines, peppers, cucumbers, melons and mangos. The UAE is firmly committed to research and studies that will contribute towards agricultural innovation, and in 2016 re-launched the Khalifa International Award for Date Palm and Agricultural Innovation. The award puts emphasis on innovation and offers prize money of AED1 million. Jose Graziano, Director-General of the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation, FAO, attended the launch ceremony and praised the UAE for its diligent efforts in providing food security for its citizens and residents, as well as its worldwide contributions. The initiative is aimed at supporting scientific research and development in the agricultural and date palm sector, and to showcase the UAE's efforts towards that goal. Each year, on the sidelines of the World Future Energy Summit, the UAE hosts Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week to addresses the interconnected challenges that affect the widespread acceleration and adoption of sustainable development and clean energy, to seriously address the global energy challenge, the relationships between economic development, poverty eradication, energy security, water scarcity and climate change. The event is the largest gathering on sustainability in the history of the Middle East, and encourages actionable outcomes to carve a pathway toward sustainability worldwide. In 2016, ADSW welcomed over 35,604 participants from 170 countries. WAM/Moran \</doc>

ADNOC CEO/ADIPEC ABU DHABI, 7th November, 2016 (WAM) -- In an era of unpredictable oil prices, producers who focus on efficiency, value creation, commerciality and excellence will be successful, said Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE Minister of State and CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC, in his keynote speech at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference, ADIPEC, 2016, which started at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre, ADNEC, here today. "While we cannot predict the future price of oil, one factor remains well within our control and that is the cost of every barrel we produce. In this new energy era we must reflect on how to make the most of our resources, enhance our performance and find new ways to be more competitive," Al Jaber said. Held under the patronage of President His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the 19th edition of the exhibition is hosting more than 2,000 companies, 25 country pavilions, 700 speakers, 8,500 delegates and 100,000 trade professionals from more than 125 countries. According to Al Jaber, oil and gas companies can succeed in the new energy era by driving efficiency and leveraging synergies. He, however, stressed that sound, strategic and targeted investments are equally important to enable sustainable growth. "Time and again, our industry has shown it can engineer around obstacles, create ground-breaking solutions and catalyse human progress," he pointed out. "Today's new energy landscape calls on us once more to break from old conventions and welcome new paradigms. By embracing the new energy era, we will thrive and we will shape our future," he added. Citing ADNOC as an example, Al Jaber said the company is not waiting for the times to change, but taking charge of its own future to ensure its resilience and long-term prosperity. Under its new 2030 strategy and five-year business plan, the company will diversify and increase production of its petrochemical portfolio while opening new markets to ensure sustained profitability. It also intends to expand its refining capacity to meet growing demand for refined products. "We will stretch the margin from every barrel we produce," Al Jaber said. "And by taking full advantage of our geography, at the pivot point between the East and the West, we will capitalise on the world's fastest growing markets, including Asia, where oil demand is expected to increase 15 per cent and the market for petrochemicals is set to double by 2030. "To fully unlock those opportunities, we require a new model of partnership across the industry, one that creates real and tangible value by bringing technology, experience, resources and market access to the table," he noted, adding "At ADNOC, we are focused on growth and we are open for business." Al Jaber's comments came days after Abu Dhabi's Supreme Petroleum Council approved ADNOC's new 2030 strategy and five-year business plan, which seek to deliver a more profitable upstream, more valuable downstream and a more sustainable and economical gas supply, in line with the directives of Abu Dhabi's leadership. In addition to creating a more commercially viable organisation, ADNOC is also building on its success story by creating a performance-led culture and developing its talent. "Our most precious resource lies not in the ground, or under the sea, but in the people of our organisations. Investing in our human capital and nurturing a performance-led culture is the best investment we will ever make. And to truly excel, we must take advantage of the entire talent pool, both women and men alike," Al Jaber said. Oil companies also have a paramount duty to protect their employees and there can be no compromises on keeping them safe. At the same time, they need to ensure the integrity of operations, safeguarding communities and protecting the environment. "The industry is doing its part to protect the environment, while supplying the energy needed to drive the global economy," Al Jaber noted, speaking on the same day when the COP 22 Marrakech Climate Change Conference opened in Morocco. ADNOC is producing cleaner fuels for its customers and advancing innovative clean technologies, including the Middle East's first carbon capture utilisation and storage project, which was inaugurated on Saturday. The facility will capture, use and sequester 800,000 tonnes of CO2 every year. \</doc>

The summit, operating under the new banner theme of "Driving Global Green Economy", will focus on how to drive, create and sustain a Global Green Economy whilst outlining and positioning the UAE's vision for its own green agenda going forward. The press conference was attended by Dr. Thani Alzeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, MD and CEO of Dubai Water and Electricity Authority and Chairman of World Green Economy Summit, Adnan Amin, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Ahmed Butti Al Muhairbi, Secretary General of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy (DSCE), Frode Mauring, United Nations Resident Representative in the UAE (covering Qatar and Oman), Saif Humaid Al Falasi, Chief Executive Officer-ENOC Group, Essa Al Maidoor Deputy Director General Of Dubai Municipality (DM), Waleed Salman, Vice Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Summit and EVP \- Strategy & Business Development at DEWA, Dr. Yousef Ibrahim Al Akraf, Chairman of logistics committee - WGES and EVP Business Support & HR, and Jens Nielsen, CEO of World Climate Ltd, and a number of senior officials from ministries and government departments in UAE. In his speech during the conference, Dr. Alzeyoudi said that the initiative of "Green Economy for Sustainable Development" which was launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohamed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 2012 aims to build a sustainable future and to adopt the principles of a green economy in order to ensure the competitiveness of the national economy and to support its contribution in reducing the effects of climate change. "Under the guidance of our leadership, the UAE has taken important strides in implementing the country's green growth strategy and in putting in place the required in collaboration with all concerned entities approved by the Ministerial Council in 2015. This includes the proposed goals and programs such as the transformation management and empowerment programs in addition to the strategic key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed programs," said Dr. Alzeyoudi. He added: "The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment is keen on collaborating with all stakeholders to support green growth through 96 initiatives. The UAE Council for Green Development was established to oversee the implementation of the programs based on the approved mechanisms and indicators." WGES 2016, hosted by DEWA, under the umbrella of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, in collaboration with World Climate Ltd, international partners is supported by the United Nations. The Summit runs in conjunction with 8th session of Water, Energy & Environment Exhibition (WETEX) and Dubai Solar Show 2016. Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy said: "Under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, the World Green Economy Summit 2016 is held under a new theme "Driving Global Green Economy". WGES 2016 aims to support the UAE Vision 2021 and further the National Agenda to promote sustainable development. This year's program will focus on how to further the Global Green Economy agenda whilst outlining and positioning the UAE's vision and Dubai Plan 2021. The Summit aims to support Dubai's ambitions in the Green Economy sector and drive the Clean Energy Strategy 2050. The summit aims to support the ambitions and objectives of UAE Vision 2021 and further the National Agenda to promote sustainable development, and Dubai Plan 2021 aiming to achieve a healthy and sustainable clean environment, and Clean Energy Strategy 2050 launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai last year. The Clean Energy Strategy 2050 aims to provide 7% of Dubai's energy from solar sources by 2020, 25% by 2030 and 75% from clean energy by 2050, and seeks to make Dubai the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world by 2050 and a global centre for clean energy and energy conservation." The UAE is taking major strides to drive the low-carbon green economy with the support of its vision and wise leadership, which is in line with global trends and efforts. The historic agreement to combat climate change which was reached at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference was a clear example of global determination and dedication. Last year, for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, all 195 members reached a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 C." All reports issued by United Nations indicate that the main benefits of doubling today's share of renewable energy is to keep the increase in global average temperature well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels; while avoiding up to 12 giga-tons of CO2, creating more than 24 million jobs, saving 4 million lives a year and boosting global GDP up to US$1.3 trillion." Locally, we are working to achieve the objectives of the UAE's Green Growth Strategy launched in January 2015. Yearly public investments reaching 2.4% of total GDP in technology and enhancing green efficiency in all economic activities will help increase the rate of economic growth by 4- 4.5% by 2030." Al Tayer added: International reports by the UN indicate that doubling today's share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030 could save $2.4 trillion yearly, which exceeds total costs 15 times. The United Nations environment program expects the size of the global market for products and services to have doubled to $2.74 by the end of 2020. The success achieved by the previous installments of WGES in terms of developments and turnout has made us more determined than ever to achieve our aim in positioning Dubai as a global capital for the green economy. In addition, the Summit provides an ideal platform for bringing senior experts and professionals in the green economy together to strengthen PPP and develop green initiatives, not only for Dubai but for the whole world. WGES 2016 aims to achieve strategic objectives that complements the key commitments contained in Dubai declaration: Help to promote Dubai's position as a global capital of green economy and sustainable development Raise the profile of key issues such as Clean Energy, The Green Fund and the development of a dedicated Green Business Zone Maintain WGES as the premier international platform for Green Economy WGES 2016 will see distinct participation by a number of distinguished speakers including: Dr. Thani Alzeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment, Government of UAE; Mohamed Boussaid, Minister of Economy and Finance, Morocco; Dr. Khaled Fahmy, Minister of Environment, Arab Republic of Egypt; Reem Ebrahim Al Hashimy, Minister of State for Int.

March 2 -- Global warming is worsening and urgently requires the attention of the international community. Climate change is rapidly becoming the largest challenge facing the world today, and poses dangerous threats for our future. According to a report from the World Bank, titled 'Turn down the heat,' the Middle East stand at the forefront of climate change. Rivers are drying out, coastal areas are sinking, and over the last 150 years, industrial development has released a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are a significant cause of climate change, leading to increasing the planet's average temperature. Although greenhouse gas emissions in Arab countries does not exceed 5% of the world's emissions, it is still one of the largest contributors to climate change. Environmental experts believe that the effects of climate change are already impacting the Arab region. There have been torrential rains and floods in Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, including a cyclone that hit the southern coasts of Oman and Yemen. Desertification and drought are also the results of climate change. The Arab region has witnessed a significant rise in temperatures in recent decades. Temperatures are expected to rise by as much as eight degrees Celsius in parts of Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq by the end of the century. Three main challenges that face the UAE to mitigate the increasing effects of climate change include: population growth, urban and industrial development, and limited natural resources. The rapid increase in the country's population has led to a rise in the demand for industrial growth. This has led to excessive greenhouse gas emission, especially carbon dioxide. We are aware that the pressing issue of climate change is not only an environmental challenge, but also an issue for ensuring development, with enormous social and economic challenges that directly impact the rate of sustainable development. The UAE has taken great strides towards addressing climate change and mitigating its impact on the environment and economic sectors. The UAE works according to a strategic framework, to preserve the environment, and strives to develop the role of the youth in its work to reduce the effects of climate change. The UAE's wise leadership launched the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, to highlight the importance of environmental preservation, reflecting the priority the UAE gives to protecting the environment. The UAE is one of the first countries in the world to support the international community's efforts to tackle climate change. The UAE was one of the first countries to support the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, to curb greenhouse gas emissions in industrialised countries, in addition to being the first country in the region to sign the Copenhagen Agreement, during the 15th session of the Conference of the Parties, to support the long-term agreement towards reducing emissions. The UAE has played an important role in the negotiations that led to an agreement to combat climate change, at the International Conference of the Parties in 2015 (COP21), in Paris. For the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations, 186 out 195 countries pledged their commitment to reduce emissions and combat climate change, to keep the increase of planet's temperature less than 2 degrees. UAE is committed to achieving the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, launched by the United Nations, to eradicate poverty, inequality, and the effects of climate. Dubai seeks to support efforts in renewable energy, sustainability and environment. The Dubai Supreme Council of Energy launched the Carbon Abatement Strategy 2021, to reduce carbon emissions by 16% by 2021. This will transform Dubai into the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world by 2021. HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, launched the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050, to transform Dubai into an international hub for clean energy and green economy, by providing 7% of Dubai's total power output from clean resources by 2020, 25% by 2030, and 75% by 2050. This will enable Dubai to reduce its carbon footprint, and limit the effects of global warming. To contribute to global efforts in this regard, Dubai hosted the World Green Economy Summit over the last three years, to promote Dubai as an international hub for green economy, while providing a platform to gather experts in the field of green economy, to strengthen partnerships between the public and private sectors, while developing green initiatives aimed at ensuring a sustainable future. DEWA works to enhance sustainability in the Emirate, by launching clean and renewable energy projects, and increasing the efficiency of water end energy networks, in addition to launching initiatives, to raise awareness and instil a culture of rationalisation among community members. This supports objectives to lower Dubai and the UAE's carbon footprint and mitigate the impact of global warming. DEWA continuously participates in conferences, events and national forums that highlight environmental action and the most innovative solutions in the field of green development. Solar energy is the most common source of clean energy in the UAE, as the country is conveniently located within the solar belt. In Dubai, about 2,150 kilowatts per square meter (kW/m2) of solar radiation, which can be used in PV technology, is recorded annually. The amount of direct radiation which can be used for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology is recorded at 1850 (kW/m2) annually. These results greatly contribute to the implementation of solar energy technology in Dubai. DEWA launched the 'Shams Dubai' initiative to support the 'Green Economy for Sustainable Development' initiative, launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in adherence with the UAE Vision 2021 to transform Dubai into the smartest city in the world. Shams Dubai focuses on achieving a sustainable environment, in adherence with the Dubai Strategy 2021, to transform Dubai into a city with clean, healthy, and sustainable environmental elements. Shams Dubai encourages customers to install PV panels on their rooftops to generate electricity from solar power. The electricity is used on-site and the surplus is exported to DEWA's network. An offset between exported and imported electricity units is conducted and the customer account is settled based on this offset. DEWA has launched a number of promising projects and initiatives to support Shams Dubai, including the Jebel Ali M Station, which is a first of its kind in the region, with a total production capacity of 1.5MW. We are proud of the accomplishments in this field, and have been able to achieve great success in solar energy technology. DEWA received a globally-competitive price of USD 2.99 cents per kilowatt hour (kW/h) for the park's third phase, which is based on the IPP model, will use PV technology and will be operational by 2020. The solar park is the first of its kind in the region, and is significant due to its production capacity. It is the first of many promising projects to ensure greater reliance on renewable energy sources to generate electricity in Dubai. In adherence with the directives of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, we recently launched the largest solar energy project in the world based on the IPP model, with a planned production capacity of 1000 MW by 2030. The park includes an innovation centre that features a number of R&D centres to find solutions and develop new clean energy technologies. R&D centres include CSP testing facility, a water and environment research facility, and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) research facility. The centre will also focus its R&D efforts on 3D printing technology, and water desalination using solar energy. The innovation centre has allocated a budget of AED 500 million towards integrated, smart and energy efficient water and electricity networks, waste reduction, solar energy, to preserve natural resources, and the environment. DEWA also launched a specialised programme that will enable DEWA to establish a higher education institute, which offers master degree programmes in the fields of clean energy sustainability and technology. This will increase the efficiency of DEWA employees, in the fields of sustainability, environmental preservation, renewable energy technology, clean energy, and green economy. According to the IPP model, DEWA chose a bidder with the lowest price of USD 4.5 cents per kW, to develop the first phase of the Hassyan Clean Coal Power Plant. The plant will produce 2,400 MW, and will become operational in 2023. It will make use of Ultra Super Critical technologies, which is one of the best international techniques. Through the Hassyan Clean Coal Power Plant, DEWA aims to achieve the fifth pillar of the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050. This will help Dubai transform into an international hub for clean energy and green economy. DEWA joined Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 'GOLD Community' in January 2017. Gold Community members are organizations which are at the heart of the community shaping the future of sustainability and reporting, and empowering decision making towards a more sustainable economy and world. This is aligned with the UAE's leadership wise vision to shape the future and support sustainable development in UAE and the region. DEWA has also been invited by the GRI to be part of the Standards Pioneers Program. GRI launched the distinguished programme for those organisations which have demonstrated leadership in Sustainability Reporting. DEWA being at the forefront of reporting is participating in the Standards Pioneers Program, available only to 100 organizations worldwide who are going to adopt the new standards. The wise leadership understands the importance of adopting sustainability and launching green initiatives, to streamline the transition into a green economy. HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO) in October 2016, with the support of Dubai Government, and in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). DEWA launched Etihad Energy Services Company (Etihad ESCO), to provide promising investment opportunities to companies specialising in energy efficiency, in addition to financial institutions, and green technology and equipment suppliers. DEWA is working to retrofit over 30,000 buildings to ensure energy efficiency. In adherence with the Demand Side Management strategy, the project will reduce energy consumption by 30% by 2030. The project has an allocated budget of AED 30 billion, is valued at AED 82 billion, and will achieve savings of up to AED 52 billion, while benefitting the economy. DEWA takes priority in furthering sustainable development in the UAE. We are cooperating with Emirates Central Cooling Systems Corporation (EMPOWER), the world's largest district cooling system provider in the world, to highlight the benefits of district cooling for public and private sectors on an international level. There is an urgent need to unify efforts, to address the challenges facing the energy sector, while increasing the job market in the clean and renewable energy sectors. Dubai Carbon Centre of Excellence works to develop a green economy, by developing new operational standards to reduce carbon emissions in daily activities, while strengthening the partnership between the public and private sectors. To strengthen international efforts towards tackling the effects of climate change, the United Nation Framework on Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) announced the launch of the UAE Solar Power Programme, in cooperation with the Dubai Carbon Centre for Excellence (Dubai Carbon), to enhance the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in all ongoing solar projects. The UAE Solar Power Programme is a leading initiative supporting global efforts towards achieving a green economy and sustainable development. Dubai Carbon collaborated with DEWA in launching the State of Green Economy Report 2016. The report presents a comprehensive look at the initiatives that encourage innovation and the policies that accelerate the shift towards green transformation. It also highlights the UAE's efforts to become a role model in the shift towards a green economy. DEWA has received a number of environmental certifications and awards, including the ISO 14001:2004, and the Five Star Environmental Audit from the British Council in 2011. These awards are a result of DEWA's efforts to comply with international laws and regulations, while adopting appropriate management systems and best practices to preserve the environment. DEWA's efforts also resulted in it winning the Sword of Honour in the environment category, from the British Safety Council, for the fifth time in a row since 2012. DEWA was selected to win the award out of seven international institutions, and became the first government entity in the region to receive this prestigious award. Our efforts and achievements shall not cease, as we continue following in the footsteps of our wise leadership. Our participation in COP22 reflects our commitment to strengthening the UAE's cooperation with the international community to tackle climate change, and fulfil the historic agreement reached during COP21. We are confident that by unifying efforts with the international community, we will be able to find solutions to climate change, and ensure future generations the right to live in a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.

Feb. 12 -- In Presence of Officials, Media and Private Sector Representatives: Platform aims to establish partnerships, enable dialogue and knowledge exchange among countries, public and private sectors, UN Agencies, financial institutions and civil organisations, to accelerate transition to green economy says Chairman of WGEO HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, launched today (Saturday, 11 February 2017) the Private Sector Platform of the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO). The newly launched platform is the first of WGEO that was launched during the third World Green Economy Summit (WGES) in Dubai on 5 October 2016, supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The grand ceremony was attended by HE Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, Minister of Climate Change and Environment; HE Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy; HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of WGEO and HE Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The official launch of the Private Sector Platform of the World Green Economy Organisation also witnessed the presence of several VIPs, esteemed guests, dignitaries, experts and energy specialists. The event commenced by a keynote speech delivered by HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Chairman of WGEO. In his speech, HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer said: "It is my pleasure to welcome you to this event, just a few months after the global launch of the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO). This great initiative comes under the wise vision of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE as it was launched by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai during the third World Green Economy Summit (WGES) in Dubai on 5 October 2016, supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). "The UAE joined the organisation as its first member during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) which was held in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November 2016. This reflects the diligent efforts of the UAE to support the United NationsSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 and the Paris Climate Agreement. The organisation plays a pivotal role in limiting climate change as well as finding innovative solutions to the challenges related to sustainable energy, water and the environment in general," continued HE Al Tayer. HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer underscored the vision of WGEO in his speech: "WGEO through its seven platforms aims to develop innovative solutions to climate change, as well as other challenges facing the environment and society. This initiative is in line with global agendas and the UAE's, 'A Green Economy for Sustainable Development' initiative which was launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. It's not a secret the organisation's essential role is to reduce the investment risks in the green economy sector, and support international cooperation in innovation and funding." The World Green Economy Organisation is founded on seven platforms, namely, Countries, Sustainable Cities Sector, Private Sector, Academic Sector, Organisations & Civil Society, Youth Sector and Financial Sector. "The platform we are launching today aims to help WGEO to take on a frontline role by establishing partnerships as well as enabling dialogue and knowledge exchange among countries, public and private sectors, United Nations Agencies, financial institutions and civil organisations, to accelerate transition to green economy," HE Al Tayer added. "The role of the private sector in this transition is of crucial importance in establishing a strong foundation for a healthy and diversified economy. WGEO aims to catalyse the private sector towards a greener economy that achieves sustainable development," HE Al Tayer added. HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer also highlighted the importance of the green economy and its expected role through the newly launched platform: "This new platform will help forge world-class partnerships, helping us build capacity and develop key opportunities for partnerships between private and public sectors across the region and internationally." "Today, we give great importance to enhance our societies in terms of sustainability and equality. Leaders of the world are working to launch programmes targeting various segments of their societies to raise awareness on the importance of energy conservation and green initiatives which will help all nations and people," he added. "The development of policies and programmes provides the necessary political direction and support, creates the right conditions and sets the stage to transition into a green economy. That being said, the private sector must now strive to transform green credentials into a global marketplace for trade and investment. The mobilizing of private funds furthermore represents a key to unlocking green growth and scaling up green investment which will help meet global climate and environmental goals," HE Al Tayer added. "The 'Private Sector Platform' will therefore create pathways to green development by facilitating the adoption of green innovative technologies, products and services on a global equilibrium. The private sector is increasingly seeing the opportunities that come along with 'green growth' and this Platform will provide the prerequisite channel for a vibrant private sector engagement," HE Al Tayer added. "The focus on adopting a green lifestyle is going to be a key aspect of the new platform. We are determined to exceed the level of developing innovative important initiatives; we want to make sure these initiatives are applicable in everyday life so that future generations can benefit from our actions today. We also need to focus on opportunities to develop joints projects internationally," emphasized HE Al Tayer. "Like many of you here today, we believe in the collaborative process. If we are committed to accelerating innovation that will drive the implementation of 'The Sustainable Development Goals', an initiative adopted by world leaders in September 2015 and implemented at the start of 2016 with more than 150 countries pledging to mobilise efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities, and tackle climate change, then we have to work in co-operation within this Private Sector Platform with dedication and determination," said Al Tayer. HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer concluded his speech by acknowledging Dubai's drive and efforts towards being an international capital for green economy: "WGEO appreciates Dubai's endeavors to be the global capital of green economy. We believe Dubai's relentless efforts will help limit the effects of climate change, as well as boost measures towards finding innovative solutions for the sustainable energy and water challenges, and other environmental challenges, which fall under the key responsibilities of this organisation. Being based in Dubai, WGEO is counting on Dubai's role as a commercial bridge between the East and West." Thanks to its world-class standards in advanced infrastructure, finance, partnerships and aviation, Dubai has succeeded in attracting the best international brands and outstanding companies from all over the world. The Emirate is the key connecting point for global green economy. Subsequent to HE speech, the attendees had an opportunity to view a video that showcased information about WGEO and its role. This was followed by an influential speech by HE Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) who appreciated the UAE's leadership: "It is an honour to be present here today to mark the launch of the 'Private Sector Platform' of WGEO. This event comes at an opportune moment as we meet to reconfirm commitments to a green and sustainable economy at the start of a New Year." "Taking this as an opportunity, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, for moving forward the green economy and climate change agendas and promoting the role of UAE as a global partner in sustainable development," HE Clark said. HE Clark explained UNDP's role in supporting WGEO in her speech: "UNDP is pleased to be associated with this ground-breaking initiative to support WGEO develop capacities in the coming years leveraging on the support of the private sector." The transition to a green economy is a challenging move for any country, a process that calls for multiple approaches and several catalysts. WGEO's initiative to launch the 'Private Sector Platform' today reinforces its determination to persevere its green goals. "The launch of the 'Private Sector Platform', which is the first initiative under WGEO, is shaped by the organisation's clear thinking and resilient policy-making capabilities. It will further enhance the private sector position as a global role model for green initiatives," she added. "Over the past few years, private sector has helped lift the economic growth of the world. As such, the role of the private sector will serve as a catalyst to boost a greener economy, one that is embedded in sustainable development," continued HE as she emphasised the role of the Private Sector Platform. Followed by a winning speech by HE Helen Clark, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); Mr. Yvo de Boer, a private sector thought leader acknowledged WGEO for ground-breaking initiative which will help in shaping and creating diverse opportunities for private sector entities to commence effective partnerships with all involved parties to secure growing development. He stressed that the private sector shares the collective responsibility with all the other sectors to face the current and future environmental challenges. In addition, Mr. Paolo Lembo, Project Director, WGEO stated that the launch of the Private Sector Platform was a one-step approach that will serve as a guiding force for many. Mr. Lembo thanked the UAE government for its extensive support to WGEO. Subsequent to the speeches by official dignitaries, HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman of Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, accompanied by the official guests, launched the Private Sector Platform of WGEO. The brain storming session revolved around discussions pertaining to environmental challenges and listed suggestions for developing creative and applicable solutions that can help WGEO achieve its goals to preserve and create a clean and green economy for generations to come.

State of Energy Report MARRAKECH, 13th November 2016 (WAM) - Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Vice Chairman of Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and MD & CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), has launched the State of Green Economy Report 2017, a United Nations Development Program (UNDP) backed publication. The 3rd report was launched at the World Climate Summit organised during the 22nd Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 22 ) to the UNFCCC, in Marrakech, Morocco. The event was attended by Dr. Hakima El Haite, Minister Delegate for the Environment in the Kingdom of Morocco, Ahmed Buti Al Muhairbi, Secretary General of the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Adnan Amin, Director General of the International Renewable Energy Agency(IRENA), Miriem Bensalah Chaqroun, President of the General Confederation of Moroccan Companies, Bertrand Piccard, Initiator, Chairman and Pilot of Solar Impulse, Yvo de Boer, Former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Frode Mauring, the UNDP Resident Representative in the UAE, Qatar and Oman, Jens Nielsen, CEO, World Climate Ltd , Paul Polman , CEO of Unilever and other international personalities. The State of Green Economy Report 2017 aims to help the UAE sustain its economic growth, while keeping the green economy as the fuel for this growth. The report is created around the theme of Knowledge, and aims to provide the public and private sectors with a clear overview of the government's plans, as well as offer a benchmark on the country's current standing in green economy. "The 4th of November 2016 was a historical date as it marked when the Paris Agreement came into force. It is with great pleasure that we meet here today to reaffirm our commitment to the Agreement. The Paris Agreement charts a new course in our efforts to combat climate change and limit its effects, both as individual countries and as part of something far bigger: a global network that by working together can make a real change. Under the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, Dubai has adopted green growth and sustainable development," said Al Tayer. He continued: "Last year, His Highness announced the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050. This strategy has a target to make Dubai a global centre for clean energy and green economy, which will also contribute to making Dubai the city with the lowest carbon footprint in the world by 2050. Based on our leadership's vision, we have set primary goals to ensure our continued social and economic development by mitigating the corresponding negative impacts on our environment. We will continue our efforts to achieve this vision so that it remains a beacon that shapes our policies, strategies, and practices for government, which in turn will promote social change. We recognise that there are different methods of achieving as every nation will follow its own path towards a green economy that is adapted to their own social, economic and environmental conditions. Nonetheless, we also recognise the importance of this being a common goal, along with the lessons learned along the way. Sharing experiences, transferring knowledge, and providing support across borders is the only way we can all prosper into the future," "Each year, we organise the World Green Economy Summit, which is an international forum for government representatives, business leaders, decision makers, experts, specialists and other stakeholders to gather and create partnerships between the public and private sectors. It encourages dialogue and knowledge exchange, which are vital elements in pushing us forward in planning and implementing the shift to a global green economy. At this year's summit, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the World Green Economy Organisation (WGEO), which is supported by the Government of Dubai and in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). WGEO will be based in Dubai, pioneering a new approach to promoting the green economy by bringing together governments, the private sector, foundations, UN agencies, financial organisations, and civil society, to work on achieving the green economy goals, and to serve as a mechanism for generating new solutions to climate change, sustainable energy, and other challenges for water and the environment around the world. This year was a very productive one for the UAE. In addition to these initiatives to encourage international cooperation, we have continued to propel the shift in our own economy, adding further smart services and focusing on diversifying the energy mix to incorporate renewable energy sources. We have numerous initiatives underway, covering all sectors of industry, the economy, and society, to ensure a prosperous, happy and healthy future, for generations to come. Many of these initiatives are outlined in this year's edition of the State of Green Economy Report, which is an annual review and critical reflection of the current situation of the green economy landscape. The report traces our successes in green economic development, offering a knowledge base for national and international experts and thought leaders to share research and development, tools, and repeatable initiatives. This year alone, Dubai has recorded two milestones in renewables. Dubai Electricity and Water Authority received the world's lowest solar tariff at USD 2.99 cents per kW/h, an improvement on DEWA's previous record of USD 5.6 cents per kW/h. This resulted in an increase in our commitment to clean energy providing 75% of Dubai's total power output by 2050 and launching the Dubai Green Fund, a USD 27 billion (AED 100 billion) green investment vehicle to support green investments and green growth," added Al Tayer. "It is a privilege and honour to be here to present the State of Green Economy Report 2017. In this report, we capture success stories that we wish to share to contribute to global sustainable and green development. The report demonstrates our commitment to develop and implement green programmes and initiatives across all sectors, making a strong case for a green transition to a robust low-carbon economy. It also provides an overview of initiatives that promote innovation, and policies that help accelerate the transition. The report also underlines the efforts made to encourage and enable different sectors to participate in the transition towards a green economy. It serves as a roadmap to establish new market-driven models to decarbonise the energy sector and encourage the market to adopt energy efficiency. The report emphasises that knowledge leads to change and helps redesign strategies. It provides cutting-edge information to both policymakers and practitioners. The report is divided into 8 areas of green economy development, connected through one common theme: Knowledge, which is the main driver to sustainable development and a guarantee that it remains on the right path," said Al Tayer. "Human civilization, throughout history, has stood at the edge of many new frontiers. Strong political leadership, with the help of thought leaders, think-tanks, innovators, academicians, businesses and entrepreneurs, and utilising knowledge as a common link, has ensured our consistent progress and sustained economic growth. The transition to a green economy is not a journey into the unknown. The globally-accepted UN Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals are well-defined. The targets are clear. A better understanding of climate change helps deliver specific solutions based on technology and innovation. Smart cities are sustainable cities. The sustained green growth will reflect positively not only on the environment and ecosystems but also socially. Each chapter opens with a thought leader and continues to highlight the remarkable contributions of individuals and organisations in knowledge-sharing and building partnerships," noted Al Tayer. At the end of his speech, Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer handed Dr. Hakima El Haite and other attending personalities a copy of The State of Green Economy Report 2017. Produced with the support of organisations that are leading the way in the Emirate and the UAE, including DEWA, Dubai Supreme Council of Energy, Empower, ENOC, RTA, Dubai Sustainable Tourism, UAE Water Aid, Dubal Holding, Dubai Science Park and EGA to name a few, the report is a success story of what can be achieved through knowledge sharing and the building of strong partnerships, while advancing towards new frontiers. The report is divided into eight chapters anchored by an opinion from a thought leader, highlighting the remarkable contribution of individuals, as well as government entities. "The report confirms the UAE's dedication to combating climate change while increasing the share of renewable energy. It sheds light on the most important strategies, initiatives, existing projects and success stories across various industries including energy, water, oil and gas, industry, transportation, construction, tourism, wastes, land planning, agriculture and finance, in addition to following up on the progress achieved by the UAE in its transformation into a green economy," said Waleed Salman, Chairman of the Dubai Carbon. \</doc>

Trade, travel and tourism remained key factors that fuelled business activity, which helped offset the impact of lower oil prices. The emirate also benefited from further diversifying its economy and revenue sources. During the first half of 2016, Dubai's non-oil foreign trade amounted to Dhs647bn ($176bn), while the volume of traded goods witnessed a 17 per cent increase. China retained its position as Dubai's top trading partner in the first half of the year, followed by India and the United States.

Recent developments have also led us to feel more optimistic about Dubai's growth prospects for 2017. The decision to allow Chinese visitors to obtain visas on arrival in the UAE will help us forge closer bilateral ties. We are also seeing a shift in global trade patterns, and a lot more focus turning to the New Silk Road and Dubai's strategic position along the historic trading route. The positive impact of Expo 2020 is already being felt in our city's industrial, retail, tourism, hospitality, aviation and logistics sectors. Looking ahead, we are excited to be launching the first initiatives from our newly opened office in Shanghai. By establishing a presence there, we will identify attractive trade and investment opportunities for our members in the local market, and also assist Chinese firms that want to expand their reach in the GCC through Dubai. We have also set our sights on promising markets and exciting opportunities in Latin America. Following the strong response we received at the inaugural Global Business Forum on Latin America in Dubai, we will plan to open the chamber's first office in the region within the dynamic city of S\'e3o Paulo. The Chamber will also build on the progress it has achieved in strengthening Dubai's trade ties with Africa, with the next Global Business Forum taking place in November. The 11th edition of the World Retail Congress will return to Dubai for a second time. We are proud to be supporting this high-profile conference that attracts high-calibre business leaders and industry experts to discuss the future of retail and the latest trends impacting the industry. Innovation will play a bigger role in our strategy as we use the Dubai Innovation Index to benchmark progress on this front within the public and private sectors. We will promote innovation through our existing programmes such as the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Business Innovation Award, Tejar Dubai, DubaiStartup Hub and our Smartpreneur Competition. We will also continue to organise initiatives and events that support the growth of SMEs and the entrepreneurial ecosystem. In addition, we will work to attract more international events and associations to Dubai that will support its transition to a knowledge-based economy and boost its overall competitiveness. Mohamed Al Ramahi Chief exeCutive OffiCer, Masdar Last year marked the 10th anniversary since Masdar was established \- it was a year of celebration and reflection, as well as excitement for what the future holds. This excitement is especially strong because of the momentum the clean energy sector has built up. We can now say without doubt that it has reached the critical mass needed to complement conventional energy sources in the global energy mix. A significant benchmark was set in June, when the Dubai Water and Electricity Authority (DEWA) selected a Masdar-led consortium as its preferred bidder to develop Phase III of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The winning tariff was set at a world-record price of 2.99 US cents per kilowatt hour, this was a game-changing moment that clearly underlined the commercial viability and competitiveness of renewables. Another milestone was the success of Al Reyadah \- a joint venture between Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Masdar to create MENA's first Carbon Capture Utilisation & Storage project. This facility is now capturing CO2 emissions from Emirates Steel for injection into onshore oil fields, saving precious natural gas and sequestering up to 800,000 metric tons of CO2 annually. Not only does the project put the UAE among the pioneers of this cutting- edge technology, it also demonstrates the benefits of collaboration between the conventional and renewable energy sectors. During 2016, Masdar also cemented its position among the leading providers of off-grid turnkey renewable energy, having successfully executed a number key projects to remote communities. Our operations in grid-tied renewable energy projects are experiencing double- digit growth, stretching from the west of Africa to the Pacific and reaching a total installed capacity of nearly 100 MW. Masdar City also took strides forward as it consolidated its status as a world- leading urban ecosystem and 'greenprint' for the cities of the future. We approved or signed deals for over 400,000 square meters of real estate, and in addition to maintaining 100 per cent office occupancy, the City attracted more than 100 new Free Zone companies. Among Masdar's other 2016 milestones was hosting more than 33,000 attendees at Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week (ADSW) in January. The Zayed Future Energy Prize had its best year ever for entries, with nearly 1,500 received, and in July, we welcomed Solar Impulse 2, the first aircraft to fly around the world without any fuel, back to Abu Dhabi. At COP22 in Marrakesh we launched the first-ever global survey of youth attitudes towards climate change, renewable energy and sustainability. Looking ahead to 2017, I am confident that the clean energy industry is ready to build on the strong position it has now established. The result will be positive action \- in line with our theme for Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week 2017: Practical Steps towards a Sustainable Future. When the Paris Agreement on climate change was ratified in November it was the largest indication to governments, businesses and the public that the time to act is now. This will affect the business of sustainable development and will be a major influencer in the future of the renewable energy market. Because of this commitment, enhanced technology and improved economics, I expect renewable energy to become even more competitive and widely adopted in 2017 and beyond. The MENA region will play an important role in achieving this. Morocco has committed to increase its share of renewable electricity generation to 52 per cent by 2030; Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is targeting 9.5GW of renewables in the coming years; and Jordan is targeting 10 per cent of energy from renewables by 2020. Outside the region, India has approved a target of producing 175GW of electricity from renewable energy by 2022. This promises to make ADSW 2017 one of the most important ever for stimulating international dialogue and action, further establishing the UAE's global reputation for leadership in clean technology and sustainable development. We have every reason to look forward not just to the next year, but also the next decade, as our sector continues to deliver a more sustainable future. mohammed amin 2016 has been a landmark year for us. The long-awaited merger of Dell EMC finally concluded, creating a $74bn market leader \- Dell Technologies. Consolidating two industry titans means Dell Technologies is now the largest, privately held technology company in the world, serving 98 per cent of the Fortune 500 across 180 countries. This bodes well for our customers in the Middle East, as the new entity boasts the most comprehensive set of capabilities for organisations to thrive in a new digital era. Our sole purpose is to create technol- ogies that enable digital transformation and human progress. We are witnessing an incredibly interesting time. It's the dawn of the Internet of Everything \- what many call the next industrial revolution that will fun- damentally alter the way every business in every industry operates. And at Dell Tech- nologies we believe that this change is rich with opportunity. Today, businesses need to invest in transformation to leverage this industrial revolution. We see ourselves as the trans- formational catalyst for our customers. We recognise that we're not the only ones claim- ing to play this role \- but we are the best. We have the right vision, and leading technolo- gies to empower customers at every step of their digital journey. However, in order to free up funds to invest in this transforma- tion, often IT has to transform first. Most CIOs agree on a three-step strategy beginning with modernising the infrastructure to deliver maximum perfor- mance and availability. This is done using flash-based and converged technologies. Step two involves automating service deliv- ery. Everything in the data centre must be self-service to make the environment reli- able. This turns IT environments into an 'IT-as-a-service' platform, providing a public cloud-like experience inside the data centre. Finally, the entire organisational structure of IT must transform to ensure transparency in costs and services levels are well defined. But transforming IT environments is only half the story. For workforces of the 21st century, it is imperative to modernise user experiences, empower new ways of working and innovative decision making We recognise that We're not the only ones claiming to play this role \- but We are the best. with intuitive applications and data insight. In addition, shifting this status quo to empower a mobile and interconnected workforce necessitates the need to adopt security solutions that drive business value. CIOs face big challenges to make this a reality. They need to allocate resources not only towards IT, workforce and secu- rity transformation but also provision their transformation efforts with adequate support and supplement the traditional applications that run the business today. In short, they must bridge the gap between these two worlds. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to help our customers address these challenges. At a time of economic uncertainty, the key is to find new ways to thrive. At Dell EMC, we provide the essential infrastruc- ture for customers to build their digital future, transform IT and protect their most important asset \- information. Dell eMC Senior ViCe PreSiDent anD regional Manager, turkey, eaStern euroPe, afriCa anD MiDDle eaSt powerletters 2 0 1 7 Dr Habib Al Mulla Baker & Mckenzie HaBiB al Mulla cHairMan The economic horizon in 2016 has not been very optimistic. With the fall in oil prices and the global economic slow- down, the world economy has not been in its best shape, as reflected in the UAE and GCC markets. However, the UAE continued to stimu- late its economy with the launch of various projects in real estate, hospitality and enter- tainment. It is expected that this trend will continue, as we are getting closer to Expo 2020 and all the potential opportunities that it will provide. The UAE has one of the most dynamic and advanced economies in the region. An economy of this nature needs equally a dynamic and an advanced legal framework to properly serve it. In 2015, the long awaited Commer- cial Companies Law was enacted. The new law introduced some new features and approaches intended to raise the levels of good corporate governance, increase the protection of minority shareholders, facilitate IPOs and promote the social responsibility of companies. However, the essential features of the previous law were maintained, particularly the foreign own- ership restriction of 49 per cent. In 2016, the UAE introduced the much-needed Federal Bankruptcy Law. The law has indeed brought a level of mod- ernisation and reform, although it has its shortfalls. However, real assessment of the successful impact of these laws will depend on how they are used and how much they will improve the business and investment climate in the UAE.

Looking ahead to 2017, it is expected that the UAE will continue to evolve in modernising its commercial laws. The UAE is still in need of a modern arbitration law, a standalone capital markets law, a banking law and a data protection law, to name but a few. What the UAE also needs to do is to take a bold approach to address the issues that hinder the business community, rather than the cosmetic approach that has been the trend so far. As the laws have been changing, so too has our legal practice over the course of 2016. Not only have we expanded our dispute resolution, employment and mari- time teams in the UAE in response to our clients' needs, but we have also achieved recognition for our cross-border mergers and acquisitions practice, winning back- to-back industry awards over the past year. One area that we are exploring is tax. The UAE has announced that it will intro- duce VAT in 2018, and we would like to make Baker & McKenzie's extensive tax expertise available to our local and regional clientele, particularly if the proposed VAT regime was to expand into a corporate or income tax. We at Baker & McKenzie Habib Al Mulla believe in the UAE market. We continue to keep a close eye on legal devel- opments and the economic environment and aim to stay ahead of the curve to ensure that we are making our local and global expertise available to our clients, supporting their strategic and operational objectives in the Middle East, as we have been doing for over 30 years. Maha K Al-Ghunaim Global Investment House vIce cHaIrman & Group cHIef executIve offIcer Carrying forward from 2015, the year 2016 continued to remain a sub- dued period for the regional financial services industry. Last year, not only the IPO activity remained muted but trading volumes also remained weaker across GCC stock exchanges. Fiscal woes resulting from a continuous fall in oil prices for the last two years have continued to adversely impact the GCC economies and financial services industry. The year started with downbeat sen- timents as oil prices eased to 12-year low and during the year volatile oil markets kept capital markets on edge. Further, during the year, global cues emanating from major political disruptions including Brexit and the US elections contributed to overall weakness and volatility in the regional markets. Accordingly, the highlight of the year was a dramatic rise in sovereign bor- rowings, a significant trend reversal for traditionally cash-rich GCC countries. Towards the end of the year, the markets witnessed an optimism driven by a combi- nation of successful $17.5bn Saudi Arabian sovereign bond issuance and a rally in oil markets driven by OPEC's decision to cut oil production starting the next year. Despite these extremely volatile and challenging times, we at Global Investment House continue to maintain our profitabil- ity momentum and to create value for our stakeholders through our resilient and robust fee-based business model. During the year, we won several mandates in various lines of business, suc- cessfully completed several transactions and our managed funds and portfolios continued to outperform their respective benchmarks. We have successfully acquired two real estate properties on behalf of our cli- ents in the United Kingdom offering them competitive and stable income, and are in the process of closing other real estate We expect 2017 to be Another extreMely chAllenGinG yeAr for the reGionAl cApitAl MArKets And the investMent industry. transactions in Europe and the US. On behalf of private equity funds we manage, we acquired one of the largest quick service restaurant managers in the GCC, Yum Yum Tree restaurants chain, completed several exits and distributed more than $25m to clients raising the total amount distributed since 2009 to more than $380m despite a challenging exit environment for private companies in the region. Our Special Situations Asset Man- agement solution, launched in 2014, also distributed more than $16m this year, raising the total distributions to more than $265m since 2014 with exits at valuations exceeding targeted prices by 60 per cent. We expect 2017 to be another extremely challenging year for the regional capital markets and the investment industry. On the global front, we continue to expect acceleration in US output growth helped by higher fiscal spending as the new presi- dent assumes office. Also, expectation of higher interest rates and the relative weakness of other global economies means the strong US dollar era will continue. A rate hike would accelerate the reversal of carry trade, increasing pres- sure on the emerging market currency and fixed income markets. Moving to the region, we expect 2017 to be a year of consolidation for financial ser- vices sector mirroring the several structural economic reforms targeted to position GCC economies for the long haul. In 2017, we will continue offering our clients innovative investment solutions with regular distributions and capital gains including real estate products and private equity opportunities in food & beverage, education and healthcare sectors. Further- more, we will extend our special situations asset management offering to institutions in the United Arab Emirates Nabil Habayeb GE PrEsidEnt and chiEf ExEcutivE officEr for thE MiddlE East, north africa and turkEy Having set the fundamentals and by supporting the region to address economic volatilities through new investments, stra- tegic partnerships and highly efficient manufacturing systems, we see 2017 as a promising year, where our advanced tech- nology capabilities will help achieve more tangible benefits for our partners. In the power sector we are bringing our H-class turbines, the world's largest and most efficient gas turbines that offer unprecedented levels of reliability and fuel flexibility. GE was recognised by the Guin- ness World Records for powering the world's most efficient combined-cycle power plant, based on an achieved efficiency rate of up to 62.22 per cent achieved using the HA tur- bine at the Bouchain plant in France. Our oil and gas business has strength- ened its regional presence through the Pressure Control Manufacturing Facility, the Multi-Modal Manufacturing Center, and its partnership with Saudi Aramco and Cividale SpA to build the MENA region's first-of-its-kind Forging & Casting Manu- facturing Facility. We are closer to our customers than ever before, assuring timely maintenance and repair services for power plants with the Global Repairs Solutions Jebel Ali Ser- vice Center. We are also expanding our digital footprint in the aluminium industry through our partnership with IIT Madras. In the UAE, we will also contribute to cleaner air in line with the UAE Govern- ment Accelerator Programme, by working with Emirates Global Aluminium and the UAE Ministry of Climate Change & Environment. we entered 2016 riding on the remarkable response that we gained from the launch of our industrial internet solutions in the region. This could not have come at a more opportune moment. The impact of the oil price volatility, and subsequent infrastructure investment roll-backs, reflected in a stronger call for economic and industrial diversification for creating more jobs for nationals and to strengthening the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector. GE's internal evolution as a digital industrial company is thus a natural fit to the requirements of the region. Through the application of digitisation across all our businesses we have set a new template for the next wave of growth for our partners. With our culture of simplification, and by drawing on GE Store, our global mar- ketplace of ideas and innovations, we see a new era of opportunities for growth in the region. By delivering on positive and tangi- ble benefits for our partners, we continue to be the partner in progress \- reinventing ourselves and our technologies to meet the shifting requirements of our partners in an ever-changing economic environment. Through 2016, we strengthened our partnerships across MENAT to support our partners to deploy industrial inter- net technologies that bring unprecedented enhancements in their operational efficiency. The integration of heavy machinery with advanced analytics enables them to get connected and gain insights for increased productivity. We also marked new investments in localised manufactur- ing underpinned by the expansion of the GE Manufacturing & Technology Center in Dammam, which now manufactures heavy duty gas turbines in Saudi for the world. Transformational change comes from a culture of localised innovation, and we formed partnerships with leading entities including the UAE Ministry of Economy, Saudi Arabian Industrial Investments Company, Saudi Aramco and Masdar City to identify innovative digital solutions in areas including energy and healthcare. Across all our initiatives, the goal has been to create a vibrant ecosystem that covers all touch-points \- from technology deployment tHe goal Has beeN to create a vibraNt ecosystem tHat covers all toucH-poiNts \- from tecHNology deploymeNt to promotiNg iNNovatioN aNd buildiNg tHe local sme value cHaiN. to promoting innovation and building the local SME value chain. This is reflected in our focus on strengthening the skills of local youth through partnerships with aca- demic institutions and by nurturing the local entrepreneurship ecosystems. The GE Eco- magination Innovation Center in Masdar City, the GE Saudi Innovation & Technology Center and the newly opened Kuwait Tech- nology Center are all robust examples of how we nurture the next generation of talent. In Saudi Arabia, over 150 Saudi SME suppliers are partnering with us in making parts for gas turbine systems at GEMTEC. We aim to double the supplier base in the next three years. Hussein Hachem ArAmex CeO 2016 will go down as one of the most unprecedented years in history. From the UK's decision to leave the EU, to the presidential election in the United States, there were historic politi- cal and economic upsets that caught many by surprise. The one thing that has remained relatively constant in the midst of these unpredictable times is consumer demand. While the world goes through fundamental changes, the need for the efficient and effective movement of goods and services has not changed. At Aramex our focus has been to stay alert, responsive and agile to meet these demands and we have succeeded. Why have we been able to navigate these turbulent times? Innovation in technology. This has been the underlying reason why we have been able to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. In 2016 we launched our mobile app for consumers to improve our customers experience. We also partnered with what- 3words, the global address system, to reach more customers in off-the-grid locations. Technology is ultimately behind every fun- damental business decision we make and is critical to the growth of our e-commerce business and global footprint. Other companies have also leveraged technology to succeed, with Uber, Airbnb and UAE company Careem using plat- forms to aggregate data, predict consumer behaviour and develop new and innovative products and services. And while we can celebrate these achievements, the harsh reality is that InnovatIon In tecHnology alone wIll no longer be enougH to navIgate tHe current envIronment- busInesses must do more. technological innovation is now essential. If you are a business and want to com- pete, having innovative technologies is no longer an option it is a requirement. But as we move into an unpredictable 2017, I believe the recipe for business success calls for a different order. Innovation in tech- nology alone will no longer be enough to navigate the current environment - busi- nesses must do more. In my opinion, businesses must pursue strategic partnerships while continu- ing to leverage innovative technologies. We partnered with Australia Post this year to give us reach across all post offices worldwide. In today's environment, pursu- ing synergistic partnerships also allows businesses to leverage technology more effectively. Today, Aramex exports our technologies to new business partners and integrates other business' platforms into our operations. New partnerships also make us more cost effective by outsourcing logistics ser- vices to third party suppliers who have the appropriate technologies in place. Our e-commerce platform has also benefit- ted from more partnerships with online shopping vendors who have the necessary technological hardware. With all of this in mind, one thing remains very clear. Companies are suc- ceeding by disrupting their business models through innovation in technol- ogy. But the key to more success in 2017 will be how companies leverage strategic partnerships to help them adapt to global market uncertainty, take advantage of innovative technologies and capitalise on opportunities for growth. Dr Azad Moopen Aster DM HeAltHcAre FounDer, cHAirMAn AnD MAnAging Director The Middle East's healthcare sector continued its impressive upward tra- jectory during 2016. This is despite a gloomy backdrop of macro-economic storms, fuelled by suppressed oil prices and geopolitical uncertainty, both regionally and globally. In fact, the healthcare industry as a whole has continued to deliver new growth opportunities, driven by fresh medical advancements, demand for quality, acces- sible and affordable healthcare services, and increasing life expectancy. Over the past 12 months, we have wit- nessed significant growth, which came as a response to market needs. In the GCC alone, we are working on delivering five new hospital projects, including four in the UAE and one in Qatar. Meanwhile, in India, we formally launched a Qua- ternary Healthcare facility in Hebbal, Bengaluru, bringing the total number of healthcare facilities on the subcontinent to 15 establishments. In addition, we acquired a 60 per cent stake in Harley Street Medical Centre (HSMC) in Abu Dhabi. Currently operat- ing as a day-care surgery facility, the centre is staffed by European-trained medical practitioners specialising in urology, plas- tic surgery, gynaecology, gastroenterology, orthopaedics, paediatrics, internal medi- cine and general surgery. Our growth story has been a spectacu- lar one, having started with a single clinic in Bur Dubai three decades ago. Today, we operate 296 establishments spread across nine countries in the Middle East, India and Philippines. For us, rapid medical advancements, coupled with changing demographics and an aging population, make fertile grounds for more growth. And this growth will be guided by an unrelenting vision to pro- vide people with better access to quality, affordable healthcare. We strongly believe that profit should be a by-product and not the aim in healthcare. As such, we have launched several CSR initiatives aimed at giving back to the society. With all these new developments, resourcing remains a pressing issue. The twin dangers of inadequate homegrown talent and a decline in international talent are putting pressure on industry players. We call upon the industry and regional governments to support the development of teaching institutions as a proactive, capacity-building measure, to further strengthen the sector. To this end, we ventured into edu- cation with the opening of DM WIMS Medical College and Hospital, in Way- anad, India, to train future healthcare professionals under the Dr Moopen Education and Research Foundation (DMERF). We currently employ in excess of 18,750 people across the Middle East, India and Philippines including 2,035 doctors and 6,129 nurses, who touch the lives of 50,000 patients per day. Our grOwth stOry hAs been A spectAculAr One, hAving stArteD with A single clinic in bur DubAi three DecADes AgO. Another healthcare-related area of growth for Aster DM Healthcare is technology. With the introduction of forward-thinking services such as "Aster Chronic Care", which offers a distance monitoring system, and online pharmacy (asteronline.com) leading the fusion of healthcare and technology, making qual- ity care accessible and convenient for all. In general, there's still a lot of untapped potential for technology in the healthcare sector. Investing in advancements such as wearables will greatly improve the delivery of healthcare services, and reduce costs. For example, we'll be able to monitor a patient's blood sugar levels and make the necessary adjustments to their treatment, all remotely. Exploring the use of such technologies opens the doors to the next- generation of care. Ashish J Thakkar Mara Group & Mara Foundation Founder 2016 has been a monumental year for Mara Group and Mara Founda- tion. Not only have we launched a number of exciting new business ventures and foundation initiatives, 2016 also marks the 20th anniversary of the Group \- a sig- nificant milestone in our history. What started as a journey of a family's survival 20 years ago, has led to a voyage of discovery and the evolution of a business that we refer to today as 'Mara'. Like many start-ups, we have faced an abundance of challenges along the way and understand that our failures, along with our successes, are a fundamental tenet of our growth. Doing good whilst doing well is a motto that is now ingrained in our psyche and will continue to serve as a solid foundation for our work in Africa for years to come. While we can't ignore the challenges Africa has faced in recent months, includ- ing the dip in commodity prices, economic slowdown in China and rising pockets of political instability in the Horn and South- ern Africa, etc, our passion and vision for the business opportunity on the continent remains as bold and optimistic as it was when we started our journey 20 years ago. This year alone, we have launched three new businesses with footprints spanning the Middle East and Africa region: an infrastructure investment vehicle for Africa, formed via a joint ven- ture with Mara, General Electric and Atlas Merchant Capital; an online jobs portal, Mara Jobs, set up to connect blue and white collar workers in Africa to part and full-time work opportunities; and a last-mile delivery business, Mara Xpress, servicing the growing e-commerce mar- kets of the Middle East, soon to expand into Africa. What this clearly demonstrates is that despite recent economic, political and infrastructural challenges, we remain confident in the long-term prospects of the African and Middle East economies, as do our partners and investors. Beyond our core commercial activities, at the end of last year, our social enter- prise, Mara Foundation, also launched the inaugural Ashish J Thakkar Global Entrepreneurship Index 2016 to better understand entrepreneurial environments around the world. What became clear from our study of the African markets is that one of the principal barriers facing Africa's economies and entrepreneurs is Like mAny sTArT- ups, we hAve fAced An AbundAnce of chALLenges ALong The wAy And undersTAnd ThAT our fAiLures, ALong wiTh ouT successes Are A fundAmenTAL TeneT of our growTh. the lack of infrastructure. Around 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are currently without electricity access \- 70 per cent of the population \- and 50 per cent of businesses in sub-Saharan Africa view a lack of reliable electricity access as a major constraint to doing business. As a result, Africa's businesses, and especially entrepreneurs are limited in their capacity to succeed and grow. But with this challenge comes oppor- tunity \- an opportunity to provide a regular, reliable supply of electricity to enable large, medium and micro busi- nesses to thrive. This is something we are looking to address through our infrastruc- ture vehicle. As we look to the year ahead and, indeed, the next 20 years, our commer- cial focus will very much remain in Africa and the Middle East and our foundation will continue to support young and female entrepreneurs around the world mentor- ship and advocacy. This is a pivotal and exciting time in our history where our physical, digital and biological worlds are colliding. Africa has shown us before and they will show us again how they can leapfrog the bad habits of the West and truly lead on the digital revolution. This, along with the infrastructure challenge, will be key to Africa's success. Maryam Al Mheiri Media Zone authority \- abu dhabi and twofour54 acting chief executive officer Reflecting on 2016, steady and solid are the two words that spring to mind for twofour54, the home of media in Abu Dhabi. Against a backdrop of economic challenge and global political and social change, we continued to fulfil our man- date to help Abu Dhabi build a thriving media industry in the capital. We saw modest growth in our overall partner base; currently we have just over 430 active media companies on campus. What is interesting to note is the shifting sector focus. We witnessed growth in dig- ital companies, which follows the global shift in this direction; while the growth we saw in publishing companies contrasts with the global picture of print media. With our role as industry enabler, we worked towards enhancing the production industry's infrastructure, including building Abu Dhabi's first backlot for film projects. As a result, we secured a three-year agreement with major regional network, MBC, to film its Arabic dramas in Abu Dhabi, helping to boost the production sector. Twofour54 also invested in three start- up companies to serve underdeveloped parts of the industry value chain and sup- port entrepreneurs. More than 60 per cent of the UAE's GDP comes from small and medium businesses so it is vital that within our sector we support the businesses that will become the employers of tomorrow. One of our proudest milestones of last year was hosting our longest feature film project to date, Bollywood film Dishoom. Film- ing for 38 days at 30 locations, it is a great example of the size and scope of project that Abu Dhabi can take on. Talent development also remained at the top of our agenda and we placed more than 75 interns with companies on campus and ran our first ever summer camp, to introduce young students to the media industry as a career option. Looking forwArd to 2017, the rise of digitAL wiLL continue in terMs of Advertising And pLAtforM deveLopMent. International engagement is critical to the growth of the local industry and we were delighted to welcome delegations from the US, Ireland, Korea and Japan to Abu Dhabi in 2016. Looking forward to 2017, the rise of digital will continue in terms of advertis- ing and platform development. Currently digital advertising in the region accounts for only 10 per cent of total advertising spend, which is significantly less than in other parts of the world. New tools will come to life, but with so many choices for consumers, the winners will be those who engage the audience emotionally, prioritise user experience and achieve seamless execution. Like in other sectors, we can expect to see more consolidation in the media industry as business models evolve in response to market changes and a matur- ing of the industry. We will also see more companies embrace the power of partner- ship and collaboration. This is a theme we have seen in the twofour54 community that has resulted in some impressive con- tent outputs. We expect to see continued interna- tional interest in Abu Dhabi as a media hub. As the private sector looks for growth opportunities in more challeng- ing times, the spotlight will swing further towards the MENA region as a vibrant, young, increasingly connected but largely untapped market for media content con- sumption. Creative sectors like the media will generate the vast majority of job opportunities in the future, so for our part, twofour54 will continue to focus on devel- oping Emirati and Arab talent, to enable more private sector investment in the local industry and the job creation that comes with this.

Hotel operators and owners should be more concerned about the strong US dollar making 2017 a chal- lenging year. Having spent two years on site ensuring the completion of SKAI's first major devel- opment, Viceroy Palm Jumeirah Dubai, which is set to open in the first quarter of 2017, I have a vested interest in Dubai's hospitality sector, in particular on Palm Jumeirah. In the last few months I have been asked over and over again about whether or not I am concerned about opening a hotel with 477-rooms at a time when reports are focused on fears of a hotel oversupply. My short answer is no and I'll explain why. Firstly, I believe in Dubai's hospitality story. Like any sector it is cyclical but its fundamentals remain the same. Year-round sun, frequent travel connections around the world from Emirates and ultra-luxury resorts will continue to attract holidaymak- ers and business travellers. Secondly, tourists are still prepared to pay for a five-star ultra-luxury experience. Over the last three years average revenue per available room (RevPAR) rates for luxury Palm Jumeirah hotels have remained stable in spite of the geopolitical turmoil around the world. According to data from STR, average RevPAR rates in 2014 were Dhs1,499 ($408) \- this was at a time when the average barrel of oil was around $87. In 2015, when the price of oil halved, aver- age RevPAR declined only a small amount to Dhs1,461. So far this year, it has held at an average of Dhs1,342, and when Decem- ber is taken into account, I expect it to be around Dhs1,400. If you look at currencies around the world during the same three-year period, you will see that in reality travellers have continued to pay more in their local cur- rency to stay on Palm Jumeirah. The UK's decision to leave the European Union in June has had a major impact on pound sterling. From December 2013 to Decem- ber 2016, sterling has declined 23 per cent compared to the US dollar. Over the same period, the euro has dropped 22 per cent and the rupee nine per cent. These stable RevPAR rates during a difficult period globally prove that Palm Jumeirah remains desirable and tourists are willing to pay for the experience. It also demonstrates that 2017 is unlikely to be challenging because of supply and demand problems but because of currency issues. Looking beyond 2017, I think 2018 will be the stabilisation year and from 2019 the uptrend will be significant. In three years Dubai will host Expo 2020, which is expected to attract more than 17 million international visitors to the city and just two years later, Qatar will play host to the 2022 World Cup. All of these are good enough reasons to ensure I am back on site in January, overseeing the construction of our second hospitality project. Paul Griffiths Dubai airports CEo planning and execution. As a result, while we are mindful of short- term fluctuations to regional and global traffic volumes due to social-economic fac- tors, we must also take a longer-term view of macro-economic factors and emerging trends that will shape our world 10 years or more from today. And our world is changing. According to OECD and IATA statistics, in Asia alone there will be 1.93 billion additional passen- ger journeys by 2034 (vs. 2014). Accelerating urbanisation is supporting the importance of air travel, and in turn the concentration of population will amplify the relevance of intercontinental hubs. Accordingly, airlines will continue to need to connect route net- works to give people the 'from anywhere to anywhere' service they demand. As a result, the creation and expansion of the intercon- tinental hub will continue to play a vital role in the next two decades. Additionally, Dubai's growth trajectory and emergence as a global centre for trade, commerce, tourism and finance in the dec- ades ahead will similarly put demands on airport infrastructure as a fundamental ena- bler of that economic expansion. So, to be successful, airports will need to make sure they invest sufficiently in cost- effective connection services to enable these network efficiencies to be realised to cater for the increased mobility created by the expan- sion of the middle classes both in this region, and more specifically, in Asia. But even as this pressure mounts, scale cannot be the sole focus. Historically the approach to airport expansion has been all about building stuff. At DXB alone we've spent about $13bn since 2008 on major new facilities. And we're not alone. All over the world airport management companies are investing in bigger and bigger facilities to accommodate more and more passengers. The traditional view of airport com- panies as infrastructure providers must change. We must become customer-cen- tric. Every customer that passes through an airport, whether departing, arriving, or in transit has needs that are unique and most airports have yet to unlock the secrets of mass-customisation that has been pioneered so well in manufacturing. The answer is in our pockets.... well almost everyone's pocket. A recent survey by SITA shows 81 per cent of passengers carry smartphones with them. And the pace of miniaturisation exceeds the growth in portable computing power. As technology has evolved and its usage sky- rocketed, the world around us has changed. As have expectations. This is heralding a new age of free- dom: the freedom from the linearity of scale and capacity. When you consider capacity equals space multiplied by flow, we can use tech- nology to enhance flow through in the same space. That is the fundamental prem- ise underlying our DXB Plus programme which is designed to improve service at space constrained Dubai International while boosting capacity to 118 million by 2023 without adding any significant infra- structure. And it is a driving consideration in the design and build of Dubai World Central, which will be the new home for Emirates airline in or around 2025 with capacity for 120 million passengers and unparalleled customer convenience. We have a unique opportunity to take the next step in the evolution of the airport experience with our shared, connected cus- tomers. To do this we need to design and apply technology in a different way. And we must think completely differently. We must change our thinking and our approach and put the customer first. That means col- laboration and shared ownership of the customer experience. The winners will be those airports that invest in smart technology, infrastructure and collaborative processes that combine to deliver on customer needs. And Dubai Airports has a strategy in place to ensure we are in that winner's circle.

Pouya Parsafar EntErprisE systEms Distribution CEo anD Co-founDEr Dubai has been growing inexorably over the last few decades, and 2016 was by far the most rewarding year in terms of deliverability and innovation within the enterprise industry. It has also been an exceptionally pro- lific year for Enterprise Systems. As our fifth year in the industry, we have been rising exponentially and expanding at rapid proportions. In a transforming industry and during stirring times, we have sustained high tar- gets; both in our deliverability of services and the way we lead our business. 2016 was a year we established ourselves within the enterprise industry as one of the lead- ing information technology distribution companies within the Middle East. We believe that in 2017, information technology will be implemented deeply into enterprises. ICT systems will turn out to be considerably more than just support- ing devices, but will instead play roles in decision-making, marketing, customer relationship management and customer service. Digital Enterprises of the future will offer better products and solutions by embracing imaginative ICT innovation. Today, the proliferation of IT presents new opportunities for tens of millions of enterprises worldwide. In 2016, more than 200 million employees adopted the con- cept of bring your own device (BYOD) and big data analytics and software-defined networks will dictate how enterprises con- duct business. We believe that in 2017, information technology Will be imPlemented deePly into enterPrises. ICT systems are shifting from the role of cost centres to that of business-driven centres, enabling enterprises to operate more efficiently, and will be used to create revenue rather than simply be used in a supportive capacity. In 2017, we predict that gathering and analysing data is going to be critical for understanding the journey ahead. And choosing the right vendors and the right solutions will be critical during this period. The UAE \- more so Dubai \- has been established as a core for innovative IT solutions and brands as it is largely the first to present new solutions and services in the region. An expanding number of local and worldwide vendors have estab- lished their footprint in the Middle East through the UAE. The UAE is already a leader in areas such as smart city development and 2017 looks set to see organisations in the country increase their adoption of other transformational IT. ICT vendors and service providers, including distributors and system inte- grators, need to work more shrewdly to sustain the rapid growth we've seen over the last few years. This means initially looking inwards within your own organi- sation to make sure our existing talent is up to date in terms of training processes and procedures. They also need to be posi- tively motivated to embrace the smart way of working. Our approach towards our client base salso needs to be smart. We need to under- stand our clients and their motivations better and move away from product sales to solutions sales that support their busi- ness by increasing their sales or reducing their costs. This will in turn have a positive impact on the return on investment. From an infrastructural perspec- tive, the Gulf \- more so the UAE \- has grown from a developing into a developed region. In order to be successful in 2017, corporates must take to heart what their clients require and look toward their ven- dors to provide solutions to satisfy those requirements. We are transforming and chang- ing the direction of our journey to be in line with the market direction and our client's needs. During 2017 our mission is to explore new ways of supporting our clients to seek out new innovative vendors and new tal- ented individuals and to boldly venture where no distributor has before. powerletters 2 0 1 7 Andrew Fisk General ManaGer, Valiant CliniC After four years of planning and construction, Valiant Clinic opened in Dubai in November 2016, creating our own niche through our focus on high qual- ity, evidence-based medicine. The process of introducing a new concept gives a unique perspective on accomplishment: on the one hand, we have successfully opened our doors and are making our mark but on the other hand we have much left to do in areas such as cus- tomer service, regional disease prevention, and lifestyle choices to name a few. We saw an opportunity in this market for a facility that provides a focus on pre- ventive health care rather than traditional, reactive medicine. This is a proposition that is garnering huge interest in the UAE as it embraces a long-term focus on health and allows doctors and health specialists to guide lifestyle choices as opposed to just treating their diseases and symptoms. The prognosis is promising. We are optimistic about this holistic view of good health finding a strong foothold in this region in 2017-2018. In addition, given the current rate of growth, we believe we will get the opportunity to test the penetration of two industry buzz words \- quality and value \- in 2017. Our customers are no longer 'patients' who want to be treated; they are well- informed individuals, who perceive doctors as advisors. This is a major shift and will put the onus on medical health experts to be educated on a wide variety of subjects, deal positively with well-informed consum- ers, and push institutions like ours to offer services that focus on customer experience as well as health needs. This encourages doctors to treat each customer as a guest as opposed to a subject under observation. A bespoke approach to service will go a long way in creating distinction in the minds of all our stakeholders. We are at a major turning point in this industry and although the sector has grown exponentially, there has not been a commen- surate increase in the quality of services. This also includes a commitment to transparency. Doctors, clinics and hospi- tals must be transparent about the quality of care they provide in order to attract and keep their patients, as well as raise or even sustain their pricing. With much of the competition in Dubai being about price, we will see the market hit critical mass and the density of providers causing pressure on both price and quality. With debates and discussions around escalating costs in the United States, we are seeing a ripple effect around the globe with scrutiny on healthcare pricing growing everywhere. As health insur- ance becomes more pervasive, employers, insurance companies and physicians are all learning how to operate in an era of we will get the opportunity to test the penetrAtion oF two industry buzz words \- quAlity And vAlue \- in 2017. cost containment and relative value of the medical services provided. It will become imperative for health- care providers to align pricing with quality, especially as Dubai seeks to compete with destinations like India and Thailand in establishing credentials as a medical tourism destination. Insurers have strug- gled to underwrite healthcare insurance at a level that covers claims expenses. As these insurers attempt to raise rates, the market will cap whatever price increase they can achieve. Medical providers will then be pushed to deliver services for the same or less money, bending the health- care price curve down from its historical rate of growth. On the bright side, the competition will transition from price-based to qual- ity-focused, compelling employers and insurers to demand transparency and qual- ity metrics that will change the market. Finally, ultra-luxury healthcare services are developing and growing in demand, and the concentration of providers serving the higher end of the market are not con- sidering insurance as a key pricing driver. These providers will continue to grow offer- ing premium services in niche segments to a very select clientele as opposed to a singu- lar provision of care. This year will see these market trends evolve and come into conflict. Provid- ers that evolve to focus on quality will be the best prepared to not just survive these competing forces, but thrive in the increasingly competitive Dubai healthcare environment \</doc>

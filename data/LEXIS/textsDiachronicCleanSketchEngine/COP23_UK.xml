Preliminary strategies, developed by Jacobs to address challenges posed by sea level rise on the South Pacific nation of Kiribati, were showcased at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) held in Bonn, Germany. The Government of Kiribati (GoK) presented an animated visualization of a concept land and urban development plan, which was created after the Jacobs-facilitated workshops in Kiribati. The workshops, which involved government departments, were designed to ensure that the project vision was being developed by the stakeholders with an understanding and agreement of the key issues and design principles critical to the success of the plan. 'The workshop format proved to be highly effective, with everyone participating, and wrapped with a sense of common aspiration and concern being recognized during a close out session,' said to Jacobs Project Manager Simon Liddell. Jacobs was appointed by the New Zealand Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT), in partnership with the GoK, to assess the feasibility of undertaking a land and urban development project on the Temaiku Bight in the Kiribati capital of Tarawa. 'This project comes at an extremely critical time in the history of Kiribati, as the South Pacific nation faces economic, urbanization and environmental challenges,' said Jacobs Buildings and Infrastructure Asia Pacific Senior Vice President Patrick Hill. 'Jacobs has a wealth of adaption, geotechnical engineering and sustainable land use planning experience that we will leverage to assist Kiribati in this effort.' The multi-disciplinary study involves assessing the feasibility of increasing the height of a 330-hectare area of land on the Temaiku Bight to approximately two meters above the highest measured sea level. Kiribati, an atoll in the South Pacific, is one of the world's most economically and physically vulnerable countries. Home to more than 110,000 people, Kiribati is made up of 33 low-lying atolls which, at their highest elevation, average 6 feet (1.8 meters) above sea level. Over the next eight decades, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) projects a 3 feet (0.9 meter) increase in global sea levels. Kiribati's surrounding sea levels are predicted to rise by up to 0.6 feet (0.17 metres) by 2030. In addition to the feasibility study, Jacobs is developing an accompanying conceptual land use plan that addresses resilience issues impacting the atoll, including rapid urbanization, limited water supply, ecosystem services and an increasing risk of land inundation from king tides. The project is scheduled for completion in March 2018 when the feasibility of the land and urban development design, engineering and environmental and social impacts will be presented to the GoK for a decision on whether to proceed with the ambitious and transformational project. The Jacobs team is comprised of urban planners, social impact and stakeholder engagement specialists, terrestrial and marine environmental subject matter specialists, along with geotechnical, coastal, water, wastewater, power, civil and transport engineers.

COP23 : promoting climate change education for a fair economic transition Education International reiterated the importance of emphasising climate change education in order to achieve a fair transition towards carbon-free economies during the 23rd United Nations climate change conference . "Climate change education should be a priority at this global conference on the climate", said Dennis Sinyolo, Education International (EI) representative at the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change ( COP23 ), held in Bonn from 6 to 17 November. He spoke on the occasion of an activity co-organised by the International Trade Union Confederation and Greenpeace aimed at fostering a dialogue between the organisations working towards achieving a fair transition towards carbon-free economies. Promoting values of humanism and respect for our planet is the key role of education According to Sinyolo, the key role of education involves promoting values of humanism and respect for our planet, a role which can only be fulfilled if teachers and other education professionals receive the necessary training and support. "The urgent and fair transition to which we all aspire requires a major change involving unprecedented mobilisation of future generations, such as the young people currently in school," he concluded.

COP23 - Is sustainable land and water management compatible with small-scale farming under climate change? During a panel discussion on 'The Land and Water Advantage: Is sustainable land and water management compatible with small-scale farming under climate change?' at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, participants from different organizations met to discuss how to transform agricultural development in the face of climate change. Moderated by Dhanush Dinesh, Global Policy Engagement Manager at Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CGIAR), the discussion aimed to determine which conditions favour sustainable land and water management and to highlight innovations and policies creating favourable conditions for smallholder farmers. As stated by one of the panellist Theo de Jorge: 'there is no agriculture without land rights and water access rights.' Climate change adaptation in agriculture will be driven by growing pressure on water and land, and the food production will have to keep up with increasing demand. 'We need to produce 60% more food by 2025' said Alan Nicol, Strategic Program Leader, Promoting Sustainable Growth, International Water Management Institute (IWMI). 'Managing agricultural water availability access and use is key to success' he added. He presented innovations in water management and highlighted challenges in their deployment. 'Climate change will increase food prices and increasing food prices worsens extreme poverty' Jan Low, 2016 World Food Prize co-laureate and Co-leader of the Sweet potato for Profit and Health Initiative, International Potato Center (CIP) said. She made a presentation on whether non-GMO climate-smart crops can sustain small-scale farming, drawing from her experience in Africa with the Sweet potato for Profit and Health Initiative at the International Potato Center. 'To adapt to climate change we need to produce more adapted crops faster at times under tougher environments and we need to produce more with less water.' she continued. James Kinyangi, African Development Bank' s Chief Climate Change & Policy Advisor remarked that agriculture remains a major source of income in Africa. However, its untapped potential has resulted in widespread chronic poverty and food insecurity. 'In Africa 61% of the total employment is in agriculture.' Kinyangi emphasized that a supporting enabling environment in Africa includes risk management, asset protection and the inclusion of women and youth, through greater access to agricultural finance. He affirmed that the Bank is giving much attention to the development of agribusiness as a significant proportion of 70 million new jobs by 2020 will be created in the agricultural sector in Africa. He identified conditions that have to be set to enable the supporting environment for smallholder farmers in Africa.

November 9, 2017 Youth groups working in Africa's Congo Basin countries are supporting economic progress in isolated rural communities while protecting the forest, and a young woman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany, said it is time their voices were heard. Youth groups working in Africa's Congo Basin countries are supporting economic progress in isolated rural communities while protecting the forest, and a young woman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, said it that is time their voices were heard. "Young people in the Congo Basin have been doing things on the ground that often go ignored," explained Marie Tamoifo, President of the Cameroon Green Youth Association (Association de la Jeunesse verte du Cameroun - AJVC) and Regional Coordinator of the Youth Network for sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa (Reseau des jeunes pour la gestion durable des ecosystemes forestiers d'Afrique centrale - REJEFAC) in an interview with UN News. REJEFAC brings together youth organizations from 10 Congo Basin countries - Burundi, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe and Chad). Its aim is to promote the effective participation of young environmental actors in decision-making in the Congo Basin and "to contribute to the emergence in the region of a new type of leadership, more sensitive and open to the requirements of sustainable development." "[As for] actions on the ground, there are reforestation, awareness and education programmes for young people. It's about strengthening the work that is done by governments," said Ms. Tamoifo. For several years, AJVC has been developing a programme in Cameroon for the electrification of isolated rural areas with solar panels. The programme started in 15 pilot communities in the east, in the center and in the far north of the country with the installation of solar panels in homes and schools. A contribution is made by the community itself, representing 25 to 30 per cent of the cost. "In these 15 communities, we trained 85 young people in solar installation techniques but also in psycho-socio-organizational methodology," explained Ms Tamoifo. "When we arrive in a community, we first hold a discussion with that community. We try to see with [them] what the glaring problems are." The youth participating in this programme are from the community. They are trained and they provide maintenance for the solar panels that have already been installed. "For now, they are not really paid. They receive a small allowance," added Ms.Tamoifo. The association needs more financial support to maintain and expand this programme. "We have received more than 100 requests from villages and we cannot answer them given [our] modest means. And young people who are trained today also need to make a living to be able to continue this work," she said. A 'climate caravan' in Cameroon Among other actions carried out by young people in the Congo Basin region, the REJEFAC Coordinator mentioned a tree planting initiative by volunteers in the Republic of Congo, and a programme focusing on handicrafts and conservation of natural resources in Rwanda. Before coming to COP 23 , the network organized a 'climate caravan' in Cameroon with the participation of young people from the ten countries of the Congo Basin to show what youth organizations are doing in terms of sustainable development and protection of the planet. "We organized this caravan which was named 'the COP at home,'" said the Coordinator of REJEFAC. Young people have been designated as climate ambassadors. The 'climate caravan' travelled in the Douala region, coastal areas and went to Equatorial Guinea. "It showed how we could talk about the theoretical aspect and go on the ground to experience the realities of conservation parks and conflicts between humans and elephants," concluded Ms. Tamoifo. \</doc>

A coalition of US cities, companies and other groups has pledged to stay committed to the Paris agreement on climate change, despite President Donald Trump initiating America's withdrawal from it. The accord was signed in December 2015 by nearly 200 countries in an effort to curb carbon emissions and limiting global warming to under 2\'b0C. Called the We Are Still In coalition, the group set up a pavilion outside of the official United Nations climate change conference ( COP23 ) venue in Bonn, Germany, where countries - including the US - are meeting for the next few weeks to negotiate how the Paris agreement will be implemented. Republicans and Democrats alike make up the We Are Still In coalition, which has more than 1,000 CEOs, mayors and governors in the US. The purpose of the pavilion is to showcase how Americans are still fighting climate change in spite of the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle Obama-era environmental regulations. The coalition claims it represents more than 130 million Americans and $6.2trn (\£34.7trn) of annual economic output. Fiji, which is presiding over this year's UN talks, welcomed the coalition as a "perfect example" of how the Paris accord aims to widen action beyond national governments." THE INDEPENDENT \</doc>

November 14, 2017 On the heels of one of the worst - and most costly - Atlantic hurricane seasons on record, a global initiative was launched Wednesday at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany, with the aim of providing insurance to hundreds of millions of vulnerable people by 2020 and to increase the resilience of developing countries against the impacts of climate change. In 2017, extreme weather events are estimated to have caused more than $ 200 billion worth of damage worldwide, as hurricanes, droughts and rising sea levels devastated vulnerable communities with increased frequency and intensity. In the face of skyrocketing costs, new forms of financial protection have become an increasingly urgent part of the climate change discussion. The InsuResilience Global Partnership is a major scaling-up of an initiative started by the G7 in 2015 under the German Presidency. It aims at meeting the pledge of providing cover and support to an extra 400 million vulnerable people by 2020. The Global Partnership now brings together G20 countries in partnership with the so called 'V20' nations, a group of 49 of the most vulnerable countries including small islands like Fiji, which holds the Presidency of COP23 . "The Global Partnership is a practical response to the needs of those who suffer loss because of climate change," said the COP23 President and Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama. This announcement on climate risk insurance was made a day before the high-level segment of COP23 , which Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, are expected to attend. Thomas Silberhorn, Parliamentary State Secretary to the German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, announced support of 125 million dollar for the new Global Partnership as part of the launch. This follows the \£330 million commitment to the initiative made by the British Government in July 2017. "Climate risk insurance is a response to the simple fact that extreme weather events are constantly increasing in number and intensity, and also a response to our experience that the international community and the countries affected by extreme weather events tend to really act after those incidents occurred and they tend to come too late and to intervene not significantly enough," Mr. Silberhorn told a press conference. "So our intention is to act more preemptively, to act in time, and to act decisively in order to reduce the impact of extreme weather events. Insurance is one tool to address this challenge," he added. A partnership for climate and disaster risk finance and insurance solutions The Global Partnership supports data and risk analysis, technical assistance and capacity building according to countries needs and priorities, solutions design of concrete risk finance and insurance solutions, smart support for the implementation for such schemes and monitoring and evaluation efforts. "This new and higher ambition initiative represents one shining example of what can be delivered when progressive governments, civil society and the private sector join hands with creativity and determination to provide solutions," said Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC). The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF), for example, is being supported with the help of 'InsuResilience.' The most recent example of support was in September 2017, when more than $ 55 million was paid out to 10 Caribbean countries within 14 days of hurricanes Irma and Maria, which left an arc of destruction across the region. The money was used in various ways, for example, to quickly buy urgently needed medicines and to build emergency shelters for the people affected by the storms. In Zambia, InsuResilience supports the NWK Agri-Services cotton company, which offers direct weather and life insurance to small contract farmers. In 2015, some 52,000 farmers decided to buy insurance. Following a major drought in 2016, more than 23,000 farmers received payments. \</doc>

Adina-Ioana Valean| Photo credit: European Parliament audiovisual Parliament will soon head to Bonn on an official mission to COP 23 . This delegation, which I will lead as the Chair of the environment, public health and food safety committee, will participate in the negotiations and contribute to the solutions for designing the facilitative dialogue and securing more climate finance. Stakeholders and the public are very eager to grasp what will actually be decided in Bonn and what the EU will do in order to achieve its objectives in this changing global landscape. Their expectations are legitimate given the climate of uncertainty regarding the future of COP and the level of involvement of certain parties. Europe has continued to deplore the unfortunate decision by the US to pull out of the Paris agreement. RELATED CONTENT Gilles Pargneaux: COP23 : Despite US withdrawal, Paris agreement is alive and well Giovanni La Via: 'Everyone has to contribute' to fight against climate change JosDelbeke:The Paris agreement one year on: What next? The environment committee - and Parliament as a whole - have voiced their regret through the joint declaration that President Antonio Tajani and I issued on the day of the US announcement. I believe that it is 'time up' for regrets. We now need to focus on what we want for Europe and on how we want to build a fully sustainable world economy. The US decision has had a significant impact, but it is one that still needs years before it will produce any legal effects. Our job as Europeans is not to substitute the ambition of any global actor, but to find ways to fulfil our goals and convince others that our strategies, policies and standards are worth following. Leading by example means leading by demonstrating success. This needs to be our mantra from now on if we want to our actions to followed by as many parties as possible in shaping a truly integrated global mechanism against climate change. For this, I am very proud that the environment committee is contributing with a wide and consistent package of legislation, including the emissions trading scheme, the land use change and forestry emissions regulation, and the effort-sharing regulation, as well as the clean energy package. The core philosophy of all this legislation is to lower emissions while maintaining the competitiveness of the EU's industry at home and abroad. If we create laws to lower emissions, we should stop subsidising heavily polluting fossil fuels, such as coal, and just let them compete in the free market. The industry needs clarity when they decide where they wish to invest, therefore we need to put our policies where our mouth is. This COP will however be more than an opportunity to show leadership in terms of legislation. We also have to devote our efforts to reaching an agreement on the design of the facilitative dialogue, now called the Talanoa dialogue. It is our aim to make this tool fully functional before COP24 and focus it towards a direct exchange of planning and updates of all parties' nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Moreover, we also want to open up this dialogue mechanism to non-party stakeholders such as businesses and cities, as it is they that will actually bear the greatest burden of lowering emissions over the years. This brings us to our third main topic in COP23 : reinforcing climate finance. The transition to a low emitting global economy faces significant hurdles in developing countries. That is why developed countries have agreed to jointly allocate $100bn per year by 2020 to address those needs. The EU continues to be the world's leading climate finance donor with over $20.2bn allocated in 2016 alone. Nevertheless, we are still falling short of reaching the $100bn total. Therefore, we have chosen to tailor our side event around the increased role of non-state actors in closing this financing gap. We will be talking to the EIB, the Green Climate Fund and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy about creating a market-based environment around climate finance, in order to attract private financial resources. In this context, there is a great deal of discussion about the impact of the US withdrawal on climate finance, since they had pledged to contribute with $3bn to this fund. We must not forget that the US remains, to date, the single largest contributor with $1bn paid before announcing their withdrawal. This context should make us even more determined to ensure pledges made in Paris by EU member states will be fulfilled. Keeping our promises is the only way to maintain the credibility of the $100bn initiative and attract international financial institutions and private investors such as pensions and insurance funds. With all this in mind, I invite interested stakeholders to visit the EU Pavilion in Bonn to follow our press points we will be having throughout our mission and, of course, to attend our side event. \</doc>

With over 1 billion people lacking access to electricity, about 850 million living without access to safe water, and another 800 million undernourished, the world faces immense challenges, which are exacerbated by climate change. Integrated approaches and tools developed by the IAEA and other UN organisations can help, an UN panel stressed on the side lines of COP 23 in Bonn, Germany. While ensuring access to reliable, clean and affordable energy is essential for sustainable development, linkages between climate change, energy, land and water resources can create conflicting demands, representatives of several United Nations (UN) agencies and other experts said at a side event to the Bonn Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) on Friday. For instance, the production of food and energy are both highly dependent on the access to water and may compete for this resource, water supply and agriculture are major users of energy. Energy system and land-use change are the biggest emitters of GHGs. There is thus a high likelihood that pursuit of policy goals in one area could have impacts on other areas. Among the tools developed by the IAEA and other UN organizations, the Climate, Land, Energy and Water (CLEW) methodology helps countries analyse complex interactions between these key resources, together with climate change. The methodology supports policy and planning for sustainable development. 'Resource delivery systems are interwoven. Yet demands are growing and made more volatile with changing climate,' said Mark Howells, Head of the Division of Energy Systems Analysis at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. 'Our response to this challenge must also be appropriately interconnected,' he urged. Simon Langan, Director of the Water Future and Solutions Initiative at International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), emphasized: 'There is an urgent need to develop and enhance capacity and partnerships in relation to understanding three underpinning elements of a sustainable society: food, energy and water security.' Other initiatives to prompt an integrated approaches were mentioned, including the Global Framework for Climate Services led by the World Meteorological Organisation. 'It is a positive example on how the UN system joins forces to support capacity development in support of energy policies,' said Tobias Fuchs, Head of the Department of Climate and Environment Consultancy at Deutscher Wetterdienst firm in Germany. The panel discussion on 'Energy Policy Trade-Off within the Broader Sustainable Development Challenge' took place on 10 November and was co-organized by the IAEA, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

November 24, 2017 Education International joins the international trade union movement in deeply lamenting the fact that the 23rd United Nations climate change conference did not keep its promises despite the urgent climate emergency. At the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change ( COP23 ) held in Bonn from 6-17 November, representatives from almost 200 countries were finally unable to make concrete progress on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement against Global Warming. No agreement was reached on the follow-up of the actions to be taken by the countries, nor on the financial aid promised by the rich countries, all of which are commitments that are intended to be implemented from 2020 onwards. There was nevertheless agreement to hold a dialogue that will run throughout 2018 for the purpose of drawing up an overview of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, as no substantive progress was made, the crucial decisions were postponed to the COP24 which will take place in Katowice, in Poland, in December 2018. The unions' idea of a fair transition is gaining support The COP23 was nevertheless an opportunity for the trade union movement to continue its advocacy for "fair transition" policies, which are gaining increasing support from the stakeholders. The recognition of the importance of a social pact promoting the transition to low-carbon economies foster, according to the International Trade Union Confederation (CSI), great optimism for the future of millions of workers and their communities. This is why the CSI is already calling for a "Katowice" action plan for a fair transition. For Education International (EI), the adoption of such an action plan is an excellent opportunity for highlighting education's crucial role in combating climate change. The Education Day: strengthening our partnerships on climate change education For several years now, the Conference's organisers have had the bright idea of organising a thematic day devoted to education, giving rise to a host of activities dealing with climate change education (CCE), including conferences, seminars, performances and exhibitions. This year, EI was able to speak as a guest organisation at the "Dreaming big in Climate Education" event organised by various United Nations agencies. The event addressed partnerships aimed at initiating the necessary changes in attitudes and actions to be taken in the face of the risks arising from climate change. At the event, EI representative Dennis Sinyolo argued that, faced with the low level of penetration of CCE in the curricula of the various countries, the EI member organisations must absolutely join forces in order to compel governments to observe their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Teachers must also have access to all the necessary support and training order to become engaged and effective stakeholders in combating climate change. For its part, EI will mobilise its affiliates around this crucial issue for our collective future. \</doc>

Researchers from the University of Reading are participating in a number of ways in the 23rd annual conference of the parties (COP), which got under way in Germany last week. The University of Reading has official observer status at COP23 , which enables our community of researchers to access and engage with proceedings at this vitally important global conference on climate change. Central to the activities taking place at COP23 are the negotiations between world leaders to agree policies which meet the aim of keeping the global average temperatures below 2oC, or 1.5oC if possible, above pre-industrial levels. This was the target set out in the Paris agreement at COP21 in 2015. Research at Reading is helping to increase our understanding of, and response to, a number of aspects of our changing climate, such as the relative impact on the atmosphere of different greenhouse gases, the difference between staying below a 1.5-degreeC and a 2-degreeC rise, and how countries around the world be more resilient to the effects of climate change. Travelling from Reading to Bonn to present their research to the world's nations are: rofessor Keith Shine, Regus Professor of Meteorology and Climate Science rofessor Nigel Arnell, Professor of Meteorology rofessor Rosalind Cornforth, Director of the Walker Institute rofessor Elizabeth Robinson, Professor of Environmental Economics Most researchers believe dramatic cuts to carbon emissions are vital to preventing a continuation of the trends in climate change seen in recent years. A record high average global temperature was recorded by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for 2016 - the third year in a row to record a record high. The WMO announced this month that 2017 was likely to rank among the top three hottest years on record. Professor Keith Shine will be giving a presentation in Bonn alongside international collaborators on the latest science seeking to improve understanding of how different greenhouse gases impact on the environment. This distinction will be important as countries begin to reduce emissions of certain gases, as opposed to the blanket rise seen up to now, and is the subject of new research currently being carried out by Professor Shine and colleagues. Read Professor Shine's blog on research being heard at COP23 . Research by Professor Elizabeth Robinson, looking at how climate change is already affecting the health of people around the world, will be presented at COP23 . She was part of an academic collaboration that recently produced The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, a report that warns that urgent work is needed to avoid a changing climate impacting things like labour productivity, the spread of diseases, heatwaves and air pollution. Read our news story. The University of Reading's Walker Institute, a community of researchers, policy-makers, practitioners and users who support a climate-resilient future, is participating in COP23 and is leading on the University's interaction as official observer. It organises the COP Climate Action Studio (COP CAS) programme, which is enabling doctoral students to remotely participate in the conference. This programme is funded by the SCENARIO Doctoral Training Centre. As part of the experience, the students are tweeting (@ClimActStudio) and blogging at HYPERLINK http://www.copcas.uk www.copcas.uk . Professor Rosalind Cornforth, Director of the Walker Institute, said: 'We are presenting important research around forecast-based financing, climate-water nexus, adaptive social protection and early warning components from Copernicus Emergency Services. Additionally, our COP Climate Action Studio is a unique experience enabling doctoral students to remotely participate in the conference in real time, and to engage with a huge range of conference participants, as well as still gain exposure to the latest ideas in policy and practice concerning climate change.' The 'pre-industrial' baseline with which to compare modern-day temperatures, referred to in the Paris agreement, has been the subject of recent research involving Professor Ed Hawkins at the University of Reading. As atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations started to rise earlier than the 1850-1900 period often used by scientists, they argued that the 1720-1800 period would be a better baseline to work with.

EBRD at COP23 , determined to achieve climate goals. Bank is chairing four events at Bonn climate conference: 'green' fiscal risks, climate resilience, Green Cities Framework and technology transfer The EBRD heads for international climate talks in Bonn next week, determined to demonstrate its commitment to meeting ambitious goals to address the global challenge of climate change. At the COP23 climate conference in Bonn, Germany, the EBRD will be able to report on the progress it has made in delivering its climate finance objectives set in the run-up to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. It will also hold a series of technical sessions, outlining practical approaches based on its broad range of projects in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The EBRD is a major investor in climate finance in many of the 38 emerging economies where it works, a driving force in energy efficiency projects, a pioneer in the development of renewable energy sources and an increasingly important player in adaptation to climate change. Josue Tanaka, EBRD Managing Director, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change, outlined the urgency of achieving the climate action objectives developed by the EBRD and other multilateral development banks in the context of the COP21 Paris meeting. 'We are taking decisive steps to ensure we meet these objectives,' he said. Under its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, the EBRD aims to dedicate 40 per cent of its annual investment to green finance by 2020 and is well on the way to achieving this objective. Mr Tanaka added that in addition to the EBRD's focus on energy efficiency, renewables and green cities, the Bank was now putting an additional focus on climate adaptation. This year's talks with be chaired by Fiji, he noted, a country particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. The COP23 will bring together over 25,000 environment and climate change specialists, including representatives from governments, observer organisations, multilateral development banks such as the EBRD, and business delegates and media. In Bonn, the EBRD sessions will focus on a number of key climate issues: Achieving the Paris Agreement through a Green Economy Transition: Fiscal risks and opportunities EBRD Green Cities Framework: Accelerating financing for urban action on climate change From early movers to critical mass: How to build a market for climate technologies Measuring climate resilience: Emerging work of financial institutions on metrics for climate resilience and adaptation Bank representatives will also take part in several events focused on driving climate action on finance, research and innovation and legal and institutional developments that support the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Nationally Determined Contributions. Since 2006, the EBRD has invested over EUR24 billion in around 1,400 projects leading to reductions in CO2 emission of 87 million tonnes per year.

Education International is the federation of organisations representing over 30 million teachers and other education workers, through over 400 member organisations in more than 170 countries and territories. The key role of education and training on sustainable development to safeguard the planet was highlighted at the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change. The 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change ( COP23 ), which is being held in Bonn between 6 and 17 November, began its second and final week in Bonn under the presidency of Fiji. This is a strong symbol given that this small country in the Pacific is already being hit hard by the effects of climate change, in particular the devastation caused by cyclones, as recalled Richard Langlois, economist and representative of Education International (EI) at the COP23 . Current carbon emissions are a grave threat to humanity The findings detailed in the discussions at the COP23 are clear and unequivocal: the current trajectory of carbon emissions, should it remain unchanged, would render it impossible to reach the objective of the Paris Agreement which, according to a majority of experts, is a minimum threshold that should not be exceeded at the risk of exposing humanity to grave danger. This situation requires urgent mobilisation of all relevant stakeholders, and government first among them, which must rapidly fulfil their role as leaders. According to the trade union movement, which was strongly represented in Bonn, it is imperative for governments to strengthen international climate governance. This means raising their "ambitions" by 2020, observing their financial commitments and committing to a fair transition for workers and populations. EI: The planet's future depends on generations of educated citizens informed about the climate emergency According to EI, better governance must also include an ambitious programme on climate-related education and training. The education sector has a crucial role to play in the transition towards a low carbon emission global economy. With new business models making a significant impact on workers, EI also emphasised that education and training must prepare young people for civic and professional life. Similarly, technological research and development will be of paramount importance in combating climate change. Consequently, EI calls on the world's governments to strengthen initial training and lifelong professional training programmes for teachers who must have the necessary skills with which to deliver education on sustainable development and climate change. The future of the planet will rest in the hands of generations informed and educated with regard to the climate emergency. EI's brochure for the COP23 is available here. http://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/FlyerCOP23_EN.PDF http://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/FlyerCOP23_EN.PDF (Distributed by M2 Communications ( \~ HYPERLINK http://www.m2.com www.m2.com )) \</doc>

To prepare for the rising temperatures, strengthening storms and higher sea levels in the coming decades, Fiji must spend an amount equivalent to its entire yearly gross domestic product over the next 10 years, according to the first comprehensive assessment of the small island nation's vulnerability to climate change, compiled by its government with the assistance of the World Bank. Released half-way through the COP23 in Bonn, which Fiji is presiding over, the report highlights five major interventions and 125 further actions that it says are necessary to achieve Fiji's development objectives, while facing the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. Combined those actions would cost about US$4.5bn over the next decade. The report concluded that some parts of the country, especially those on low-lying outer islands, could be made uninhabitable by sea level rise and increased storm surges. It recommended existing towns and cities be made more resilient, but also for brand new and resilient greenfield sites to be constructed to house the growing population. Related: The COP23 climate change summit in Bonn and why it matters "The results of the [Climate Vulnerability Assessment] reinforce what we already know to be true - that the situation we face is urgent and the world needs to immediately raise its ambition to tackle this great threat," said Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Fiji's attorney general and minister responsible for climate change in a foreword to the report. But he said the report itself would assist in that happening, since it "provides a specific blueprint that quantifies the resources necessary to climate-proof Fiji, giving us a full account of the threat that climate change poses to our national development." Victoria Kwakwa, vice president, East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank said the Paris Agreement was not just a commitment to keeping global temperature rise well below 2C, but "also a global commitment to help build resilience and adaptation capacity among vulnerable countries - especially those most at risk from climate change, such as Small Island Developing States." Related: Politicians and activists gather for COP23 Bonn climate talks - in pictures In the report, Fiji called on the world to take "drastic action that limits greenhouse gas emission while supporting action to enhance resilience." It notes that Fiji has limited capacity to manage those risks itself, and that investment from other nations was needed. The biggest investment needed to build resilience in the country was into transport, where US$228m was needed each year, the report found. A detailed analysis in the report found specific parts of the road network that were critical for the country, and should be strengthened to protect against worsening storms. Significant sums were needed to protect the country's water, health and education facilities, housing and environmental assets. "These investments and expenditures would have resilience-related benefits that extend over decades - far beyond their implementation period - as well as significant non-resilience benefits, improving the population's well-being and development prospects," the report found. Fiji is expected to face as much as a metre of sea level rise by the end of the century, increasing the risk of coastal flooding, with flood events that currently happen only once a century expected to recur every second year if global emissions are not abated. In just a few decades - by 2050 - the fraction of the country's GDP lost every year due to tropical cyclones is expected to increase by up to 50%, reaching more than 6.5%. That estimate didn't include the additional risk caused by sea level rise, which would magnify it further. The report also concluded that some parts of the country, especially those on low-lying outer islands, could be made uninhabitable by sea level rise and increased storm surges. It also highlighted the impacts climate change would have on Fiji's health system, with water-borne diseases and respiratory diseases expected to worsen. "These health issues threaten the Fiji population and will challenge the health care system, and could also have a negative impact of some key sectors of the economy, especially the tourism sector, which is highly vulnerable to negative risk perceptions," the report said. Coming less than two years after Tropical Cyclone Winston devastated the country, killing 44 people and costing the economy 20% of its GDP, the findings are likely to raise some attention at COP23 . In a statement released with the report, prime minister of Fiji and current president of COP23 Voreqe "Frank" Bainimarama said: "As the president of the COP23 and on behalf of the small island nations, and building on the findings of this report, Fiji is asking the world for drastic action on climate change-building resilience through adaptation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions so that climate change does not impose a limit to our development and the aspiration of our people to live in their own lands." The talks going on this week and next at COP23 are focused on writing the "rulebook" for implementing the Paris Agreement - including how countries will be required to "ratchet up" their commitments to achieve the agreed aims. \</doc>

Agricultural emissions have been flagged as a key issue ahead of the United Nations\' COP23 climate change talks, which will kick off in Bonn next week with the aim of developing a roadmap for implementing the Paris Agreement. Agriculture accounts for around 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions and the sector has been an agenda item within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\' s (UNFCCC) Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) since 2011. However, little headway has been made to agree on a framework that would reduce the emissions generated during food production.\~Key rifts between developed and developing countries have come to dominate talks on agriculture while consensus\~on how mitigation is treated within these negotiations is yet to be achieved. In an effort to break the deadlock, SBSTA organised workshops and meetings, as well as collecting stakeholder views on how to tackle agricultural emissions, in Marrakech at COP22. These efforts produced scant results and a decision on next steps was postponed until this year\' s Bonn talks. In a preparatory meeting for COP23 , held in May, progress was again slow with discussions only resulting in an agreement to continue negotiations at the upcoming Bonn meeting. Currently, no developed country has a detailed plan in their Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) documents to tackle livestock emissions while the meat processing and distribution sector \- which is responsible for close to 1% of GHG emissions \- is not called out in any country\' s plan to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Pressure mounting for action RESPTABLE Calls for action on the question of agricultural emissions have gained steam ahead of COP23 . Investor network FARR \- which manages US$4trn in assets - yesterday (1 November) urged leaders of developed OECD countries to prioritise emission reductions in their livestock sectors as a <em> crucial </em> issue in the UN talks. FAIRR highlighted that the ten developed countries with the largest agricultural emissions\~collectively emit greenhouse gases equivalent to consuming 1.6bn<strong>\~</strong> barrels of oil annually. FAIRR argues that these countries have a "<em>unique responsibility</em> " to act on emissions from their livestock sector. <em> It\' s two years since Paris rang the starting bell on the low carbon transition and investors have tended to focus on high-emitting sectors like energy, transport and extractives. Investors should not overlook the livestock sector where some of the biggest climate risks and opportunities exist. It\' s the elephant in the room in Bonn \- especially for developed countries who still drive an unsustainable level of demand for animal protein, </em> Jeremy Coller, founder of the FAIRR Initiative and CIO of Coller Capital, argued. <em> Too many delegates at COP23 will be fluent in low carbon automotive innovations from Tesla to telematics, yet still rely on cows and pigs as the outdated technology to supply the world\' s protein demand. The next stage of the Paris talks must put cows alongside cars. </em> Meanwhile, international food advocacy organisation ProVeg, is calling for food - <em> particularly animal agriculture </em> \- to be given priority in the global climate protection agenda. ProVeg has launched a petition urging the German government, as host nation, to introduce and address the issue in the negotiations as well as taking it into account when formulating the German climate protection plan. The petition has already secured in excess of 41,000 signatures. \</doc>

Bonn (Germany) - To mark COP23 , Schneider Electric, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, is re-enforcing its aim to become carbon neutral by 2030. At COP21 in Paris in 2015, Schneider Electric announced 10 Commitments for Sustainability. The commitments were aligned with the Planet & Society Barometer, its sustainability scorecard, and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These commitments supported the company's objectives to make its plants and sites carbon neutral by 2030, and to build a coherent industry ecosystem encompassing both suppliers and clients. Schneider Electric, which has been at the forefront of sustainability efforts for more than a decade, has made significant progress on these commitments since 2015. Schneider Electric uses 16 indicators from the 2015- 2017 Planet & Society barometer to measure its commitment to sustainable development. In October 2017, Schneider Electric announced that it exceeded its barometer target for 2017; a quarter ahead of schedule. Gilles Vermot Desroches, Senior Vice President Sustainability at Schneider Electric said: ' COP23 gives us the opportunity to take an active part in mobilizing society - creating awareness about climate change; align with global discussions and demonstrate that there are current technologies that can have a real impact on reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions'. Schneider Electric's sustainability efforts are closely aligned with the ambitions of COP23 , including climate justice, transition to a new economy, a strong focus on adaptation, and gender and climate change. Specifically, Schneider Electric's aims to address the following issues when it comes to climate change: What is good for the climate is good for the economy: the global demand for infrastructure investments in transport, energy, water, and urban development is estimated at around 6,000 billion US dollars per year over the next 15 years, while 270 billion US dollars per year would be sufficient to develop low carbon infrastructures. Schneider Electric has introduced Science-Based Targets (SBTs) to help companies, as well as its own business, capitalize on the new energy landscape opportunities; Access to energy as a fundamental human right: the fight against climate change will not be effective without taking into account the needs of 2.3 billion people who have poor access to energy. Schneider Electric actively promotes access to energy. Energy Access Ventures - a fund backed by Schneider Electric that invests in growing, entrepreneurial businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa addressing the lack of electrification in the region with new technology and innovative business models - has secured commitments of 54.4 million Euros to provide electricity to 1 million people by 2020; Providing new solutions for more efficient, more livable and more sustainable cities: for Schneider Electric, a sustainable city is an urban center where infrastructure and energy go hand in hand. Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure enables it, its partners and its customers to lead a new world of energy that is more electric, more digitized, more decarbonized and more decentralized. Schneider.

COP23 and the transfer of climate technology. EBRD to showcase its FINTECC transfer programme at Bonn conference Paris was a crucial breakthrough - delivering the near-universal consensus behind the urgent need to tackle climate change and to slow the pace of global warming. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the EBRD have all agreed to scale up their financing for green investments, putting in their own funds but also playing a key role in galvanising the resources - and the expertise - of the private sector. The EBRD is also making an important contribution to the process of climate technology transfer, a topic that will be in focus at this year's global climate talks, the COP23 conference, that will be taking place in Bonn, Germany from 6 to 17 November. The MDBs are supporting technology transfer with the development of Regional Technology Transfer Centres using initial funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) under its Long-Term Program on Technology Transfer. These centres facilitate the transfer of know-how, experience and equipment all aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change. For the EBRD it is crucially important to promote such transfers to many of the 38 emerging economies where it works to promote the development of sustainable market economies. Many of the EBRD's countries of operations are still struggling with a legacy of energy waste and pollution. The EBRD's Regional Technology Transfer Centre is called the Finance and Technology Transfer Centre for Climate Change or FINTECC. It has a vital role in supporting climate technology transfer, across different regions and sectors by helping businesses implement climate technologies. The programme offers technical assistance provided by the EBRD and international consultants, as well as incentive grants for companies to introduce eligible technologies. Grants are available to the companies as a complement to EBRD financing. Since its beginning in 2014 and until now, FINTECC has helped more than 25 companies up their game by improving energy efficiency and implementing new technologies in their production and operating processes. In Jordan, an agricultural company is being supported with an EBRD loan of US$ 21 million for its expansion programme. The project involves expansion of feed mill and silos, improvement to the retail segment, and implementation of new energy efficient measures that will reduce the company's fuel consumption for farmhouse heating, by at least 20 per cent. In Morocco, a leading confectionery producer and exporter is using an EBRD loan of EUR4.6 million to finance the construction and operation of a new facility in Casablanca powered by a 1.4 MW solar plant on its rooftop. The project will implement additional energy efficiency measures, such as an ice-based energy storage system, energy recovery from a furnace chimney and high-grade thermal insulation. The project is expected to result in annual fuel savings of 600 tonnes of oil equivalent and emission reductions of 2,200 tonnes of CO2 per year. The EBRD will present its successful FINTECC programme at this year's COP with a dedicated event. The main purpose of this event is to showcase the FINTECC's business model and the reasoning behind its achievements, to present trends in the region and lessons learned by the Bank while implementing the programme. Alongside FINTECC, the event will also cover another EBRD programme-The GCF-EBRD Renewable Energy Financing Framework- with a focus on two country examples: Egypt and Kazakhstan.

The goal of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2C requires new climate policies, investment incentives, and a massive adoption of low carbon energy technologies, including nuclear power, participants at an IAEA side event to the Bonn Climate Change Conference heard yesterday. 'As we look at the future of nuclear power and the issue of climate change, it is worth taking a moment to lay out a roadmap showing how nuclear energy innovations can support our Member States with their national climate action plans,' said Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy, in his video message to the event. At the two-week-long 23rd Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the IAEA is leading three side events on energy policy, sustainable development, nuclear power and climate change. 'Existing nuclear power plants account for a third of the low carbon energy produced globally,' Chudakov said. 'To meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement, we need to substantially increase nuclear power capacity by 2050 and beyond.' Under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, all Parties submit their planned actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Starting from 2020, governments will submit updates to their NDCs every five years to the UNFCCC with increasingly ambitious climate actions to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. At the side event on 'Connecting Roadmaps for Innovation in Nuclear Energy to the NDC Timeline', senior representatives from the industry discussed how advanced nuclear energy technologies can help achieve a low carbon future. Panellists outlined options to incorporate innovative nuclear power technologies into climate action plans and NDC timelines. 'Enhanced accident tolerant fuels are revolutionary concepts of the next generation to be deployed within the next decade,' said Elmar Schweitzer, AREVA's senior expert on Materials and Thermal-Mechanics. There are a number of other advanced nuclear power technologies such as high temperature reactors, small modular reactors (SMRs), non-electric nuclear applications and innovative nuclear systems with great potential for enhanced competiveness and sustainability. With this knowledge, Member States may choose to include new nuclear technologies in the updates of their NDCs, participants at the session heard. Through various activities, the IAEA helps Member States use nuclear technologies to mitigate climate change and achieve other Sustainable Development Goals. These include supporting energy planning and infrastructure development with training and guidance, providing information on innovative nuclear power technologies such as advanced reactor designs and innovative fuels, as well as new applications. In parallel to the main sessions at COP23 , the IAEA serves as the focal point for the United Nations exhibit on Energy, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. Located in the One UN Exhibit Area, the exhibition showcases the IAEA's latest publications and integrated approach in nuclear science and technology that can help address climate change.

'Partnerships for Implementation of the Paris Agreement: Africa's Response.' On Wednesday, 15 November 2017, COP23 will celebrate Africa Day, a joint initiative of the African Development Bank (AfDB), the African Union Commission (AUC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). Two years after the Paris Agreement was signed at COP21, Africa continues to consolidate its efforts, focusing particularly on partnerships to ensure that developed countries meet their responsibilities and commitments in terms of funding, and encouraging African nations to pursue a low-carbon development path and maintain their nationally determined contributions. All of this is in line with the roadmap for the African Union's Agenda 2063, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and the African Development Bank's High 5s. The theme of this year's Africa Day is therefore: 'Partnerships to Implement the Paris Agreement: Africa's Response'. The programme will focus on funding, capacity-building, development and technology transfer. Heads of state, high-level ministerial discussions There are a number of highlights throughout Africa Day, which will be opened at 11:30 by His Excellency, Alpha Conde, President of Guinea and Chairperson of the African Union; His Excellency, Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the Republic of Congo and President of the Climate Commission of the Congo Basin; His Excellency, Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of Gabon and Coordinator of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC); and His Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission; A ministerial debate, moderated by Honorable Pacome Moubelet-Boubeya, the Gabonese Minister of Forest, Sea and Environment and President of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), will mark the start of the discussions, followed by a question and answer session. Official launch of the Africa NDC Hub The last segment of the Africa Day is an expert panel discussion on climate change to discuss various technical themes. Africa played a decisive role in the signing of the Paris Agreement. It has so far been ratified by 168 states and the European Union, and 43 of these states are in Africa - representing more than 78% of African nations. This demonstrates the continent's level of commitment and awareness of the need to fight against climate change. Although at COP21 in Paris, developed countries reiterated their pledge to provide 100 billion USD in climate funding every year until 2020, Africa has received less than 4% of these funds. There is still a long way to go! The Africa Day organised jointly by the AfDB, AUC, ECA and NEPAD at the request of African Heads of State, held at every COP since COP17 in Durban.

LAST week, a conference known as the Conference of the Parties 23 ( COP23 ) drew to a close in Bonn, Germany. COP23 was the latest UN conference debating how best to deal with the challenges posed by climate change, bringing together thousands of delegates from all around the world. So was this colossal meeting of minds a success from the EU point of view? In a word, no. First, there was the acknowledgment that attempts to turn the EU away from fossil fuels have failed. Germany's state secretary for the environment confirmed that reforms to the system of carbon credit trading (the basis of the EU's climate action) were insufficiently robust to incentivise a switching to cleaner fuels and renewables. Nor does the future of the carbon trading system look positive. The EU has taken a step backwards and entered into talks to link its carbon market to those of California and China, meaning that EU power and industrial firms will be able to import carbon credits from both California and China. Prices in the EU system are currently flat, languishing around (EURO)7.4 per credit, which is down around 80 per cent from their highs because of an oversupply of credits in the market. The Chinese carbon market is set for launch by the end of this year, and if the early years of the European system are anything to go by, will be chronically oversupplied. This will mean that Chinese industrials and power companies will be able to export their carbon credits to the EU for cash, creating another extended period of low prices, which will subsidise fossil fuel consumption in the EU and hand China billions in subsidies. Finally, the EU's Innovation Fund is to help finance Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects. CCS is often viewed as the have-your-cakeand-eat-it solution for curbing carbon emissions: the CO2 is caught at the plant, and then injected into disused oil wells and similar underground depositories. But employing CCS technology can involve up to 25 per cent more energy to strip out the gas, increasing both pollution and prices. According to the NGO Climate Vision, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide are both predicted to increase due to the additional fuel consumption. Ammonia is expected to increase by more than three times current levels from energy plants, due to the degradation of the solvents in the process of capturing the CO2 . The combination of higher power prices will lend a hand to cheaper competition from overseas, and the increase in particulate matter will pose a significant risk to public health. There is also an additional environmental hazard posed by injecting CO2 into oil wells: if the gas leaks it could acidify the sea and threaten aquaculture. From an EU perspective, COP23 has, If anything, kicked the opportunity to deal with climate change well and truly down the road. Brexit brings the UK the opportunity to go our own way regarding the climate and environment. I look forward to entering this exciting and optimistic phase once we have broken away from the EU, and can negotiate for nationally appropriate CO2 mitigation actions. \£3 Diane James is an independent MEP. \</doc>

On 11 November at the UN conference on climate change in Bonn, ( COP23 ), a significant number of US states, cities and businesses that have signed up to honour American promises under the Paris Agreement joined together to make 'America's pledge', a commitment to combat global warming in direct opposition to the Trump administration's climate policies. To date, 20 US states and more than 50 of its largest cities, along with more than 60 of the biggest businesses in the USA, have committed to emissions reduction goals. Added together, they have an economic power of about $10 trillion, which places them behind only the US as a whole ($18.6tn) and China ($11tn) in terms of gross domestic product. Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, led the group in promising to take measures such as reducing coal-fired power and investing in renewable energy and efficiency that would substantially reduce their carbon output. But some delegates want the companies and local governments involved to go further, by submitting reports on their progress towards their emissions-cutting goals that would be subject to the kind of monitoring and accountability that is required from national governments under the United Nations process. They have put forward a draft text which, if accepted, would mean that such voluntary commitments were made in line with UN standards, and could therefore be included in the national greenhouse gas inventories that are required from signed-up countries by the Paris agreement. Also on 11 November Virginia became the latest US state to commit to action on climate change, becoming a member of the Under2 Coalition of leading sub-national governments committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the Paris Agreement. The Under2 Coalition brings together signatories and endorsers from across 39 countries to fight climate change and support the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of keeping global warming below 2degsC. It now represents over 1.2 billion people and 39% of the global economy ($US29.4 trillion). Virginia became the 11th US state to join the Coalition, alongside California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York State, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. \</doc>

Gilles Pargneaux | Photo credit: European Parliament audiovisual The Paris agreement is irreversible and non-negotiable. This is the message that Parliament has sent to US President Donald Trump through our resolution on COP23 . The US withdrawal from the Paris agreement galvanised, rather than weakened, the other 194 COP21 signatories. Since 1 June, heads of state around the world have continued to reaffi\£crm their commitment avoiding a global temperature rise of between 2.4 and 6.6 degrees by 2050. The Paris agreement is alive and well, even though American isolationism has led to the formation of new alliances within the climate arena and the emergence of new leadership. RELATED CONTENT Adina-Ioana Valean : COP23 : It's time for Europe to lead by example Jos Delbeke:The Paris agreement one year on: What next? The EU accounts for 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. This, I believe, should make it responsible for leading the fight against climate change. Europe must now lead the way by defining the measures needed at international level to limit global warming to 2.0, perhaps even 1.5, degrees, below pre-industrial temperatures. Parliament has a key role to play in realising the COP21 commitments. Over the coming months, we will vote on a number of legislative proposals to encourage the transition to a low-carbon economy. As I often said during the months I spent preparing for COP21, while climate change is the fight of the century, it's also the opportunity of the century. Energy is clearly one of the key sectors to make an economic paradigm shift happen. The circular economy will create up to two million jobs by 2030. The legislative proposals that Parliament will soon adopt will allow us to make the most of primary resources, products and waste, facilitating energy savings and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. An increase in energy efficiency will result in long-term savings, through the use of renewable energy. For example, energy savings in terms of electricity will lower costs by (EURO)100bn annually by 2020 in Europe, or (EURO)465 per household. This will also help tackle energy poverty, which currently affects 11 per cent of European citizens. Abolishing fossil fuel subsidies will allow for the development of renewables. According to the IMF, every year around the world, governments spend (EURO)4740bn in supporting fossil fuels - that's about (EURO)10m per minute. This is an economic aberration. Removing these subsidies would increase tax revenue and decrease healthcare costs and greenhouse gas emissions while improving the competitiveness of renewables. Developing renewables in Europe means accelerating the energy transition. By 2020, we will have surpassed the 20 per cent renewables in our energy mix target. In 2014, renewables already accounted for 15.3 per cent of the EU's energy consumption. We must intensify our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport and agricultural sectors to reach our 2020 and 2030 targets. By setting a minimum price for each tonne of carbon, we could reduce market volatility and improve its predictability, encouraging low-carbon investments. This is currently being looked at in the ETS negotiations between Parliament and Council. It's also crucial to recognise the status of climate refugees. The UN estimates that by 2050, 250 million people will have been forced out of their homes for environmental reasons. This question can no longer be ignored. Over the coming months, more than ever, the EU will have to demonstrate that it is the world leader in the fight against climate change by taking up all of these challenges. We must all play our part. \</doc>

The Moving for Climate NOW cycling trip, sponsored by the Spanish Network of the United Nations Global Compact and Iberdrola, will start today in Paris. Participants will travel on their electric bicycles to Bonn (Germany), where the Climate Summit - COP23 - chaired by the Fiji Islands will begin on the 6th of November. This initiative is an official Summit event, classified as an endorsed initiative by COP23 . The multi-disciplinary cycling team will be made up of over 40 people from different organisations and countries, with the purpose of raising awareness on the importance of facing the climate change challenges, uniting efforts in all areas and the implementation of ambitious and urgent measures to combat climate change. The cycling team will disseminate these messages over an 800-km itinerary through Brussels and other European cities, such as Bruges and Urmond, reaching Bonn on the 5th of November. The Spanish Network of the United Nations Global Compact and Iberdrola see the Bonn Summit as a very important event, which will help speed up the definition of the Paris commitments and foster implementation of the Agreement reached during the 2015 Climate Summit held in the French capital. Upon their arrival at COP23 in Bonn, Moving for Climate NOW will present the Manifesto of this initiative to combat climate change. The document includes the fundamental principles which according to the team must be addressed when facing climate change challenges. For example, it highlights the commitment to renewable energies, the need to see the fight against global warming as an opportunity and not as a threat towards building a sustainable economic model, the urgency to unite efforts in all sectors of the society and the importance of attracting funding. And of special relevance on this edition will be measures to adapt to climate change and protecting vulnerable communities as well as raising awareness on the importance of oceans and the vital role they play in regulating climate and the planet's health. Emissions calculation for the trip was verified by CeroCO2 and its carbon footprint has been compensated by purchasing carbon credits from the UN's Climate Neutral Now and CeroCO2 platforms. SECOND EDITION OF 'MOVING FOR CLIMATE NOW' Moving for Climate NOW is running its second edition, after a group of cyclists travelled over 1,000 km last year from Seville to the COP22 Climate Summit held in Marrakesh. Last year's edition saw the participation of the following international organisations: the European Commission, the European Investment Bank and the International Energy Agency (IEA); entities such as the Spanish Climate Change Office, the Economic, Social and Environment Council of Morocco, the Biodiversity Foundation and City Council of Seville; initiatives such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development or Carbon Disclosure Project, or the civil society, through NGOs like ECODES, the Red Cross and Ayuda en Accion. Most of these organisations are participating in this year's edition and new organisations have joined, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC); the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), among others. The 2016 trip started in Seville on the 7th of November, arriving at the Climate Summit of Marrakesh on the 16th of November, where Iberdrola's Chairman, Ignacio Galan, and Victor Vinuales, Vice-President of the Spanish Network of the United Nations Global Compact (organising committee for Moving for Climate NOW) handed over the Manifesto to Horacio Peluffo, Chief of Protocol and External Relations Officer of the Executive Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Miguel Arias Canete, European Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy; Isabel Garcia Tejerina, Minister of Agriculture, Fishing, Food and the Environment, and Said Mouline, Chief Operating Officer of the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency and member of the Executive Committee of the COP22 also attended that event.

Al Gore has suggested America could stay in the Paris Climate Agreement if a new president gets into the White House in 2020. President Donald Trump announced he would be withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement in June, making the US as the only country in the world not to get behind the framework deal to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement states that signatories cannot withdraw until 4 November 2019 but the actual departure would not become official until the following year. "If there is a new president ... a new president could simply give 30 days notice, and the United States is back in the agreement," the former US Vice President told an audience at COP23 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany. Read more US cities and companies declare 'we are still in' Paris Agreement desp Syria signs Paris Agreement leaving US only country to refuse deal USA and Syria become only two countries not in Paris Agreement Mr Gore added: "The first date upon which the United States could actually leave the Paris Agreement happens to be the first day after the next presidential election in 2020 so that's good news". But he interrupted his comments during the climate finance panel at the US Climate Action Centre with a quick pause before adding "Excuse me a moment" and bowing his head and folding his hands in prayer. The former Democrat presidential candidate joked: "That was not a partisan comment there. You can't quote me on that". The accord was signed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015 in an attempt to restrict global greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to within two degrees Celsius. "The United States of America is still in the Paris Agreement, and we are going to meet and exceed our commitments," Mr Gore continued. He said: "The United States of America is very seriously moving forward. This train, if you'll forgive the metaphor, left the station in Paris." Mr Gore, who gained an Oscar for his 2006 documentary about climate change An Inconvenient Truth , said it was unlikely Germany, Japan, and other American allies would ever succeed in persuading President Trump to reverse his plans to withdraw the Paris climate agreement. The politician, whose world-renowned work in climate change activism with the IPCC gained him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007,rebuffed President Trump's declared readiness to re-engage in the 2015 agreement if he gained better terms for US taxpayers and businesses, saying it was merely a "smokescreen". "It's a classic political effort to have things both ways. He's made his decision but he wants to give the other side a faint hope that ... that he might yet change his mind," he told Reuters from the sidelines of the 200-nation meeting. "It's pointless for me to continue trying to persuade him to change his mind," he said. "Can somebody else? (German) Chancellor Angela Merkel? (Japanese) Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe? Somebody else? I don't know. I doubt it." Syria, the last nation outside the pact, became a signatory of the Paris climate agreement last week. \</doc>

October 17, 2017 NADI, FIJI - The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will more than double the level of climate financing it will mobilize for its Pacific developing member countries to over $ 500 million between 2017 and 2020. ADB Vice-President Stephen Groff made this announcement as ADB signed two agreements: first with the Government of Fiji for a $ 42 million loan to improve water and sanitation services to over 300,000 people in the greater Suva area, while ensuring that critical infrastructures are climate resilient. Second is with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for a $ 31 million grant to the country through ADB. Apart from Mr. Groff, signatories for the two agreements were Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney-General and Minister for Economy and Climate Change for Fiji, and Howard Bamsey, GCF Executive Director. The agreements were signed during the climate change discussions in Fiji in the lead up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ), which Fiji will chair. "ADB has been supporting Fiji to improve water and sanitation for more than 20 years," said Mr. Groff. "With this new investment, we expect to assist Fiji expand water supply by 40,000 cubic meters per day, ensure 98% of households in Suva have access to clean water, and expand the sanitation network for additional 4,500 households to access reticulated sewerage by 2023." "This project aims to improve access to sustainable water supply and sewerage services to Fijians in the greater Suva area, taking into account the increasing population and the need for more resilient infrastructure. Fiji appreciates the financial and technical assistance provided by ADB and GCF and thanks them for recognizing the importance of this project," said Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum. "Access to financing for such projects, which consider adaptation and the effects of climate change, is a key objective for Fiji's Presidency of COP 23 ." "GCF financing will assist Fiji move the main water intake for Suva upstream to respond to increasing salt water intrusion," said Mr. Bamsey. "GCF is pleased to have now approved almost $ 280 million of investments for Pacific island countries, including investments in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu." The Fiji Urban Water Supply and Wastewater Management Investment Program was among the first group of projects approved by the GCF Board at its meeting in Zambia in 2015. The investment will also be cofinanced by the European Investment Bank. During his visit to Fiji, Mr. Groff met with Fiji Prime Minister Bainimarama and Australia's Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members-48 from the region. In 2016, ADB assistance totaled $ 31.7 billion, including $ 14 billion in cofinancing. \</doc>

November 13, 2017 With the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ), in Bonn, Germany, entering its final week of negotiations, the Fiji Presidency today announced an agreement on a Gender Action Plan, highlighting the role of women in climate action. At a press conference, President of COP 23 and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, announced that the Parties had finalized the plan, which still has to be adopted. "This recognizes the role of women in climate action," he said. "It is about integration of gender into all the work around climate policy - both nationally and internationally," added Nazhat Shameen Khan, the Chief Negotiator for the COP 23 Presidency. Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres will be attending the high-level segment of COP 23 , on 15-16 November. New national and corporate climate action on forests Also Sunday, countries and corporations announced new initiatives to cut emissions from forest use and establish sustainable forestry management programmes. The efforts include an Ecuadorean initiative to reduce 15 million tons of CO2 emissions in the forest sector; a commitment to deforestation-free commodities by Walmart; Mars Inc.'s new policy to reduce their carbon footprint 27 per cent by 2025 and 67 per cent by 2050 through addressing deforestation throughout their corporate value chain; and Gabon's National Park Service efforts to combat illegal logging. "The forests have this incredible ability to store carbon and we have underinvested in that," said Inger Andersen, Director-General of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), at a press conference. "Protecting and restoring the forests is absolutely key to achieving the Paris Agreement [as well as] the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)." Also today in Boon, the industry sector said that it is set to deliver much of the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goal but added that closer national and international policy and implementation strategy partnerships together with governments will help business take further, faster action. "Industry is taking action on climate change like no other period in history," said Peter Bakker, President and CEO of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD, a global, business leaders-led organization of over 200 leading businesses working on sustainable development). "The transition to the low-carbon economy is inevitable, and business will continue to implement the solutions necessary for fulfilling the Paris Agreement," he added. Since 2015, over 600 companies with combined revenues of more than $ 15 trillion have made over 1,000 commitments to climate action through 'We Mean Business,' a global non-profit coalition. Many are going 100 percent renewable, are implementing science-based targets and are collaborating across sectors through the Low Carbon Technology Partnership initiative (LCTPi). Local, regional leaders sign Commitment for faster climate action Local and regional leaders from around the world signed the Bonn-Fiji Commitment Sunday, pledging action to deliver on the Paris Agreement. Cities are responsible for as much as 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels used for energy and transport, and with more than half the global population living in urban centres and this figure expected to approach two-thirds by 2050, the Bonn-Fiji Commitment pushes efforts to advance sustainable urban development. The Commitment encompasses 19 initiatives, including The European Covenant of Mayors and Compact of Mayors joining forces to create the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy - the largest coalition of over 7,400 cities from six continents and 121 countries to reduce emissions and make societies and economies resilient to climate change. Similarly, the UN World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the UN Climate Change secretariat (UNFCCC) and in partnership with the Fijian Presidency launched an initiative to protect people living in small island developing States from the health impacts of climate change. The vision is that, by 2030, all small island developing States will have health systems that are resilient to climate change. \</doc>

LONDON (ICIS)--The UK and Canada have formed an alliance of countries pledging to phase out the use of coal, as the COP23 climate change summit draws to a close in Bonn, Germany, on Friday. Representatives of 20 countries had signed up to the agreement as of Thursday, which backs research that that EU and OECD member states will need to phase out coal usage by 2030 to meet the climate change goals set out in the Paris Agreement. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland were among the signatories, but key coal states Germany, China and the US declined to sign up to the deal. China s extensive reserves have led to the development of a number of coal-to-olefins (CTO) plants, although the country s move to improve air quality [1]may slow the pace of further developments in the sector. Germany s reliance on coal has increased since it took the decision to phase out nuclear power in the wake of Japan s Fukushima disaster in 2011, whereas the UK s usage has fallen from 40% of its power generation in mid-2012 to around 2% this year. Representing the first near-global accord on climate change abatement, the Paris Agreement that came out of COP21 stipulated that signatory countries must take steps to cap global warming to 2030 at under two degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, and ideally at 1.5 degrees. The accord was reached after EU member states abandoned a push for a top-down structure, where climate goals would be dictated to signatories, to a bottom-up structure where countries could state what measures they were willing to commit to, leading to key holdout China agreeing to sign. COP22, the following year in Marrakech, Morocco, was more of a technical affair, as countries discussed how the pledges agreed at the Paris COP would be carried out, but the shift towards a formalised international framework of commitments was upset by the news later that year of the US intention to withdraw from the agreement. However, the US move to break away from the accord which cannot take place until 2020 at the earliest may not seriously undermine the process, according to Marco Mensink, director general of EU chemicals trade group Cefic. Mensink noted that certain climate abatement trends, such as renewable energy and insulation, have sufficient momentum at this point that policy actions of one nation are unlikely to arrest that growth. China Premier Xi Jinping s rhetoric at the Davos summit in early 2017, indicating that the country may be looking to take a more active role in global affairs, also represents an interesting development for international climate policy, he added.

The challenges and opportunities for nuclear power to continue to provide low carbon energy in the future was the focus of a side event held at the COP23 Bonn Climate Change Conference. Hosted and moderated by the IAEA, the side event 'How Nuclear Power Can Contribute to Climate Change Mitigation' underscored the global role that nuclear energy plays in addressing climate change and featured specific initiatives underway in France, Hungary, and the United Kingdom. Senior government officials and experts at the side event described country actions and drivers behind future nuclear power development. Nuclear power is expected to be an indispensable part of the reliable, low cost and low carbon power supply needed to meet the Paris Agreementgoal of keeping the rise of global temperature below 2-degreeC. Nuclear power today provides a third of global low carbon electricity generation. However, for nuclear power to step up to the Paris Agreement goals, construction rates of new nuclear reactors will need to double by 2030 from the rate seen in 2015-2016, according to Peter Janoska, an analyst with the International Energy Agency (IEA). 'Low carbon electricity is key,' said Jean-Yves Caneill, a Climate Policy Consultant in France. 'Electricity will help to decarbonize many sectors of the economy. It is crucial that all low carbon technologies including nuclear are used appropriately depending on national circumstances.' Some countries already use a significant share of nuclear power and plan to build more. Hungary's four nuclear reactors generate over one third of the country's electricity, with two new units planned. Pal Kovacs, Head of Cabinet of Hungary's Minister responsible of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant expansion, said that nuclear power generation was a more mature option for Hungary. 'Technologically, it has a strong potential in the future,' he said. 'New, safer and more economical nuclear reactors could lead us to a clean and sustainable future.' Nuclear power is among the lowest cost electricity generation technologies, once in operation. However, the cost of the ultimate price of electricity depends on market structure and competition. New financing mechanisms, such as Contracts for Difference used for the UK Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, guarantee returns while sharing project risks. 'I believe nuclear power has an important and continuing role to play in reducing carbon intensity in the power generation sector in the UK, while contributing to security of supply,' said Anurag Gupta, Director of KPMG in the United Kingdom. 'The key challenge facing the sector in achieving this goal is ensuring the delivery of cost competitive projects, on time and on budget.' The experts emphasized that with the right support nuclear power can provide affordable, reliable and low carbon electricity for development. The IAEA led a series of side events at the COP23 , held from 6 to 17 November in Bonn, Germany.

Delta, a global leader in power and thermal management solutions and a long-term advocate for climate change action, was invited by ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) for a speech in its side event during the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference. As the only corporation invited to the side event, Delta exchanged constructive views and practices with the cities of Toyama City, Ulan Bator, Shenzhen and New Taipei City, as well as the Asian Development Bank. During the event, which was overflowed with dozens of decision makers and climate experts, Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, executive director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, offered effective ways for the private sector to contribute in the development of sustainable cities while elaborating on Delta's concrete achievements in enabling low-carbon buildings, transportation and energy infrastructure. Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, executive director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, participated in ICLEI's side event through a speech themed 'How can the private sector help facilitate a sustainable city' in which she remarked, 'Delta has committed to carbon reduction in its operations and businesses. We have successfully established 25 green buildings globally with our energy-saving technologies, and further provide building automation, EV charging and smart LED street lighting solutions to facilitate sustainable cities across the world. At the COP23 side event exhibition area, Delta has also been granted permission to showcase its endeavours and accomplishments in nurturing green buildings, low-carbon mobility and environmental education to share Taiwanese companies' experiences in sustainability with the world.' Delta has attended the COP UN Climate Change Conferences for 11 consecutive years and once again promotes a more active role of the private sector in climate change at the conference. At the COP21 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, Delta's chief executive officer, Mr. Ping Cheng, and Delta Electronics Foundation's executive director, Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, were not only invited by the German Pavilion of COP21 to provide keynote speeches, but also led the company to share its green building experience through the 'Delta Green Building Exhibition' held at the Grand Palais in Paris. The company subsequently replicated this exhibition in Beijing and Taipei last year. This past October, the City Government of Kaohsiung and ICLEI invited Delta to organize the exhibition, during the 'EcoMobility World Festival 2017', where we integrated the green building concept with low-carbon transportation. These exhibitions received more than 150,000 visitors in total, including prominent government officials, business leaders and decision makers. The 'Transformative local actions toward climate resilient and sustainable cities in East Asia' side event was hosted by ICLEI East Asia Secretariat's Regional Director, Mr. Shu Zhu. The event focused on the key initiatives of East Asian cities and the collaboration between different sectors in tackling carbon emissions to help attain the Paris Agreement's main goal of containing the rise in global temperature within 2-degreeC.

Speaking at Oceans Action Day, at the COP23 UN Climate Conference in Bonn the Vice-President in charge of Climate Action and Environment at the European Investment Bank (EIB) has urged the global community to do more protect oceans and support the blue economy. Jonathan Taylor said, 'The European Investment Bank, which is the long-term lender of the European Union, can be a strong partner in protecting the environment, especially our oceans. With your help, we can reduce pollutants in the water, manage ocean resources sustainably and mitigate climate change.' He added, 'It is important to underline that there simply will be no green without blue. In other words, in order to meet the Paris targets and Sustainable Development Goals, we need to establish an economy that is blue in the same sense that the economy on land should be green.' Speaking at one of a series of events organised around Oceans Action Day, Vice-President Taylor added, 'But the global community needs to work together. It is clear that current climate strategies - on national, regional or local levels - are not leading to concrete policies and mechanisms to ensure that ocean acidification is reduced.' (click here for full speaking points - check against delivery) As a key supporter of the Paris Climate Agreement, the EIB has committed to deliver global climate financing of 100 billion dollars before 2020. The EU bank's efforts actively contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and tackle important water issues such as ocean acidification and warming, which are growing problems around the world. The EIB is involved in a wide range of ocean and coastal projects - supporting adaptation, biodiversity and ecosystems projects aiming to increase the resilience of the ocean and coastal environments to the effects of climate change. Over the last five years the EIB has supported the blue economy activities such as offshore wind, seaport installations and water transport with around 8 billion euros. The EIB's support for small island states has involved mitigation and adaptation projects in the Caribbean (supported by a recent 110 million dollar loan to the Caribbean Development Bank for climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience projects), the Pacific, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. Projects include an airport in the Cook Islands, roads in La Reunion, a wind farm in Cape Verde, solar micro grids in the Maldives, upgraded water systems in the Seychelles and a hydro project in the Solomon Islands. Small islands are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Discover in this interactive map how the European Investment Bank is helping them adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. On November 10 at COP23 , the EIB signed its biggest ever loan in the Pacific: a water project in Fiji's capital Suva to help increase climate change resilience of the water supply system. Earlier this year, the EIB also approved a 20 million dollar investment in the Sustainable Ocean Fund. This will provide money for marine and coastal enterprises that are helping with conservation, improved livelihoods and better economic returns. Background information: The European Investment Bank is active in more than 130 countries. It is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate-related investment in the five years up to 2020. At COP23 in Bonn, EIB climate experts and senior management will highlight the EIB's broad support for climate investment in diverse sectors, announcing a number of new policy initiatives and project investments.

At this year's United Nations climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, the Transnational Law Institute partnered with institutions from Brussels and Paris to highlight the need for social justice in the development of international and European climate law. Across two public events at the 23rd Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the TLI and partners investigated the prospects for a 'just transition' to a clean energy future that respects labour and human rights. The annual COP meeting is the key venue for the international community to set the course of activity under the Climate Convention and, since 2016, the Paris Agreement. On 8 November, the TLI cohosted a panel discussion on 'just transition to a low-carbon economy' with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), Fondation Jean Jaures and the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS) at the EU Pavilion at the climate summit. The discussion was opened by the President of the EESC, Georges Dassis, who gave a powerful speech calling for ambitious climate action that provide positive outcomes for communities and workers. Cillian Lohan, EESC Rapporteur on Climate Justice, presented the EESC's recently issued opinion on climate justice, which calls for sustainable ethical alternatives for consumers and the identification of opportunities to protect workers whose jobs are displaced by the clean energy transition. Agnes Michelot of French Economic, Social and Environmental Council spoke about the challenges and prospects of climate justice in France and Europe, emphasizing in particular the importance of research in developing solutions. Also on the panel, Anne-Beth Skrede, Adviser on Environment, Climate and Sustainable Development with the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, outlined the union movement's priorities at the conference. Stephen Minas, Assistant Professor at the School of Transnational Law, Peking University and Senior Research Fellow at TLI, discussed the social elements of the EU's Energy Union framework. Emily Hickson, Manager, Net Zero by 2050 at the B-Team, discussed the business community's engagement with unions and civil society in scaling up climate action. Finally, Mart Raamat, representing the current Estonian presidency of the EU, commented on how the just transition agenda aligns with the presidency's priorities. On 15 November, the TLI again partnered with Fondation Jean Jaures and FEPS to host a panel discussion on the topic of £ just transition, economic diversification and the forum on response measures to climate change'. This event examined opportunities for progress and synergy on the UNFCCCC response measures work programme items of just transition and economic diversification, both through the improved forum on response measures and through complementary regional and national processes. The session included an update on work under the UNFCCC by William Kojo Agymang-Bonsu from the UN Climate Secretariat, the presentation of national approaches by Peter Govindasamy from the Singapore delegation and Steven Turnbull from the Australia delegation, and perspectives from civil society from Nick Mabey from E3G and Anabella Rosemberg from the International Trade Union Confederation. Both events featured lively engagement from audiences of party delegates, civil society representatives and researchers. Stephen Minas, who co-organized the events for the TLI, commented that 'the response to climate change must have a social dimension, and this must be reflected in the work under the Climate Convention. By bringing together national governments, unions and employers, we can advance the social dialogue on how to achieve just outcomes for workers affected by the economic transition, as well as how to create the jobs of the future low-emissions economy'.

November 12, 2017 Cities, the transport sector and ocean advocates today announced a number of new initiatives to push for further, faster climate action, at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany. These announcements were made under the auspices of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, created last year to spur action by state and non-state sectors to help implement the Paris Agreement on climate change. New Transport Decarbonisation Alliance In a major new partnership, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Costa Rica and the Paris Process on Mobility and Climate (PPMC) launched the Transport Decarbonisation Alliance to stimulate greater political leadership in the sector. Transport contributes about one quarter of all energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and about 15-17 per cent of the entire spread of human CO2 emissions. "More ambitious and coordinated action on transport is required to deliver on the Paris Agreement," said Jose Mendes, Deputy Minister for Environment of Portugal. Six new voluntary sector initiatives were also introduced in Bonn to address specific aspects of transport and climate change. These include: the 'below50' (expanding the global market for the world's most sustainable fuels); the EcoMobility Alliance (cities committed to sustainable transport); EV100 (accelerating the transition to electro-mobility); Walk 21 (valuing and delivering more walkable communities); the Global Strategy for Cleaner Fuels and Vehicles; and the Transforming Urban Mobility Initiative (accelerating implementation of sustainable urban transport development and mitigation of climate change). Similarly, global cities and communities also announced new efforts Saturday to coordinate their climate action commitments to deliver bigger and faster results together. "Local and regional governments are making commitments that will help national Governments close the gap between current national commitments and the emissions reductions needed to achieve the Paris Agreement targets", said Gino Van Begin, Secretary General of ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, a global network of more than 1,500 cities, towns and regions working together for sustainable development. Urban areas account for around two-thirds of the world's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global energy use. Their overall contribution to total greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at between 37 and 49 per cent globally, depending on base assumptions of data used. Also at a press conference at COP 23 , the Mayor of city of Pittsburgh (in the United States), William Peduto, announced that 367 American mayors have agreed to be "part of the Paris Agreement no matter what our Federal Government did". "It's going to happen at the local level", he said. The new initiatives announced include efforts ICLEI and the global NDC Partnership (a coalition of countries and institutions working to mobilize support for climate goals and enhancing sustainable development) to design, implement and align climate action strategies across all levels of governments. Similarly, the Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance (a group of some 40 organizations working to mobilize investment in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure in cities and urban areas internationally) is mapping available finance to match known infrastructure projects - a critical requirement to help local governments identify funding. Also Saturday at COP 23 , a new declaration was signed to strengthen global response to climate change impacts on oceans and coastal zones. Oceans are the planet's largest carbon sink, a major regulating force of global climate, and fundamental to the survival and well-being of humanity. "Oceans have featured little in the UN climate negotiations to date, and yet they are not only important for planetary survival but also offer great opportunities for innovation towards a low-carbon blue economy", said Biliana Cicin-Sain, President of the Global Ocean Forum. Isabel Torres de Noronha, Executive Secretary of the Future Ocean Alliance, a non-governmental organization, in an interview with UN News, underscored that ocean acidification "might put at risk not only ecosystems but also many economic activities and food security of coastal populations." Among initiatives at national level, she highlighted one from Viet Nam about strengthening the coastline by planting forests of mangroves. \</doc>

November 16, 2017 Climate engineering, or climate intervention, is risky but needs to be explored as a supplement - not as a 'Plan B' - to greenhouse gas emissions reduction, said experts at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany. Climate engineering, also referred to as geoengineering, is the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the climate system with measures including carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere or solar radiation management. "We can do a lot, we have to do a lot, we have to try much harder at cutting our emissions, but there will remain certain emissions, especially in the land use sector, which are not going away. So we actually need to start talking about this removal of greenhouse gases inevitably," said Matthias Honegger, research scientist with the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies, at a press conference. Different approaches are being discussed. Some already exist, like planting trees. Other ideas include dispersing certain minerals in the oceans to enhance the growth of algae, which then as they sink to the ocean floor, would create a net flux of carbon from the atmosphere into the oceans. "Business as usual is a little worrying," said Dr. Hugh Hunt, from the Department of Engineering at Cambridge University. "The concept of not doing anything is full of danger. Now the concept of cooling the planet is full of danger as well." "We need to have full-on public engagement, full-on societal involvement. The reason is that the risks of climate change are huge, the risks of doing nothing are huge; but the risks of geoengineering are huge as well. We've got to explore those risks, because who knows, we may end up entering a very risky world without understanding it," he added. "Geoengineering risks are not well understood and need to be explored." Stratospheric aerosol injection Stratospheric aerosol injection consists of injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere with aircraft or balloons to create a global dimming effect. "This technology is absolutely terrifying. We may actually need it, but then, who do we want to decide. That's where this society-wide discussion has to take place," said Janos Pasztor, Executive Director of the Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative (C2G2), and former UN senior climate advisor. "It would require a level of international cooperation that we have not yet seen." "Who will decide whether we should make use of stratospheric aerosol injection and when that decision should take place? [...] Who will make that decision on behalf of the world? And then how far do we turn the thermostat of the global air conditioning system [...] to cool the planet?" he said. "There are issues: the more temperature you want to reduce the higher the chance there will be negative impact and the higher the chance that some of these impacts will not be the same across different geographical zones. You might end up in a situation where some people benefit from the reduced temperature but some people would have negative impacts. What do you do with those people? How do you compensate them? How do you take care of them?" he added. Mr. Pasztor concluded that the highest priority should remain the gas emission reduction. "But we have to consider these other options, as supplements, not as a 'Plan B,'" he warned. \</doc>

At the COP 23 climate summit Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP 23 , today welcomed new support from the European Investment Bank to better protect water infrastructure against extreme weather events in Fiji. The new long-term EIB loan to support investment by the Water Authority of Fiji signed at COP 23 earlier today represents the EIB's largest ever loan in the Pacific and largest ever support for water investment in a small island state by the world's largest water financier. The European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, will provide USD 75 million for a new USD 405 million investment programme by the Water Authority of Fiji. The scheme will strengthen resilience of water distribution and wastewater treatment following Cyclone Winston, the world's second strongest storm ever recorded, that hit Fiji in February 2016. In the presence of Prime Minister Bainimarama, and climate leaders from around the world, the 20 year EIB loan was formally signed at the EIB Pavilion at COP23 by the Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Public Enterprises, Civil Service and Communications of the Republic of Fiji and Ambroise Fayolle, Vice President of the European Investment Bank responsible for development and lending operations in the Pacific. 'This welcome financing will be used with funding from the Green Climate Fund, the Asian Development Bank and the Fijian Government. A great many people in Fiji will benefit from this project, which will cost a total of approximately USD 400 million, and I am grateful to the EIB for its support and its foresight. Financing of projects to build resiliency in developing countries is critical, and I sincerely hope that this project can serve as a model for other developing countries that wish to access blended financing on behalf of their own people,' said Frank Bainimarama Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23 . 'As the bank of the European Union, the European Investment Bank recognises the crucial importance of investing in water and improving access to clean water and sanitation worldwide. Small island states are vulnerable to a changing climate as witnessed by the devastation caused by Cyclone Winston in Fiji last year. We pleased to support transformation water investment on the island of Viti Levu that will benefit hundreds of thousands of Fijians and better protect key services from extreme weather.' said Ambroise Fayolle, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank. More than 275,000 people living around the capital city of Suva will benefit from the new EIB-financed water investment that will both help to improve current service levels and reduce leakages and enable quicker resumption of water supply following cyclones. The scheme includes construction of a new water-treatment plant and upgrading existing wastewater treatment facilities, as well as improving and expanding water networks. Once complete, the scheme is expected to support a number of sustainable development goals including health, economic development and sustainable urban growth. The new water investment is also financed by the Government of Fiji, Asian Development Bank and Green Climate Fund. It follows extensive due diligence by the Asian Development Bank and represents the first EIB co-financing with the Green Climate Fund. Ahead of the signing ceremony the EIB hosted a workshop to outline practical experience gained from three water projects around the world to enhance climate resilience. Priyaraj Lakmal Munasinghe, CEO of the Water Authority of Fiji and representatives of the Lilongwe Water Board in Malawi and the EUR 5 billion Emscher River renovation project highlighted key issues to consider and discussed how to overcome practical challenges with climate experts at COP 23 . Over the last decade the EIB has provided more than USD 40 billion for water investment around the world in Europe, the Caribbean, Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Pacific. Small islands are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Discover in this interactive map how the European Investment Bank is helping them adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects.

ADB Vice-President Stephen Groff (left) and Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney General, Minister for Economy, and Minister for Climate Change. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will invest $ 1.5 million to assist Fiji's Presidency of the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and join the Government of Fiji's COP 23 Advisory Panel. 'ADB's support for Fiji's Presidency of COP 23 comes as ADB is doubling the total financing we provide for climate change to $ 6 billion by 2020,' said Stephen Groff, ADB's Vice President for East Asia, South East Asia, and the Pacific. 'ADB was also very pleased to have assisted Fiji in mobilizing $ 31 million in grant financing from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to improve water supply in Suva. This was among the very first round of proposals agreed by GCF.' The ADB contribution was warmly welcomed by Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Attorney General, Minister for Economy, and Minister for Climate Change. 'As our Honorable Prime Minister and incoming COP 23 President, Frank Bainimarama, has highlighted, COP 23 will be critical to keep up the momentum for decisive action to reduce carbon emissions and arrest the current state of global warming. Fiji is pleased to extend an invitation to the ADB President to join the Advisory Panel for COP 23 , and appreciates ADB's valuable technical advice,' he said. ADB's support to Fiji's COP 23 Presidency will include technical advice worth at least $ 0.5 million to assist the Pacific country become a global leader on green transport issues and explore options to expand insurance coverage for households, farmers, and businesses to cover potential losses from natural disasters. Recognizing that small island developing countries are the most at risk from climate change, ADB will also provide $ 1 million in grants to the Fijian government to ensure Pacific island countries have a strong voice in the lead up to COP 23 . ADB has been working with the Government of Fiji since 1970, approving $ 509 million in loans, $ 35 million in grants, and $ 32 million in technical assistance for the country. ADB support to Fiji is largely directed to improving transport infrastructure and extending the supply of clean water and modern sanitation. ADB's Board of Governors yesterday formally approved Fiji to host ADB's 52nd Annual Meeting. This will be the first time ADB will hold its Annual Meeting in any Pacific developing member country. ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership. It is owned by 67 members-48 from the region. In 2016, ADB assistance totaled $ 31.7 billion, including $ 14 billion in cofinancing.

An international research collaboration has revealed that the belief that grass-fed livestock are good for the environment may be misplaced. The newly published report suggests that not only are cattle pastures not a climate solution, they directly contribute to the problem. The Food Climate Research Network (FCRN) at the University of Oxford's new 'Grazed and Confused' report, sheds light on the impact that grass-fed animals have on climate change, offering clarity to the debate around livestock farming and meat and dairy consumption. The authors dissect claims made by different stakeholders in the debate about so called 'grass-fed' beef, the greenhouse gases the animals emit, and the possibility that, through their grazing actions, they can help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It evaluates these claims and counterclaims against the best available science, providing an authoritative and evidence-based answer to the question: 'Grazed and Confused? Ruminating on cattle, grazing systems, methane, nitrous oxide, the soil carbon sequestration question - and what it all means for greenhouse gas emissions'. Written by Dr Tara Garnett of the FCRN, Cecile Godde at Australia's national science agency the CSIRO and a team of international experts, the report throws cold water on claims that grass-fed beef benefits the environment. Key findings include the observation that while grazing of grass-fed animals can boost the sequestration of carbon in some locally specific circumstances, that effect is time-limited, reversible, and at the global level, substantially outweighed by the greenhouse gas emissions they generate. Explaining the key takeaways from the report, Dr Tara Garnett, co-author and founder of the FCRN, said: 'This report concludes that grass-fed livestock are not a climate solution. Grazing livestock are net contributors to the climate problem, as are all livestock. Rising animal production and consumption, whatever the farming system and animal type, is causing damaging greenhouse gas release and contributing to changes in land use. 'Ultimately, if high consuming individuals and countries want to do something positive for the climate, maintaining their current consumption levels but simply switching to grass-fed beef is not a solution. Eating less meat, of all types, is.' Published just ahead of the COP23 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bonn, the report places emphasis on the need to consider animal production and meat consumption, if we are to reach the climate goal of a 2-degree warming limit. More than laying out the bones of the grass-fed grazing dispute, the report also helps fill the knowledge gaps about emissions and sequestration, and aims to provide more nuance to the debate. The work reflects two years of close collaboration between researchers at the Universities of Oxford, Aberdeen and Cambridge in the UK; Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands; the Swedish Agricultural University; CSIRO in Australia and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) in Switzerland. It is aimed at policy makers, the food industry, civil society and all those concerned with the future of land use, climate change, and the role of livestock in a sustainable food future. Lead author Cecile Godde explains the focus on climate and the significance of these questions for the overall debate on land use and environmental sustainability: 'The big question' that needs answering is whether farmed animals fit in a sustainable food system, and if so, which farming systems and species are to be preferred. Of course, there are many dimensions to sustainability and this report only considers one of them - the climate question. But the climate question alone is important to explore and in doing so, this report takes us a step further towards understanding what a sustainable food system looks like.' Dr Tara Garnett adds: 'When thinking about different livestock production systems there are many important aspects to consider: people's livelihoods and jobs, animal welfare, biodiversity, nutrition and food security and more. Grazing systems and grass-fed beef may offer benefits in these respects, benefits that will vary by context. But when it comes to climate change, people shouldn't assume that their grass-fed steak is a climate change-free lunch. It isn't.'

November 16, 2017 An alliance of nations and states committed to moving the world from burning coal to cleaner power sources was launched today (16 November 2017) by more than 20 partners at COP23 , the United Nations climate change talks. The UK was one of the first countries to commit to ending unabated coal power generation by 2025. In July 2012, our generation profile still included 40% coal. In July this year, this fell to 2% and in April, the UK had its first full day when no coal was used for 135 years. The Powering Past Coal Alliance plans to grow to 50 or more members by this time next year. Its ambition is to lead the rest of the world in committing to an end to unabated coal power. The members of the alliance commit to taking action such as setting coal phase out targets, committing to no further investments in coal-fired electricity in their jurisdictions or abroad. Unabated coal is the generation of electricity from a coal plant without any treatment to reduce substantially the emissions of carbon dioxide. It emits twice as much CO2 as gas per unit of electricity. The announcement comes as the UK government prepares to launch its flagship Industrial Strategy to get the economy firing while building on its strengths like clean growth and embracing the opportunities of technological change. Claire Perry, Minister for Climate Change and Industry, said: Reducing global coal consumption should be a vital and urgent priority for all countries and states. Unabated coal is the dirtiest, most polluting way of generating electricity. The Powering Past Coal Alliance will signal to the world that the time of coal has passed. The UK is committed to completely phasing out unabated coal-fire power generation no later than 2025 and we hope to inspire others to follow suit. Catherine McKenna, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change, said: Phasing out coal power is good news for the climate, for our health, and for our kids. Coal is literally choking our cities, with close to a million people dying every year from coal pollution. I'm thrilled to see so much global momentum for the transition to clean energy - and this is only the beginning. The new coalition will work with businesses, civil society and governments to offer technical and practical help to accelerate the transition away from coal. However, it recognises that not all countries can completely phase out the use of unabated coal at the same rate. To stay below the 2C target agreed as part of the Paris accord 2 years ago, OECD countries across the world need to phase out coal by 2030 and global use will need to reduce by two-thirds by 2040. Today's launch of the alliance comes after British Prime Minister Theresa May reiterated the UK's commitment to phase out unabated coal by 2025 in a joint press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in September. In its first meeting, the alliance agreed that transitioning away from coal-fired electricity is one of the most important steps the international community can take to meet the aims of the historic Paris agreement - at which the UK played a leading role 2 years ago. The UK has already begun its transition away from coal, in part as a result of renewable energy sources becoming cost effective. Offshore wind, for example, is now half the cost it was 2 years ago. Since 1990, the UK has reduced its emissions by 42%, while growing our economy by 67%. This is in no small part due to the 85% reduction in coal use we've seen in that time. However, domestic action alone is not enough. It is important that we restrict financing for coal projects abroad. The UK government announced in 2014 that it would end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in rare circumstances. UK Export Finance has not supported a coal project since 2002. \</doc>

The IAEA participated in a UN Oceans side-event at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP23 in Bonn on ocean and climate entitled 'A Resilient Ocean for Future Generations'. The objective of the 11 November side-event was to present actions that countries are taking, with the support of the UN system, to address climate-related multi-stressors on the ocean through improved scientific capacity, the development of CO2 mitigation strategies and new innovative adaptation approaches. Peter Thomson, the first UN Special Envoy for the Oceans, appointed in September 2017, provided remarks and stressed that 'we have to talk of ocean change like we talk of climate change'. During the session, Mr Deon Terblanche from the World Meteorological Organization presented its latest Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, according to which carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by 145% as compared to pre-industrial (before 1750) levels. This is causing changes in the world we live in with knock-on effects on the oceans and marine ecosystems. About a quarter of the CO2 emitted through human activities is taken up by the ocean. This is causing a change in the ocean's chemistry, a process known as ocean acidification. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, ocean acidity has increased by 26% and the current rate of acidification is over 10 times faster than any time in the last 55 million years. Peter Swarzenski, from the IAEA Environment Laboratories stressed that 'we all have an important role to play in ocean action. IAEA research provides insight into ocean processes and can be used by Member States to make informed decisions and take action'. He added that 'it is not too late. We can avoid irreversible consequences for the oceans and the communities that depend on them'. Recent research, including that done by the IAEA, shows that ocean acidification effects on fisheries, aquaculture and coral reefs are expanding, both in terms of geographical location and intensity. Some effects are direct such as on species' physiology: growth, reproduction and calcification, while others may be indirect: impact on food sources, habitat degradation, changes in the food chain structure, for example. Nuclear and isotopic techniques are powerful tools to study ocean acidification and have contributed widely to investigating past changes in ocean acidity and potential impacts on marine organisms. Researchers at the IAEA Environment Laboratories use calcium-45 to examine the growth rates in calcifying organisms such as corals, mussels and other molluscs, whose skeletons and shells are composed of calcium carbonate. Tracers are also used to determine how ocean acidification is affecting the physiology of marine organisms, as well as the impact of multiple combined stressors, such as ocean acidification and increases in temperature and contaminants. The IAEA laboratories in Monaco also host the Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (OA-ICC), which works with many international partners to advance ocean acidification monitoring, research and capacity-building around the world. Vladimir Ryabinin, Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO highlighted how IOC-UNESCO and the IAEA OA-ICC are collaborating closely to support the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON), a global platform launched in 2012, which brings together researchers working on ocean acidification monitoring. 'Oxygen in the ocean decreases, sea water is acidifying, and sea level is rising. We know this, and can make projections for the future, because of systematic ocean observations and science,' argued Mr Ryabinin. Ultimately, these efforts contribute to equip countries to respond to Sustainable Development Goal 14 dealing with Ocean change, and it's Target 3, specifically addressing ocean acidification. The side-event was coordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO and the IAEA with representatives from UN Environment, FAO, IMO, the UNESCO World Heritage Centre and the WMO.

But from another perspective, Fiji is supremely well qualified to tackle climate change "" its task as president of COP 23 , the global climate negotiations scheduled for November. Voreqe Bainimarama, prime minister, told Fiji's parliament in February: "In our region, the simple truth is this: if we cannot gain the agreement of the industrial nations to keep reducing their carbon emissions and lower the global temperature, the consequences will be catastrophic." In the Pacific, as in the Caribbean, climate change is already a life or death struggle. COP 23 , which for convenience will be held in Bonn, not Fiji, will draw attention to the plight of the lands most severely lashed by storms and rising water. "What was originally seen as a technical COP, needed to get stuff done about rules, will now be more political," said Jens Clausen, climate change adviser at Greenpeace in Copenhagen. "The Fijians see it as a visionary COP "" they want to reinforce the ambition of the Paris Agreement and look at how we can enhance it." Fiji will urge the world to focus on the 1.5C target for global warming that sits in the Paris Agreement alongside the more often discussed "well below 2C" commitment.US in the spotlight Bonn is not going to produce a big new agreement "" though there could be some big action announcements from mayors and the likes of California governor Jerry Brown. "I'm curious how far California will go at this COP," said Nathan Fabian, policy and research officer at the Principles for Responsible Investment in London. "Given we have had the US announcement on withdrawal [from the Paris Agreement], which takes a few years to effect, the Californians are going to step in on that US narrative about emissions reduction. We will be watching how they step up expectations on Californian leadership ahead of the Climate Action Summit they're hosting in 2018." Despite President Trump's decision to pull out of Paris, a US delegation will be there, led by diplomat Thomas Shannon. "It's important for the US to be playing a constructive role there "" I think that's what everybody will be watching for," said David Waskow, director of the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute in Washington. The US and China jointly lead the work stream on transparency, so it could contribute well there.Writing the rules But while there could be some eye-catching announcements on emissions reductions, this COP has two major pieces of work to do. The first is to establish the process by which, during 2018, the rulebook for implementing Paris can be negotiated, ready to be signed off at COP 24. "That is the thing that will bring the Agreement to life and give it traction," said Waskow. The key topics in the rulebook are transparency, adaptation, reduction targets, provision of targets, capacity building and technology. "There is lots of work to be done on how the transparency rules are designed," said Waskow. "The intent is to have them be robust, but with flexibility for developing countries."Raising the ambition Still more vitally, COP 23 will shepherd countries to start considering in 2018 how they can increase the ambition of their Paris commitments "" something they are supposed to finalise by 2020. Fiji will also push for more public and private sector finance for poor countries to fight climate change "" and especially, the neglected area of adaptation. \</doc>

This inaugural Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform (LCFP) EUR 5 million investment will support energy efficiency and renewable energy development in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The investment will enable the Green for Growth Fund (GGF) to leverage private funding, increasing impact in the region. The objective is to achieve annual primary energy savings of 125,000 MWh and CO2 emission reductions of 35,000 metric tons. The recently launched Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform, a joint initiative between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Government of Luxembourg, is investing EUR 5 million in C Shares of the Green for Growth Fund (GGF). This first investment of the platform was announced today by the EIB at COP 23 , the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference. Speaking at COP23 , Christopher Knowles, nominated to the GGF Board by EIB and serving as its Chairman, said: 'The EIB has played a key role in the development of the GGF, and remains one of the fund's leading partners. We are very pleased that the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform is supporting the GGF in renewable energy and energy efficiency development in the MENA region.' The Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform will fund high-impact climate action projects with strong environmental and development benefits thereby acting as a catalyst for additional financing. The GGF is an ideal investment partner due to its proven capability to facilitate investments of households, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises into energy efficiency and renewable energy. The GGF also has strong experience in direct financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in low and middle-income countries. Through its innovative public private partnership structure, the GGF is able to leverage public financial resources with private investments High impact is additionally achieved through on-the-ground support and capacity-building activities from the fund's Technical Assistance Facility. LCFP's EUR 5 million investment will focus on climate change mitigation in the MENA region. In 2016, the GGF expanded to the MENA region, where it sees a high demand for the implementation of energy efficiency measures and the development of renewable energy. Speaking at COP23 , EIB President Werner Hoyer said: 'At the EIB we are on track to delivering on our climate action commitment. Since the Paris Agreement was adopted, the EIB has provided around 35 billion US Dollars for climate-related investment around the world. We all know that attracting private finance is crucial and that finding innovative solutions is necessary. The Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform and the project we've approved for MENA under the Green for Growth Fund is an excellent example of how the public sector can, through innovative solutions, help to attract private sector investment for high impact projects.' Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg Minister of Finance, said: 'For Luxembourg, being an important financial centre, unlocking private finance is a key objective. We are very pleased to partner with the EIB on the Climate Finance Platform.' Carole Dieschbourg, Luxembourg Minister for the Environment, said: 'We need innovative solutions to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. This initiative will finance three projects that would otherwise struggle to attract private investment, especially climate adaptation projects in developing countries.' Background information: About the EIB The EIB, active in more than 130 countries, is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate related investment in the five years up to 2020. At COP23 in Bonn, EIB climate experts and senior management are highlighting the EIB's broad support for climate investment in diverse sectors, announcing a number of new policy initiatives and project investments. A regularly updated agenda of EIB events and contacts can be found here: HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/cop23 www.eib.org/ About the GGF The Green for Growth Fund invests in measures designed to cut energy use and CO2 emissions by a minimum of 20% in 19 markets across Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, Ukraine, Moldova, the Middle East and North Africa. The Fund provides financing to local partners that on-lend to enterprises and private households, and it invests directly, primarily through the contribution of senior debt, in renewable energy projects. The GGF's Technical Assistance Facility maximizes the fund's investment impact through support for capacity building at local financial institutions and partners. The GGF was initiated as a public-private partnership in December 2009 by Germany's KfW Development Bank and the European Investment Bank, with financial support from the European Commission, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Austrian development bank OeEB. The fund's growing investor base comprises donor agencies, international financial institutions and institutional private investors, including the International Finance Corporation, the Dutch development bank FMO, the German ethical bank GLS, and Church of Sweden.

November 6, 2017 The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) is representing the world's national shipowners' associations and over 80 percent of the world merchant fleet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn this week. ICS will emphasise how the shipping industry is supporting the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop an ambitious CO2 reduction strategy. ICS Director of Policy, Simon Bennett explained: "ICS has a vision of zero CO2 emissions from shipping in the second half of the century. We are confident this will be achievable with alternative fuels and new propulsion technologies." ICS says its vision might be delivered with batteries or fuel cells using renewable energy, other new technologies such as hydrogen or even something not yet anticipated. In the meantime, the shipping industry has proposed that IMO Member States should adopt a suitably ambitious goal for reducing total emissions from the entire international shipping sector by an agreed percentage by 2050. ICS is pleased that a large number of IMO Member States have already come forward with detailed proposals. Several EU and Pacific island nations have jointly proposed that the sector should reduce total CO2 by as much as 70 percent by 2050. Mr Bennett commented: "Japan has set out in detail to IMO how a 50 percent total cut by 2060 might be achieved. In view of projections for future trade growth, an objective in this range, while still incredibly ambitious, therefore seems more realistic." He added: "It will be for governments to agree the actual reduction number when they adopt an initial IMO strategy next April. And this is also going to have to address the legitimate concerns of major economies such as China and India about the implications for future trade and their sustainable development." Whatever is decided, ICS says that the entire world fleet is probably unlikely to enjoy global access to new alternative fuels for at least another 20 or 30 years. Moreover, population growth and further improvements to global living standards will probably determine that demand for shipping must continue to increase, as it is already by far the most carbon efficient form of commercial transport. ICS says that, using a combination of technical and operational measures, the international shipping sector already appears to have reduced and held its total annual CO2 emissions at about 8 percent below its 2008 peak. This is despite an increase of about 30 percent in maritime trade, estimated in tonnes of cargo transported one nautical mile (tonne-miles) over the period up to the end of 2015. ICS cautions that these latest estimates by third parties will have to be verified by the next official IMO Greenhouse Study in 2019 using the new IMO CO2 Data Collection System. "They are nevertheless encouraging especially given the dramatic reduction in fuel prices since 2014. Moreover, a significant increase in marine fuel costs is expected in 2020 due to the mandatory global switch by the entire world fleet to low sulphur fuels. This should greatly incentivise, to the extent this is possible, the further reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by ships." said Mr Bennett. -end- Notes The annual Conference of Parties ( COP 23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (and the 2015 UNFCCC Paris Agreement) meets in Bonn from 6-17 November. On behalf of its member national shipowners' associations, ICS will be participating in various official events inside the Conference. The figures quoted on CO2 emissions and maritime trade are derived from a recent study by the International Council on Clean Transportation and the UNCTAD Review of Maritime Transport 2017. Amendments to the IMO MARPOL Convention, which have already entered into force worldwide, will require from January 2020 all internationally trading ships to use fuel with a sulphur content of 0.5 percent or less (except in Emission Control Areas where they must already use fuel with a sulphur content of 0.1 percent or less).

Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama watches 'Our Home, Our People', the World Bank-led Virtual Reality production for COP23 . Photo: Tom Perry/ World Bank. 360-degree VR film produced for COP23 screening in Suva until 14 April SUVA, April 4, 2018 - The Virtual Reality climate change project that shared Fiji's climate change story with global leaders at COP23 has returned home to Fiji, with thousands expected to see the film in the coming weeks. Our Home, Our People ( HYPERLINK www.ourhomeourpeople.com COP23 , and was recently named as a finalist in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Action Awards. The project is funded by the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and the European Union, through the ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Program 'This film and its characters convey, through the truly immersive experience of Virtual Reality, the message that we have long aimed to share with the world: that we Fijians are not standing still and accepting the realities of climate change; rather that we are resilient; we are coming together with strength to support each other and build our communities through these challenges,' said Fijian Prime Minister and President of COP23 , the Hon. Frank Bainimarama. '[The VR film] was one of the highlights of the Fiji Pavilion at COP23 , [and] I urge as many Fijians as possible to try to see it. Because it is genuinely brilliant,' the PM added. Ambassador Julian Wilson, Head of the EU Delegation for the Pacific, noted the emotional power of this film, and its story appeals to any community across the globe fighting climate change. 'This global appeal is exactly what the spirit of the talanoa dialogue seeks - stories that will spread and spark the discussions and accord that will be needed if we are to make a difference in the fight against climate change,' said Ambassador Wilson. Lasse Melgaard, the World Bank's Resident Representative for the South Pacific, thanked the communities across Fiji who had committed so much of their time and hearts to the project. 'We are incredibly grateful to the communities of Ra and Vunisavisavi, who shared their lives with our team for this story, and we are so pleased to be able to finally bring their story 'home' to Fiji - to allow thousands of Fijians to experience this powerful, moving story in its true 360-degree format.' He added said the film was a powerful way of sharing the findings of sharing the findings of the Fiji Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient, the report launched at COP23 that provides a deep-dive analysis of the economic and social impacts of climate change on Fiji over the coming decades, and provides a set of recommendations as to the most effective investments to adapt and minimize its impacts. 'The Virtual Reality project, and the Climate Vulnerability Assessment are designed to connect with the two elements that drive decision-making: the report is designed to connect with the head; and the Virtual Reality production with the heart.' The 'return tour' will also include a series of community events to be held at the communities whose stories are featured in the film, including Nabukadra and Naramai (Ra Province) and Vunisavisavi (Cakaudrove Province).

MICHAEL Gove recently declared the Tories a "green" party. It's laughable when David Cameron once said that we should "get rid of all the green cp" and one of Theresa May's first actions in government was to remove the words "climate change" from the government department for energy and climate change. The Tories have also been guilty of ditching carbon capture and storage, the promotion of fracking and the appointment of an environment secretary who voted against reducing the carbon dioxide emission rate permitted in new homes. As countries around the world work to combat climate change and improve the future of this planet, the Tory Government are an embarrassment. Thankfully, in Scotland we have an alternative.

A global transition to 100% renewable electricity is not a long-term vision, but already a tangible reality, a new groundbreaking study by the Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT) and the Energy Watch Group (EWG) shows. The study was presented on November 8, 2017 during the Global Renewable Energy Solutions Showcase event (GRESS) on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP23 in Bonn. The results of the study are revealing: A global electricity system fully based on renewable energy is feasible at every hour throughout the year and is more cost effective than the existing system, which is largely based on fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Existing renewable energy potential and technologies, including storage can generate sufficient and secure power to cover the entire global electricity demand by 2050[1]. Total levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) on a global average for 100% renewable electricity in 2050 is EUR52/MWh (including curtailment, storage and some grid costs), compared to EUR70/MWh in 2015. "A full decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050 is possible for lower system cost than today based on available technology. Energy transition is no longer a question of technical feasibility or economic viability, but of political will", Christian Breyer, lead author of the study, LUT Professor of Solar Economy and Chairman of the EWG Scientific Board said. A transition to 100% renewables would bring greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector down to zero and drastically reduce total losses in power generation. It would create 36 million jobs by 2050, 17 million more than today. "There is no reason to invest one more Dollar in fossil or nuclear power production", EWG President Hans-Josef Fell said. "Renewable energy provides cost-effective power supply. All plans for a further expansion of coal, nuclear, gas and oil have to be ceased. More investments need to be channeled in renewable energies and the necessary infrastructure for storage and grids. Everything else will lead to unnecessary costs and increasing global warming." The key findings of the study: Existing renewable energy potential and technologies, including storage can generate sufficient and secure power to cover the entire global electricity demand by 2050. The world population is expected to grow from 7.3 to 9.7 billion. The global electricity demand for the power sector is set to increase from 24,310 TWh in 2015 to around 48,800 TWh by 2050. Total levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) on a global average for 100% renewable electricity in 2050 is EUR52/MWh (including curtailment, storage and some grid costs), compared to EUR70/MWh in 2015. Due to rapidly falling costs, solar PV and battery storage increasingly drive most of the electricity system, with solar PV reaching some 69%, wind energy 18%, hydropower 8% and bioenergy 2% of the total electricity mix in 2050 globally. Wind energy increases to 32% by 2030. Beyond 2030 solar PV becomes more competitive. The solar PV supply share increases from 37% in 2030 to about 69% in 2050. Batteries are the key supporting technology for solar PV. The storage output covers 31% of the total demand in 2050, 95% of which is covered by batteries alone. Battery storage provides mainly diurnal storage, and renewable energy based gas provides seasonal storage. Global greenhouse gas emissions significantly reduce from about 11 GtCO2eq in 2015 to zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, as the total LCOE of the power system declines. The global energy transition to a 100% renewable electricity system creates 36 million jobs by 2050 in comparison to 19 million jobs in the 2015 electricity system. The total losses in a 100% renewable electricity system are around 26% of the total electricity demand, compared to the current system in which about 58% of the primary energy input is lost. The study "Global Energy System based on 100% Renewable Energy - Power Sector" will have major implications for policy makers and politicians around the world, as it refutes a frequently used argument by critics that renewables cannot provide full energy supply on an hourly basis. The first of its art modeling, developed by LUT, computes the cost-optimal mix of technologies based on locally available renewable energy sources for the world structured in 145 regions and calculates the most cost-effective energy transition pathway for electricity supply on an hourly resolution for an entire reference year. The global energy transition scenario is carried out in 5-year time periods from 2015 until 2050.

Today at COP23 , the Climate Action in Financial Institutions initiative has called on the world's entire financial community to sign up to a set of key principles for mainstreaming climate action adopted in 2015 during COP21. The call comes at an official UN side event in Bonn co-organised by the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) and I4CE - Institute for Climate Economics (Secretariat of the Initiative). Representatives of the institutions supporting the initiative also called on business and industry to join them in implementing the 5 Voluntary Principles for Mainstreaming Climate Action. These principles, agreed at COP21 in Paris by around 20 public and private financial institutions are: Principle 1: COMMIT to Climate Strategies Principle 2: MANAGE Climate Risks Principle 3: PROMOTE Climate Smart Objectives Principle 4: IMPROVE Climate Performance Principle 5: ACCOUNT for your Climate Action The Paris Agreement has set a significant challenge for governments and the financial community: aligning all financial flows with a below 2-degreeC-coherent economy and society. The Climate Action in Financial Institutions initiative has significant potential to support this commitment and develop and share practice to the benefit of the entire financial community to help implement the Paris Agreement. 31 Institutions are now part of the Initiative and today they announced the launch of a new online and publically accessible Climate Mainstreaming Practices Database, shared the progress made by the initiative, and specifically how it can support the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the financial sector. The Climate Mainstreaming Practices Database will help institutions to share their knowledge and experience via concrete case studies to help them take into consideration climate change and implement the 5 Principles. 'Since the Initiative was launched two years ago, we have come a long way. The case studies contained in this new database launched today will give financial institutions and business a much improved overview of how their peers are integrating climate change in all their operations. It is an invaluable resource, which will feed the work of the initiative, help financial institutions progressively improve the way they integrate climate change in their operations, and contribute to making the Paris Agreement a reality. Today we call on the entire financial sector as well as the business community to join the initiative and share their own practices', said Benoit Leguet, Managing Director of I4CE. 'This initiative brings together public and private financial institutions from around the world in our commitment to integrate climate in everything we do. Building on the five mainstreaming principles we launched at COP 21 two years ago, today's launch of the Climate Mainstreaming Practices Database makes an important contribution to share knowledge and good practice on our approaches to climate change. Importantly, it also increases transparency in green finance. Better information is urgently needed to align the financial sector with the Paris goals. That's why we at the EU Bank, are proud to be a member of the Climate Action in Financial Institutions initiative and we invite the financial community to join us and support the implementation of the Paris Agreement', said Jonathan Taylor, EIB Vice President for Climate Action. 'Financial institutions have a key role to play in addressing the challenges of a global low-carbon and resilient development, internally and through relationships with their clients. Governments, multilateral organizations and private investors need to bet on climate change considerations in order to boost economic growth, and by mainstreaming these considerations, financial institutions become a reliable partner that can deliver better, more sustainable, short and long term results', said Felix Bergel, Director of Institutional Funding of CAF. The Climate Mainstreaming Practices Database contains close to 50 case studies submitted by member institutions related to both the 5 Principles and the 4 areas of work of the initiative for 2017-18: Climate risks: approaches, tools and methodologies Mapping reporting initiatives and understanding implementation challenges City-level climate smart approaches and financial instruments Spreading a climate strategy into a whole organization It is accessible on the website of the initiative ( HYPERLINK http://www.mainstreamingclimate.org www.mainstreamingclimate.org Other institutions throughout the financial community are invited to contribute to this database and share their practices by sending their case studies to the Secretariat ( HYPERLINK mailto:contact@mainstreamingclimate.org contact@mainstreamingclimate.org For more information: HYPERLINK mailto:contact@mainstreamingclimate.org contact@mainstreamingclimate.org About the Initiative: As of November 2017, the Initiative includes: the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), the Belgian Investment Company for Developing Countries (Bio Invest), BMCE Bank of Africa, BNP Paribas, the Caisse de Depot et de Gestion (Morocco), the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), Credit Agricole, the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), HSBC Holdings plc, the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), the Inter-American Development Bank Group (IDB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), KfW, Malaysia Credit Guarantee Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), Nederlandse Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V., the New Development Bank (NDB), the Nordic Development Fund, Promotion et Participation pour la Cooperation Economique (PROPARCO), Societe Generale, Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A.S.(TSKB), Yes Bank and the World Bank.

Addressing the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, on Wednesday, Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called for more ambition, more leadership and more partnerships to tackle climate change. "Our duty - to each other and to future generations - is to raise ambition," said Mr. Guterres at the opening of the high-level segment of COP23 , which was also attended by Heads of State and Government, including President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarana, who is also the President of COP23 . "We need to do more on five ambition action areas: emissions, adaptation, finance, partnerships and leadership," the Secretary-General added. The Bonn Conference, which opened on 6 November 2017, is taking place one year after the entry into force of the Paris Climate Agreement. The Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2015, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. Today, 170 Parties have ratified the treaty. We will have more from our news team in Bonn throughout the day. (Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK http://www.m2.com www.m2.com )) \</doc>

Fiji is set to use 360-degree Virtual Reality (VR) as a key part of its global push for stronger action on climate change at next week's COP23 Climate Change conference. As part of its Presidency of COP23 in Bonn, Germany, the Fijian Government will launch an immersive VR experience that aims to transport delegates, decision-makers and the global community to Fiji to experience the current and future impacts of climate change on the Pacific. Featured in this program is Our Home, Our People, which was produced by the World Bank. The video takes viewers to communities across Fiji to experience the stories of four people whose lives have already been fundamentally changed by climate change, including through last year's devastating Category Five Tropical Cyclone Winston. The VR experience includes the story of Vunisavisavi, a remote coastal community which has already seen significant relocation due to the impacts of rising sea levels. Our Home, Our People is launching alongside the Fijian Government's Climate Vulnerability Assessment 2017, a significant new report which sets out, in significant detail, the climate impacts already felt by Fiji, and identifies possible strategies and costs to make Fiji more climate resilient. The Fijian Government's High-Level Climate Champion, Hon. Inia Seruiratu, said that VR provides a powerful medium for helping decision-makers and members of the public more deeply understand the impacts climate change is already having on Fiji and Fijians. 'Working with partners such as the World Bank, the Fijian COP23 Presidency is supporting a number of virtual reality projects as a way to share stories about climate change. We believe in VR's power to give audiences - both decision-makers at COP23 in Bonn, and people across the world - the chance to see and experience the impacts of climate change in far-away vulnerable countries and isolated communities like in the Pacific, in order to better understand our call for stronger action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increased investment in climate adaptation. I hope through VR the urgency to act will be highlighted.' he said. Michel Kerf, World Bank Country Director Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands said Our Home, Our People is about delving into the stories behind the numbers and projections of how climate change will - and is - impacting Fiji and the Pacific. 'VR is extraordinarily effective at taking audiences to another place, into other people's lives,' said Kerf. 'Our Home, Our People transports audiences - including decision makers who can take action to change the course of climate change - to the true heart of the issue in the Pacific.' The Our Home, Our People project is produced by the Fijian Government, COP23 Secretariat and the World Bank, in partnership with the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and VR specialists, S1T2.

November 6, 2017 The United Nations Climate Conference opened on Monday in Bonn, Germany, with the aim of a greater ambition for climate action, as the world body's weather agency issued a stark warning that 2017 is set to be among the three hottest years on record. The Bonn Conference of the State Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNTCC), informally known as COP 23 and which runs until 17 November, is chaired by Fiji, an island State particularly affected by the impacts of our warming climate. "The need for urgency is obvious. Our world is in distress from the extreme weather events caused by climate change - destructive hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts, melting ice, and changes to agriculture that threaten our food security", said COP 23 President and Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama, at the opening of the conference. "Our job as leaders is to respond to that suffering with all means available to us. [We] must not fail our people. That means using the next two weeks and the year ahead to do everything we can to make the Paris Agreement work and to advance ambition and support for climate action before 2020." The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015 in the French capital after which it is named, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. A year ago, the Marrakech Climate Conference concluded with the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development, in which the UNFCCC States Parties affirmed their "commitment" to the "full implementation" of the Paris Agreement. Today, 169 Parties have ratified the Agreement. UN weather agency warns 2017 to be among hottest years ever As this year's Conference got under way, the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), released its provisional statement on the State of the Climate. "It is very likely that 2017 will be one of the three hottest years on record, with many high-impact events including catastrophic hurricanes and floods, debilitating heatwaves and drought," said the agency. For his part, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas told delegates in Bonn that the past three years have all been in the top three years in terms of temperature records. "This is part of a long term warming trend," pointing to recent "extraordinary weather," including temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius in Asia, record-breaking hurricanes in rapid succession in the Caribbean and Atlantic reaching as far as Ireland, devastating monsoon flooding affecting many millions of people and a relentless drought in East Africa. "Wherever we live, we are all vulnerable and need to act," Mr. Bainimarama told delegates, explaining that Fiji is helping build a Grand Coalition for decisive, coordinated action by governments at every level, by civil society, the private sector and all citizens on earth. "That's why we installed an ocean-going Fijian 'drua' canoe in the entrance here to remind everyone of the need to fill its sail with collective determination to make COP23 a success and confront the biggest challenge humanity has faced," he said. Patricia Espinosa, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, reminded the participants that: "We have some very specific goals we must achieve while we are here in Bonn. We expect these negotiations to be the next essential step that ensures that the Paris Agreement's structure is completed, its impacts are strengthened, and its goals achieved. We also need to move forward to fulfil the commitments that are due in 2020. In this regard, finance and mitigation pledges are essential." The Bonn Conference will feature a series of meetings and events, including the high-level segment, on 15 November and 16 November, attended by Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres. Mr. Guterres has invited leaders to consider championing six high-impact areas at a special Climate Summit in 2019. These areas are investment in clean technology, maturing carbon pricing, enabling the energy transition, risk mitigation and building resilience, augmenting the contribution of sub-national actors and business and mobilizing climate finance. Among the side events scheduled at COP 23 , several will be organized under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, to show how cities, regions, private sector companies and investors are trying to implement the Paris Agreement in the areas of energy, water, agriculture, oceans and coastal areas, human settlements, transportation, industry, and forests. \</doc>

ENVIRONMENT campaigner Ewan Jones of Bruton has continued a journey he began in 2015, pedalling on from Paris to the United Nations COP23 climate change conference in Bonn, Germany. In November 2015, Ewan cycled from Plymouth to the previous Paris COP21 conference - delivering reports on more than 3,000 tonnes of carbon saved by the people of Cornwall - via Climate Vision's ten Carbon Logic Footsteps pledges. This year, Ewan was one of three cyclists to pick up the pedals from Paris, and continue "On2Bonn". Ewan said: "The COP21 Paris Agreement was rightly hailed as one of the world's greatest diplomatic successes - as all 196 nations united in committing to limit global tempererature rise to a maximum 1.5C to 2C above pre-industrial levels. "However, the hard work started after Paris. The COP23 Bonn conference is an important step along the road of the world working out, together, 'how' we can meet this ambitious target." Arriving in Bonn after pedalling 600 kilometres across northern France and Belgium's hilly Ardennes region, Ewan and his two companions united with 2,500 German cyclists to ride into the city, and then joined more than 30,000 people marching to end coal mining in Germany - the biggest climate demonstration the country has ever seen. Ewan said: "We have met cycling teams from countries across Europe, all converging on Bonn by the power in their legs. Three hundred cycled together from Belgium; we met a couple of Frenchmen who had crossed the Alps on a yellow tandem, and there are even two young New Zealanders who have cycled 10,000 kilometres to get here." Of the upcoming COP23 negotiations in Bonn, he said: "The two years since Paris have seen political turmoil in Both Britain and America, but those converging on Bonn are demonstrating their commitment to deliver the Paris Agreement regardless of the absence of national leadership. "A total of 383 US Climate Mayors, representing 68 million Americans, have committed to working together to strengthen local efforts for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of the presence of Donald Trump in the White House. "The EU Committee of the Regions is bringing proposals for Regionally and Locally Determined Contributions that will count towards national carbon reduction plans, meaning the South West of England can deliver our share of the Paris Agreement regardless of Brexit paralysis in Westminster. " COP23 "I love the generosity of Bonn's vision in hosting COP23 on behalf of Fiji, the first small island developing state to hold the Presidency of a UN climate conference, and hope that our small island state can rediscover broader horizons soon." \</doc>

The EU expects this year's UN climate conference ( COP23 ) to reaffirm once again the international community's commitment to stepping up the global response to climate change and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Following the entry into force of the historic agreement last year, elaborating its implementing guidelines is now a key focus. President Jean-Claude Juncker clearly said it in his State of the European Union speech at the European Parliament this year: 'I want Europe to be the leader when it comes to the fight against climate change. Last year, we set the global rules of the game with the Paris Agreement ratified here, in this very House. Set against the collapse of ambition in the United States, Europe must ensure we make our planet great again. It is the shared heritage of all of humanity.' Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete said: 'The Paris Agreement has set the direction of travel for the global transition to a modern low-carbon economy. The increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events we are witnessing across the world are a stark reminder of the urgency of the challenges we face. Now is the time to translate ambition into action and speed up implementation. COP23 will be a key moment to ensure that we are on track to meet our first deadline: completing the Paris work programme by 2018.' The 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23 ), presided over by Fiji, is taking place from 6-17 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany. It will bring together ministers and government officials, as well as a wide range of representatives from civil society and business. The EU expects the conference to demonstrate clear progress on the development of the technical rules and guidelines for implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement, for example on the transparency framework and the 5-year ambition cycle aimed at helping countries make progressively more ambitious contributions. The work programme is due to be adopted at the 2018 UN climate conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland. The EU is making solid progress on finalising a legislative framework for achieving its Paris target - its collective nationally determined contribution (NDC) - to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030. This includes revising the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) post-2020, setting 2030 emissions reduction targets for non-ETS sectors such as transport, buildings and agriculture and integrating land use, land use change and forestry into the EU's legal framework for climate action. In addition the Commission intends to present a Clean Mobility package of proposals on 8 November to further facilitate the EU's transition to low carbon mobility and economy. The EU remains committed to the collective global goal of mobilising USD 100 billion a year by 2020 and through to 2025 to finance climate action in developing countries, from a variety of sources, and continuing to significantly increase financing for adaptation to climate change. In 2016, the EU and its Member States contributed a total EUR 20.2 billion in climate finance, an increase of more than 10% from the EUR 17.6 billion provided in 2015. Alongside the formal COP23 negotiations, the Bonn conference will showcase climate action by a wide range of stakeholders including cities and regions, businesses and civil society groups. The EU is a strong supporter of the Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA) as an important platform for multi-stakeholder action and will continue to engage actively in this forum. The EU will be represented in Bonn by Miguel Arias Canete, Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy and Siim Kiisler, Environment Minister of Estonia, which currently holds the presidency of the Council of Ministers of the EU. Events during COP23 During the conference, the EU will host more than 100 events at the EU Pavilion in Bonn (see link below). These events, organised by a variety of countries and organisations from Europe and the rest of the world, will address a broad range of climate-related issues from the energy transition to the role of forests and oceans, climate finance, research and innovation and assessing climate risks.

November 17, 2017 The United Nations Climate Conference ( COP23 ) wrapped up on Friday in Bonn, Germany, with delegations expressing a renewed sense of urgency and a need for greater ambition to tackle climate change. Participants focused on how to maintain momentum two years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change in the context of the recent announcement by the United States of its decision to withdraw from the accord. At COP23 , cities and local governments, including American cities and states, intensified their push to achieve the goals set out in Paris. The Conference, which ran from 6 to 17 November, was chaired by Fiji, an island State particularly affected by the impacts of climate change. The Fiji Presidency announced an agreement on a Gender Action Plan, highlighting the role of women in climate action. Apart from negotiations among Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), several new climate action initiatives, commitments and partnerships were announced by States and non-State actors in the areas of energy, water, agriculture, oceans and coastal areas, human settlements, transportation, industry, and forests. Climate finance and climate resilience were also at the center of the discussions at the conference. More than 20 countries, including the Canada, Finland, France, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, launched a new global coal alliance aimed at achieving the rapid phase-out of existing traditional coal power and at placing a moratorium on any new traditional coal power stations without operational carbon capture and storage. COP23 : Concrete Climate Action Commitments As the UN Climate Change Conference comes down to the last day and governments work to complete the final negotiation decisions, it's good to be reminded of the new wave of climate action that has been announced during COP23 from countries, cities, states, regions, business and civil society Read more \'bb Businesses and other non-government partners have in turn made commitments to focus on powering their operations without coal. The 19 Member countries of the 'Biofuture Platform,' including Brazil, China, Egypt, France, India, Morocco, Mozambique, also announced on Thursday formal agreement on the development of targets for biofuels and to construct an action plan to achieve them. "Sustainable biofuels can provide solutions to the energy transport nexus. This partnership offers us that chance,"said Rachel Kyte, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and CEO, Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All). Among other initiatives announced during the Conference, a global initiative was launched Tuesday with the aim of providing insurance to hundreds of millions of vulnerable people by 2020 and to increase the resilience of developing countries against the impacts of climate change. The 'InsuResilience' Global Partnership is a major scaling-up of an initiative started by the G7 in 2015 under the German Presidency. The Conference took place one year after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. The Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. Today, 170 Parties have ratified the treaty. The Conference, which was attended by some 27.000, took place in a sobering context of alarming scientific reports of climatic changes. A week before the opening of the Conference, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere surged at "record-breaking speed" to new highs in 2016. COP23 will be followed by a series of summits and conferences on climate change which are scheduled ahead of the UN Climate Summit in September 2019, including the 'One Planet summit' to be convened by France next month and focusing on financing, a gathering in California, bringing together non-State actors, and the COP24 in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018. Brazil has offered to host COP25 in 2019. \</doc>

Polar bear cubs|Photo credit: Press Association Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, Jerry Brown also countered the scepticism in his homeland about the existence of global warming. Introducing the American, environment committee Chair Adina-Ioana Valean pointed out that while the US had endorsed the Paris agreement, President Trump, since coming to office, had pledged to pull America out of the deal. In his speech, Brown told MEPs that everyone was affected by climate change and he believed the Paris deal had an important contribution to make to tackling the problem. RELATED CONTENT Gilles Pargneaux: COP23 : Despite US withdrawal, Paris agreement is alive and well Adina-Ioana Valean : COP23 : It's time for Europe to lead by example Jos Delbeke:The Paris agreement one year on: What next? "We have seen the effects in California where we are now fighting forest fires not just three months of the year but the whole year round. This is due to climate change I believe. "We are getting extraordinary events around the world that are not normal and it's not going to get better, but worse. The need for decarbonisation is clear but this will require a transformation of society and our lifestyles in a relatively rapid period of time. The climate science is clear so we have no choice." He also took a swipe at those in the US and elsewhere who deny the need for action. "I am told back home that we need to tackle things like crime, poverty and disease and of course we do but they also question the need to tackle climate change so there is a lot of scepticism to combat. "There is, in fact, a rising need to tackle climate change but this will need courage. If you asked me if we are doing enough the answer is no and nor are we on track to meet the emission reduction targets. "In my opinion, civilisation faces an over-arching existential threat from climate change." Brown told the committee, "The risk of rising temperature in irreversible ways, with great destruction exacerbating inequality, poverty and migration, is going to happen soon. I am going to COP23 to join other states and provinces throughout the world to push a climate action agenda and to get the job done." He pointed to a "whole package" of climate changes measures enacted in California which, along with some other US states, has pledged to defy President Trump and implement in full measures agreed in Paris. Brown said, "The nature of the threat from climate change is existential, and the level of commitment is not up to the threat. Decarbonising requires a transformation of our whole civilisation, fossil fuels are the basis on which we function today. We are fossil fuel people, carbon people. Even the 2\'b0C goal may not be enough." Brown earlier met with environment committee members and EU-US delegation MEPs. He will travel today to the COP23 conference in Bonn. European Parliament President Antonio Tajani, opening the debate with Brown, said, "It is of great importance to have this debate today with the leader of a US state, California, which we consider to be a very important regional state in the US and a key player in US politics." Valean, a Romanian MEP, said, "Although the US decided to withdraw from the Paris agreement, an impressive number of US states and cities decided to uphold their share in the fight against climate change". She will lead a delegation of MEPs to Bonn to attend the COP23 climate conference this week. "We are all aware that state-level action alone is not enough. We need to bring together governments on all levels, businesses, academia and civil society in a joint and coordinated effort to meet the ambition we set out in Paris two years ago", she said. EU-US delegation Chair Christian Ehler, a German EPP group member, said, "The UN climate change conference started this week with strong, unified calls to hold to the path of the Paris agreement. "This takes place against the backdrop of this year's destructive hurricanes, fires, floods, droughts, melting ice and impacts on agriculture, which threaten food security. "For us, it has become more and more important to engage with US states and their top political representatives, given the particular make-up of the US political system, alongside our regular contacts from Congress and the administration", he added. Brown was named Special Advisor for States and Regions ahead of this year's COP23 by Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama - President of COP23 - at a ceremony where Fiji became the latest government to join the Under2 Coalition. The coalition includes 176 jurisdictions on six continents, collectively representing more than 36 countries, 1.2 billion people and $28.8 trillion GDP - equivalent to over 16 per cent of the global population and over 39 per cent of the global economy.

COUNTRIES MUST WORK TOGETHER TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE, SAYS NICOLA STURGEON By Katrine Bussey, Political Editor, Press Association Scotland Countries from across the world must work together as ``friends and partners'' to tackle the problem of climate change, Nicola Sturgeon said. The First Minister will join political leaders from other United Nations countries at the international climate change convention summit in Bonn, Germany. The COP23 Since then, however, US president Donald Trump signalled his intention to withdraw from the global treaty. Ms Sturgeon stressed that ``in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, it is important we work together with our friends and partners across the globe'' The First Minister will address a high level plenary session of COP23 and ahead of her speech she confirmed the Scottish Government will provide more than \£3300,000 of funding for a UN plan that aims to increase the role women play in tackling global warming. Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham, who is also at the summit, has meanwhile announced over \£33.6 million to help developing nations deal with the impact of climate change Ms Sturgeon said: `` COP23 brings politicians and activists from around the world together, providing an opportunity to work towards our common goal of reducing greenhouse gasses and mitigating the effects of climate change. It is a privilege to be asked to represent the states, regions and devolved governments in the Marrakech Partnership. ``The UNFCCC Gender Plan recognises the importance of involving women in global efforts to tackle climate change. If we are to be successful in addressing this issue, we need to ensure that women are fully represented. The Scottish Government stands ready to play our part in helping achieve that goal.'' \</doc>

Scotland needs to do more than meet its own ambitious emissions targets to help tackle climate change, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. As well as tackling reducing emissions at home, she also stressed the importance of efforts to combat the problem on a global scale. The First Minister spoke ahead of an address to politicians at this year's United Nation's climate change conference in Bonn. Ms Sturgeon will join a panel at the COP23 event also featuring UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, Fijian prime minister and COP23 president Frank Bainimarama, UN climate change convention executive secretary Patricia Espinosa, and the Mayor of Bonn Ashok-Alexander Sridharan. The Scottish Government is already proposing legislating for a 90% cut in emissions by 2050 - up from the 80% it had originally set as a target. Ms Sturgeon said: ``Scotland is absolutely committed to tackling climate change and our targets are the most ambitious in the UK. ``But it is not enough to just focus on domestic targets. That is why Scotland is also active in tackling climate change at a global level. We are signatories to the Under2 Coalition to reduce worldwide carbon emissions and are party to the Marrakech Partnership.'' The Marrakech Partnership works to increase cooperation between national and regional governments, business, civic society and others to promote emission reductions and sustainable development. Ms Sturgeon said: ``International summits like COP23 are vital to tackle climate change and it is an honour to be asked to speak on behalf of the states, regions and devolved governments in the Partnership.'' Acting WWF director Dr Sam Gardner said: ``Scotland has a fantastic climate story to share, and it's great that it's being heard on a world stage. ``We can be proud of the word-leading climate legislation unanimously passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2009 and the recent commitments in the Programme for Government.'' That included a target for phasing out the sale of traditional petrol and diesel cars by 2032 - eight years ahead of the UK. But WWF called on the First Minister to go further and set a target for a 100% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050. Dr Gardner said: ``The upcoming Climate Change Bill presents a crucial opportunity to renew our climate leadership. ``By setting a target for cutting our greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050 and introducing bold new policies in transport, housing and agriculture we'll be playing our part in helping realise the goals of the Paris Agreement. ``An ambitious Climate Change Bill will create jobs, improve health and reduce poverty at home, whilst also ensuring Scotland plays its part in helping the poorest people in the world cope with the effects of climate change.'' Ms Sturgeon will speak at COP23 on Wednesday November 15, with Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham also due to address the summit's sustainable innovatio forum on Monday November 13. \</doc>

Fijian Government launches significant new study into the country's climate vulnerability at COP23 . By 2050, Fiji's annual losses due to extreme weather events could reach 6.5 percent of GDP because of the impact of climate change, with more than 32,000 people pushed into hardship every year, according to a significant new climate vulnerability study launched today at COP23 in Bonn, Germany. An estimated FJ$ 9.3 billion (US$ 4.5 billion) over ten years - almost equivalent to 100 percent of the country's GDP for one year - is needed to build the resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change. Climate Vulnerability Assessment: Making Fiji Climate Resilient, which was prepared in partnership with the World Bank and Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), was launched at COP23 today by Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum. The Vulnerability Assessment provides significant new analysis of Fiji's vulnerability to climate change, with projections outlining potential impacts for Fiji over the coming decades, covering the impact of climate change on Fiji's economy, livelihoods and poverty levels, health and food security together with key industries including agriculture and tourism, as well as potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas and low lying islands. Key projections from the Assessment include: An increase in the number of Fijians being pushed into poverty and hardship would increase from 25,700 people per year to an estimated 32,400 per year by 2050. A significant increase in the cost of climate change-related disasters, with projections of asset losses from floods and cyclones costing up to 30 percent higher than current averages. Sea-level rise and increased intensity of coastal storms, with most models projecting an increase in global sea levels of 17-38cm relative to current levels by 2065, potentially creating a major threat for the country; with 30 percent of Fiji's population currently living in risk-prone areas. Much can be done to help Fiji minimize risks and adapt to climate change. The Assessment identifies 125 measures across five priority areas that could make Fiji and Fijians more resilient. The five areas include: building inclusive and resilient towns and cities; improving infrastructure services; climate smart agriculture and fisheries; conserving ecosystems and building socioeconomic resilience. According to the Assessment, an estimated FJ$ 9.3 billion (US$ 4.5 billion) over 10 years is required to finance these interventions, in addition to maintenance and operation costs and social protection systems. Fiji's Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Climate Change, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said the Assessment is critical for climate and risk-informed development to strengthen the resilience of the Fijian economy. 'Assessing vulnerability to climate change is important for defining the risks posed by climate change and provides information for identifying adaptation measures. It enables practitioners and decision-makers to identify the most vulnerable areas, sectors and social groups. This in turn means, climate adaptation options targeted at specified contexts are developed and implemented,' said Minister Sayed-Khaiyum. Michel Kerf, the World Bank's Country Director for the Pacific Islands, said that the World Bank had set out to support Fiji with a comprehensive Assessment that would paint a realistic picture of the challenges ahead and provide a roadmap of recommended priorities for climate resilience. 'This Assessment presents, in stark terms, clear evidence of the costs of climate change,' said Kerf. 'Yet crucially it also provides an evidence-based resource from which we can best support Fiji, and other island countries, in their drive towards more climate resilient development.' The Climate Vulnerability Assessment was launched at COP23 alongside a 360-degree Virtual Reality (VR) experience, Our Home, Our People ( HYPERLINK http://www.ourhomeourpeople.com www.ourhomeourpeople.com COP23 delegates, decision-makers and the global community to Fiji to see the impacts of climate change for themselves.

Today in Bonn, Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank - the world's largest financier of climate action - welcomed a new action plan designed to stimulate green finance to tackle global warming. Dr Hoyer was speaking at an event on the margins of the COP23 UN Climate Conference in Bonn. Convened by the United Nations' Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative and hosted by the Luxembourg Green Exchange, the event featured the release of a new SSE action plan on how stock exchanges can grow green finance. President Hoyer said, 'It is estimated that 90 trillion dollars of sustainable investment is needed by 2030. The path to a 2 degree world may look long and steep for climate activists. But I firmly believe that green bonds - pioneered by the European Investment Bank 10 years ago - alongside other green financial instruments, can help us reach this target.' He added, 'Stock exchanges can play a decisive role in triggering the trillions needed to ward off a global tragedy. Therefore, I very much welcome today's release of this important publication by the UN Sustainable Stock Exchange. I hope that actions will soon follow words and that this plan, which highlights two crucial aspects: promoting green products, and greening financial markets, will stimulate supply and the demand for green finance.' Full speech available here. The European Investment Bank is active in more than 130 countries. It is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate related investment in the five years up to 2020.

Fiji has become the first emerging market to issue a sovereign green bond, raising 100 million Fijian dollars, or US$ 50 million, to support climate change mitigation and adaption. Home to over 870,000 people, Fiji's 300 volcanic islands include low-lying atolls that are highly susceptible to cyclones and floods. In 2016, Tropical Cyclone Winston-the most intense tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere on record-passed directly over Fiji, causing economic losses that amounted to almost one third of the country's GDP. Like all Pacific island states, Fiji is also highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change: close to 20 percent of the region's 10 million people could be displaced due to climate change by 2050. Green bonds are fixed income, liquid financial instruments that are used to raise funds dedicated to climate-mitigation, adaptation, and other environment-friendly projects. This provides investors an attractive investment proposition as well as an opportunity to support environmentally sound projects. At the request of Fiji's Reserve Bank, the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group focusing on private sector, provided technical assistance to assist the government in issuing a sovereign green bond. This collaboration took place under a broader, three-year Capital Markets Development Project supported by the Australian Government. Through this partnership, Australia and IFC are helping stimulate private sector investment, promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in the Pacific. Projects financed from the Fiji green bond will follow the internationally developed Green Bond Principles, and will focus primarily on investments that build resilience against the impacts of climate change. Sustainalytics US (Sustainalytics), a provider of environmental, social and governance research and analysis, evaluated Fiji Sovereign's green bond transaction and its alignment with the Green Bond Principles. Fiji will also use bond proceeds for projects supporting its commitment to achieve 100% renewable energy and reduce its CO2 emissions in the energy sector by 30% by 2030. Fijian Prime Minister and President of COP23 Frank Bainimarama said: 'The Fijian people, along with every Pacific Islander, live on the front lines of climate change. The rising seas, changing weather patterns and severe weather events are threatening our development, our security and the Fijian way of life, along with the very existence of some of our low-lying neighbors. I have made access to climate finance a key pillar of our upcoming COP23 Presidency, and we are proud to set an example to other climate-vulnerable nations by issuing this green bond to fund our work to boost climate resilience across Fiji. By issuing the first emerging country green bond , we are also sending a clear signal to other nations that we can be creative and innovative in mobilizing funds and create win-win outcomes for countries and investors in adapting to the serious effects of climate change.' 'With this bond, Fiji has demonstrated that green capital markets can be created in emerging economies, and that all countries, big and small, have an important role to play in facilitating climate solutions,' World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said. 'As it takes the helm of COP23 , Fiji is uniquely positioned to inspire other countries to meet their respective targets and build resilience against climate change.' The World Bank and IFC are among the pioneers of the green bond market. The World Bank issued the first green bond in 2008. Since then, both institutions have provided leadership by issuing green bonds across a range of currencies, tenors and volumes; helping to define best practice for reporting and standards; and working with countries to facilitate the development of domestic green bond markets. The global green bond market is expected to reach US$ 134.9 billion in 2017. The Government of Fiji will chair the 23rd Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany from November 6-17, 2017. Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama has given high priority to COP23 and aims to continue the momentum for action since the entry into force of the Paris Climate Change Agreement last year.

AN INCONVENIENT SEQUEL: TRUTH TO POWER (PG) HHHHH Jon Shenk, Bonni Cohen, 98 mins, featuring: Al Gore The message hasn't changed in the decade since former US Vice President Al Gore's first, Oscar-winning documentary about climate change: Big Al remains an impassioned and impressive campaigner. It's hard to say how much freedom directors Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk had in shaping the film, but whether it is their doing or Gore's, the film's structure feels artificial. It builds up to a dramatic finale at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris in late 2015. Gore is shown working heroically behind the scenes to ensure the Paris agreement on climate change is signed and India is kept on board. This should be the pay-off, but other vexing elements keep getting in the way. There's the looming figure of Donald Trump, soon to become President and ready to pour scorn on Gore's environmental efforts and on President Obama for taking them so seriously. COP 21 itself happens in the wake of the 2015 Paris terrorism attacks. Even as climate treaties are announced, there's a dispiriting sense that they won't last. Early in the documentary, Gore acknowledges that he "got really discouraged" by what happened after 2006. His first film sparked considerable debate - but it also provoked his opponents into trying to trash his reputation and dismiss his "hysterical global warming theories". He talks darkly of democracy being "hacked by big business". Yet the "number of extremely hot days" are becoming much more numerous. An Inconvenient Sequel is skilfully put together. As in An Inconvenient Truth, lecture material is combined with Gore's reflections on his own private and political life. There is footage of him out and about in Miami Beach as the water levels rise, and meeting Republican mayors in Texas who share his passion for renewable energy. We see him making calls to political leaders, lobbying industrialists from Silicon Valley and telling jokes at his own expense. At times, as he holds forth about the "environment crisis" and the "democracy crisis", he resembles Burt Lancaster as the preacher/ mountebank in Elmer Gantry. We know exactly what he is going to say, but that doesn't stop his words from resonating. THE INDEPENDENT \</doc>

Specialised schemes could protect lives and jobs against extreme weather, say experts at Imperial's COP23 side-event. The effects of climate change, such as droughts, wild-fires and extreme weather are a particular concern for those living in countries where people cannot afford to protect themselves against such disasters. Globally, 70% of the damage caused by climate change events, and 98% in developing countries, doesn't get compensated unless the government steps in, delegates heard at the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is taking place in Bonn, Germany. Climate risk insurance - which provides financial compensation for people following climate-related disasters - could be a powerful tool to build resilience to global warming trends, but financial concerns are holding up progress. These concerns were raised by experts at an official side-event organised by the Imperial College London delegation at COP23 , with Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII)_and Munich Re Foundation. The need for climate risk insurance is clear Climate change is already affecting people's lives worldwide, and are predicted to worsen as greenhouse gases from human activities cause further global warming. 'By looking at the changing distribution of different weather parameters, such as temperature or precipitation, we know that, as a result of climate change, some weather extremes are becoming more frequent,' said Professor Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial's Global Institute addressing the challenges of global warming and environmental change. 'For example, in July 2010, Russia experienced a series of heatwaves: such events used to have a 99-year repeat time but now this is reduced to about 30 years,' she said. The COP23 conference is presided over by Fiji who, drawing on their experience as a Small Island Developing State in the Pacific, have prioritised discussions on accelerating climate action for the most vulnerable nations. Imperial's event addressed the topic of climate risk and insurance and its relevance to developing nations. According to Christian Barthelt, Project Manager at the Munich Re Foundation, climate risk insurance has broad, multi-faceted benefits. 'It is much more than just a pay-in pay-out scheme,' he said. 'Insurance can cover many aspects of disaster risk management. It's a constantly evolving process that can be understood as a cycle, incorporating research, data and constant improvements. This approach can bring transparency, a much greater awareness of climate-related risk, and improved resilience - if applied correctly.' Everyone must be involved Speakers at the event emphasised that climate risk management is a long-term intervention, requiring commitment to improve communities' resilience to climate change and their role in avoiding its worse effects. 'An effective insurance policy depends on partnerships between the public and private sector, and the active participation of communities at risk,' said Barthelt. 'You need to promote the project on the ground, develop a sustained dialogue with the different stakeholders, and ensure the long-term commitment of all those involved.' This sentiment was echoed by Soenke Kreft, Executive Director of Munich Climate Insurance Initiative: 'The whole thing is rooted in international cooperation - shared responsibility between countries, both developed and developing, access to data, and the political will to see projects through long term'. Momentum is growing, but there's more to do Over the past few years, climate risk insurance has been recognised by major policy fora, including the Paris Agreement, the UN Sustainability Development Goals and G7 and G20 discussions. However, Simone Ruiz, Managing Director of Allianz Climate Solutions, highlighted that only 2% of the developing world is insured against climate disasters. 'In developing countries, 98% of the damage caused by climate change events doesn't get any compensation unless the government steps in - and of course, behind the damage there are people who lose their homes, work places, or worse,' she said. 'Insurance can be a mechanism to prevent livelihoods falling back into poverty after extreme weather events.' Financial and technical constraints 'Over the past few decades, these countries have suffered from repeated extreme weather events. Their frequency disrupts any recovery progress, and has significant adverse effects on economic, social and environmental conditions,' he said. To overcome these constraints in vulnerable countries, the private sector, governments and the populations at risk need to work together to develop approaches that enable insurance to be used as a tool to promote sustainable development and adaptation to climate change. One approach discussed was a pooling of contributions beyond national boundaries to share the financial outlay between more governments. 'Although this would require would require significant political will, it could deliver significant social and environmental dividends,' said Soenke.

MICHAEL STIPE and PATTI SMITH will headline a United Nations (UN) concert organised to raise funds for the fight against climate change. The rockers will take to the stage at New York City's Carnegie Hall on 5 November (17) for the Pathway to Paris concert, formed in collaboration with UN Development Programme chiefs. Also performing at the gig, which takes place on the eve of the UN's COP23 climate conference in Bonn, Germany, will be Flea, Cat Power and musicians and activists Rebecca Foon and Jesse Paris Smith. The event will also feature talks from leading environmentalists and the announcement of a new initiative calling on city planners to convert to using renewable sources to fulfill 100 per cent of their energy needs. November's gig is the third Pathway to Paris event. The first took place in December 2015 during the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, France. At the 2015 conference, world leaders signed the Paris climate accord agreeing to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The climate deal has since been placed in jeopardy, following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the agreement earlier this year. The COP23 \</doc>

November 16, 2017 Education International is the federation of organisations representing over 30 million teachers and other education workers, through over 400 member organisations in more than 170 countries and territories. A toxic cloud over India's capital Delhi has prompted Indian public authorities to take the unprecedented step of closing 4,000 schools for nearly a week. Levels nearly 30 times what the World Health Organisation considers safe Delhi has notoriously noxious air but even by the standards of this city, the pollution has been alarming, reaching levels nearly 30 times what the World Health Organisation considers safe. On 7 November, the government decided to close primary schools, and the next day the closings were extended to all public and most private schools. In some parts of the city, the levels of PM 2.5 - very small particles that can settle deep in the lungs - had climbed to more than 700 micrograms per cubic meter, which is considered hazardous to breathe, according to data provided by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Scientists estimate these particles have already killed millions. The Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi State Manish Sisodia even explained that he was driving to a meeting Wednesday morning when he passed a school bus and saw two children throwing opening the window to get sick. "That was shocking for me," he said. "I immediately told my officers to pass the order to close all the schools." Delhi's chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal. Pollution levels will be reassessed, he said, and a decision made about whether schools should remain closed for longer. Over four million children are now out of school, as it is believed they will be safer staying at home than going to and from school on polluted streets, though most homes in Delhi do not have a single air filter. Officials acknowledged that this was the first time so many schools would be closed for this many days. AIPTF: teachers urge Delhi government to take urgent steps to control the situation One of Education international's national affiliates, the All India Primary Teachers Federation (AIPTF) expressed grave concerns on the dangerous state of air pollution and smog in Delhi. Straw burning in the neighbouring states have added to the ever existing air pollution in Delhi, stressed AIPTF Secretary General Kamala Kant Tripathy, adding that "such situation is very dangerous particularly for the young students and poor who have to spend lot of time outdoors which may cause irreparable health hazards." He demanded of the Delhi government immediate measures to control the situation and keep the schools closed until then. He also called upon the government "to come out with a comprehensive long-term plan to curb air pollution and smog which has become an annual phenomenon now". The current situation in Delhi highlights climate change due to unchecked and unregulated development and consumption of natural resources Tripathy observed, requesting joint efforts by central and state governments and India's citizens to meet the challenge. He further guaranteed public authorities of the AIPTF members' full support in tackling this environmental hazard. Education international hopes the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) to the UN Convention on Climate Change, currently held in Bonn, Germany, will focus on finding long-term solutions to these environmental disasters, and invite COP23 participating countries to include climate change education in national curricula. \</doc>

By NICK LAVIGUEUR HYPERLINK mailto:nick@examiner.co.uk nick@examiner.co.uk The President of the USA has famously denied climate change is man-made and pulled the world's second biggest polluting country out of an international environmental agreement to try and cut emissions. Now Kirklees Green Party chief, Clr Andrew Cooper, has said he has a cunning plan to undermine Mr Trump. As a member of UK delegation to the EU Committee of the Regions, he is pressing for sub-national bodies and councils to be able to take part in tackling climate change. His plan could allow US states to side-step Trump and make their own policies. Clr Cooper will be attending the COP23 climate change talks in Bonn, Germany next week where he hopes his plan will be given the green light. His proposal has already been backed by the EU Committee of the Regions. Clr Cooper explained: "Adopting this policy will provide a way for state governments in the USA to produce plans to reduce carbon emissions without seeking the permission of their president. "We cannot allow the illogical and unscientific approach taken by President Trump to go unchallenged. "This is a way he can be side-stepped and give those politicians who take a rational approach in the USA the policies they need to make the action they take at the local level count towards international climate change targets." Now Councillor Cooper's initiative has been passed at the European level, the EU Committee of the Regions is taking it as one of their principal proposals to the climate talks in Bonn. Clr Cooper will be attending the summit in a bid to press for further support and inclusion in the final 'Summit Declaration'. "This proposal is also very relevant to us in Kirklees," he added. "Action we take at the local level, such as mass insulation schemes, installing LED Streetlights or tree planting projects would not currently be taken into account in the UK government's carbon reduction plans. "Under my proposal any action we take to reduce carbon emissions would be taken into account and make it easier to achieve our challenging targets to reduce global greenhouse gases." COP23 will see the world's nations meet to try and take the landmark Paris agreement at COP21 further. The Paris agreement saw all countries agree to toughen laws and reduce emissions to keep global warming below 2C. Ex-President Barack Obama committed the USA to the deal, only for President Trump to back out of it within months of taking office.

Text of report in English by Nepalese newspaper The Kathmandu Post website on 7 November As one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, Nepal will draw the attention of international community during the global climate change conference, also called Conference of Parties ( COP23 ), that kicked off in Bonn, Germany, on Monday [6 November]. The Nepali delegation led by Minister for Population and Environment Mithila Chaudhary will take part in several events, sharing Nepal's concerns on the effects of climate change that the country confronts. The twenty-third session of the COP to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) is a global event which brings together policy makers, delegates, scientists, lobbyists and private sectors. Nepal has prepared a detailed status paper especially for the COP23 . It will be sharing its climate change experiences at the event, according to Bishwo Nath Oli, secretary at the Environment Ministry. "We have prepared the status report including our experience with climate change over the years and what we expect from the international community," said Secretary Oli. "The status paper was necessary also for making our participation in the conference effective." The document, drafted after a series of consultations with stakeholders and experts, urges implementation of previous agreements especially the Paris Agreement, widely seen as a historic accord that pledges to limit global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius. As a party to the UNFCC, Nepal signed the Paris Agreement in April last year. The Legislature-Parliament ratified the accord in October the same year. Global leaders converging at the COP23 are expected to push for implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement by developing guidelines, incorporating various issues like adaptation, emission reduction, transparency of action and support, technology transfer and capacity-building of the poor and highly vulnerable countries like Nepal. Besides, the global event is also supposed to finalise the Paris Agreement rule book to be adopted at the COP24 in Poland next year. In Nepal's status paper, the country has urged the international community to build momentum and trust among themselves for preparing the rule book guiding implementation of the Paris Accord. Nepal, besides stressing timely adoption of the rule book and implementation of the accord, has asked for technical and financial support it deserves as a Least Developed Country (LDC). The status paper incorporates topics such as programmes under the Paris Accord, mitigation measures, adaptation, means of implementation, and cross-cutting agendas like climate and gender. Under these areas, the paper enlists Nepal's experiences and furnishes demands while fighting climate change. On the fund for climate-vulnerable countries, the status paper reads, "While mitigation is important, adaptation finance must also be prioritised. Green Climate Fund should have more focus on adaptation for LDCs. The Least Developed Countries Fund is important for countries like Nepal; hence, the developed countries should urgently pledge to the Fund and support the actions in LDCs." Citing its disasters like recent flooding, Nepal has also requested for separate funding for loss and damage, urging the COP23 to provide space to discuss funding requirements for vulnerable countries as compensation for loss and damage. The international access to climate finance has always been difficult for LDCs. The status paper suggests that simplified, easy and direct access of support must be in place so that the LDCs can access the necessary resources for climate actions. Nepal has also drawn attention of the developed world for support in the field of technology transfer and capacity-building, which has been sluggish so far. "The Paris Committee on Capacity-building has been established to support countries like Nepal. However, not much progress has been made under this heading. The support mechanism for LDCs must be expedited," reads the document. Source: The Kathmandu Post website, Kathmandu, in English 7 Nov 17 \</doc>

AN INCONVENIENT SEQUEL: TRUTH TO POWER (PG) HHH HH MINUTES into Jon Shenk and Bonni Cohen's tub-thumping sequel to Oscar-winning 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, it becomes apparent that there is one renewable energy source the world has yet to harness. It is a steady, irresistible thrum that won't destroy the ozone layer, and could power the planet for decades: former United States Vice President Al Gore's boundless determination to prick consciences about the effects of global warming. Gore loudly bangs a drum for action and words on climate change, spreading his message during a turbulent period of political upheaval including the election of Donald Trump, who withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord. Canadian Prime Justin Trudeau the UN Climate "With all these new threats, there's never been a more important time to speak truth to power," Gore sombrely observes, providing a snappy subtitle for the sequel. Breathtaking footage of the statesman atop a rapidly melting glacier in Greenland is intercut with snappy soundbites that anoint Gore as the lone voice of reason capable of deviating us from self-destruction. Nowhere in the film is this more pronounced than footage from the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where consensus is countered by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. An unflustered Gore heads backstage to makes a few calls to powerful friends. Lo and behold, a few tense hours later, the accord is salvaged. Aside from lionising Gore, the sequel is blessed with scenes of undeniable emotional power. Minister and Al Gore at Conference His 24-hour reality broadcast on November 13, 2015 in Paris is interrupted by shocking news of suicide bombings and shooting in the French capital. With glistening eyes, Gore stands before the largely French production crew and delivers a heartfelt pledge of solidarity. These simple, unscripted words resonate and remind us of the undeniable power of strangers, from different cultures and backgrounds, to pull together in pursuit of a common goal - our survival. \</doc>

The United Nations is hosting the annual climate change conference in Bonn, Germany this year and the first one taking place since US President Donald Trump took office. The purpose of the two-week meeting led by Fiji, known as the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 on climate change signed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015 in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help poorer countries adapt to an already-changed planet. The US delegation's role as industry advocate Read more Trump team to preach fossil fuel virtues at climate conference The administration has taken a variety of steps to illustrate the stance of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Scott Pruitt's stance that human action does not necessarily exacerbate climate change despite several scientific studies stating otherwise. In June, Mr Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement, citing that it put American workers at an "economic disadvantage." A major piece of legislation called the Clean Power Plan, also established under the previous administration of Barack Obama, was seen as one of the main ways of achieving goals outlined in the Paris accord. According to the Washington DC-based organisation, account for almost 40 per cent of the country's emissions - "more than every car, truck, and plane in the US combined." If left in place, the CPP would reduce power plants' carbon emissions by 2030 to a level 32 per cent lower than they were in 2005. With the US showing no interest in the global fight against climate change, the role of the US delegation at this year's meeting will be drastically different than it has been in the recent past. Nearly half as many delegates, 48, are being brought to Bonn as were taken to last year's conference in Marrakesh. It does not appear as if former Exxon CEO and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose department houses the delegation will be making an appearance. Of them, only 25 have attended COPs previously and several government agencies are not represented, like the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Energy, and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) which monitors natural disasters like recent Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Climate change might be worse than thought after scientists find major mistake in water temperature readings As the New York Times reported, the White House said it "will promote coal, natural gas and nuclear energy as an answer to climate change." Among companies included in the "The Role of Cleaner and More Efficient Fossil Fuels and Nuclear Power in Climate Mitigation" programme are coal company Peabody Energy, nuclear engineers NuScale Power, and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter. Though nuclear power does not produce the same type of emissions as other fossil fuels, many who attend the UN climate change negotiations have been wary of the dangers of power plants near populated areas. Fossil fuels will be billed as a way for poorer countries to get a leg up economically. It is true that developing countries like India have historically argued that they need to use fossil fuels in order to keep its economy running while transitioning to greener alternatives. Several of the world's least developed countries have said use of fossil fuels, even while exercising their rights to development, are more harmful to a sustainable economy than helpful. New leaders on the world stage To wit, the US withdrawal from the Paris accord and announcement that it will be pushing fossil fuel use has left a vacuum in climate leadership according to many experts. India has stepped up to the challenge of making solar power a large scale project. China may look to move into a leadership role as well with its plan for a new national carbon market, which would put a price on carbon emissions by companies. Though one of the world's largest polluters, China has a bilateral agreement on reducing carbon emissions with the US under Mr Obama's signature and has held meetings with the EU and Canada as well. Opposition to Trump within the US We can also expect to see a fair amount of CEOs, mayors, and governors making their mark at the conference as well. American companies and governors from New York, Washington state, California, and Virginia will be on hand to discuss how they are combatting climate change at the sub-national level after voicing opposition to Mr Trump's withdrawal from the Paris deal. Governor Jerry Brown of California has already announced he will host a climate change solutions conference in his state in 2018 as well. Only five US Senators are listed as part of the official US delegation: Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and Ben Cardin of Maryland - all Democrats from states with track records of environmental regulations and specific coastal climate change concerns. Money for natural disasters The crux of the negotiations from the beginning has been how developed, wealthier countries can help poorer countries develop despite historical climate damage done by those wealthier countries who relied on fossil fuels to develop - a concept called £daptation.' One of the main ways to do that has been seen as changing economies to have less of a reliance on oil, gas, and coal. Another crucial point in this debate is the concept of 'loss and damage' which is the term used to describe compensation for developing countries and vulnerable populations when climate-related natural disasters occur - in other words, adapting to a changing climate takes long-term planning, but loss and damage aid is for the hurricanes, typhoons, droughts, floods that occur while the world continues to negotiate. Read more Trump's Scottish golf course 'faces flooding' due to climate change Ambassador to Canada says she 'respects both sides of climate science' US government agency issues climate change warning There is also a portion of 'loss and damage' that would allow island nations to account for refugees and displacement as a result of climate-related events. With recent displacement of American citizens from Houston, Texas, the low-lying areas of Louisiana, and almost all of Puerto Rico this is an issue to watch. The conference is expected to run from 6-17 November in Bonn, Germany. \</doc>

The main business of this Conference of Parties meeting is procedural "" setting up two processes that have to happen in 2018 to support the Paris Agreement: writing the rulebook and beginning the process of countries making their Paris commitments more ambitious. "Candidly, this is a COP for drilling down, rather than high level announcements," said Jonathan Taylor, vice-president for climate at the European Investment Bank, who was in Bonn yesterday. "The purpose is to have got to a point where we see a clear roadmap between here and Katowice, COP 24." Nevertheless, there will be announcements aplenty. HSBC grabbed headlines on Monday by pledging to provide $100bn of sustainable financing and investment by 2025, supporting clean energy and projects that implement the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It also signed up to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure, meaning it will describe in its annual reports its strategy for handling climate change. The EIB, which made a $100bn commitment two years ago for climate finance in the years 2016 to 2020, is on track for that, with \'e2,\£c19bn lent in 2016. Counting the billions A third, and more controversial, $100bn is the promise made by rich countries at the Copenhagen summit in 2009. That is the sum they promised to be channelling to developing countries annually by 2020, for climate purposes. How this was to be counted was left vague, and remains a fraught issue. "This is one of the things that have to be discussed by 2018," said Jens Clausen, climate change adviser at Greenpeace in Copenhagen. "There has to be an official counting mechanism." Rich and poor countries disagree on whether the $100bn has to be additional to aid poor countries were already getting; whether it can include loans as well as grants; and whether it can include private sector money. Projects designed to make countries cope with climate change (adaptation), rather than trying to prevent it (mitigation), are often harder to finance. Sea walls and drains do not generate obvious cashflows, unlike wind or solar energy plants. It is widely agreed that the sums needed to fight climate change must be counted in the trillions rather than billions, so the arguments over the $100bn pledge are decried by some as missing the point. But because public sector money can lever in greater volumes of private sector financing, the sum matters.Attracting private money How to mobilise private capital will be the subject of much attention in Bonn. "There are three different, official, finance-related events, designed to increase dialogue with private parties," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy and research at the Principles for Responsible Investment in London. The PRI is attending with a group of investors. Fabian said their message to governments would be that they should come up with well defined plans for meeting their Paris commitments, and make investment plans that flowed from those. Detailed proposals "that can be turned into investment assets and opportunities is the key issue from our perspective," he said. Taylor said: "By and large, countries don't produce great long lists of things and say "~here we are, come and invest'." The process tended to be more interactive, he said. But he agreed with the thrust of Fabian's aspiration. "I think that what one would hope for is a clear indication from countries of what they are intending to do about taking forward their operations, and on the back of that coming up with projects for people to invest in over the period ahead," Taylor said. Investors and bankers often say there is no shortage of capital for green projects "" as for other investment needs "" on the contrary: what capital needs is to be shown more deals. Stephen Yeats, head of fixed income beta solutions for Asia Pacific and EMEA at State Street Global Advisors, said at the IMN Green Bonds conference in London last week that State Street had been frustrated by the low supply of green bonds and their lack of difference from ordinary bonds. State Street was keen to see more deals in which the green element gave a differentiated risk/return profile, such as project finance.Making projects palatable However, many bond investors, including those that buy green bonds, can only buy investment grade, benchmark size, listed bonds from OECD countries. Bridging this gap is a central challenge of climate finance. "We think there is still fairly limited awareness among most country parties about how best to leverage private capital," said Fabian. "So we spend most of our time at these meetings, and in meetings between the COPs, talking about how it works and what our role could be." In particular, he added: "Some of the [public] funding goes, not enough of it, into derisking and co-investment structures. We've always seen that as a key part of attracting private capital." Banks themselves, including development banks, are such derisking structures, since they put savers' money to work in loans, using their own capital to absorb losses. But there is a place for more targeted structures. The EIB sees itself as "the crowding in bank", which specialises in bringing private capital along with it. It very rarely finances more than 50% of a project's cost, and on average only about a third. The rest often comes from private sources. It is about to launch its second GEEREF (Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund), with an investment from the Green Climate Fund. This is a fund-of-funds, advised by the EIB, which invests in private equity funds that focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in emerging markets. The first GEEREF was launched in 2008 with \'e2,\£c112m of funding from the EU, Germany and Norway, and raised another \'e2,\£c100m from private investors by 2015. The EIB has estimated that this \'e2,\£c222m could flow, with other private capital, into projects totalling more than \'e2,\£c10bn. Such a multiplier effect is also at the heart of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, launched in 2014. It has now approved \'e2,\£c47.4bn of financing, which together with co-investments in the same projects adds up to \'e2,\£c240.9bn of investment. Fabian said there were various co-investment funds from organisations such as the World Bank, Asian and Inter-American Development Banks and EIB. "We are looking for more support from country parties for these funds," he said. "We want to see more of that. We observe some of the historical tensions between emerging economies and some of the development finance institutions, but the private investors take some comfort when the DFIs are involved, so there is a need for dialogue." \</doc>

A POPULAR holiday destination for Britons could be gone by the end of the century as it continues to sink due to rising sea levels, as world leaders are called to act at the COP23 conference. Getty The Maldives is rapidly sinking and could be gone in the next 80 years The Pacific Islands contain some of the famous idyllic holiday destinations chosen by Britons for sun and luxury,\~ With sea levels rising dramatically in the past few decades, the islands will suffer the most as they eventually become entirely submerged. Tuvalu could be uninhabitable by 2050, with some islands such as Kiribati being completely gone by 2100. The Pacific island nations have urged leaders around the world to act after the COP23 conference in Germany discussed climate change and implementing the 2015 Paris agreement on global warming. The COP23 The Maldives is a famous destination for honeymooners and families, and this is also at risk of completely disappearing. With the lowest elevation in the world and just an average height of four feet above sea level, this too could be gone in the next century. The Solomon Islands have also been affected, with five of them already having completely sunk. New Zealand has become the first nation to create a new visa category for people who live on the islands, and are a product of island displacement. Getty Pacific Islands has warned that many islands are sinking, threatening the homes of many Professor Tim Flannery, a climate change expert at La Trobe University, told news.com.au: "It's very concerning times, particularly if you live in a small island nation. "Many of those nations are already making agreements to deal with the problem as it develops." He explained further: "As sea water rises it starts to penetrate the freshwater on the land, that's the most immediate threat for a lot of the island. "Beach and coastal erosion and flooding is another threat. With these two factors it's entirely possible within the next 30 years some islands could be rendered uninhabitable." Getty The Maldives is a popular destination for honeymooners, but may not be around in the next decade They aren't the only tourist destinations that could disappear within 50 years.\~ Rising sea levels are also occurring due to glaciers melting as the planet warms up. The famous Columbia Glacier in Alaska is at risk due to the speed in which it is melting.

NICOLA Sturgeon will be among the political leaders to take part in the United Nations climate change conference which begins in Bonn on Monday. The First Minister and Scotland's Environment Secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, will meet represent-atives from other governments as well as scientists, industry groups and environmental campaigners when they travel to the former west German capital during the course of the two-week event. The conference's key objective is to set out how countries can implement the Paris accord to curb climate change - despite Donald Trump's announcing his intention to pull the US out of the agreement. The 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP) will be presided over by Fiji, one of the small island nations particularly vulnerable to the effects of global warming. Researchers say extreme weather like the events of recent months - including hurricanes in the Carib- bean, heatwaves in Europe and flooding in south Asia - will become more frequent as a result of climate change. To prevent catastrophic consequences, they say countries must make concerted efforts to shift the global economy away from fossil fuels. Cunningham said: "The Scottish Government recognises that the need for international collaboration is greater than ever, which is why the First Minister and I will be attending UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] Bonn 23, taking the opportunity to build relations with our international neighbours, and ensure Scotland continues to lead by example in tackling climate change. We believe Scotland and the rest of the developed world has a clear moral duty to ensure our lifestyles do not cause harm to the world's poorest people." Friends of the Earth Scotland will be among a host of environmental groups attending the conference. Head of campaigns Mary Church said: "Current targets are woefully inadequate to stop warming at 2C, let alone the 1.5C that countries most vulnerable to the impacts of global warming need to have any chance of surviving climate chaos. "Rich countries who have done the most to cause the climate crisis are still not cutting emissions fast enough, but a growing global movement is forcing them to start facing up to their responsibility, and take action. Friends of the Earth will use the talks to call for an end to the use of polluting fossils fuels and a rapid and just transition to low-carbon econ-omies around the world. For Scotland this means ramping up ambition in our new climate act to zero emissions by 2040, and plan for a fair shift away from North Sea oil and gas." Trump announced he will pull out of the 2015 accord unless he can an secure a better deal for the US. \</doc>

The avuncular messiah of the modern age loudly bangs a drum for action and words on climate change, spreading his message during a turbulent period of political upheaval including the election of Donald Trump, who lambasted global warming as a "very expensive hoax" and withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord. Like its predecessor, the film incorporates segments from Gore's slideshow lectures, which have been updated with scenes from Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and flooding in Florida, the state which famously denied him the keys to the White House in the 2000 presidential election against George W Bush. There's no sense of lip-smacking schadenfreude as Gore wades through water-logged streets and engages with local dignitaries. Breathtaking footage of the statesman atop a rapidly melting glacier in Greenland are intercut with snappy soundbites that anoint Gore as the lone voice of reason capable of deviating us from self-destruction. Nowhere in the film is this more pronounced than footage from the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where consensus is countered by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He rationalises that the West has enjoyed 150 years of burning fossil fuels and now India should be afforded the same opportunity, not constrained by the prohibitive costs of borrowing to pay for solar power.

Aside from lionising Gore, the sequel is blessed with scenes of undeniable emotional power. His 24-hour reality broadcast on November 13, 2015, in Paris is interrupted by shocking news of suicide bombings and shootings in the French capital, including an assault on the Bataclan theatre during a concert by the Eagles Of Death Metal.

At least 15 countries have joined an alliance against coal use at the ongoing United Nationsclimate change negotiations taking place in Bonn, Germany. Called the Powering Past Coal, the alliance was started by the UK, Canada, and the Marshall Islands. International climate lead at Christian Aid lead, Mohamed Adow,told Reuters that the alliance is a "rebuke to President Trumpfrom the UK and Canada, two of America's closest allies, that his obsession for dirty energy will not spread". Read more UN chief says time running out to prevent catastrophic climate change Current members also include Denmark, Finland, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Switzerland, New Zealand, Ethiopia, Mexico but the goal is to sign up at least 50 countries by the 2018 UN climate summit. Major coal users like China, the US, Russia, and Germany have not joined. ThoughChina has put forward an ambitious plan for solar energy,as has India. The alliance appears to be a thinly veiled critical response to the current administration of Mr Trump. Climate change might be worse than thought after scientists find major mistake in water temperature readings The announcement comes on the heels of an event the official US delegation - half the size of what it has been in the two previous Obama administrations - held on Monday. Industry representatives from coal, oil/gas, and nuclear power companies like Peabody Energy, nuclear engineering firm NuScale Power, and Tellurian, a liquefied natural gas exporter, were prominently featured during the event. The presentation was interrupted for nearly 10 minutes by youth activists chanting and singing. Activists are a common presence at the UN meeting every year, but this time their ire was in full force opposing the US's starkly different message from the rest of the world, several people attending the meeting told The Independent . During the panel Trump international energy issues adviser George D Banks said it was "controversial only if we chose to bury our heads in the sand". "Without question, fossil fuels will continue to be used, and we would argue that it's in the global interest to make sure when fossil fuels are used that they be as clean and efficient as possible," Mr Banks said. An unofficial US delegation including California Governor Jerry Brown, former Vice President Al Gore, former New York City mayor and UN special envoy on cities and climate change Michael Bloomberg, as well several American mayors and CEOs have been a presence at the meeting as well. They aim to show that sub-national governments and the private sector in the US are committed to meeting the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement under the previous Obama administration. The purpose of the meeting in Bonn is to hash out details of how to implement the accord, signed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015 in an effort to curb carbon emissions and contain global warming to 2C.

In June, Mr Trump announced the US would begin withdrawal procedures from the deal and if uninterrupted the US would be out by 4 November 2020. After previous holdouts Nicaragua and Syria announced they would be joining the accord in recent weeks, the US is the sole country to be in the withdrawal process. \</doc>

A new project is urging people to make five lifestyle changes to combat climate change. Eating less red meat, driving an electric car, holidaying in the UK, insulating your home and installing solar panels are the most important actions you can take to reduce harmful carbon dioxide emissions and benefit your quality of life, according to One Home, a website launched in Somerset this week. The not-for-profit website encourages people to take action on climate change by giving practical solutions. It is the brainchild of Wells-based environmental scientist Angela Terry who has 20 years of experience working in renewables and was one of the first pioneers of community wind farms. Ms Terry said: "The subject of climate change is a difficult one. "Most people accept it is happening but are sometimes confused and overwhelmed by what they can do about it. "Having worked in the green industry for many years, I saw a real need for one platform which brings together accurate, practical information into one place that equips people with the know-how on what they can do to make a difference and how to adapt to climate change. One Home fills this crucial gap. "We want to give options that offer the best quality of life while reducing carbon emissions. Making these choices doesn't mean making sacrifices - in fact, a low carbon lifestyle is healthier, more affordable and more comfortable. "For the biggest impact, it's all about saving energy to reduce carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas that causes climate change - and that's why we've developed these five clear ways to do just that." One Home is being piloted in Somerset and across the Westcountry first before being promoted nationally later this year. The website will include a directory that enables people to find local initiatives and suppliers and people are also being asked to share their actions, via social media or simply by talking about it with others. "The South West is the natural home for this project," Ms Terry said. "Our region has one of the country's best renewable energy resources, including wind and sun, yet research published last year by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology shows that households in the South West emit more carbon emissions than households in any other country in Europe." Sir David King, formerly the UK's climate envoy and the Government's chief scientific adviser from 2000 to 2007, said: "The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris set an objective to ensure the planet does not exceed a 2C temperature rise above the pre-industrial level, and make every effort not to exceed 1.5C. "This will not be possible without raising awareness of the situation. One Home can play a major role in encouraging a vital transformation of consumer habits." \</doc>

The IAEA will lead side events on energy policy, sustainable development, nuclear power and climate change, and the future of the oceans at the Bonn Climate Change Conference, which kicks off today in the western German city. The 23rd Conference of Parties ( COP23 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides a platform for countries to present their strategies for mitigating the effects of a warming planet, including their next steps for implementing the Paris Agreement on climate change. The conference, presided over by the Government of Fiji, runs through 17 November. 'The IAEA will seek to raise awareness among participants and country delegates of the role of nuclear science and technology in addressing climate change, including the resources available at the IAEA to meet their needs,' said David Shropshire, Head of the IAEA's Planning and Economic Studies Section and of the Agency's delegation at COP23 . The IAEA is the focal point of a joint UN side event on 10 November, Energy Policy Trade-Offs within the Broader Sustainable Development Challenge. The event will highlight pathways to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 - access to safe, clean and affordable energy - and support implementation of the Paris Agreement. Speakers at the event will present tools to evaluate the trade-offs and synergies among energy systems, land and water use, and climate change, which require integrated approaches for assessing sustainable-development strategies. The IAEA has been instrumental in developing tools such as Climate, Land, Energy and Water (CLEW), a framework for integrated assessment of resource systems. The IAEA will lead two other events. On 8 November, Connecting Roadmaps for Innovative Nuclear Energy to the NDC Timeline will focus on how nuclear energy innovation can be coupled with the timelines of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) made by countries in committing to the Paris Agreement. Another side event on 15 November will discuss how nuclear power, which accounts for one third of global low carbon energy production, can further contribute to climate change mitigation. 'To meet the targets set out in the Paris Agreement, nuclear power capacity will need to be substantially increased by 2050,' said IAEA Deputy Director General Mikhail Chudakov, Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy. At the 8 November side event, 'panellists will discuss innovations in nuclear energy technologies - the progress, challenges, and enabling conditions to accelerate their development and hopefully, early deployment,' he added. 'The five-year NDC reporting period and time horizons of innovative nuclear power technologies, could be incorporated into energy plans to support carbon reductions.' In addition, the IAEA is the focal point of another joint UN side event on 11 November, Ocean and Climate: A Resilient Ocean for Future Generations. The IAEA will explain how policymakers can make informed decisions on climate change through the use of nuclear science, including in measuring and monitoring ocean acidification, which is profoundly changing seawater chemistry, threatening marine ecosystems and coastal communities. As the focal point for the UN exhibit on Energy, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, focused on SDGs 7 and 9, IAEA staff will also interact with participants on the Agency's work on climate change during the two-week-long COP23 .

November 13, 2017 The urgent need to raise the finances to meet the funding goals of the Paris Agreement, especially to support action by developing countries, took center stage Monday at the UN Climate Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. The urgent need to raise the finances to meet the funding goals of the Paris Agreement, especially to support action by developing countries, took center stage Monday at the UN Climate Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. "We need all financial players - public, private, domestic, international - and including markets and regulators, to work together effectively to mobilize at least $ 1.5 trillion in climate finance that is needed every year," said Eric Usher, Head of Finance Initiative at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). As part of 'Finance for Climate Day' at COP23 , high-level representatives from across the sector highlighted their efforts to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement of keeping the average global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius and as close as possible to 1.5 Celsius. They stressed that every dollar invested in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change gets double the bang for the buck because it directly supports the international community's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. According to the UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat, finance for climate is flowing at a greater pace than ever, with vibrant and growing markets for renewable energy, electric vehicles, green buildings and climate-smart agriculture seeing aggressive growth, backed by exponential advances in innovative green financial instruments, indices and markets. Equally, the finance sector is recognizing to a much greater degree where and how climate change presents risks to its existing investments and the need to adjust their portfolios away from carbon-intensive assets to reduce that risk. However, much more is needed to secure finance and investment at the scale required to deliver a fully de-carbonized and climate-resilient global economy by 2050. "The potential for climate friendly investment in areas such as clean energy and climate-smart agriculture is enormous," said Laura Tuck, Vice-President Sustainable Development at the World Bank. "The key is to get the funding to flow so that everyone everywhere can benefit from low-carbon and climate resilient investments." Peter Damgaard Jensen, CEO of the Danish Pension provider PKA and Chair of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) said at a press conference that "it is extremely important that there is a significant increase of investor awareness and action with regards to supporting the transition [...] to a low carbon economy." "Strong investment signals from policy makers across carbon trading, energy, transport and buildings, are essential to unlock the necessary capital," he added. Members of African civil society and members of Parliament spoke today on the urgency of climate finance as a prerequisite to ambitious action in African countries. "Africa is the continent that pollutes the least," but "it is Africa which suffers the effect of climate change," said at a press conference Roger Nkodo Dang, President of the Pan-African Parliament, which is the legislative body of the African Union. In an interview with UN News, he added that developed countries have a duty to provide additional support to Africans for their green development. "If you tell us 'do not cut the wood,' we say, 'you bring us electricity,'" he said. "It's not a favor; it's a compensation." \</doc>

Deutsche Bahn is taking Germany's government delegation and other guests by special train to the 23rd UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn. 'Germany's government delegation has a tradition of taking environmentally friendly transport to conferences in Europe,' said Chairman of the Management Board and CEO of DB Dr. Richard Lutz today as the ICE 'Train to Bonn' departed from Berlin Central. 'Today we are sending an important message by having our 250 guests travel CO2-free. We have continued to raise our own climate protection targets and step up our efforts since Copenhagen in 2009, in Paris two years ago and now in Bonn in 2017,' he added. The specially branded train, which was sent off on its journey with the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) on board, will be stopping at the new UN Campus station in Bonn. Various discussions about climate protection were scheduled to begin on the train, with guests including Environment Minister Dr. Hendricks and state secretaries Flasbarth and Schwarzeluhr-Sutter taking part. 'Our objective in Bonn is to move global climate protection forward and work on implementing the Paris Climate Accord,' said Environment Minister Dr. Barbara Hendricks. 'But we also want to set green standards when it comes to conference organization. Traveling to the conference on the climate-neutral special train is the perfect way to kick off the event,' she continued. DB recently earned the top climate score of A for its environmental performance in the new 2017 ranking published by the international rating organization CDP. DB is one of only two companies in the rail sector in the world to make it onto CDP's A List. CDP evaluates companies' climate protection activities and the transparency of their reporting and is considered the world's best known list of climate protection ratings. During the journey to Bonn, DB CEO Dr. Lutz and Board Member for Passenger Transport Berthold Huber were scheduled to speak about the new ambitious climate targets DB set ahead of COP23 . DB aims to cut specific greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50% by 2030, which amounts to an absolute reduction of more than two million metric tons of CO2 for train transport in Germany. The Group intends to be entirely CO2-free by 2050. DB Schenker has also set its own specific goals. It wants to be the first major international logistics company to achieve CO2-free growth in the next ten years. It intends to cut specific greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 2006 levels. The UN COP23 is being held from November 6 to 17. Over 20,000 participants are expected. The regional transport company Nahverkehr Rheinland (NVR) and DB Station&Service completed the new UN Campus station ahead of schedule to accommodate as many train travelers as possible. The ICE Train to Bonn is also part of DB's new 'This is green' environmental communication campaign, which was just launched. As part of the campaign, 112 projects - including DB's mobile phone ticket, CO2-free freight transport and DB's own hydroelectric power plants for generating green power - are being published and will be presented at stations and on trains. The campaign is a first, giving DB a compact and diverse way to showcase its green projects.

China\' s top climate official said on Tuesday that preparations for a nationwide emissions trading scheme were  basically complete but he stopped short of giving a date for its launch and warned of the dangers of  excessive investment . Beijing announced two years ago that 2017 would be the year in which it rolled out a national carbon trading scheme that experts believe will become the largest of its type, eclipsing that of the EU. But Xie Zhenhua, Beijing\' s lead negotiator at the United Nations HYPERLINK climate change HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Climate_change conference in Bonn, pointed to several pitfalls associated with China\' s plans even as he hailed its progress. The scheme is intended to reduce carbon emissions by creating a market cost for carbon emitters.  The work to create a national carbon market has won successes and the whole process is going well, Mr Xie said in a speech.  Preparations for the carbon market are basically complete and after approval it can go ahead. Chinese officials and experts in Bonn, who declined to be identified, said that Beijing may miss its original target of launching the scheme this year but may be ready for the inauguration early next year. The expected delay comes after a report this week found that stronger Chinese economic growth would push global greenhouse gas emissions to a record high in 2017 after remaining flat for three years, dashing tentative hopes of a turning point in the world\' s efforts to curb climate change. China is predicted to see a 3.5 per cent jump in emissions in 2017, according to the report by the Global Carbon Project. Mr Xie stuck a cautious tone in describing some of the parameters of the planned trading scheme. He said the scheme would start by trading the carbon of a selected group of companies from  mature industries and then build scale from there. Carbon futures trading will not be available at least at the launch stage of the scheme, he said.  As the activity of the emissions trading scheme continues we intend to avoid excessive investment and development of excessive financial derivatives, he said.  The aim of the spot contract trading will be to reduce carbon, Mr Xie said.  This is our sole aim. Although Mr Xie said that market forces would play a  decisive role in setting prices for carbon traded in the national scheme, he added the qualifier that  the government may also provide some guidance . Chinese climate experts said that one of Beijing\' s greatest concerns was that the scheme could become a casino for speculators, potentially bidding up the price of carbon to levels than punish industry. \</doc>

Chemical Leasing is just one example that it is possible to raise sustainability even within difficult sectors, experts stated at the UN's climate conference Cop23 this week. By Sarah Katz 'It is clear that there is an urgent need to decouple growth from consumption of resources'. This was one of Joachim Schmidtkes, Director, Ramboll Environment & Health, main conclusions at a side event on the sidelines of Cop23 Wednesday afternoon. Here, a dedicated group of professionals from industry, government and private sector gathered to discuss innovative solutions for circular economy and sustainability. In order to move from traditional product cycles to circular ones, the notion of moving from a production model to a performance based model was introduced. Petra Schwager, UNIDO, said:' In chemical leasing, you don't pay for the product itself - rather you pay for the benefit of the product. This means a move from a production model to a performance-based model'. Steffen Secher, founder and director of SafeChem, was a strong example of just this. He introduced his solution for enabling chemical leasing as an alternative to the traditional purchase in e.g. retailing: 'It is chemical leasing in practice, and introduces a new paradigm for sustainability. While sales of chemicals decline, sustainable chemicals solutions increase'. Collaboration is key When it comes to business-to business, the experiences so far show that support and engagement with heavy weight actors such as Ikea, Carrefour and Tesco have worked. Dr. Susanne Czech, Director General, EU, gave examples such as vertical, in-store herb farms and recycling plants, and concluded: 'More ambition and greater collaboration can help us in the transition to the circular economy'. However, Dr. Branko Dunji pointed to the fact that public legislation can also be necessary: 'Government involvement is important, even though you can make a lot of progress working with industry alone.' As a follow-up to the workshop, Ramboll will be producing a publication with main conclusions and findings. Contact: Joachim C.

Private companies can help move city governance from silo thinking to integrated climate masterplanning - with more focus on the people. That was the conclusion at a side event at COP23 . By Sarah Katz and Michael Rothenborg Cities are an important part of the climate problem - but they must also be a part of the solution. That was one of the main conclusions at the panel discussion on 'Sustainable, liveable cities' yesterday at the Sustainable Innovation Forum, at the UN's climate conference COP23 . 'Climate change brings increased temperatures and heavy rainfall to cities, but every climate incident brings opportunity for more liveability', said Neel Strobaek, Group Market Director for Sustainability in Ramboll. Ashok-Alexander Sridharan, Mayor of Bonn, emphasised that coalitions are the key to success: 'Cities and regions are ready to engage with their stakeholders - in particular with private companies' he said. Neel Strobaek agreed, and added that private companies like Ramboll can not only facilitate buildings, infrastructure and smart assets - they can also help move city governance from silo thinking to integrated solutions. Involve the citizens The holistic approach also helps when you involve the citizens - which is something that needs to be done. President of the Assembly of European Regions Magnus Berntsson agreed that cities need to take the lead on climate change. 'It's about the people', he said. Neel Strobaek puts it this way: 'Cities are people. Although having the right technology is a key enabler, taking lead is what moves cities towards solutions. We see this in cities like Copenhagen, Oslo, Gothenburg, Cologne and Melbourne'. Cathy Oke, Councillor and Chair of the Environment Portfolio in the city of Melbourne, agreed: 'Understanding the ecology of the city is about understanding the ecology of water flows and the biodiversity that lies beneath the urban infrastructure, and coupling that with civil society engagement. This is how Melbourne is moving towards sustainability', she said. Neel Strobaek added that biodiversity alone is often not enough: 'Sustainability also needs to be embedded in engineering solutions', she said.

November 10, 2017 As the impact of climate change worsens around the world, United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has called on the global community to redouble efforts to help countries respond to climate shocks, especially the most vulnerable. "I am encouraged to see climate action taking hold, at all scales, at all levels, involving an ever-wider coalition of actors and institutions," said the Secretary-General, at a press stakeout at the UN Headquarters, in New York. "But we need to do more," he underlined. In his remarks, the UN chief said that he will be travelling to Bonn to participate in the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ), where, he will urge efforts to accelerate climate action as well as to raise ambition to do more. "The window of opportunity to meet the 2-degree target may close in 20 years or less - and we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve towards 1.5 degrees," he said, noting the need for a further 25 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. Speaking on the need for bolstering finance, Mr. Guterres called for mobilizing the agreed $ 100 billion annually for developing countries, which is crucial to spur action. He also said that in September 2019, he will convene a Climate Summit to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels. "I ask world leaders to show courage in combatting entrenched interests; wisdom in investing in the opportunities of the future; and compassion in caring what kind of world we build for our children," he said. "As a former politician myself, I have no doubt that in today's world, this is the path to progress today and a meaningful legacy for tomorrow." Also at the stakeout, the UN chief informed that before Bonn, he will visit the Philippines to attend the UN-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Summit, and after participating at COP23 , he will deliver an address at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) University of London on counter-terrorism and human rights on Thursday, 16 November. "As the world responds to modern terrorism, our goal must be to win the fight while upholding our values," he said. \</doc>

This year's climate conference, COP23 , concluded today with steps forward to ensure global climate action through implementation of the Paris Agreement. Nearly 200 countries gathered at COP23 , held in Bonn under the presidency of Fiji. The parties made concrete progress on turning the historic 2015 agreement into action on the ground across the world, ahead of next year's UN climate conference in Katowice, Poland. The Paris Agreement sets out a global framework for climate action and the necessary transition to a low-carbon future in order to limit global warming to well below 2-degreeC. Under the Paris Agreement the EU has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% till 2030 (1990 level). As stated by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in his 2017 State of the Union address, the EU wants to remain the global leader in the fight against climate change. To re-affirm this commitment to ambitious climate action, President Juncker will lead the Commission delegation at the 'One Planet Summit' to be hosted by the French President Emanuel Macron, the United Nations and the World Bank in Paris on 12 December. Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy Miguel Arias Canete said: 'The spirit of Paris is very much alive. We achieved progress in Bonn on the issues that were important to the EU, such as the Paris Work Program. But we must continue to build on this momentum in the coming months, because there is still a lot of work ahead of us before we meet in Katowice next year. The main objective must be to keep the world firmly on the path towards what was agreed two years ago in Paris.' The EU again had a central role in brokering agreements during the two-week climate negotiations. As a sign of climate leadership the EU announced on Thursday that it intends to deposit the ratification instruments of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol by the end of this year. The Doha Amendment concerns the second period of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires parties to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020. The EU has already exceeded its 2020 targets in 2016 by having decreased emissions by 23%. The decision to swiftly ratify the Doha Amendment demonstrates our commitment to the international climate action and shows that the EU makes good on its promises. Concrete steps forward were also taken on the work program for implementing the Paris Agreement. Clarity on the design of the so called 'Talanoa Dialogue' (Facilitative Dialogue) has been achieved looking at how global climate action can be accelerated in the years to come. The Facilitative Dialogue next year will be the opportunity for political stock-taking for the parties on progress made on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. COP23 also brought outcomes on a number of other key issues: Facilitative (Talanoa)Dialogue The design of the Talanoa Dialogue has been agreed here in Bonn to set a firm base for ambitiously accelerating global efforts to tackle climate change. The Dialogue will provide a space to showcase progress and share best practice in tackling climate change, with contributions from every corner of society. Pre-2020 ambition The discussions on pre-2020 ambition concluded with an agreement on a decision text which foresees two stocktaking exercises on pre-2020 implementation and ambition to take place at COP24 and COP25. The EU has already exceeded its 2020 target by having decreased emissions by 23% in 2016. Furthermore, the EU and its Member States remain the biggest donors of climate finance to developing countries with a contribution of EUR20.2 billion in 2016. Loss and damage The parties agreed on a substantive decision text. They worked out a compromise proposal that takes into account asks from the vulnerable and small islands while keeping a balance with what had been already agreed. An expert dialogue will be organised in May 2018 to enhance the support for Loss and Damage. Gender Action Plan The COP23 agreed on the first Gender Action Plan under the Convention, a priority for the Fijian presidency. The EU actively supported this action and many Member States invested efforts at the highest level in getting this initiative through. Indigenous Peoples' Platform The Parties agreed on the functioning of the local communities and indigenous peoples' platform, which was established at COP21 in Paris. Again the EU played an important role in securing the outcome. Next steps Ahead of the next UN climate conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018, the EU will play an active role in a number of key high-level climate events, starting with the 'One Planet Summit' in Paris next month. Next year, the EU will also host the second Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) together with Canada and China, in Brussels, and takes part in the 2018 Petersberg Climate Dialogue, as well as preparatory UN climate meetings in Bonn and Katowice ahead of COP24. The release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on global warming of 1.5 celsius ahead of Katowice will be an important source of information for discussions under the Talanoa Dialogue.

September 4, 2017 DAO IPCI protocol aiming at global green economy blockchainization has announced the presale of Mitigation Token (MITO) starting September 11, 2017. Green finance markets are gaining momentum across the globe providing economic solution to environmental and climate crisis. Carbon market for example is projected to become largest commodity market valuing at $ 10 trillion. However, existing initiatives are highly fragmented. Mitigation Token was designed to unite global green finance markets by acting as exchange vehicle allowing to monetize all types of environmental assets. MITO is based on the DAO IPCI protocol that has been in place since early 2017 pioneering the world's first carbon credit transaction on blockchain. DAO IPCI international team was officially invited to the UN Climate Change Conference COP23 where its detailed proposal to blockchainize the Paris Agreement will be studied. Initial Coin Offering of MITO will be announced in November at one of COP23 events. By participation in MITO presale, you will help to establish a Swiss-based international NGO aiming at accelerating green economy by further development of a universal framework for easy monetization of clean technologies and mitigation programs. DAO IPCI public blockchain ecosystem will grow with the booming green economy, which is recognized globally as a key to Planet's sustainable future. Anton Galenovich, DAO IPCI Team Leader: "The platform developers' idea is to providecommon space for fair competition, provide early crediting, offsetting carbonfootprint opportunities for the companies, and break the barriers dividing marketand types of high quality mitigation outcomes. We owe thefuture to our children, and we can contribute to it on our own free choice now, track our contributions and even benefit". Sergey Lonshakov, DAO IPCI Lead IT Developer: "DAO IPCI is an example of the correctand logical use of the public blockchain technology.

This coming week I will be at the UN climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, where - alongside hundreds of other committed campaigners and politicians - we will be jointly working out the best way to cut our carbon emissions. I'm enormously proud to be attending COP23 as the UK's climate change minister. We, in the UK, can count ourselves as world leaders on clean growth. Since 1990 our carbon emissions have fallen more than any other nation in the G7 and our national income has risen faster per person. Our low-carbon economy is booming and analysis by the committee on climate change estimates that this sector could grow by 11 per cent a year from now until 2030 - which means up to two million more UK jobs in only 13 years. Our clean growth strategy, published last month, set out how over \£32.5 billion will be invested to support low-carbon innovation in the UK between 2015 and 2021. This is part of the largest increase in public spending on science, research and innovation in over three decades, and we will build on this with our modern industrial strategy which is due to be published shortly. So our leadership in this area is being noticed around the world. But don't just take my word for it. This week there will be nearly 50 events at the UK Pavilion in Bonn to promote Britain's world-beating contribution to climate solutions. Indeed we will launch, alongside Canada, a new global alliance to power past coal - a group of countries committed to phasing out unabated power production from coal. For a country like the UK, which built its industrial prosperity on coal, to be among the first to phase it out is a strong signal to send to the world. At COP23 With a potential audience of more than 40,000 delegates, UK businesses will be highlighting how they are taking advantage of the opportunities that clean growth brings. But COP23 If anything, I want to accelerate the momentum we saw when Paris was first signed. The timing is right. Just this month, the Climate Science special report found it was "extremely likely" that humans were the main cause of global warming over the last half-century. Scientists the world over are now unequivocal about the real and present danger we face from climate change. They have pointed out that much more needs to be done to implement the Paris agreement - and they are entirely right. This COP is crucial in forming consensus among countries about the rules that underpin the Paris agreement. These rules will be finalised next year at COP24 in Poland. Left unchecked, climate change will ravage our natural environment, both at home and abroad. We can be proud that internationally, we are regarded so highly, particularly in the fields of green finance, low carbon vehicles and offshore wind. Just last week, we had further proof of our global leadership on green finance. Barclays announced it was issuing a green bond - the first for the UK market, and the first green bond issued by a UK bank, using UK assets. Now is the time for us to show other countries how they can expand their economies while reducing their emissions but, most importantly, for us to accelerate global action on climate change and deliver the commitments agreed in Paris two years ago to create a safer, more prosperous future for us all.Claire Perry is the climate change minister \</doc>

Pope Francis has denounced "shortsighted human activity" for causing global warming and rising sea levels, and urged world leaders atclimate talks in Germany to act in tackling heat-trapping emissions. The pontiff spoke out as he met a delegation of Pacific leaders in the Vatican and told them he shares their concerns about rising sea levels and increasingly intense weather systems that are threatening their small islands. He decried in particular the state of oceans, where overfishing and pollution by plastics and micro-plastics are killing fish stocks and sea life that are critical to Pacific island livelihoods. Read more Pope Francis bans sale of cigarettes at the Vatican History's first Latin American pope has often spoken out against global warming and the impact it has in particular on poor and indigenous peoples. Praise Be, his landmark 2015 encyclical (a type of letter concerning Catholic doctrine), denounced how wealthy countries exploit the poor, risking turning God's creation into an "immense pile of filth". The Pacific leaders praised the encyclical for drawing attention to those most vulnerable to climate change, including residents of small Pacific islands for whom rising sea levels pose an existential threat. US 'should be kicked out of UN climate talks because of Trump' Trump is not invited to our next climate change summit, says France Syria signs Paris Agreement leaving US only country to refuse deal The president of Nauru, Baron Waqa, told Pope Francis that Pacific island leaders would urge negotiators at Bonnto uphold the Paris climate accord, where governments made commitments to keep global temperature rise this century below 2Cabove pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C. Mr Waqa warned that the 1.5C-rise was a crucial threshold: "There only remains a few years before we exceed carbon dioxide levels that will make temperature rise to levels that will see many parts of the Pacific disappear," he said. Pope Francis told the Pacific leaders that he hoped the Bonn talks would take their plight into consideration, and look for a shared strategy to confront the "grave problems" facing the environment and oceans.

Greenpeace's ( HYPERLINK http://www.Greenpeace.com www.Greenpeace.com ) ship, the Esperanza was barred on Tuesday from berthing at the port of Pointe Noire in the Republic of Congo. For two days, the ship had anchored in Congolese waters. But port and government officials in Pointe Noire refused her to berth, claiming no prior knowledge about the ship's arrival and planned activities in Congolese territory. A claim rebuked by Greenpeace Africa and its local partners which had filed all necessary documents for the ship to berth in Congo. The Esperanza has been on a month-long tour of the coast of Central Africa to raise awareness about the importance of the Congo Basin forest. With a name tag of "Give the Congo Basin forest a chance," the ship has toured Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) urging environmental stakeholders to safeguard and sustainably manage the Congo Basin forest which is the second largest rainforest in the world. "We are deeply disappointed by the shrinking liberal space available to Congolese civil society organisations and their partners to have a frank exchange about environmental conservation," said Victorine Che, Greenpeace Africa Forest Project Leader. "The refusal to allow our ship berth in the Republic of Congo will only spur us to continue our role as an environmental watchdog and deepen our collaborative efforts with local and indigenous communities whose livelihoods depend on the forest," added Che. The Congo Basin forest is the second largest rainforest in the world after the Amazon. The forest serves as a vast carbon sink which needs to be preserved. Scientists recently discovered the world's most extensive tropical peatlands in the DRC and Republic of Congo swamps which are believed to store some 30 billion metric tonnes of carbon. Protecting these precious forest resources is only possible if both countries collaborate with civil societies and local communities. However, industrial agriculture and logging pose a massive threat to the peats. "So many indigenous people who travelled from far and wide to participate in the ship tour activities in Pointe Noire are disappointed by the government's action," said Sylvie N. Banga, Coordinator of the Platform for Sustainable Forest Management; a grouping of national organisations in Congo. "We also envisioned discussing the forest revision text and its implementation to protect local and indigenous people," added Banga. The government of the Republic of Congo has been mobilising neighbouring countries under the Congo Basin Blue Fund initiative, to demonstrate leadership on Congo Basin forest issues. The same government prevented Greenpeace Africa, civil societies and local and indigenous communities from meeting to discuss forest conservation issues on board the Esperanza. These meetings had as main purpose to address issues related to forest governance in the country, and challenges associated to the rights of forest-dependent communities. "This is contradictory. One country cannot, on one hand, want to go to COP 23 in Bonn with the objective of demonstrating leadership on environmental issues with the Congo Basin Blue Fund, and on the other, restrict the right of association of NGOs to raise awareness on the importance of Congo Basin forest," said Christian Mounzeo, President of the national organisation: Rencontre pour la Paix et les Droits de l'Homme (RPDH) in Pointe Noire. "It is regrettable for the Congolese NGOs and communities who showed up to welcome the Esperanza at Pointe Noire," concluded Mounzeo. The month-long ship tour of Central Africa by Esperanza started in prelude to the COP23 climate meeting in Bonn, Germany. People in the Congo Basin region used a wish tree on board the ship as a medium to amplify the concerns of local communities that depend on the forest nationally and internationally during the upcoming Bonn meeting. Local communities and indigenous people in Cameroon and DRC also used this tree to send their ecological wishes to world leaders scheduled to meet later this month in Germany.

THE 23rd meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP23 ) is about to begin in Bonn, Germany. If this information fails to set your pulse racing, you're not alone. Which is a problem, given that these are the blockbuster events dedicated to the issue. What's worse is that they may be creating a more relaxed attitude among the public towards taking action. This was shown by a survey in Germany before, during and after the "historic" Paris UN conference in 2015. It found that rather than catalysing concern, citizens became less inclined to push for a leading role for Germany in climate politics. And despite reports on the summit reaching them, Germans were no more likely to want to cut their carbon use after the event. Researchers blame a lack of "context" in coverage, saying it often omits analysis of the wider meaning of such conferences. Germans may have assumed work on climate change was being taken care of, with no clear role for themselves. This chimes with research I'm involved in at UK non-profit organisation Climate Outreach on the image the public gets of these UN events. Despite the many ways in which climate change affects us \- health, homes, food, travel \- coverage is very literal, dominated by anonymous negotiators inside the conference, or stage-managed protests outside. Such images don't resonate with most people. That requires showing "ordinary" people being affected by, or responding to, climate change. Blockbuster UN climate events may create a more relaxed attitude when it comes to public action There is a wider problem here. It is the assumption, held by campaigners and politicians, that massive, technocratic climate change events will automatically catalyse public engagement. They won't. More than factual detail on science or policies, it is our own values, and the views of those in our social networks, that shape how we think about this subject and what it means for us. Politicians and campaigners must realise that we can't expect events like COP23 to communicate themselves. As the German study shows, grandstanding on the political stage may even backfire. Because media coverage \- and by extension public attention \- is fleeting, the UN conferences are precious chances for engagement that must not be missed.

Taipei, Taiwan, - Following the pioneering sponsorship in 2013 of the first Taiwanese aerial film 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above' by the professional team of director Po lin Chi, the Delta Electronics Foundation, which has long been focusing on climate and energy issues, continues to play the role of a modest inducer four years later. In addition to providing funds for the early shooting of 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above II' and organizing follow-up welfare promotion activities, the Foundation is also calling on the public to support this environmental care and education-related film so that it can make it to the big screen. Ms. Shan-shan Guo, executive director of the Delta Electronics Foundation, remarked, at the film's kickoff shooting press conference, 'Even before the first 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above', our Foundation had already collaborated with director Po-lin Chi several times by promoting environmental education through film sponsorships, physical exhibitions, public broadcasts, tours to rural areas, book publications and related initiatives. Moreover, during Delta's participation in the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) in Paris at the end of 2015, in which we were invited to the German Pavilion to share our corporate experience on energy conservation, the overwhelming images of 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above' not only portrayed the challenges we face on climate change, but also enchanted international guests with the unique natural beauty of Taiwan.' Last year, upon hearing director Po-lin Chi was preparing to shoot 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above II', and that its filming scope would extend beyond Taiwan in an effort to expand international awereness, Delta's founder, Mr. Bruce Cheng, agreed to offer assistance without a second thought. In addition to providing funds to support filming, the sponsorship also includes assistance in promotion of the film as well as Delta's latest laser 4K ultra-high resolution energy-efficient projector so aerial shots by director Po-lin Chi can achieve awe-inspiring results. Screened at the end of 2013, 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above' not only grossed NTD 220 million at the box office in a milestone as one of the most popular documentaries in Taiwan's film history, but also won recognition from the 50th Golden Horse Awards for best documentary, while making an impact on environmental policies at the time. Four years later, Taiwan is still facing environmental challenges from all several dimensions, including air pollution, marine ecology, energy conservation and carbon reduction, the impact of climate change and other factors. The recent decision by the US President Trump to withdraw from the 'Paris Agreement' entails that more environmental challenges will emerge in the foreseeable future. Delta Electronics Foundation looks forward to inspiring ever more citizens to rethink upon our environmental issues through the scenes of natural beauty and stunning visuals of 'Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above II', in hopes of joining the ranks of the fight against climate change.

Jean-Philippe Desmartin, Head of Responsible Investment at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, on what to expect from Emmanuel Macron at this week's climate change summit in Paris The COP23 \~ At the COP23 Will \€  Old Europe\€ succeed in assuming co-leadership with China? Emmanuel Macron has already called for Donald Trump's decision to cease IPCC funding to be symbolically compensated. For the moment, the current political standstill in Germany precludes any pro-active stance from Berlin and thus from Europe. \~ In the meantime, one of the tough questions that participants at the December 12 summit will have to grapple with is how to raise the 100bn a year that developed countries promised back in 2015 to pay to the least developed countries from 2020 to help them fund energy transition. The US was at the time supposed to be one of the biggest contributors. How will this shortfall be met, at least until the end of Donald Trump's term of office? The immediate focus will be on reassuring beneficiary countries as they are expecting a sustainable solution to be found. \~ At the same time, the French President could, in a gesture to business interests, put the question of a carbon price floor back on the agenda. A number of countries, investors and economists are in favour of a carbon price signal at EUR30 or USD30 at least.\~ \~ Looking beyond government action, he will probably encourage all stakeholders to acknowledge their responsibilities. Quite a few US states, cities and companies have already said they are willing to continue the fight against global warming even if the White House has backed out. Emmanuel Macron is also expected to encourage investors, most of whom are already fully aware of climate issues, to go further.\~Also, NGOs will be doing their job if they continue to apply pressure so that things really do change from 2020 onwards. offFlag:\~ \</doc>

EMMANUEL Macron and Angela Merkel have taken the lead role in a world climate change event - with one expert heralding it as a "perfect opportunity" to show they can lead Europe together. GETTY Merkel and Macron at COP23 - it was seen as perfect opportunity to lead Europe COP23 climate conference in Bonn is the chance for the French and German leaders to show they can 'lead Europe,' says a leading charity. The pair were pictured ahead of today's speeches\~ The UN-led climate change conference is the 'perfect opportunity' for France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel to show the rest of the world that they are the 'de facto' leaders of the European Union, and to position themselves as the bloc's climate champions, a spokesperson for the international charity Oxfam said on Wednesday. Armelle Le Comte, a climate and energy campaigner for Oxfam France, said: "The climate change summit in Bonn is a golden opportunity for both Mrs Merkel and Mr Macron, because it is their chance to shine and to show the rest of the world that the renewed Franco-German partnership is both dynamic and ambitious, especially when it comes to tackling climate change. Related articles Merkel's key ally Weber to give crushing Brexit message to May Merkel LIED to Germany! Yanis Varoufakis blasts chancellor over banks "They both need to show their counterparts that they are equally determined to tackle the climate change threat head on in 2018, and that France and Germany can lead the EU's clean energy transition." Representatives from nearly 200 countries convened in Bonn, Germany, last week in a bid to bolster the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which suffered a massive blow after Donald Trump announced in June that he was pulling the US - the world's second-biggest polluter - out of the landmark deal. The representatives, including the French president and the German chancellor, will also work on a detailed rule book for the historic climate deal, including details of how to report and check all participating nations' greenhouse gas emissions, and how to encourage world leaders to step up their Paris climate pledges by 2020. The Paris climate deal seeks to limit a rise in temperatures to below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, ideally to 1.5. In addition to Mrs Le Comte's push for climate change action, a coalition of 20 French and German NGOs have called for a stronger Franco-German partnership to push for a "sustainable zero-carbon transition at the heart of a renewed European Union". \</doc>

World leaders converged on Germany this week for the COP23 conference and talks over how to slow global warming. Just months after Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Climate accord, forged during the event's previous edition, it promises to be an awkward few days for the American delegation. But it may also put the limelight on another odd-one-out: agriculture. Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return, an investor initiative representing more than $4 trillion of institutional money, reckons the sector is largely behind peers when it comes to cutting its contribution to climate change. In a note issued in anticipation of COP23 , the group points out that not a single OECD country has a plan in place to reduce livestock emissions, despite farm animals being responsible for 14.5 percent of all greenhouse gas released in the atmosphere. In analysis published alongside its warning, FAIRR argues that the 10 developed countries with the worst-offending agricultural sectors generate emissions equivalent to burning 1.6 billion barrels of oil or about the amount of black stuff produced by Iraq in the whole of last year. This, FAIRR argues, exposes investors to significant risks. As the effects of extreme climate become ever more tangible, the group believes the shift toward more sustainable protein sources may be sudden rather than orderly. Institutions attracted by the sizeable returns on offer in the meat industry could be wrong-footed, just like those that snapped up oil equities ended up bitten by the retreat of large pensions from assets linked to fossil fuels. As FAIRR director Maria Lettini told us this week, investors should think about the problem before the value of their portfolio takes a knock. It's hard to disagree with FAIRR's diagnosis. Other influential market players agree that the industry is late to the sustainability game: as far as climate change is concerned, "agriculture cannot continue to be the odd one out," World Bank risk expert Marc Sadler told us last month. Developed countries need to incentivize operators and their backers to move toward more carbon-efficient production methods, for example by paying closer attention to what cattle feed on. But the parallel FAIRR makes between the fate of fossil fuels and that of meat production is not perfect. What ended up punishing holders of oil-related assets is a complex mix of forces, including slowing consumption in the West, a glut in crude, increased competition from shale gas and the rise of renewables. The dynamic is different in the animal protein sector. Global meat consumption is growing fast, there's no worldwide oversupply and protein alternatives, while on the up, are not yet in a position to dictate pricing for the whole category. For investors, FAIRR's warning may be more prescient on the early-mover opportunity than the threat side. As Lettini told us, "energy and transport were the first movers, agriculture is next in line." Investors that spot promising innovations healthy grain feed, say, or new, lower-emission breeds may well find themselves ahead of the pack.

At the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is being held in Bonn (Germany), ACCIONA has urged companies to make a determined shift towards decarbonising their production models. 'By participating in this summit, ACCIONA encourages other companies to adopt its carbon-neutral approach,' said Joaquin Mollinedo, General Manager of Institutional Relations, Sustainability and Brand at ACCIONA. 'In the working groups and high-level meetings in which the company is participating, we are also promoting a CO2 pricing system that serves as an incentive to decarbonise the economy.' ACCIONA presented its approach to reducing and offsetting emissions, which has enabled it to achieve carbon neutrality since 2016. The company also detailed how the effort to minimise emissions and offset those inherent in its activity has served as a lever to improve its business and drive innovation. ACCIONA also insisted on the importance of the Bonn Summit making progress towards standard, transparent procedures for measuring and assessing the degree of compliance with the commitments acquired under the Paris Agreement, which was adopted at COP21 in Paris in 2015. ACCIONA also reiterated its support for creating market mechanisms that facilitate the decarbonisation of the economy, especially carbon pricing, in line with decisions already made by the European institutions. During 'Transport Day', organised as part of COP23 , the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group, of which ACCIONA has been a member since 2009, released a report entitled 'Electric avenue: The future of road transport in Europe', in which the company describes some best practices in the area of sustainable highways. ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES The ACCIONA Microenergy Foundation, which channels ACCIONA's community outreach work to promote access to basic services, was also on site at COP23 . In the international encounter entitled 'PPP's for development and achievement of the Paris Agreement goals'the Foundation presented the 'Electricity at Home Oaxaca' project as a success story, since it has provided electricity to 7,500 households in isolated rural areas of Oaxaca (Mexico) using photovoltaic solar panels. The programme is an example of public-private partnership for development since it involves the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) and the Mexican Agency for International Development Cooperation (AMEXCID).

The IAEA's annual publication on energy and electricity projections show that nuclear power's global potential up to 2050 remains high, although its expansion is expected to slow in coming years. The newly released 37th edition of Energy, Electricity and Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2050 (Reference Data Series No. 1 (RDS-1)) documents these trends in detail by region. Projections are presented as low and high estimates, reflecting different driving factors that have an impact on nuclear power deployment. Interest in nuclear power remains particularly strong in the developing world, the publication highlights. However, compared with the 2016 projections for 2030, the 2017 projections were reduced by 45 GW(e)[1] by 2030 in both high and low cases. Over the short term, the low price of natural gas, the impact of renewable energy sources on electricity prices, and national nuclear policies in several countries following the accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 are expected to affect nuclear growth prospects. Yet, commitments agreed to at the 21st session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) could have a positive impact on nuclear energy development in the future. The high projections indicate an increase from 2016 levels by 42% in 2030, by 83% in 2040 and by 123% in 2050. The low projections, on the other hand, indicate a decline in capacity by 12% in 2030 and 15% in 2040, before rebounding to present levels by 2050. The wide range in these projections is also due to the considerable number of reactors scheduled to be retired around 2030 and beyond, particularly in North America and Europe, and whether new nuclear capacity would be built to replace these retirements. The leading influential factors that might affect the future of nuclear power are discussed in detail in the recent IAEA report on International Status and Prospects for Nuclear Power 2017. Regional Trends Northern America: In both low and high cases, nuclear electricity production is expected to change significantly in this region over the next two decades. Latin America & the Caribbean: Nuclear electricity production is projected to increase in both low and high cases, but its role will remain small in the coming decades. Northern, Western and Southern Europe: Several countries in these regions have announced a phase-out of nuclear power. The regions' nuclear power capacity will therefore change significantly in the coming years. Eastern Europe: Nuclear electricity production is projected to continue to grow in both low and high cases, albeit at different rates. Africa: In the low case, nuclear electrical generating capacity is projected to stay at the present level of 2 GW(e) until 2030 and to increase to 7 GW(e) by 2050. The development of nuclear power is expected to face uncertainty. Western Asia: Although the single nuclear power reactor in the region provided only 2 TWh in 2016, nuclear electricity production is expected to increase significantly in both the low and high cases. Southern Asia: The existing nuclear power reactors in the Southern Asia region are relatively young, and the majority are expected to remain in operation until the middle of the century. Nuclear electricity production is projected to continue to grow in both the low and high cases. Central and Eastern Asia: Nuclear electrical generating capacity is projected to increase significantly in both low and high cases. South-eastern Asia: Nuclear electricity will appear in the electricity production mix of this region only after 2030.

As Trump announced his controversial decision to withdraw from the international agreement, Weather.com started posting articles about the impact of global warming.\~ Around 4pm, the homepage led with a 'LIVE BREAKING' main story about the decision, followed by eight follow-up stories warning of the environmental consequences of Trump's decision. Another article, 'Antarctica Turning Green,' contains a brief video which shows the 500 per cent increase in moss growth in Antarctica over 50 years, and cites climate change as the reason for all the green. Possibly the most to-the-point article is titled '...and Even More Proof...' and contains a list of statistics to show the devastating effects of climate change just in the state of Minnesota.   'Sad Day': Global Reacts to Trump's Decision So, What Happens to Earth Now?\~ Still Don't Care? Proof You Should ...and More Proof...   ...and Even More Proof   ...Or the Imminent Collapse of a Key Ice Shelf... ...Or Antarctica Turning Green... Or California's Coast Disappearing Into the Sea... \~ Trump made his \~announcement around 3pm on Thursday afternoon at the White House Rose Garden.\~ During the announcement, he said he would be willing to consider re-entering the accord if his administration can renegotiate terms in a way he would consider more fiscally beneficial for the United States.\~ Hailed as a significant achievement by many climate scientists, it is a worldwide agreement signed by 195 countries aimed at reducing greenhouse gasses and investing $100million each year to help fight the numerous impacts of climate change around the world. Trump's predecessor President Barack Obama released a statement during the address and condemned the decision, saying Trump's withdrawal makes the United States one of £ small handful of nations that reject the future.' The Paris Climate Accord is the first large-scale global agreement to combat climate change. It came together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and was adopted on December 12.\~ On Earth Day 2016, it was opened for signatures and gained enough to enter into force by November 4, 2016, four days before Trump won the presidential election.\~ During his announcement, President Trump cited American jobs and the environment as reasons he would be pulling out of the agreement. He said major polluters like China are allowed to increase their emissions under the agreement in a way the United States cannot, calling it unfair, and said it was more about allowing other countries to gain financial advantages over the United States than about helping the environment. \</doc>

An interactive tool for tracking pumped storage hydropower projects worldwide has been launched by the International Hydropower Association (IHA) at COP23 climate conference. The new Hydropower Pumped Storage Tracking Tool maps the locations and vital statistics of existing and planned projects. According to the tool, more than 100 pumped storage hydropower projects totalling some 75GW of new capacity are in the pipeline around the world - with these set to increase existing global storage capacity by 50%, from 150GW to almost 225GW. The first of these projects will come on line in 2018, and the majority will be operational by 2030. The Hydropower Pumped Storage Tracking Tool is designed for policy-makers, investors and researchers. It shows the status of a pumped storage project, its installed generating and pumping capacity, and its actual or planned date of commissioning. "This tracking tool is the most comprehensive online resource of its kind. It shines a light on the enormous contribution of pumped storage to meeting the battery demands of clean energy systems, with very high efficiency," commented Richard Taylor, Chief Executive of the IHA, announcing the tool at the conference in Bonn, Germany. \</doc>

2017 is set to be one of the hottest three years on record, provisional data suggests, confirming yet again a warming trend that scientists say bears the fingerprints of human actions. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said temperatures in the first nine months of this year were unlikely to have been higher than 2016, when there was a strong El Ni\'f1o weather system, but higher than anything before 2015. Related: The COP23 climate change summit in Bonn and why it matters He said further detailed scientific studies would be carried out, but that it was already possible to say many "bear the tell-tale sign of climate change" caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations from human activities, such as burning fossil fuel and deforestation. This recent increase in average global temperatures confirms a renewed warming trend in recent years, which had slowed its pace slightly in the previous decade, leading some climate sceptics to claim global warming had "paused". The results were revealed to delegates at the UN's global climate talks being held in Bonn, Germany, this week and next. The COP23 talks, a follow-up to the landmark Paris agreement of 2015, will focus on a new process by which countries' pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions can be toughened, in line with scientific advice. Current pledges would, according to estimates, leave the world 3C warmer than in pre-industrial times. At that level, sea levels would rise, heatwaves and droughts would become more common in large swathes of the globe, and fiercer storms and floods would become more likely. Patricia Espinosa, the UN's climate chief, said the talks showed "unprecedented momentum", but warned of the consequences of failure. Recent research also found that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are now higher than they have been for 800,000 years. Scientists reacted with concern to the WMO's findings, which are still provisional and only cover January to September. Martin Siegert, co-director of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College, London, said: "The state of our climate is being reset by humans. What were once one-in-a-hundred-year events are now turning into regular events. We see this in terms of extreme weather impacts, with examples from the south of the US this year. For the future we can expect more of the same." Richard Betts, professor of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: "We expect developing countries to be hit the hardest in terms of human impact. Flooding will be a particular threat in south Asia, particularly due to increased rainfall and rising sea levels, and partly because of the large and growing numbers of people who have little choice about being in harm's way." \</doc>

December 17, 2017 RABAT, Morocco -- 2017 is ending with a flurry of activities across key global agendas, none more important than new models for action that integrate issues of Climate Change with the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. The mobilization of global climate actions in Bonn, Germany, which hosted the COP23 , November 6th - 17th, provided a unique opportunity for UCLG Africa to highlight activities that have made African local governments, cities and territories an important global partner in the drive to achieve long term goals set by the Paris Agreement. During COP23 we took stock of our achievements and contributions, which included headline declarations that clearly laid out our commitment to climate action and partnerships that have showcased and provided real solutions for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. "UCLG Africa has a responsibility to its members to report on climate change issues across the continent to help local and subnational governments understand the immediacy of the threat and how to localize, adapt and mitigate." The Cotonou Declaration set in Benin, September 8-10, 2016( HYPERLINK http://APO.af/9d1PTn http://APO.af/9d1PTn HYPERLINK http://APO.af/e81XNV http://APO.af/e81XNV "Reaffirming our adherence and support to the recent commitments and declarations of local and subnational leaders concerning the climate, in particular: The Declaration of the Summit of Cities and Regions of Africa in Yamoussoukro (June 2015); the Declaration of the World Summit of Climate and Territories in Lyon (July 2015); the Declaration of the Summit of World Local and Regional Leaders on Climate in Paris (December 2015); the Declaration of Local and Regional elected leaders of Africa at the preparatory Forum of COP 22 held in Cotonou (September 2016); the Marrakesh Roadmap for Action and Regions for Climate (Nov 2016)". "To date, commitments of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to fight global warming remain insufficient to meet the target set by the Paris Agreement." Beyond these declarations there are a wealth of activities taking place at the grass roots level across the continent, which we are showcasing in our Special Climate Change Newsletter( \~ HYPERLINK http://APO.af/L3T9md http://APO.af/L3T9md COP23 . Whilst declarations are important and can be significant for local and regional governments in demonstrating their stance and showing their commitment to the Paris Agreement, it is important to determine what real impact is being made on the ground. Where is the practical support for adaption that can be shared with others? What support is available to develop the capacity of stakeholders to access finance for innovative bankable solutions for some of the most vulnerable communities in the world? Accompanying the climate transition of African cities and territories by mobilizing climate finance The ambition of these declarations must be inclusive and matched with practical support. It is with this in mind that UCLG Africa has established partnerships that bring together non-state actors - that is, cities and other subnational authorities, civil society, private sector, financial institutions, local communities and indigenous peoples, to play a critical role in implementing these commitments made by the international community. The mobilization of this wider group and their capacity to contribute to the process is the focal point of the UCLG Africa Climate Task Force, which was launched in Bonn on Tuesday, November 14, 2017 under the chairmanship of His Excellency Mr. Barnab\'e9 Dassigli, Minister of Decentralization and Local Governance of Benin and Chairman of the Specialized Technical Committee N\'b0 8 of the African Union.

Syria has become a signatory of the Paris climate agreement, leaving the US as the only country in the world not to support the framework deal to combat greenhouse gas emissions. When President Donald Trump announced he intended to pull the US out of the agreement, it initially meant America would join Nicaragua and Syria on a small list of countries who were not part of the deal. The war-torn Middle East nation made the announcement in Bonn, Germany at the COP 23 UN climate summit. Syria is facing the sixth year of a brutal civil conflict, which started with rebel groups fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad and expanded to include a battle against Isis. The Paris accord was signed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015 in an effort to curb global greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius. Until recently Nicaragua was also a holdout nation, but only because the Central American country felt the agreement did not go far enough in putting limits on emissions and helping poorer countries adapt to an already-changed planet with solid financial commitments by wealthier nations. Scientists had confirmed the emissions levels agreed upon by top polluters like the US, EU, China, and India were not low enough to keep sea levels from rising and global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, let alone the recommended and more ambitious goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. However, parties to the deal agreed, it was far superior to having no global climate change agreement at all. Nicaragua has been a haven for renewable energy - more than half of the nation's energy comes from geothermic, wind, solar, and wave energy. They plan on increasing that to a 90 per cent share by 2020. The World Bank called it a "a renewable energy paradise" in 2013. The US was among the first to sign the deal and put it into action under former President Barack Obama's executive order, which bypassed climate change deniers in Congress. But his executive action meant the Paris accord was not a legally binding treaty for the US, and paved the way for Mr Trump to withdraw. In June, he cited that American workers were being put at an "economic disadvantage" by the deal, particularly referring to coal workers. As The Washington Post reported, "the coal industry employed 76,572 people in 2014," the last year US Census data is available for the industry. Following the worldwide, swift, and public backlash Mr Trump faced there was talk of renegotiating the deal; "if we can get a deal, that's great. If not, that's fine," he commented. France, Germany, and Italy immediately announced that renegotiation was not a possibility and the topic is not on the agenda for the next two weeks of meetings in Bonn where countries will hammer out details on how to implement the accord beginning in 2020 when provisions take effect. In fact, Mr Trump did not have to withdraw from the deal at all. Sue Biniaz, former US State Department Deputy Legal Adviser on climate, previously told The Independent that she thinks the joint statement "is driven by the Paris Agreement's careful balancing and accommodation of interests, very much already including those of the US." "There's no legal reason why it couldn't be amended, but I don't think it needs to be amended or 'renegotiated' in order to address the concerns raised by the President," said Ms Biniaz. "The US has the ability to change its own targets," Todd Stern, the Special Envoy on Climate Change during the Obama administration, told The Independent at the time of withdrawal. Domestically, the Paris withdrawal appears to be part of a larger scheme to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations, including the Clean Power Plan which was supposed to be one of the main vehicles for the US to meet Paris targets. If left in place, the CPP would have reduced US power plants' carbon emissions by 2030 to a level 32 per cent lower than they were in 2005. Paula Caballero, Global Director of the Climate Program at Washington DC-based think tank the World Resources Institute said that "with Syria on board, now the entire world is resolutely committed to advancing climate action - all save one country. This should make the Trump administration pause and reflect on their ill-advised announcement about withdrawing." It remains to be seen whether or not this will impact the actions of the US delegation over the next fortnight of talks at COP23 . The White House has said it "will promote coal, natural gas and nuclear energy as an answer to climate change." The goal for the rest of the countries now is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \</doc>

Move from silo mentality towards holistic masterplanning of cost-efficient district heating and integrated energy systems, stated Ramboll's CEO at the World Climate Summit-part of the COP23 climate conference. By Sarah Katz and Michael Rothenborg 'Many solutions contribute to a low-carbon energy transition, but experience shows that you get the best results if your approach is cross-disciplinary'. That was a main conclusion from Ramboll CEO Jens-Peter Saul at today's sessions at the World Climate Summit held in Bonn, in connection with the UN's Climate Conference COP23 : 'We need to move on from a silo mentality towards holistic masterplanning. We need to forge connections between the technical solutions, the governance structure and the social and cultural offerings, if you are to create cities that are sustainable and liveable', Jens-Peter Saul stated. For several years, Ramboll has worked with the city of Copenhagen on cross-disciplinary climate solutions that do not only include for example hydraulic expertise but are also optimised socially, environmentally and economically.This broad sustainability approach has led to New York City choosing Ramboll on a similar climate project in Queens. Jens-Peter Saul participated in the opening ceremony 'Building a New Coalition - The Role of Alliances and Bottom-Up Actions in the New Era of Climate Leadership' - with H.R.H. Princess Abze Djigma from Burkina Faso and Director-General Thorsten Herdan from the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy in Germany among the other participants. A flexible power grid Ramboll's CEO was also key speaker at a Roundtable Discussion with Danish companies Danfoss and Kamstrup on 'How to combat climate change with digitalization and low temperature district heating'. At the roundtable Jens-Peter Saul shared the Danish success story about decarbonisation: Denmark has enabled a green transition while securing continued socio-economic growth, thanks to an increased use of high-efficient district energy among other things. The Greater Copenhagen part of the district heating system now supplies heat to a floor area of more than 70 million m2 - with more than one million citizens connected and a 2025 carbon neutral target. The system is moving towards the 4th Generation District Heating system, fully integrated with the district cooling, thermal storage capabilities and the power system. 'The power grid of the future is very flexible. It will absorb, transmit and distribute heat and power from various sources in most cost effective way, depending on generation and demand, storage capabilities, market prices, the weather, the season and the time of day', Jens-Peter Saul said. Digitalisation raises efficiency Large thermal storages and a huge fleet of heat pumps help optimize the production from fluctuating renewable energy sources in particular. And digitalisation, where distributed energy generation systems in the future, will form 'Energy Cells' that connect to each other and operate like an 'internet of energy' - based on a secure and reliable energy supply. 'So while the Paris Agreement and local climate goals are putting pressure on energy planning, there are also solutions underway that address the issue at scale. And solutions such as these are necessary for countries, regions and cities that are concerned with the big question: how to get on the path to a low-carbon society in the most cost-efficient way - while also taking energy security into account', Jens-Peter Saul pointed out. Jens-Peter Saul was recently awarded 'CEO of the Year' by the leading business association in the engineering sector, ACE (Association for Consultancy and Engineering).

The United Nations convened its latest international global warming conference COP23 in Bonn, Germany under the Presidency of the Government of Fiji, a nation vulnerable to climate change. The key objective of COP23 : To implement the Paris Agreement which became effective in November 2016 - and from which the USA has now withdrawn. At the Paris Agreement, governments have set the challenging target of staying well below two degrees of global temperature increase. Science tells us that this can only be achieved if we reach carbon neutrality by the second half of the century. However, international air transport emissions are not covered by this agreement. Airports which are part of an industry that transports the equivalent of nearly half the world's population in a single year - and the aviation industry have committed to reducing their impact on climate. The UNFCCC has partnered with the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) Programme, for which WSP has been the independent Administrator for nearly 10 years, to support airports to become climate neutral. More than 200 airports are certified under this voluntary programme of which 35 have reached the highest certification level of carbon neutrality. The aim of the UNFCCC event (10 November) under their banner of climate neutral nowwas to showcase the efforts of airports to reduce their climate impacts and show how their efforts contribute to the overall sustainable development of the entire aviation sector. WSP helped put together the programme for this event, working through the UNFCCC to bring in participation from ACI EUROPE, the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), and airport participants from Fiji, Adelaide, Lithuanian and Norwegian airports. Olivier Jankovec, Director General of ACI-Europe, spoke of the success of the programme and how it is empowering the efforts of airports to ultimately neutralise their carbon footprint, including their commitment to reach 100 carbon neutral airports in Europe. Egle Lauraityte, General Counsel, Lithuanian Airports, explained how they were developing a sustainability vision and policy for the airport group and of the practicalities and difficulties involved. Faiz Khan, Executive Chairman, Airports Fiji, spoke of how Fiji airport is addressing CO2 emissions, and the role of industry partnerships in doing so. Stephanie Bolt, Sustainability Manager, Adelaide Airport, reviewed how to reach and maintain a high level of carbon reduction achievement under ACA, of alternative pathways to carbon neutrality and of the difficulties and opportunities to engage airport stakeholders in carbon activities. Lastly, Michael Gill, Executive Director, ATAG, reviewed how aviation is supporting the UN sustainable development framework and of aviation's strategic direction and goals in addressing climate change. I then co-moderated alongside Olav Mosvold Larsen from Avinor, Norway's airport operator, a panel discussion which discussed what the next big idea could be to help airports lower their carbon impact; where does an airport's responsibility end in becoming zero carbon, and finally is achieving carbon neutrality critical to the future of a successful airport. Panellists conversed on big topics such as energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy, sustainable fuels, airport infrastructure and how to engage stakeholder in the 'not so interesting stuff' through which airports make lots of small changes to improve their sustainability as well as what the overall future of Airport Carbon Accreditation should look like. The session ended with an open Q and A on how airports can help the whole aviation sector to become climate neutral' If you'd like more information on the event, you can watch the video here Leonie Dobbie is Head of Sustainable Aviation and Airports at WSP which is one of the founders of Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) Contact: Tel: +33 1 44 08 5400 [Editorial queries for this story should be sent to HYPERLINK mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk newswire@enpublishing.co.uk \</doc>

Move is part of ambitious plan to meet its targets under the Paris climate accord New Ecology Minister, Nicolas Hulot, admitted target would be 'tough' to reach   Announcement comes as Swedish car giant Volvo announced it will go electric France is to end sales of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 the government announced today. The move is part of an ambitious plan to meet its targets under the Paris climate accord, new Ecology Minister Nicolas Hulot announced today. He acknowledged that the target would be 'tough' to reach, particularly for automakers. It comes as Swedish car giant Volvo, known for its chunky diesel estate cars, announced it was going electric and that no model brought in after next year would rely solely on internal combustion engines.\~ Volvo's cars will instead be fully electric or hybrid - combining electric and conventional engines - in what the RAC Foundation suggested could be 'the spark which turns modern motors electric'. Recent figures showed a 15 per cent drop in UK sales of diesels following dire warnings about air pollution deaths and costly levies. The data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders also revealed a surge in sales of electric and hybrid models. Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely, said it would launch five electric cars by 2021 but will continue to produce current models with petrol or diesel engines after the 2019 cut-off. Meanwhile the makers of Peugeot and Citroen cars are locked in a bitter dispute with its factory workers who worried about their jobs. Employees blockaded themselves in the factory run by company GM&S, in Sept-Fons, to protest better conditions in a pending takeover of the struggling factory. GM&S resorted to using helicopters to retrieve car parts from the factory while French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned the government would take the 'necessary measures' if workers do not lift the blockade. GM&S is a supplier for carmaker PSA Group, which has promised (EURO)40million (45 million) in contracts and investment to keep the plant afloat. PSA spokesman Pierre-Olivier Salmon said the blockade could force the carmaker to reconsider its funding proposals. More to follow\~ The Paris Agreement is the first large-scale global agreement to combat what scientists say is climate change, coming together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. China and the United States had already committed to backing the deal in September 2016, with their greenhouse gas output accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world's emissions. To go into legal force, countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions had to sign on. The deal asks that the countries signing on reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Right now 147 countries have ratified the agreement to the 197 who attended the convention.\~ The aim is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) this century. Part of the reason the Paris Agreement was successful was that ratifying countries can decide independently how to reduce their emissions rather than being told how much to cut by. The binding part of the agreement makes countries report on their progress decreasing emissions, while the actual setting of emission-reduction targets is non-binding.\~ The United States said it would try to reduce emissions from its 2005 level by 17 percent in 2020 and 26 to 28 percent by 2025. \</doc>

The 20 year EIB loan will be invested on a water resilience scheme, which includes construction of a new water-treatment plant and upgrading existing wastewater treatment facilities, improving and expanding water networks.Upon completion, the scheme is expected to support various sustainable development goals including health, economic development and sustainable urban growth. It will also strengthen flexibility of water distribution and wastewater treatment in Fiji.The government of Fiji, Asian Development Bank and Green Climate Fund have also financed the new water investment project.Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji and president of COP23 , said: "This welcome financing will be used with funding from the Green Climate Fund, the Asian Development Bank and the Fijian Government."A great many people in Fiji will benefit from this project, which will cost a total of approximately $400m, and I am grateful to the EIB for its support and its foresight."Financing of projects to build resiliency in developing countries is critical, and I sincerely hope that this project can serve as a model for other developing countries that wish to access blended financing on behalf of their own people." \</doc>

Nearly nine out of 10 of the world's biggest companies have plans in place to reduce carbon emissions, new research has found, but only a fifth of them are doing so for 2030 and beyond. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) also found that only 14% of its sample of 1,073 large companies around the world had "science-based targets" - that is, goals to reduce carbon emissions which are in line with the global agreement to hold warming to no more than 2C, enshrined in the 2015 Paris agreement. "Targets [from companies] have previously been short in scope and pretty unambitious," Marcus Norton, chief partnerships officer at CDP, told the Guardian. "That is improving." Companies are not bound by the Paris agreement, which requires country governments to take action to hold warming to no more than 2C, with an aspirational goal of keeping warming to even lower levels, of 1.5C. However, many large companies have taken their own steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including investing in renewable energy, cutting down on waste and streamlining their operations. Paul Simpson, chief executive of CDP, added: "This is great news for those companies seizing the opportunity of the low-carbon economy, but the rest need to pick up the pace or risk losing out. The majority of the large corporations we analysed do not yet appear to have the right science-based targets in place to successfully transition their business in line with the Paris agreement, though many have ambitions to take this step in the next two years." These efforts will continue despite the withdrawal of the US, the world's biggest emitter, from the Paris agreement under President Trump. Governments will meet in Bonn this November under the auspices of the UN, a meeting known as COP23 , to discuss the next steps to achieving the aims of the Paris agreement, and the attitude of the US government's representatives will be keenly watched. Ahead of COP23 , many companies and governments below the national level were keen to stress their commitment to fulfilling the aims of the Paris pact. For instance, mayors of the cities of London, Paris, Los Angeles, Barcelona, Mexico City and Cape Town, along with a few others, announced they would stop buying petrol or diesel-driven buses from 2025 onwards, and that they would ensure that a large area of their city was "zero-emission" by 2030. These actions are calculated to reduce air pollution, a serious problem in many major cities, as well as cutting down on global greenhouse gases. Ahead of the Bonn conference, developing countries have also been a key focus. A group called the New Climate Economy has surveyed Africa and found that nations across the continent could benefit from environmentally sustainable economic growth, potentially "leapfrogging" developed countries by bypassing much of the fossil fuel economy in favour of clean technology, including renewable energy. The report found that the best way to encourage such sustainable economic activity in Africa would be for governments to devise and implement new policies that would make investments in green growth more attractive, for instance by reducing existing subsidies for fossil fuels and removing import tariffs on sustainable technology. Governments should also encourage entrepreneurship, the report found, by adapting policies to the conditions in their countries and of their economies, taking into account the available natural resources and the need to keep emissions low while lifting people out of poverty. "Africa has the natural resources and the determination to instigate a green industrial revolution," said Carlos Lopes, a member of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, professor at the Graduate School of Development Policy and Practice, University of Cape Town. "Now we need the right policies to unleash economic transformation, green growth and entrepreneurship across the continent. A more prosperous and sustainable future is within Africa's reach, we just need to seize it." \</doc>

On 9 October the administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, announced that within days he would start the process of repealing former president Obama's Clean Coal Plan to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants and propose a new rule to replace it. "The war against coal," he said, "is over". The Clean Power Plan was a key part of Washington's implementation of the Paris agreement on climate change, from which US president Trump withdrew in June. It aimed to reduce the US power industry's CO2 pollution levels by 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. But it was put on hold by the US Supreme Court in 2016 following legal challenges by industry and coal-friendly states. Even so, the plan helped drive a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which were being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewables, and by state mandates promoting energy conservation. Start of the backlash The coal industry naturally celebrated the news, but environmental groups and public health advocates derided the decision as shortsighted. Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, condemned the move as ignoring deadly health issues and discounting the jobs created by clean energy deployment. The move "is a wholesale retreat from EPA's legal, scientific and moral obligation to address the threats of climate change," said Gina McCarthy, Obama's former EPA administrator. A new embarrassment came along on 4 November when US government agency the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration produced a report confirming that human activity is causing global warming, and at a rate 170 times faster than by natural causes alone. By the autumn several US groups were lining up to defy Trump. On 11 November at the UN conference on climate change in Bonn, COP23 , US states, cities and businesses signed 'America's pledge', a commitment to combat global warming in direct opposition to the Trump's climate policies. To date, 20 US states and more than 50 of its largest cities, along with more than 60 of the biggest businesses in the USA, have committed to emissions reduction goals. Added together, they have a GDP power of about $10 trillion, behind only the USA as a whole ($18.6tn) and China ($11tn). What happens next? Sarah Ladislaw (a director of the Energy and National Security Programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies) Kyle Danish (CSIS associate and Van Ness Feldman partner) and John Larsen (CSIS and Rhodium Group) have produced an analysis of the future direction of US clean policy from which the following are extracts. For a while it was rumoured that the Trump administration would simply repeal the CPP and the not pursue in earnest a replacement. Some of the commercial concerns involved warned that simply repealing the CPP was not legally defensible, because at some point EPA would be forced by the courts to replace the CPP with some form of GHG emissions regulation. Moreover, if this replacement obligation fell on a future administration, it might feel compelled to impose draconian cuts to offset inaction by the Trump administration; a so-called 'pendulum risk'. The first implication of considering a replacement rule is that it seems to signal that the administration will not try to overturn the 2009 'Endangerment Finding,' the first step in the regulatory process at EPA and the underlying justification for regulating GHGs in the first place. Overturning the endangerment finding would be the most legally challenging, resource intensive, and politically divisive route EPA could take. A second implication is that the final outcome of the process would not be known for a number of years. Even if the Trump administration were planning only to repeal the CPP, it would need to follow a 'notice and comment' rule-making process prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act. This involves proposing a rule, taking public comment, and finalising the rule. For Clean Air Act rules, this process takes anything from one to three years, followed by inevitable litigation that can last just as long. If a replacement rule was considered, the process could be extended even further. How to repeal The method by which the Trump administration proposes to repeal the CPP could offer insights into the administration's current preferences for a replacement. One option is to interpret Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (invoked by the Obama administration as the source of the CPP's authority) as actually foreclosing GHG limits on power plants, on the grounds that power plants are already regulated for their toxic emissions under Section 112. This 'Section 112 Exclusion' argument would foreclose any replacement options under Section 111. The fact that the Trump administration is still considering soliciting comment suggests that it is hedging its bets on the viability of the Section 112 Exclusion argument. Another legal argument for repeal would be that the Obama EPA exceeded its statutory authority under Section 111 in crafting the emission standards in the CPP, because it considered not only reductions achievable at affected power plants, but also reductions achievable by shifting generation from higher-emitting plants to lower- or zero-emitting resources. Petitioners argued that inclusion of 'outside-the-fence' measures violated Section 111. Repealing the CPP on this basis could set up a replacement rule that establishes standards on the basis of what can be implemented 'inside the fence.' This would reduce by much less emissions from the power sector than the current CPP, perhaos by a factor of 10 smaller than the current CPP would have required by 2030. Plants that do implement upgrades to comply would also be more competitive in power markets and may be called on to run longer, leading perhaps to higher total CO2 emissions than with no standard in place. Therefore a future administration might seek to push a more ambitious programme, and a significant issue would be the extent to which the legal reasoning behind a Trump replacement rule left a door open for a future administration to return to an outside-the-fence approach, or other means of ratcheting up the stringency of power sector regulation. Accordingly, it could be difficult for the power sector to derive long-term regulatory certainty from federal rule-making actions by this administration, and in any event, states would still be able to pursue more aggressive climate policies. Even with more lenient standards, there still could be costs and complexity in complying with them. A Trump EPA replacement rule would likely emphasise compliance flexibility for states and power plants, including allowing states to establish cap-and-trade programmes. However, this approach could draw legal challenges. The Trump administration's stance on climate is far from fully formed. There is a live debate between legally defensible strategies to moderate regulations and ideologically driven ones to repeal them. Going forward this means the Trump administration's position on climate could be far more malleable than previously thought, though still unlikely to be satisfying to the environmental advocacy community. O/MATTER In the weeks leading up to the Pruitt announcement, statements by White House officials suggested that the administration's position on climate policy could be more malleable than it first appeared, apparently motivated by a desire to create legally durable, albeit more lenient environmental regulations. This approach to the CPP could enable the Trump administration to take credit for environmental performance that was in line with both the climate agenda and with the administration's energy and economic strategy. \</doc>

The problem for President Trump weighing into any of these controversies is that he has had some of his own. A dozen women came forward last year during the election campaign with various allegations that he had sexually abused them. he denied all the allegations, He said at the time - and said he would be taking legal action. It is a difficult position for President Trump to take. If he weighs into any of these controversies, it brings up some of his own from the past. The United Nations Climate Change conference has ended with delegates agreeing to take stock of individual country efforts to cut fossil fuel emissions. Envoys spent the last two weeks in the German city of Bonn, discussing what needs to be done if the world is to meet commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Environment Analyst Roger Harrabin reports from Bonn. With President Trump trying to pull the US out of their global climate accord as quickly as he can, this meeting could have been a total car crash, with other nations uncooperative. It has not been that way. They made good progress on the new rulebook to the way climate will be governed in future. They have also rot agriculture into the talks for the first time. Farming create about 25% of global emissions. There have been major warnings though that climate change is already happening, and future changes are locked in. On the optimistic side we have heard about the collapse in the price of renewable energy, which has made it affordable to China and India to make huge steps in that direction. These nations will meet again in a year's time, but they will have some hope at last that some progress is being made. Stay with us on BBC News, because still to come this hour, reclaiming the streets: Find out how these children are playing safely outdoors just like their parents did generation ago. Benazir Bhutto has claimed victory in Pakistan's general election. She has asked Pakistan's President to name her as prime minister. Jackson has been released on bail of $3 million after turning himself in to police in Santa Barbara. It was the biggest demonstration so far of the fast-growing European anti-nuclear movement. The South African government has announced that it's opening the country's remaining whites-only beaches to people of all races. This will lead to a black-majority government in this country and the destruction of the white civilisation. Part of the centuries-old Windsor Castle, one of the Queen's residences, has been consumed by fire for much of the day. 150 firemen have been battling the blaze, which has caused millions of pounds' worth of damage. This is BBC News. The latest headlines: Regional branches of Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party have called on him to quit the presidency as opposition to the long-term leader of Zimbabwe continues to grow. Lebanon's Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, has left Saudi Arabia on a plane for France after tendering his resignation two weeks ago. President Trump has put on hold a decision to end a ban on importing elephant parts into the US from animals hunted in Zimbabwe and Zambia. An announcement on Thursday that trophies from legally hunted elephants could be imported had prompted outrage from animal welfare activists. But it's a different story in Malawi. Wildlife officials there have completed the world's biggest ever effort to relocate more than 500 elephants because of successful conservation efforts. The BBC's Ben Tavener reports from Malawi. The Liwonde National Park in southern Malawi is home to some big animals. Not just hippos and crocodiles, but also elephants. Lots of them. Too many, in fact. Conservation efforts have led to the elephants breeding prolifically. Now they are straying more and more into local villages. But in Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve over 400km to the north, the situation is very different. Poachers here virtually wiped out the local elephant population. So, African Parks, a non-profit conservation organisation, embarked on the world's biggest elephant translocation. It is no mean feat - darting and moving these massive animals takes skill and determination. To complicate matters further, families have to be moved together to reduce the stress \</doc>

EARTH'S greatest natural treasures - coral reefs, mountain glaciers and wildlife-rich wetlands - are suffering devastating threats from climate change, the planet's leading conservation organisation warned today. IUCN Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been affected by 'devastating' mass bleaching The number of World Heritage Sites affected have almost doubled over the past three years, with 62 of the natural wonders feeling the impact of rising temperatures. While coral bleaching and glacier melt has now hit a quarter of the 241 most precious natural wonders, other vital habitats such as low-lying deltas, permafrost landscapes and fire-sensitive ecosystems are also being hit by climate change. The International Union for Conservation of Nature made its shock warning today as delegates meet at the United Nations ' climate change conference in Bonn. After conducting a detailed assessment of the UNESCO World Heritage List, the IUCN says studies show how the number of sites threatened by climate change has increased by 77 per cent on the 35 wonders highlighted in its first Outlook report in 2014. Related articles Baby elephant set on FIRE by sick mob 'escaped back into the jungle' Blue Planet 2: Watch the Coral Reef's most colourful killer Three of the most spectacular coral reefs are highlighted in the report. Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef, the Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean, the second largest coral atoll, and the largest reef in the Northern Hemisphere, the Belize Barrier Reef, have all been affected by "devastating" mass bleaching over the past three years because of rising sea temperatures, says the IUCN.\~ Up to 85 per cent of the Australian marvel has suffered. Glaciers are also retreating. Increasing warmth means iconic landmarks such as the Kilimanjaro National Park, which boasts Africa's highest peak, and the Jungfrau-Aletsch - Switzerland's largest Alpine glacier, are suffering. Other dangers posed to World Heritage are the threat from rampaging invasive species, unsustainable tourism as well as infrastructure development. Climate change is blamed for increasing the impact of invasive alien species as its facilitates the pests' spread and helps them to become more established in new areas. An additional worry outlined in the report is the way that the quality of managing World Heritage sites has diminished over the past three years, with fewer than half getting a good standard of care. Insufficient funding is blamed. In an overview of all 241 sites, the IUCN report warns that 29 per cent face "significant" concerns while seven per cent, including the Everglades National Park in Florida and Kenya's Lake Turkana have a "critical outlook". The report says two-thirds of the sites are likely to be well conserved in the near future, the same proportion as is in the 2014 assessment. Inger Andersen, IUCN Director General, followed the report's publication by warning: "Protection of World Heritage sites is an international responsibility of the same governments that have signed up to the Paris Agreement. IUCN Kilimanjaro National Park is suffering from retreating glaciers "This IUCN report sends a clear message to the delegates gathered here in Bonn: climate change acts fast and is not sparing the finest treasures of our planet. "The scale and the pace at which it is damaging our natural heritage underline the need for urgent and ambitious national commitments and actions to implement the Paris Agreement." Her message was echoed by Tim Badman, Director of IUCN's World Heritage Programme, who added: "Natural World Heritage sites play a crucial role supporting local economies and livelihoods. "Their destruction can thus have devastating consequences that go beyond their exceptional beauty and natural value. IUCN Peru's Huascar\'e1n National Park "In Peru's Huascar\'e1n National Park, for example, melting glaciers affect water supplies and contaminate water and soil due to the release of heavy metals previously trapped under ice.\~ "This adds to the urgency of our challenge to protect these places." For all the fears, there have been some recent success stories. In the C\'f4te d'Ivoire's Como\'e9 National Park, elephant and chimpanzee numbers have recovered because of effective management and international support, making it one of 14 sites with an improved rating since the 2014 IUCN World Heritage Outlook report.

"We are witnessing the severe impacts of climate change throughout the world", said the Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, at a press conference. "Every credible scientific source is telling us that these impacts will only get worse if we do not address climate change and it also tells us that our window of time for addressing it is closing very soon," she added. "We need to dramatically increase our ambitions," stressed the UNFCCC chief, outlining three priorities. First, all stakeholders - including governments, non-governmental organizations, businesses, investors and citizens - must accelerate climate action by 2020. Second, she said, the international community must complete the Paris Agreement guidelines, or operating manual, to unleash the potential of the accord. Third, conditions must be improved to enable countries to be more ambitious in determining their own national policies to slow down global warming. At the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) held last November under the leadership of Fiji, nations agreed to accelerate and complete their work to put in place the guidelines - officially known as the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) - at COP24 in Katowice, Poland next December. At this Bonn meeting, which will run through 10 May, Governments will start drafting texts to be finalized at COP24. Finishing off the operating manual is also necessary to assess whether the world is on track to achieve the goals of the historic Paris Agreement limiting greenhouse gas emissions, while pursuing efforts to keep the temperature rise to less than 1.5\'b0C. Throughout this year, countries will also focus on how they can scale up their climate ambition and implementation in the pre-2020 period. All countries share the view that climate action prior to 2020 is essential. (Distributed by M2 Communications ( HYPERLINK http://www.m2.com www.m2.com )) \</doc>

November 20, 2017 The 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Bonn, Germany from November 6 -17 2017, provided the framework for the launch of the UCLG Africa ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfriqueLocale.org/en www.AfriqueLocale.org/en The official launch of the UCLG Africa Climate Task Force was held in Bonn on Tuesday November 14, 2017 under the chairmanship of His Excellency Mr. Barnab\'e9 Dassigli, Minister of Decentralization and Local Governance of Benin, Chairman of the Specialized Technical Committee N\'b0 8 of the African Union, in the presence of representatives of the first institutions that volunteered to join the Task Force. These were notably: The African Development Bank (AfDB), represented for this purpose by Ms. Louise Helen BROWN, Climate Change Task Manager, Coordinator of the AfDB Fund for Climate Change in Africa; The West African Development Bank (BOAD), represented by Mr. Bio Sawe, Director of the Environment and Climate Finance; The Local Government Capital Investment Fund of Morocco (FEC); The Special Fund for Equipment and Inter-Municipal Intervention of Cameroon (FEICOM), represented by Mr. C\'f4me Awoumou, Deputy Director of Cooperation and Partnership; OECD, represented by Ms Marie Tr\'e9moli\'e8res, Senior Policy Analyst at the Sahel and West Africa Club (SWAC) of OECD; The Environment Agency for Territorial Development of the Presidency of the Republic of Benin, represented by Mr. Jean Claude Grisoni Niaki, expert in resource mobilization and structuring of projects for Climate Finance; The 4C Agency of the Ministry of the Environment of Morocco, represented by its Director, Mr. Mohamed Nbou; Cadi Ayyad University of Marrakech, represented by Professor Fatima Arib, Sustainable Development and Major Projects Task Manager at the Presidency of the University; The National Associations of Local Governments in Africa, represented by Ms. Florence Radzilani, Mayor of the Municipality of the District of Vhembe (South Africa), Climate and Environmental Planning Officer at the South African Local Government Association (SALGA); NGO ENERGIES 2050, represented by its CEO, St\'e9phane Pouffary. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi, Secretary General of UCLG Africa, stated the intention of the Task Force to bring together, within the same ecosystem, the various stakeholders working with climate issues. This is to enable them to support local governments in Africa in the implementation of NDCs and in the access to climate finance and most notably the Green Climate Fund. This is open to all those who wish to join it who can do so by applying to the General Secretariat of UCLG Africa. On behalf of the African Ministers of Public Service, Urban Development, Local Governments and Decentralization, the Hon. Minister Barnab\'e9 Dassigli of Benin, Chairman of the Specialized Technical Committee N\'b0 8 of the African Union, commended UCLG Africa for its wonderful initiative, supported by STC N\'b0 8. He expressed confidence that the UCLG Africa's Climate Task Force would have a significant impact on the engagement of African local governments in the implementation of the Paris Agreement and pointed out that within the same support platform for local governments, development banks, institutions specializing in the financing of local governments, technical support agencies for local governments, academic and research institutions, associations of local governments and NGOs active in the field of climate, was a commitment to the synergy of the different stakeholders around the Climate Agenda. Hon. Minister Dassigli confirmed that the African Union's STC N\'b0 8 also supports requests made by local and regional elected officials during the preparatory Forum for COP 22 held in Cotonou in September 2016, especially with regard to the urgency of establishing a capacity building and technical assistance program for local governments to enable them to develop climate plans and prepare eligible funding applications for the Green Climate Fund; as well as for the recognition of UCLG Africa as an "Implementing Partner" of the Green Climate Fund. The role of territories was recognized as essential for the realization of NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions). Local policy choices in terms of infrastructure, equipment and basic service delivery methods have made an impact on energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. Priorities for elected officials include giving a climate perspective to the everyday actions they carry out. There is also a need to build their capacities to measure, report and verify the contribution of their actions and policies in the reduction of emissions and adaptation to the effects of climate change. This requirement for the Measurement, Reporting and Verification of climate actions (MRV) is one of the requirements of the Paris Agreement and one of the conditions to be met in order to access the Green Climate Fund.

The Vice-President in charge of Climate Action and Environment at the European Investment Bank (EIB) has urged the global community to step up efforts to crowd in private investors for climate action. Speaking at Climate Finance Day, ahead of the One Planet Summit in Paris, EIB Vice-President Jonathan Taylor said, 'The EIB - as the Bank of the European Union - is a key supporter of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. The EIB is the world's largest multilateral lender for climate action, and as such we have pledged to provide USD 100bn for climate action in the five-year period to 2020. This is expected to mobilise around USD 300bn of climate-friendly investments. Our support for the Paris Agreement entails higher volumes outside the EU - 35% of total financing by 2020 - and an increased focus on impact, adaptation and mainstreaming climate change considerations into everything we do. Key to unlocking the amounts we need to tackle climate change are increased efforts between the private and public sector. An example of our activities to mobilise private money for climate action is the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform, which is the first time a Member State funds an entire climate finance platform rather than an individual climate finance operation. An even earlier platform is the GEEREF fund of funds - the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund. This has blended first loss capital from public sources with private capital from institutional investors to support investment through equity (participations) in small and medium-sized renewable energy projects in developing countries.' He added, 'On the borrowing side, the EIB is proud to be the pioneer of the green bond market and its largest issuer. This year, the EIB celebrates the 10th anniversary of its first Climate Awareness Bond with an issuance of around EUR 20bn. We are at the forefront of making the green bond market more transparent, to attract more bond issuers and investors with the goal of mobilising what is needed to confront the challenges ahead.' Vice-President Taylor participated in a discussion about how to step up public and private cooperation in the field of climate action. At the One Planet Summit on 12 December, the EIB, together with partners in the public and private sector, will be announcing a number of new initiatives and projects for climate action. HYPERLINK http://www.eib.org/infocentre/events/all/eib-at-one-planet-summit http://www.eib.org/infocentre/events/all/eib-at-one-planet-summit More information on the EIB and Climate Finance The first ever green bond was issued by the EIB in 2007; in 2016, the EIB exceeded its climate action target for the seventh year running, providing over EUR 19.5 billion to help mitigate climate change and adapt to its impact. The EIB's Climate Strategy puts new emphasis on mainstreaming climate considerations across all our activities and tools and ensuring climate change considerations inform sector policies, e.g. through shadow carbon pricing, EPS and other mechanisms. The Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform: This is a model which can be scaled up and replicated with other Member States of the European Union. Here, Luxembourg will make available EUR 30 million (25% of Luxembourg's climate finance until 2020) of subordinated funding over the next three years for investment vehicles, based in Luxembourg, financing high impact climate projects. This funding will allow the EIB to co-invest and bring in third-party investors from the private sector. At COP 23 , the first investment of EUR 5 million in the Green for Growth Fund under the platform was announced. This is expected to mobilise EUR 100m of public and private money which will support energy efficiency and renewable energy development in the Middle East and North Africa region. On 10 November at COP23 , the EIB signed its biggest ever loan in the Pacific: a water project for Fiji's capital Suva to help increase climate change resilience of the water supply system. Earlier this year, the EIB also approved a USD 20 million investment in the Sustainable Ocean Fund. This will provide money for marine and coastal enterprises that are helping with conservation, improved livelihoods and better economic returns. Background information: The European Investment Bank is active in about 160 countries. It is the bank of the European Union, owned by its 28 member states .It is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and the largest single issuer of green bonds which the EIB pioneered 10 years ago. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate-related investment in the five years up to 2020. The EIB's climate strategy also commits to dedicating 35% of financing to climate action in developing countries by 2020.

Nigeria has become the first nation to issue a Climate Bonds Certified Sovereign Green Bond, the first African nation to issue a sovereign green bond and only the fourth nation in the world to issue after Poland, France, and COP23 President, Fiji. The NGN 10.69bn issuance has been described by the Ministry of the Environment as a \€  pilot sovereign\€ of a foreshadowed NGN 150 billion green bond programme and will fund a range of renewable energy, afforestation and environmental projects. The 5-Year Bond settles on December 22nd. Chapel Hill Denham is the financial adviser. \~ The Honourable Minister for State for Environment, Ibrahim Usman Jibril, says: \€  Climate Change is real and business, government and the capital market need to work together to slow its effects. This pilot green bond, which we expect to be the first of many more, has developed the platform to address the nation's target of reducing its emissions by 20 per cent unconditionally and 45 per cent conditionally by 2030.\€ \~ Climate Bonds Director of Market Development, Justine Leigh-Bell (pictured), says: \€  This debut sovereign issuance is part of Nigeria's many efforts directed towards its Paris based NDC commitments.\~ National leadership combined with international support has achieved the first stage of a long term green investment pipeline.\~ The wider objective is to build capital flows across Nigeria's vast economy which will contribute towards domestic climate and environmental goals.\€ \~ The debut green bond has come to market after an extensive development process involving domestic and international stakeholders. Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Green Bond Assessment of GB1 (Excellent) to the issuance and is expected to be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) by the Nigerian Debt Management Office (DMO). off \</doc>

On 22 April 2016, 174 countries signed the Paris Agreement, drawn up at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop 21), to limit global warming to less than 2&deg;C. The signatories also promised to pursue efforts to curtail the temperature increase to 1.5&deg;C. Some scientists believe that this will require zero carbon emissions between 2030 and 2050. One way to achieve this is to move away from using coal to generate power towards renewables, which do not produce greenhouse gasses. Asset managers have clearly taken this on board. Many have set limits on investing in companies that earn a certain percentage of their revenues from coal mining or generating power by burning coal. Others have taken a bolder stance. Austrian group Erste Asset Management, for example, has banned managers on all its funds from investing in securities which derive more than 30% of their revenues from the coal mining industry. In its sustainable funds, this limit is as strict as 5%. Dominik Benedikt, a senior ESG analyst at the Vienna-based group, says Erste set the 30% limit by looking at guidelines drafted by institutional investors and analysing companies' balance sheets. He believes investors should look closely at how a company defines its dependence on coal. \' When you exceed 30% you go up fairly quickly in terms of coal revenues. When you go below that, it drops off quite fast as well. For us 30% is the sweet spot,' Benedikt says. \' An integrated utility, that generates power from coal and distributes that energy, may say that only 50% of its revenue comes from burning coal, while the other half comes from distribution. But you could still say that ultimately, 100% of its revenue stems from burning coal,' he says. Benedikt also believes coal is a bad investment from an economic view. \' Many listed coal mines in China are operating with negative profit margins, as at least a third were loss-making in 2016. At some stage even the most convinced coal miner will have to admit that this might not be the best way forward,' he says. Steffen Hoerter, global head of ESG at Allianz Global Investors, agrees. \' Research shows that photovoltaic and wind are already comparatively cheaper per kilowatt hour of power generation than coal-fired utilities. Other analysis claims that any new coal-firing power utility is already a dead asset from an economic perspective,' Hoerter says. Fuel for thought So, if investors divest out of coal, where can they put their money instead? \' You should think about what you want to support. If you assume climate change is real and you want contribute to financing the transition to a low carbon economy, you have to have a view on reinvestment. For example green bonds or renewable infrastructure,' Hoerter says. However, it is not always a straightforward switch from coal to renewables. Benedikt says investors need to remember the unstable performance of energy stocks, regardless of their environmental impact. \' Unfortunately renewables can still be comparatively volatile investments, it depends on the investment horizon. In the short term, it can be an aggressive play. In the long term, we think it's the place to be. \' Energy is cyclical by definition. Even if you forego renewables and invest in oil & gas, you still have substantial volatility. For example, European oil majors have risen quite a lot recently, but they had been badly hit in the past,' Benedikt says. Smooth transition Robert De Guign\'e9, head of socially responsible investing at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, warns that investors cannot simply stop investing in traditional energy providers. Lombard Odier currently excludes coal miners or companies which derive 20% of their energy from burning coal. \' We want to go through the energy transition the smart way. If we decide to disinvest from all types of traditional power generation, we will never reach the Cop 21 targets, because we need to go smoothly down that route. \' We will still need some gas and oil, as well as other types of energy sources by 2050. We can't just pull out our investments all of a sudden because these companies are part of the transition towards a low carbon economy,' De Guign\'e9 says. He adds that, like any investment, you need to do your homework. Companies can put out all the statements they want but it's the numbers that count. \' Greenwashing is part of company behaviour. Our methodology tries to identify green washers to see how they are implementing their policy. Is it just through marketing, are they really taking action and is their ESG policy having an impact? \' Our process allows us to spot a company which may have a high score in terms of marketing but poor results in practice. In that case there's a good chance you're dealing with a greenwasher,' De Guign\'e9 says. \</doc>

Donald Trump could slow down US progress towards a lower carbon economy, but he will be unable to halt it because businesses and local governments have committed to a low-carbon path, a former climate negotiator for the US has said. Through measures such as slapping import tariffs on solar products, scrapping incentives to renewable energy and promoting coal power, the US president could try to alter the economics of pursuing low-carbon energy. Paul Bodnar, a lead US negotiator in the climate talks under former president Barack Obama, told the Guardian that Trump possessed "powerful instruments", such as import tariffs and quotas, that could hamper the growth of low-carbon technology. "If he chooses, he could use them," he said. But he warned this would be short-sighted, as China is forging ahead with low-carbon power and the US would risk losing any technological lead. "It is clear the way the market is driving - towards lower carbon. It would be difficult for a Republican administration to take action that is clearly counter to the forces of the market," he said. Coal, he said, was losing ground in the market, even without penalties on carbon output. "A huge percentage of US coal is just flat out uneconomic," said Bodnar. "Ratepayers are being asked to pay more for incumbent industries. Questions are going to be asked about why that is. It would cost a lot to make coal great again." He added: "The direction of travel [for businesses] has been set, and it is lower carbon. The only question is the pace at which that happens. And the pace is important because this is an urgent problem. Trump has the ability to slow that pace, but he cannot reverse it." States, mayors, local governments and businesses from the US have gathered together to present an alternative vision to Trump's policies at the ongoing UN climate talks in Bonn. On Saturday, they will unveil a new initiative to move forward with low-carbon plans in spite of the White House's opposition. Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the US from the landmark Paris agreement of 2015, signed and ratified by the US under Obama, but under UN rules this process cannot be completed until November 2020, with the prospective official withdrawal date falling the day after the next presidential election. Earlier this week, the Syrian government became the final functioning state to sign up to the Paris agreement. It was the last holdout nation, following the decision by Nicaragua to join the agreement shortly before the current talks. This leaves the US as the only nation poised to reject the 2015 agreement. Looking to the potential progress at the COP23 talks, Bodnar pointed to China's actions in pursuing low-carbon policies, in contrast to the US. He said the country's stance at the UN talks would be key, in part because the US, though present and still a party to the Paris agreement, is taking little active part in the talks, which are focused on upping countries' commitments to reduce carbon emissions. Current emissions targets are inadequate to keep the Paris goal of limiting global warming to no more than 2C, which scientists say is the limit of safety beyond which the ravages of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Countries will be expected to come forward in the next few years with new targets that match scientific advice. Bodnar said that in the process of increasing countries' carbon-cutting, some countries had more room to manoeuvre than others. "What's interesting is to ask whether some countries left something on the table in 2015 [when setting carbon targets]. Countries that came to Paris with high ambition may find it difficult to crank that up, but others that were more conservative will have room to make higher commitments. China is very important." He said he was hopeful that this round of talks would produce momentum leading to higher goals. "It's a question of perceived self-interest. At Copenhagen in 2009, it wasn't the case that everyone perceived [cutting carbon sharply] to be in their self-interest. That changed in the run-up to Paris, and now governments do see that they are acting in their own interests by signing up [to higher goals]." A US state department official at the Bonn COP23 talks said: "This administration believes in corporate federalism and is therefore supportive of states and cities making their own choices within their respective borders." \</doc>

As part of the framework, the companies and governments have pledged to eliminate illegal cocoa production in national parks or forest land. In addition, they have agreed to develop an alternative livelihood for affected smallholder farmers living in the two countries.Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana are reported to be the two countries that produce nearly two-thirds of the world's annual supply of cocoa.Initiated by the World Cocoa Foundation, the far-reaching joint Frameworks for Action was revealed at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany.The Framework for Action is a collective effort that has involved two national governments, private sectors including farmers as well as farmers organisations.The framework focuses on three themes that include forest protection and restoration, sustainable production and farmers' livelihoods, and Community engagement and social inclusion.General Mills, which is one of the companies that has announced its commitment to the Frameworks, noted that cocoa is one of ten priority ingredients used by the company, and it has committed to 100% sustainably source it by 2020.Currently, General Mills purchases more than 70% of the cocoa from West African countries including Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana.General Mills chief supply chain officer John Church said: "Deforestation is a significant challenge, but by aligning and working together we can help put a stop to it and positively impact climate change by rehabilitating the land."We also recognise there are systemic labour issues in the cocoa supply chain, and we understand it will take industry-wide collaboration to make improvements. Having the national and local governments, who are key to addressing the issues, at the table from the beginning is key." \</doc>

Global negotiations seeking to implement the Paris agreement have been captured by corporate interests and are being undermined by powerful forces that benefit from exacerbating climate change, according to a report released ahead of the second meeting of parties to the Paris agreement - COP23 - next week. The report, co-authored by Corporate Accountability, uncovers a litany of ways in which fossil fuel companies have gained high-level access to negotiations and manipulated outcomes. It highlights a string of examples, including that of a negotiator for Panama who is also on the board of a corporate peak body that represents carbon traders such as banks, polluters and brokers. It also questions the role of the world's biggest polluters in sponsoring the meetings in return for access to high-level events. The report argues that as a result of the corporate influence, outcomes of negotiations so far have been skewed to favour the interests of the world's biggest corporate polluters over those of the majority of the world's population that live in the developing world. It finds that influence has skewed outcomes on finance, agriculture and technology. We have the wrong people at the table and we're looking to the wrong people for advice Corporate Accountability's Jesse Bragg It comes as the 2018 deadline approaches for member countries to finalise the rule book that guides the implementation of the Paris Agreement. That rule book will determine things such as how compliance will be monitored and enforced and how the developing world will receive finance and support. "We've been at many crossroads on climate change but this is perhaps one of the last of those that we have left," said Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability. "If parties don't arrive at a set of guidelines that actually facilitates the transition we've been talking about and keeps us under 1.5C, we may never have another shot at this." "We're doing this wrong right now. We have the wrong people at the table and we're looking to the wrong people for advice. If we don't course-correct at COP 23 and the next inter-sessional in Bonn, we're in real trouble. And you can look at what's happened so far to see the evidence of that." Examples of the infiltration of polluters into the official negotiations include:   The UNFCCC's Climate Technology Network, which advises on how to develop and transfer green technology to the developing world, includes a member of the World Coal Association, and its board has included managers at Shell and EDF - one of the world's biggest electricity producers. A negotiator for Panama is currently a board member of the International Emissions Trading Association (Ieta), and was previously its president for several years. Ieta was set up by the fossil fuel companies including BP and Rio Tinto in order to make sure climate action caused "minimal economic harm". Today its members include Chevron, BHP, Dow, Duke Energy, Repsol, Xcel Energy, Veolia and Statoil. Sponsorship of the COP21 meeting in Paris gave fossil fuel companies access to the "communications and networking area" inside the rooms where the negotiations were taking place. Big agricultural corporations such as Monsanto, Syngenta and Yara have been lobbying heavily at UNFCCC meetings, with Monsanto even co-charing the World Business Council on Sustainable Development's Climate-Smart Agriculture working group. Related: Protecting forest dwellers goes hand in hand with protecting forests, Whitehall told The report argues this access has influenced outcomes at the UNFCCC, undermining the Paris agreement in the following ways: Market-based solutions to climate change have become dogma at UNFCCC meetings, despite many developing world countries urging alternative mechanisms such as direct regulation, and despite studies suggesting they can allow big polluters to continue polluting, according to Corporate Accountability. The US and Canada have adopted agricultural corporations' approach to "climate-smart agriculture", and argued against regulation of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Most of the funds from the Green Climate Fund have so far been allocated to private sector projects. The report argues that if the UNFCCC process results in a rulebook being developed in line with what the world's biggest polluters want, then the Paris agreement is doomed to failure. "It's where you lose any nod to incorporate non-market mechanisms into article 6. It's where 'climate smart agriculture' becomes the only focus of agricultural negotiations, and so big ag is dominating negotiations there and petrochemicals are the solution. And the fossil fuel industry dominates the conversation around technology so we're just hoping for a successful large-scale carbon capture and storage to get us out of this mess. It's those things that are at risk in the rulebook negotiations." Momentum has been building over the past couple of years to have an official conflict-of-interest policy agreed on at the UNFCCC. In Marrakech in 2016 moves instigated by a group representing the majority of the world's population - the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries - were thwarted by the US, EU and Australia. Australia's delegation has argued that "there is no clear understanding of what a conflict of interest is and it means different things to different people" and that fossil fuel companies were "the providers of the biggest and best solutions". But in May this year in Bonn, the group succeeded in getting the UNFCCC to agree to improve "transparency", and discussions will continue in May 2018. The World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control successfully implemented a conflict of interest policy that has widely been acknowledged as a key ingredient in its success. Corporate Accountability says a similar policy is needed for the UNFCCC. \</doc>

October 27, 2017 KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo -- Greenpeace ( HYPERLINK http://APO.af/2gzfEv http://APO.af/2gzfEv ) Africa is organising an expedition in the peatlands of the Congo Basin forests with scientists and government officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo from October 27 - 29. The expedition taking place in the village of Lokolama (45 km from Mbandaka - capital of the province of Equateur in the Democratic Republic of Congo) will allow scientists, who recently discovered these peatlands to continue their research and measure the depth of the peats. The delegation will be to be accompanied by national and international journalist. Peatlands have a tremendous capacity to store carbon and the expedition seeks to show the existence of peatlands in the intact forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the importance of these peatlands in regulating climate change.Scientists will therefore have the opportunity to explain to journalists and forestry representatives the importance of protecting the Congo Basin forests and leaving peatlands untouched. After the expedition, a workshop will be organised on the Greenpeace ship, Esperanza, with policy makers, scientists and the media, to discuss the results of the expedition and outline conservation solutions to be implemented with the communities. The findings will later be taken to COP23 in Bonn, from November 6. The peatland expedition is organised as part of the Greenpeace Africa "Give the Congo Basin forests a chance" campaign, which started in Cameroon on 13 October and ends in Congo Brazzaville on 10 November. The campaign is supported by the presence of the Esperanza, the largest vessel in the Greenpeace ( HYPERLINK http://www.Greenpeace.com www.Greenpeace.com ) fleet, currently docked in the waters of the DRC since 24 October. During its stay in the DRC, various activities will be organised on the ship with government officials,, donors, civil society and, in particular, the indigenous and local communities who live and depend on these forest for their livelihoods.

Global warming is likely to speed up as the Earth becomes increasingly more sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations, scientists from the University of Reading have warned. In a new study, published this week in the prestigious journal PNAS, the scientists explain that the influence of increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 on global warming will become more severe over time because the patterns of warming of the Earth's surface will lead to reduced cloud cover in some sensitive regions and less heat being able to escape into space. The findings are supported by observations, suggesting that forecasts made by climate models evaluated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are realistic. Paulo Ceppi, researcher at the University of Reading and lead author of the study, said: 'This resemblance of computer simulations to observations increases our confidence in projections that the climate sensitivity to the progressive rise in carbon dioxide concentrations will increase over time into the future.' Evidence suggests that the upper level of the Earth's atmosphere warms faster than the surface in response to CO2 levels. However, the new study shows that as CO2 levels increase further, the rate of warming in the upper levels slows in comparison with that closer to the Earth's surface. Reduced contrast in temperature between the upper and lower levels of the atmosphere causes decreased low altitude cloud cover over some areas of the Earth's oceans, leading to more sunlight reaching the sea surface, and therefore a more rapid rise in sea surface temperatures. These conditions also impede the loss of heat from the atmosphere into space, contributing to the accelerated surface warming in response to rising CO2 concentrations. These results emphasise the importance of rapidly reducing human caused emissions of greenhouse gases to avoid the worst impacts from ongoing climate change as discussed at the recent COP23 meeting in Bonn that builds upon the 2017 Paris climate agreement.

As the UN climate talks drew to a close in Bonn on Friday, delegates will look back on these talks as the moment the US tried to present Donald Trump's vision for environmental action - and was met with outrage and derision. These two weeks have seen nearly 200 countries come together to support the Paris agreement, in an unprecedented effort to coordinate against climate change. Now,with Syria on board, the US is left as the only country outside this global endeavour. For its part, the American delegation tried to explain how "clean coal" could play a part in slowing climate change. The response was best summed up by the unlikely figure of Pope Francis, who dismissed the "perverse attitudes" of climate deniers and urged negotiators to accelerate efforts to curb carbon emissions. Read more Trump team to preach fossil fuel virtues at climate conference No one here has been slow to speak out against the US federal government. Yet the summit has also shown clearly how the US under Donald Trump can continue to damage the Paris accord, and thereby the world, in ways we are only just beginning to understand. This year's conference, held in Germany but hosted by Fiji, was the first stage of a two-year process at the end of which countries need to agree on the rulebook to implement the Paris agreement. In June, Mr Trump announced his intention to withdraw the US from the accord - but this will not take effect before November 2020 at the earliest. As a result, the Trump administration is still technically sat at the negotiating table, and remains a threatening force to the fragile balance of the deal. "They have decided that they are not going to be playing the game of the Paris agreement but they still want to be inside the room and decide the rules," Harjeet Singh, Action Aid's global lead on climate change, told Countries siding with the US inside the negotiations and on matters such as its coal initiative should look beyond the apparent legitimacy of the country itself, he said. "If you are siding with the US now, you are not just siding with a country, you are siding with Donald Trump. Do you want to side with a climate denier?" Speaking at the conference, Emmanuel Macron said this week that the EU should pick up the bill where the US drops its financial contributions to a key advisory body on climate change. Read more Countries have formed an anti-coal alliance in defiance of Trump Pope Francis blames climate change on 'short-sighted' humans What to expect from the UN's latest climate talks But, according to Mr Singh, there is a danger that other rich countries in the EU, as well as the likes of Australia and Canada, use the general outcry against America as a "cover-up" to avoid genuine progress on key issues such as ramping up ambition before the Paris deal comes into effect in 2020. "The US is becoming a punching bag. Everybody is focusing on what it is doing and nobody is noticing what other rich countries are doing," said Mr Singh. Steve Herz, senior policy adviser on climate and energy for the Sierra Club environmental organisation, told The Independent that even if the US had not deliberately taken the negotiations off track, he was concerned that "if the Trump administration goes backwards, other countries could decide to follow suitand tone down their ambitions". But time for robust action is pressing with early estimates from the Global Carbon Project showing global carbon emissions expected to rise 2 per cent in 2017 after remaining relatively flat over the last three years. There was some cause for hope in Bonn, Mr Herz said, highlighting the momentum built by the American grassroots "We're Still In" campaign, backed by cities, states and businesses and led by California Governor Jerry Brown and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. But even the creation of an alliance of countries committed to phase out coal - led by the UK and Canada - appears to have backfired.That's partly because it has left a traditionally climate-friendly Angela Merkel in an awkward position, under fire from activists for failing to announce a coal phase-out in Germany, while the host country is on track to miss its 2020 emission reduction target. And the UK and Canada-led alliance appears to have left the door open for a reactionary pro-coal axis of countries, which could be spearheaded by Poland and - you might have guessed it - the US. \</doc>

It is Saturday evening in the 14th arrondissement of Paris and people are gathered for an outdoor party. The event has one distinctive feature, however: the booming speakers and turntables playing the music are powered entirely off grid, by two large solar panels and two bikes linked to generators, pedalled by partygoers.  We can party all night, after the sun has gone down, says C\'e9dric Carles, founder of Solar Sound System, the collective that has put on the gig.  If the pedalling stops, it means people don\' t want any more music. Carles\' ambitions stretch far beyond entertainment. He wants to create a viable business model for eco-friendly music events, which would pay for research into sustainability. He created the Solar Sound System concept in 1999 in the Swiss city of Lausanne, and has since opened five permanent branches  in Paris, Berlin, Marseille, the Basque country and Tel Aviv. He plans to keep expanding, with London and Hong Kong in mind as the next locations. Each branch, except for the main Paris location, is set up as a franchise and pays 20 per cent of its profits back to Solar Sound System. Each Solar Sound System site hosts public parties, which are often free, paid for by the profits they make from hiring out the technology for private events, from drinks proceeds and from sponsors such as Enercoop, a renewable electricity co-operative. There are currently 15 such DJ systems across Solar Sound\' s branches, each of which costs about \€ 25,000 to make. Profits from private functions are also used to finance other sustainability projects, such as an internet radio station whose server is powered by solar energy, research into repurposing green technologies of the past and a device for recharging disposable batteries, called RegenBox. The projects are overseen by Atelier21, a think-tank that Carles runs with Thomas Ortiz, his project manager and the co-founder of Solar Sound\' s Paris branch. The founders want their gigs to make the idea of alternative energy feel concrete rather than theoretical. The choice of venue, too, often reflects an ethos of community and sustainability. The Paris event is taking place at a former hospital complex that is home to several social enterprises and an emergency shelter for people in need. In Tel Aviv, parties are put on near the central bus station, an area in the south of the city with a large community of refugees from Sudan and Eritrea. A group of these refugees played Sudanese music at the most recent event, explains Rubens Ben, co-founder of Solar Sound\' s Tel Aviv branch. The collective also takes the technology to schools and to international events, such as the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.  Most rhetoric and campaigns about energy are anxiety-inducing, says Carles.  They make people afraid, with talk of climate change and taxes. Here the idea is to have a celebration, to inverse this tendency we have to associate energy with feeling pressured. For us, energy is a party. The group\' s founders insist that their events are not mere raves for part-time bohemians and that they encourage people to use renewable energy. As they finish cycling, several people at the Paris event say the process has made them think more about energy consumption and alternative sources.  You see before your eyes how much energy the cycling and solar panels are producing and it plants an idea in people\' s heads, which they then think about later, says Mickael Rodrigues, a computer engineer, enjoying a beer next to the bikes. Some admit they are struggling to imagine how the technologies on show are viable energy sources for everyday use, while others flirt with using the bikes at home in a limited way.  It\' s never going to power the electricity in my whole apartment, but even as a supplement it\' s a good idea, says Nadim Bel Lallahom, a design consultant, following a cycling session.  I have quite a few friends who like biking, but in the winter it\' s so cold that they do home training and that is exactly the same system.  We have the power to plant the seeds, Carles says.  It is about showing people that this is one of the avenues. We don\' t say \' we have the solution\' , but we do say \' this is part of the solution\' . Carles concedes that producing larger quantities of energy by bike is both expensive and inefficient compared with some other renewables. Solar energy, in conjunction with an array of other renewables, is where he has real hope for the growth of a viable alternative to carbon. Wind and solar power are predicted to go from producing 5 per cent of the world\' s electricity today to 34 per cent by 2040, and the cost of electricity from photovoltaic panels is predicted to fall 66 per cent by then, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Storing generated energy for later use remains a significant challenge, Carles says. Energy is lost during the electricity conversion and storage processes, which is where he is focusing Atelier21\' s research.  [Storage] is the key, he says.  It\' s what\' s missing and what\' s very costly. \</doc>

Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency) on 26 June SUVA, June 26 (Xinhua) - The Fijian government said Monday [26 June] it recognised the importance and impacts that geo-science has played in engineering strategies to mitigate the unrelenting and imminent threats of climate change from the perception of geoscientists. Faiyaz Koya, minister for Industry, Trade, Tourism, Lands and Mineral Resources, highlighted this while opening the 2017 conference of Pacific Science, Technology and Resources (STAR) Network in Nadi. The week-long conference will allow regional experts and stakeholders to strengthen collaboration and reach concrete resolutions to outline the value in refreshing and animating scientific alliances to showcase useful work, techniques and instrumentation that may be adapted to address development issues of the Pacific region. "I urge you all to contribute positively to allow for concrete resolutions being reached to outline the value in refreshing and animating scientific alliances to showcase useful work, techniques and instrumentation that may be adapted to address development issues of the Pacific region," Koya told regional participants at the workshop. "This is by no means a small undertaking. It requires collaborative efforts to ensure that the Pacific realises opportunities for sustainable ocean development focusing on targeted growth that can be measured upon scientific principles and data." Founded in 1984 by South Pacific Applied Geo-science Commission (SOPAC) and UNESCO, the forum is an annual gathering of the region's experts in geo-science. The forum plays a vital role in mapping out local and regional adaptation programmes to further the region's collective struggles against the unforgiving effects of climate change. With Fiji presiding at the COP23 (Conference of Parties) in Germany, Koya said there is a need for a collective focus on showcasing climate action initiatives and innovation was all the more relevant here and now. "The future of the whole Pacific rests on all of our shoulders and we need to manoeuvre ourselves to ensure that viable advancements are experienced now, tomorrow and onwards to effectively address this world threatening risk," Koya added.

Text of report in English by Press Trust of India news agency on 11 March New Delhi, 11 Mar (PTI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi today called for concessional financing and less-risky funds for solar projects to raise the share of solar power in the energy basket, provide cheaper electricity and cut carbon emissions. Speaking at the founding conference of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), he said India will generate 175 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2022. This would be more than double the present renewable energy capacity and would be enough to overtake renewable expansion in the European Union for the first time. Modi, the chief architect of ISA that seeks to bring together 121 nations, presented 10 action points including making affordable solar technology available to all nations, raising the share of electricity generated from photovoltaic cells in the energy mix and framing regulations and standards to support the initiative. He said better and cheaper solar technology should be easily available to all nations. "We have to increase the share of solar in energy mix," he said. Also, innovation has to be encouraged so as to provide solutions to different needs. "We have to provide concessional financing and less-risky funds for solar projects," he said. The ISA's major objectives include global deployment of over 1,000 GW of solar generation capacity and mobilisation of investment of over 1 trillion dollars into solar energy by 2030. Regulatory aspects as well as standards have to be framed which will expedite adoption of solar solutions, Modi said, adding that consultancy support has to be development for putting up bankable solar projects in developing countries. Stressing on inclusiveness, he said a vast network of centres of excellence has to be created. Solar energy policy has to be to looked at in totality for development so that it can contribute to achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs), he said. "We have to strengthen ISA Secretariat and make it more professional." Modi called for rising above narrow private goals to make collective effort for the betterment of the mankind. He said India has launched the "world's biggest renewable energy programme with a target to generate 175 GW of electricity from renewable sources." Of these, 100 GW is to come from solar and 60 GW from wind. "Of the target for solar energy generation, we have already achieved 20 GW installed solar power," he said. India needs some 83bn dollars between FY2018 and FY2022 to meet its 175 GW target, according to industry estimates. Electricity from renewable sources is cheap, reliable and clean. Besides providing an alternative to polluting coal-based electricity generation, photovoltaic (PV) has big potential to power irrigation and reduce the use of back-up diesel generators. At present, the country's renewable energy installed capacity is 63 GW. Solar and wind power tariffs have dropped to an all-time low of Rs 2.44 per unit and Rs 3.46 per unit, among the lowest in the world. China is targeting over 360 GW of renewable capacity generation during the period. As a demonstration of India's commitment to ISA, Modi said 500 training slots will be created for member countries and a solar technology mission will be started to lead R&D in the sector. To supplement solar energy generation, India has distributed 28 crore [280 million] LED [light-emitting diodes; energy-saving] bulbs in the last three years which have helped save 2bn dollars and 4 GW of electricity, the prime minister said. ISA, headquartered in Gurgaon [city close to capital New Delhi] near here, is now a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation that was established following the Paris Declaration as an alliance dedicated to the promotion of solar energy among its member countries. The prime minister said of the 121 countries associated with ISA, 61 have joined the alliance and 32 have ratified the Framework Agreement. Indian 'vedas' [sacred Hindu texts] have since thousands of years considered sun as at soul of the universe and a nourisher of life. "We have to look at this ancient balanced and all-encompassing philosophy when when we today look for ways to deal with the challenge of climate change," he said. Modi had in a speech at London's Wembley Stadium in 2015 proposed the idea of an inter-governmental organization comprising of 121 countries, which lie either completely or partly between the two tropics, with an aim to promote solar energy. ISA was launched by him at the India Africa Summit in New Delhi and the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in October 2015 and November 2015, respectively. Today, heads of 23 nations and 10 ministerial representatives gathered here for alliance's first summit. The summit was co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron. Speaking on the occasion, Macron said 1 trillion dollars will be needed to achieve one terawatt (TW) of solar power capacity by 2030. "The development of solar energy will not just lead to our prosperity, but will also reduce the carbon footprint of the earth," Modi said today. Stating that better and affordable solar technology is available to all must be ensured, he said, results would be even better if other forms of energy are linked to solar. Solar energy can have a variety of uses - agriculture, solar water pumps, clean cooking. "We need to encourage innovation in the solar energy sector to find different uses for it," he said.

Interview:\~Hassan Sentissi HASSAN SENTISSI : Plan Halieutis outlined ambitions for the fisheries and seafood processing industry to achieve by 2020. These include bringing its contribution to GDP to Dh21.9bn ((EURO)2.03bn), significantly reducing informal activities and increasing our global fisheries market share by 2%, to $3.1bn ((EURO)2.6bn). Morocco is looking to increase production and employment opportunities. In the period between 2016 and 2017, we particularly noticed supply-chain improvements, with the quality of catches and landings greatly enhanced through the use of ice and standardised containers. This better enabled us to have higher-quality raw materials delivered to transformation plants. However, significantly more work must be done to modernise fishing fleets, offer education and training opportunities for seafarers and improve port infrastructure. There is also a need to accelerate the creation of competitiveness clusters in the northern and southern regions, which would enable us to further diversify into international markets. This would also encourage innovation and research and development in terms of preparation, products, packaging and marketing - particularly in the canning industry. Morocco has the potential to produce up to 1.2m tonnes of canned goods per year, and investments in research and development would enable us to reach this goal over the next few years. What are the biggest impediments to the development of domestic fish stocks? SENTISSI : Morocco's maritime areas accommodate authentic and unique species. It is the world's leading exporter and producer of sardines. Therefore, there are enormous efforts to be made in terms of innovation, from production to commercialisation. However, the richness of the sea fluctuates, and Morocco is wary of overfishing as it can be a detriment to the ecosystem that the industry and fish both rely upon. As a result, there are limits of up to 20% of fish stocks to allow species to develop. In the Mediterranean, for example, a variety of stocks, such as red mullets, anchovies and sardines, are depleted as a result of overfishing, and therefore protecting these types of fish could go a long ways towards not only protecting the species, but mitigating the negative effects of ocean pollution on stockpiling and development. Though the effects have not been exactly measured yet, Morocco has already committed itself to take action against ocean pollution following the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change and the Blue Belt Initiative. What is still lacking, however, is a well-defined and disseminated strategy. In what ways is the fishing industry diversifying and innovating its capabilities? SENTISSI : The fisheries segment is increasingly looking to diversify its products and capabilities. Recycling and maximising the use of resources is another goal for the industry. Resulting from growth fuelled by various sectors, every bit of the fish can be used. For instance, the Department of Fisheries launched tender bids for canning factories at Boujdour and Dakhla to develop more innovative products. We have also been solicited by other African countries to help create investment and development strategies for their fishery segments, because fishing has such a long tradition in the kingdom. The fish canning industry, for example, dates back to the 1920s. We have since developed a knowledge and mastery of seafood processing. Our port infrastructures have developed; our factories are highly rated according to international standards; and export market demand has increased each year. \</doc>

African campaigners have called for the US to be kicked out of crucial international climate talks because of Donald Trump's lack of support for green policies. The Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) has organised a petition in favour of the US delegation being barred from the UN negotiations in response to Mr Trump's decision to pull his country out of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The group claims the US has no right to be involved in discussions on how the agreement should be implemented given that it has chosen to opt-out of the deal. Read more Trump is not invited to our next climate change summit, says France "Trump's agenda is to dismantle the Paris Agreement," said Mithika Mwenda, secretary general of PACJA. "You're either with the people or with Trump." Negotiators should "not give Trump the platform to rock the boat from within" he added, according to Climate Home News. The UN's two-week annual climate change summit, known as the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) is taking place in Bonn, Germany, and is the first since Mr Trump was elected. In June, the Republican announced that he would be withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement - a move he had long threatened to make. The agreement is signed by 195 countries and states that global warming must be limited to "well below" 2C. It also provides for wealthier countries supporting poorer countries to cut their carbon emissions.

Mr Trump has hinted that he could "re-engage" the US with the Paris Agreement at a later date, if he is able to re-negotiate his country's responsibilities under the deal. \</doc>

December 5, 2017 Soil is a major carbon storage system, essential for sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation, the United Nations agriculture agency said Tuesday, launching on World Soil Day a comprehensive global map showing the amount of carbon stocks contained in soil. "Soil is the foundation of agriculture , it is where food begins," said Maria Helena Semedo, Deputy Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). "Maintaining the soil's important functions and ecosystem services to support food production and increase resilience to a changing climate calls for sustainable soil management practices," she added. Soil organic matter, with carbon as its main component, is crucial to soil health and fertility, water infiltration and retention as well as food production. The world's soils act as the largest terrestrial carbon sink, reducing greenhouse gases. Intensifying its role could significantly offset the rapid rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In an historic decision on agriculture, the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn ( COP23 ) recognized the need for improved soil carbon, soil health and soil fertility. The Global Soil Organic Carbon Map, the most comprehensive to date, illustrates the amount of organic carbon stock in the first 30 cm of soil - revealing natural areas with high carbon storage that require conservation along with regions where further sequestration would be possible. This information can prove a powerful tool to guide decision-making on practices aimed to preserve and increase the current soil carbon stocks - helping win the fight against climate change. The map shows that globally the first 30 cm of soil contains around 680 billion tons of carbon - almost double the amount present in our atmosphere. The degradation of one third of the world's soils has already prompted an enormous release of carbon into the atmosphere. Restoring these soils can remove up to 63 billion tons of carbon, significantly reducing the effects of climate change. FAO's Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils supported the map's development, including by putting together the national carbon maps of more than 100 countries, making a concrete contribution towards Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15, Life on Earth. The next step is for countries to monitor their national soil information systems for organic carbon levels to make evidence-based decisions on how to manage and monitor their soils. \</doc>

Some impacts of global warming - such as sea level rise and coastal flooding - are already locked in and unavoidable, according to a major research project. Global temperatures have already risen by around 1-degreeC, and a further 0.5-degreeC warming is expected. The full impacts of current warming have not yet been seen, since ice sheets and oceans take many decades to fully react to higher temperatures. But more severe impacts can still be avoided if global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. More than 50 scientists from 16 institutions in 13 countries have worked on the HELIX project (High-End Climate Impacts and Extremes), which has just finished after four years. The project examined the possible effects of warming of 1.5-degreeC, 2-degreeC, 4-degreeC and 6-degreeC compared to pre-industrial levels. Even with rapid cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions keeping warming below 2-degreeC, sea levels could rise by 0.5m by the end of the 21st Century, particularly affecting small island states and low-lying countries. HELIX calculations suggest this could impact 2.5 million in Bangladesh. However, if emissions continue and global warming exceeds 4-degreeC, sea levels will rise further and could impact around 12 million people in Bangladesh if a storm surge from tropical cyclones adds further to the impact. Increased rainfall is expected to further compound the flooding risk by raising river levels. 'A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, so rainfall would be more intense,' said HELIX project leader Professor Richard Betts, of the University of Exeter. 'This would inevitably mean more flooding, and our research suggests the largest increase in flood risk would be in parts of America, Asia and Europe.' At 4-degreeC, the researchers say most countries - nations accounting for 73% of world's population 79% of the global GDP - could experience a five-fold increase in river flood risk and flood damage (compared to a baseline period 1976-2005). HELIX scientists advised EU officials before the signing of the Paris Agreement, in which 195 countries pledged to keep warming 'well below' 2-degreeC. And the research findings suggest this would limit flooding risk - though the risk would still double at 1.5-degreeC and rise by 170% at 2-degreeC. Professor Beets added: 'This wetter climate should also mean fewer droughts in some areas, though droughts could become more common in other areas - for example some parts of Africa and southern Europe.' This complex picture of different effects in different areas also applies in terms of crop production. 'Some places will do better and some will do worse,' Professor Betts said. 'For example, with warming of 4-degreeC, some parts of Europe would have improved production of certain crops, while other crops would be harder to grow. In Britain, it would become harder to grow wheat but easier to grow maize. 'Overall, worldwide food security would be more at risk, not just from changing crop yields but because extreme weather affects the people who grow the crops.' HELIX used sophisticated computer models and vast datasets to produce its projections. Professor Betts said: 'It is clear that humanity has a huge challenge to deal with here. 'The countries of the world have agreed to try to minimise global warming, and the debate has now moved on to exactly how to achieve this is - but we will have to live with some changes that are already unavoidable.' Case study: Warming 'will cause more floods in Bangladesh' Global warming will make river flooding more common and more severe around one of Asia's major rivers, according to research carried out as part of the HELIX project. Scientists compared likely flooding around the Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh at different levels of warming - and found it would be happen more during the wetter months from January to August at 2-degreeC compared to 1.5-degreeC (compared to pre-industrial levels). The research, carried out by Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, also suggests that there will be fewer periods of low water levels in the drier months from September to December. The Brahmaputra, which flows through China and India, is Bangladesh's main source of fresh water but is prone to flooding - and earlier this year floods killed scores of people and caused widespread destruction. Bangladesh's flat, low-lying landscape makes it very vulnerable to flooding, and therefore to climate change. Large-scale flooding risks arise from two sources - high river flows and rising sea levels. The Brahmaputra River is a major cause of nationwide flooding in Bangladesh, but it is also crucial in terms of people's access to water and food. The findings about flood risk are a real concern, as floods have historically caused catastrophic damage in Bangladesh in terms of loss of life, damage to crops, destruction of infrastructure and hindrance to economic growth. University of Exeter at UN climate talks Experts from the University of Exeter - including members of the HELIX team - have been at the COP23 UN climate change conference this week. Alongside COP23 , the university also participated in Development and Climate Days 2017, a meeting that brings together policy makers, international development professionals, businesses and researchers to develop ideas and actions to influence UNFCCC discussions and outcomes.

Mud, mud, glorious mud, as any hippo knows, is good for cooling the blood. Scottish research has found that it is also significant for its capacity to absorb and store carbon for cooling the planet. Climate change experts at St Andrews University have concluded that the sediment at the bottom of Scotland's sea lochs is better at storing carbon long-term than peatland. Bill Austin, who co-authored the study, said the findings added to a growing body of evidence that highlighted the "absolute" need to safeguard "Scotland's forgotten mud" if the nation is to meet environmental targets. Professor Austin, whose ongoing work is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "The headline figures are very large: about 650 megatonnes (Mt) of carbon stored naturally in sea-loch sediments, which is not as much as Scotland's peatlands [which store an estimated 1620Mt], but sea-loch sediments are significantly more effective at storing carbon over long timescales than the peatlands. These sediments have an important but as yet largely unaccounted role to play in helping Scotland to meet its greenhouse gas and climate targets." He added: "Protecting these environments for this unseen service of carbon capture and storage really does make a lot of sense. Bottom trawling of fishing gear is certainly disturbing [them] and almost certainly reducing effective carbon storage potential." The study also found that some of the carbon lost from peatlands damaged by activities such as historic peat cutting for fires or modern wind farm schemes has been absorbed by sea-loch sediment, offering a "second chance" to protect it. Open Seas, a Scottish environmental group campaigning for sustainable fishing, backed the call to protect these environments, warning that the "precious" mud and wider ecosystem was at risk from trawling. Phil Taylor, its head of policy, said that the government should be "rightly proud" of its marine protected areas for safeguarding habitat and wildlife, but the "precious carbon stores" within the sea bed in those areas had no protection. "These fundamentally important reserves are regularly disturbed and degraded. If we are to achieve our ambitious and worthy carbon targets, we need to shine a light down into the murky depths," he said. Earlier this year, scallop dredgers were banned from a Highland sea loch after an endangered reef with designated flame shell beds was damaged. A marine conservation order was put in place banning mobile gear fisheries, such as dredgers, from the area, initially for one year. The call to protect sea beds coincided with growing pressure on the Scottish government to set a deadline for the nation to become emissions-free, following a key UN conference on climate change this week. Speaking at the event, in Germany, Nicola Sturgeon pledged an early decision on that deadline but stopped short of announcing a date. Friends of the Earth Scotland said that Scottish targets must reflect "our fair share of global efforts", including "zero emissions by 2040". The Scottish government repeated its commitment to pioneering work on global warming, including restoring peatland and improving understanding of marine carbon stores. Climate change secretary Roseanna Cunningham repeated a commitment to the goal for net zero emissions. However, she warned that it was "important for targets to be credible and achievable." \</doc>

LONDON (ICIS)--Norway s largest pension company, KLP, is withdrawing from investments in companies that have significant revenue from oil sands, it said on Thursday. The company said that it made the decision following a review of the climate and environmental risks related to unconventional oil and gas extraction. Those risks were as great as those for extracting coal. KLP withdrew from coal investments in 2014. Coal and oil sands extraction were not compatible with the 2015 Paris climate agreement, it added. Specifically, KLP decided not to invest in companies with 30% or more of revenues from oil sands extraction, or in companies in which combined revenues exceed 30% from oil sands and coal extraction, it said. KLP did not identify any companies or countries. But it said it would announce a list of affected companies next year. Oil sands can be found in Venezuela, the US, and Russia, but the Athabasca deposit in Canada's Alberta province is the world's largest, and the country is a big producer of oil-sands-based fuels. KLP's move comes as a number of companies, including Norwegian energy major Statoil, have [1]exited or reduced investments and activities in Canada s oil-sands sector. Canada s federal government under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau supports the Paris climate deal, but, at the same time, it keeps defending the oil-sands industry. By contrast, Canada last month [2]joined an alliance of countries that pledges to phase out the use of coal. For Canada s chemical producers the oil-sands sector is a market for a number of chemicals and products. At the same time, the oil-sands industry generates large volumes of sulphur, for use in chemical and related production. Also, chemical producers are looking to off-gases from upgrading oil sands as a source of feedstock to supply existing plants, as well as expansions and new plants. In a [3]report earlier on Thursday, the country s chemical industry trade group again underlined the importance of the oil and gas sector for chemical firms.

Fighting climate change in Africa: AfDB launches Africa NDC Hub with 10 partners. Africa Day, held on 15 November within COP23 in Bonn, was the springboard for the official launch of Africa NDC Hub, the African Platform for Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This African Development Bank (AfDB) initiative is intended to help the 54 African countries fulfil their commitments under the Paris Agreement, in other words, to put their respective NDCs into action without neglecting their own development priorities. 'This platform is a response to requests made by various African countries,' said Amadou Hott, AfDB vice president for electricity, energy, climate change and green growth, as he unveiled the new initiative to a gathering of Heads of State, ministers, policy makers and representatives of civil society, among others, from across the continent. 'It should be seen as an 'opportunity to accelerate investment in climate action in Africa through NDCs,' he said, noting that it will facilitate 'better coordination among partners to provide a collective and effective response', for and by the whole of Africa. This platform should be a catalyst for concessional funding for climate-related projects in Africa which will, in turn, help raise private finance. This is a most timely initiative, bearing in mind that, US$ 4 billion will be required to implement the NDCs, according to recent studies, While all 54 African countries signed the Paris Agreement, 43 have ratified it and 53 (the exception being Libya) have submitted their NDCs, 85% of which are conditional upon financial aid from abroad while only 15% are on the basis of domestic budgets. And Africa is already the poor orphan when it comes to world climate funding, capturing less than 5% of the total. Thus, the announcement of this new platform was warmly welcomed. To date, Africa NDC Hub has 10 partners other than AfDB: the African Union Commission (AUC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the International Institute for the Environment and Development (IIED) and the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

BONN (Alliance News) - Top-level talks on climate change in the western German city of Bonn proved fruitful as officials attending the two-week conference agreed on funding after a night of drawn-out negotiations. Officials representing 195 nations, from major industrial powerhouses to tiny island states, agreed on various funding issues at the end of session that lasted until Saturday morning. The participating countries cleared the way for the Adaptation Fund, which was established as part of the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 to finance projects in developing countries, to become part of the 2015 Paris accord. The fund provides financial assistance to developing countries which are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. How to finance projects for poor countries to cope with global warming was a main sticking point at the talks. The delegations attending the conference drafted rules to implement the Paris accord, including how CO2 emissions are to be measured and reported in the future. The key aim of the meeting had been to give fresh momentum to implementing the Paris accord on reducing CO2 emissions after US President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the landmark agreement. Patricia Espinosa, the UN's climate chief since 2016, said that the Bonn conference had shown that the fight against climate change remained "an unstoppable movement" despite the US withdrawal. " COP23 in Bonn came against a backdrop of severe and unprecedented natural calamities that hit homes, families and economies in Asia, the Caribbean and the Americas - these reminded us of the urgency of our collective task," she said. Berlin co-hosted the Bonn conference with the Pacific island state of Fiji. Along with Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, Fiji faces an existential threat from global warming as water levels rise. Under the Paris agreement, signatory nations are committed to reducing global warming over the longer term to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Also on\~Saturday, a spokesman for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change told dpa that as many as 10 participants in the Bonn talks filed complaints of sexual harassment during the conference. Nick Nuttall said that the alleged victims registered the incidents with either the police or members of the UN's security personnel, who informed them of their legal options. He added that there was nothing to suggest anyone would press charges. By Christoph Driessen, dpa Copyright dpa \</doc>

What is happening? The world's nations are meeting for the 23rd annual "conference of the parties" (COP) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which aims to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system", ie halt global warming. It is taking place in Bonn, Germany from 6-17 November. Why does it matter? Climate change is already significantly increasing the likelihood of extreme weather, from heatwaves to floods. But without sharp cuts to global carbon emissions, we can expect " severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts " for billions of people and the natural world. The landmark Paris agreement at COP21 in 2015 delivered the first truly global deal to tackle climate change, but national action needs to be significantly toughened to meet to goal of keeping global temperature rise to well below 2C, and 1.5C if possible. All the science, and the battering that extreme weather has inflicted this year from floods in India and Nigeria to hurricanes in the Caribbean and wildfires in the US and Europe, indicates that global emissions need to start falling urgently - in the next few years. The Paris agreement set out principles, but not the details, with one diplomat likening it to having a brilliant new smartphone but no operating system. The Bonn meeting will be vital in building the rules that will enable the Paris deal to work. What's new? Hasn't Donald Trump pulling the US out of the Paris agreement scuppered hopes of progress? No. As the world's second biggest polluter and richest nation, the US is important. But when President Trump announced the US withdrawal in June - it takes effect in 2020 - the UN's chief climate negotiator, who delivered the Paris deal, ended up thanking him. "It provoked an unparalleled wave of support for the treaty," said Christiana Figueres. "He shored up the world's resolve on climate action, and for that we can all be grateful." The US now seems very isolated - only war-torn Syria is also outside the Paris deal. What role they will play in Bonn is largely unknown, though promotion of coal and gas as climate solutions is planned. Rumours that the climate-sceptic head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, would lead the US delegation proved unfounded however. One COP veteran said: "The mood on the ground is it is going to be OK: the US is not going to be a pain in the arse. They still don't know what they actually want." Nazhat Shameem Khan, Fiji's chief negotiator was even less diplomatic when asked about dealing with the US: "You can have a dialogue [even] with somebody who is an axe murderer." In any case, many US states, cities and businesses have pledged to honour the Paris deal and will have a high profile in Bonn. Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he will pay the $15m in UNFCCC administration costs if the US government does not. What needs to be done? The current pledges for carbon cuts by the world's nations would mean at least 3C of global warming and severe damage. So the Paris agreement included a mechanism for the pledges to be reviewed and ratcheted up, but without setting the rules. The vital groundwork for this has to be done in Bonn before being finalised in 2018. Without serious preparation to build trust and agreement, deals don't get done, as the failed COP in Copenhagen in 2009 showed. Fiji has renamed the ratchet talks process from the bland "facilitative dialogue" to the "talanoa dialogue" after a Pacific island concept of using storytelling and talking as a way to make good decisions. Could there be flashpoints? Yes. There are deep and longstanding tensions over the issue of "loss and damage", the idea that developing nations should be compensated for destruction resulting from climate change which they did little or nothing to cause. "The principle is one of compensation because the western countries developed their economies at the expense of the planet and of poor people," says Dorothy Grace Guerrero, at campaign group Global Justice Now. The stakes are heightened further as some developing nations feel they lost out in the Paris agreement which, unlike previous deals, does not impose legally binding commitments on rich nations. There is a strand of the negotiations tackling this - the Warsaw mechanism - but they have a " glaring omission ", according to aid groups: no money. The rich nations are opposed to loss and damage payments, seeing them as similar to calls for reparations for slavery. The issue is highly charged and needs to be resolved to prevent harm spreading to other areas of negotiation. Widespread and cheap insurance against extreme weather is a compromise being heavily pushed by western nations, for example the G7's InsuResilience initiative aimed at helping 400 million of the world's poorest people. But it is unclear how insurance could solve slow and inevitable problems like overwhelming sea-level rise on low-level coasts. What about the funds already pledged to help poorer nations? Rich nations had already pledged to provide $100bn a year by 2020 to help poorer nations restrict their emissions as they grow and adapt to climate change. But there are rows about what kind of funding should be counted and indeed whether $100bn is enough. The US was expected to be a big contributor and so a question to be tackled in Bonn is whether other countries will pick up the tab. Who else turns up for the COP? Nations do the negotiating but business groups pledging action also attend, such as the Renewable Energy 100 and We Mean Business, and in Bonn the California governor Jerry Brown and Bloomberg are expected to make a splash with an announcement about their America's Pledge initiative on 11 November. The presence of big fossil fuel companies is always controversial: detractors say their lobbying hinders progress while defenders say the low-carbon revolution won't happen without getting them on board. The civil society groups that are always a big part of every COP will protest on this issue, in particular against the lignite coal industry near Bonn that still provides a lot of Germany's power. "Some of our guests will be fairly surprised to see just how much Germany still relies on coal," says Annalena Baerbock, climate spokesperson of Germany's Green party. NGOs also pressure nations to increase their ambition and aid smaller nations that lack the negotiating resources of the bigger countries. COPs are certainly becoming broader, with Figueres saying: "Paris is everyone's deal. It belongs to cities, businesses, NGOs and all of global civil society as much as it belongs to nation-states." Won't the Bonn summit have a massive carbon footprint? There will be 10,000 government delegates, another 8,000 people from other groups and 2,000 members of the media travelling to Bonn from all over the globe. The organisers are trying to avoid as many emissions as possible, for example by using electric buses for conference transport. But the emissions that can't be avoided will be offset, mainly using UN-certified schemes in small island states, in recognition of Fiji's presidency of the COP. So what represents success in Bonn? An editorial in the leading science journal Nature, which calls the Paris accord a "triumph", puts it succinctly: "In theory, the annual climate roller coaster is idling through one of the low-key phases in which success is measured by nothing going wrong. In practice, the Bonn meeting will serve as a litmus test of how the rest of the world plans to stand united [without the US] and to keep the spirit of Paris alive." \</doc>

A ground-breaking approach to climate risk management has been developed by Deutsche Asset Management in partnership with California-based climate intelligence advisory firm Four Twenty Seven. Four Twenty Seven has mapped the physical locations of more than one million corporate facilities globally and uses climate science models to assess the likelihood of them being affected by climate hazards such as heatwaves, floods and cyclones. This means that exposure to catastrophic events for individual companies can now be calculated. This is the first time the physical location of corporate facilities and their exposure to climate-related events have been mapped for investment purposes. Deutsche AM will now be able to integrate a company's physical climate risk equity score within new investment products, and assess the implications of climate events for individual companies in its portfolios. The scoring methodology identifies and categorises the location, activity and business sensitivity of facilities or companies to climate hazards. Climate science models are then applied to assess the geographical exposure to climate hazards. The business impact of these is measured from an operations, supply chain and market risk perspective. The data can be analysed, for example, to look at how rising sea levels could affect coastal and offshore oil and gas infrastructure, how floods could disrupt supply chains, or whether extreme heat affects labour productivity in the agricultural and construction sectors. 'The availability of this new data on physical climate risk is a major step forward to addressing a serious and growing risk for investors. Climate risk is now centre stage, however we believe the investment industry needs to champion the disclosure of annual and once-in-a-lifetime climate risks by companies. We have a duty to understand what more hurricanes or heatwaves mean for valuations and investment returns,' said Nicolas Moreau, Head of Deutsche Asset Management (pictured). This new approach, and the physical climate threat to investment portfolios, is outlined in a research paper by Four Twenty Seven and Deutsche AM that was launched as the COP23 climate conference in Bonn gets underway. It tackles physical risk head on, giving credible insight into the vulnerability of corporate production and retail sites to climate change. Factors such as sea level rise, droughts, flooding and cyclones pose an immediate and measurable threat to investment portfolios. Whilst no location is immune from the risks of physical climate change, the research paper highlights Asia as particularly vulnerable. Five out of six people occupying the highest climate risk zones globally live in Asia, with 145 million people in China living on land threatened by rising seas.

The Boards of Directors of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), on Wednesday, 8 November 2017, approved the Africa Thriving and Resilient: The Bank Group's Second Climate Change Action Plan, 2016-2020 (CCAP2). The approval of this document is propitious as it echoes the on-going discussions at COP23 in Bonn, Germany to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change and achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5C. The African continent is a minor contributor to global warming but is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change that threatens its economic development. However, the continent also has enormous opportunities to build resilience to climate change as well as transition towards low-carbon development. The commitment of the African continent to contribute to global solutions to climate change is demonstrated by the fact that all 54 countries have submitted their 'Intended National Determined Contribution' under the Paris Agreement, and 43 of these countries have actually ratified the Agreement. The CCAP2 is designed to incorporate the Bank's High 5 priorities in the Paris Agreement, the 2030 development agenda, the Bank's Green Growth Framework and the lessons learned in the implementation of the first climate change action plan (CCAP1), 2011-2015 Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank said: 'The approval of the CCAP2 by the Board today sends a clear message on the Bank's commitment to helping African countries to mobilize resources to support the implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions of our Regional Member Countries in a way that will not hinder their development.' The strategic vision of CCAP2 is to enable the achievement of 'low - carbon and climate-resilient' development in Africa. It has four Pillars: Mitigation, Adaptation, Climate Finance and a Cross Cutting Pillar that addresses technology transfer, capacity development, institutional reforms as well as other cross-cutting activities that will create of the enabling environment for its successful implementation. 'Over the next four years, the AfDB hopes to achieve the objectives set out in the CCAP2, to help our member countries to be developed and resilient while keeping Africa a low-emitting continent,' said Amadou Hott, Vice President of the Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth Complex. The interventions identified under CCAP2 aim at bringing economic prosperity to African communities within safe planetary boundaries, including the boundaries imposed by climate change. Achieving this requires substantial investments from the Bank and its partners.

French ferry operator Brittany Ferries has claimed to be the first shipping company to benefit from the European Union's recently instituted Green Shipping Guarantee scheme. Thanks to the scheme, it is to receive financing totalling EUR142.5 million (USD166.7 million) towards the acquisition of its future, new LNG-powered car ferry, Honfleur, which is due into service in April 2019 on its line between Caen in France and the British south coast port of Portsmouth. The EUR750 million guarantee scheme was set up by the European Investment Bank (EIB) last year with the support of the EUR315 billion Investment Plan for Europe, announced by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014, and the Connecting Europe Facility. Under the terms of the scheme, the EIB concluded an EUR150 million guarantee facility with France's Soci\'e9t\'e9 G\'e9n\'e9rale bank for the promotion of newbuilding and ship modernisation projects aimed at making shipping more sustainable and environment-friendly in line with the objectives set by the United Nations COP21 climate conference in Paris in December 2015. Soci\'e9t\'e9 G\'e9n\'e9rale acted as principal arranger for the EUR142.6 million loan, of which EUR49.5 million has been guaranteed directly by the EIB. EIB vice president Ambroise Fayolle said, "This is a particularly innovative financing, successfully carried out thanks to the European guarantee under the Juncker Plan, the support of the CEF (Connecting Europe Facility) and Soci\'e9t\'e9 G\'e9n\'e9rale's pilot role in this sector." Speaking on 12 December, Brittany Ferries chair Jean-Marc Rou\'e9 said that Brittany Ferries was proud to be the first shipping company to benefit from the new EIB-Soci\'e9t\'e9 G\'e9n\'e9rale financing facility, as well as the first French passenger shipping company to take the path to energy transition through the use of LNG as fuel. "Located in four European countries (France, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain), Brittany Ferries is a truly European company," he said, "and places its ambition to lead by example at the top of its priorities, as the recent COP23 requested of both states and businesses." Brittany Ferries announced in June that it was ordering the new LNG-powered vessel from Germany's Fleinsburger Schiffbau Gesellschaft (FSG). It said at the time that it had allocated up to EUR200 million for the project. Honfleur will have capacity for 1,680 passengers and 257 cabins. It is expected to be the largest ship of its type operating in the English Channel. In the absence of an adequate LNG supply infrastructure, however, Brittany Ferries has struck an agreement with the Total oil group, which provides for the new vessel to carry its own gas in 40 ft containers. This will enable loading and unloading according to requirement at the port of Caen-Ouistreham. \</doc>

Interview:\~Abdul Hussain bin Ali Mirza How will current developments impact the longterm fitness of the sector? ABDUL HUSSAIN BIN ALI MIRZA: Construction on the new 400-KV transmission network, the installation of the high-voltage switchgears and the balance of the plant is ongoing. We are hoping we will be in a position to start commissioning the new network in the first half of 2018. The new transmission network will overlay the existing 220-KV network and will allow for the expansion and resilience of the 220-KV system - facilitating the economical transfer of bulk power within the kingdom of Bahrain and with the GCC grid. Peak system demand in 2020 is expected to reach around 4500 MW in the base case scenario. This infrastructure development will allow capacity to meet the future needs of new developments, housing projects and increased demand across the kingdom. How effective have subsidy cuts been in shifting local demand and reducing domestic consumption? ALI MIRZA: undefined In terms of electricity production, we have a capacity of nearly 3921 MW, with our highest peak summer demand during 2016 recorded at 3418 MW. The total energy production during 2016 was 17,068 GWh, with the total gas consumption for electricity production around 4.9bn cu metres. The number of customers in 2016 (399,303) increased by around 4.6% compared to the previous year. Residential customers currently account for 47% of energy consumption and almost 75% of water consumption annually. While our generation capacity held up well during the critical summer months of 2016, with continuing population and economic growth, overall use of energy resources in Bahrain is projected to increase. Over the past few years subsidies have been gradually rationalised in order to reduce government spending and promote more efficient usage. The impact of reduced local consumption and increased exports can be significant, given sustained low oil prices and the current budget constraints, so further progress is needed in this area. What role can the development of green technologies play in the energy and utilities market? ALI MIRZA: UN Conference on Climate Change agreement. Our government is working to devise strategies to conserve natural resources, improve energy efficiency and diversify the energy mix in order to ensure a viable economic development of the kingdom. A Sustainable Energy Unit was created to establish strategies, policies and legislation that will promote energy efficiency and increase the production of energy from renewable sources, as well as reduce pollution from gas-fired thermal power plants. This think tank is now bearing fruit, with the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan receiving the endorsement of the Council of the Ministers. The implementation of these falls under the Ministry of Electricity and Water Affairs and includes,among other targets, a 5% contribution from renewable energies by 2025, rising to 10% by 2035. The private sector has a lot to contribute in this area through the development of new technologies and more efficient means of implementation. As green technologies become cheaper and more economically viable, they will take on a greater role in the energy production and consumption calculus. \</doc>

Interview:\~Peter Bartlett PETER BARTLETT: The increased processing capacity is only one aspect of the BMP, which includes expanding the capability to refine "bottom-of-the-barrel" crude and increasing efficiency while reducing environmental impact. Growing refining capacity creates the opportunity to expand exports and direct additional refined oil towards local downstream industries like lubricants and petrochemicals. Bahrain's geographic proximity to regional markets and access to global trade is an advantage for exporting not only oil, but also value-added products. How has oil price volatility affected the sector? Oil volatility has had a significant impact on the global energy industry, and has forced countries and companies that rely on oil, either for revenue or for energy, to adjust to this. Despite this shift, hydrocarbons will continue to be significant contributors to both the energy mix and the economy for the foreseeable future. They are complemented, rather than hurt, by alternative energies, which can enable a greater portion of oil and gas to be exported or sent downstream. In addition to the BMP, which provides large-scale investment in efficiency and modernisation, Bahrain is exploring prospects for offshore hydrocarbon. Volatility is perhaps a blessing in disguise, because it has had two main consequences. First, it has spurred interest in developing both efficiency and a sustainable energy mix. There has been a push to implement new technologies, increase recovery, and make better use of crude in ways that can reduce energy consumed and emissions produced during the recovery and refining process. Second, it has inspired a push towards diversification of the sector into new sources of energy production. A sustainable energy mix requires the use of alternative energies, as well as more traditional sources such as oil. What role will alternative energy play in the domestic energy mix, and how will this take shape? BARTLETT: A sizeable shift towards renewable energy is anticipated during the next two decades, but oil and gas are set to remain a significant energy source through 2040, making up at least 50% of the global energy mix. Different forms of energy will compete on affordability, sustainability and security of supply. The Bahrain Economic Vision 2030 emphasises sustainability and the kingdom is a signatory to the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change . For the energy sector this means improving efficiency and developing alternative sources of energy to reduce emissions. The domestic energy mix will include cleaner, more efficiently produced fossil fuels, supplemented with renewables. For example, a solar project is being carried out for BAPCO, the National Oil and Gas Authority, the Electricity and Water Authority and the University of Bahrain. The improvements in technology and the BMP both aid in increasing the resilience and reducing the environmental effects of our operations. Sustainability goes further to be ever more respectful of all stakeholder groups, and includes safety and efficiency improvements through digitisation in all parts of the value chain. Furthermore, education and training are becoming increasingly important as the sector continues to re-engineer itself at an accelerating pace. \</doc>

\~ For up to a year in 2015 and 2016 Moroccans were prevented from making free voice calls using voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) apps, which have become a key communication tool across most telecoms markets. It was a contentious decision that led to vociferous objections among consumers. By November 2016 the ban was reversed and the use of VoIP apps was permitted. The reversal was welcomed by users, but not before the ban had a negative impact on the economy and cemented the image of a sector regulator working more to ensure operators' profits than quality of service. BACKGROUND: The move became official in January 2016, after Moroccan telecoms operators had begun blocking the use of VoIP apps such as Skype, Viber and voice calls on WhatsApp in late 2015. The National Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (Agence Nationale de R\'e9glementation des T\'e9l\'e9communications, ANRT) supported these actions through an official decree, wherein it stated that only operators with an authorised telecoms licence would be able to provide communications services within the kingdom. By March 2016 the ban was extended to include fixed internet home connections. The decision was strongly contested by Moroccan consumers, who for years had been able to use free voice apps for both domestic and international calls. The ban and its reversal were further surrounded by speculation after the ANRT allowed VoIP calls almost immediately before the country was set to host the November 2016 COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change in Marrakech. Besides pressure from Moroccan consumers, who criticised the ban on social media and organised online petitions, a study published by US-based think tank the Brookings Institution in early October 2016 might also have had an effect. The report estimated that the cost of Morocco's VoIP ban for the economy reached as high as $320m. The same study looked at the negative consequences of 81 temporary internet shutdowns in 19 different countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Iraq and Turkey, among others. According to the Brookings Institution, the total loss to GDP from those bans amounted to $2.4bn globally between July 2015 and June 2016. LEGAL BACKLASH: The VoIP ban even led to a lawsuit filed in April 2016 against the ANRT by an unnamed mobile user in the eastern city of Oujda. The plaintiff's lawyer told local press that the case was based on the fact that the VoIP ban had been implemented to protect Maroc Telecom. Whether it was domestic backlash, the economic costs, fear of bad publicity ahead of the UN summit or a combination of all of these elements, the episode has underlined the importance of having an impartial regulator. In Morocco's case, the decision to ban VoIP apps was immediately perceived by the public as a transfer of financial resources from users to operators. This was especially troublesome due to the fact that the Moroccan government is an important shareholder in Maroc Telecom. In telecoms, as in other sectors, regulatory decisions that can be interpreted as self-serving significantly reduce a watchdog's credibility. Over the long term a divestment of state participation in the telecoms sector and a strengthening of the regulator's independence will be critical to expanding internet usage and access across the kingdom. \</doc>

\~ Prior to hosting the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change , Morocco announced the Initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change (AAA), which seeks to channel international funding into the sector. Launched in April 2016, it promotes projects to improve soil management, agricultural water control, capacity building, climate risk management and funding solutions targeting smallholder farmers. Funded by Group Cr\'e9dit Agricole du Maroc, the AAA builds on domestic agricultural success. The kingdom has invested in research and development, and technologies to boost yields and production quality. It already leads efforts to adapt to climate change through SouthSouth cooperation innovative insurance instruments. With six of the 10 countries set to be most affected by climate change, the continent is relatively vulnerable. Yields could fall 20% by 2050 if the sector does not adapt. Africa only receives 5% of climate funds, 4% of which go to agriculture and 20% to adaptation projects. FUNDING: A coalition of 27 African countries, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the African Development Bank (AfDB) support the initiative, which promotes instruments such as technology transfer, policymaking, project implementation and South-South cooperation. According to an AfDB study, it will cost an estimated $20bn-30bn annually until 2030 to adapt to climate change in Africa. However, if climate-sensitive practices are adopted, annual sector production could increase from $280bn to $880bn by 2030. The initiative still needs to gain further traction and secure funding. REGIONAL REFERENCE: The national agricultural policy, the Green Morocco Plan (Plan Maroc Vert, PMV), has generated international interest. "Sustainable development and climate change are at the centre of the PMV," Hamid Felloun, director of projects at the Agency for Agricultural Development (Agence pour le D\'e9veloppement Agricole, ADA), which oversees implementation of the PMV, told OBG. "The PMV outlines a series of key measures through which this goal is pursued." According to Felloun, this includes supporting pillar-two, community-oriented initiatives; securing water resources, particularly through the National Irrigation Water Saving Programme and the Irrigation Extension Programme; incentivising the rational use of fertilisers, certified seeds and irrigation systems; and valuing research results and facilitating their transfer to producers, especially for pillar-two projects. GREEN CLIMATE FUND: In efforts to adapt to climate change, the country has benefitted from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), established in 2010 under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The GCF has approved three domestic projects in 2016 and 2017, resulting in grants worth a total of $94.7m. These have also been supported by the Adaptation Fund, launched in 2010 under the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC. The country received its first grant from the fund, worth $10m, in April 2014. SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION: Morocco is active in South-South cooperation. "ADA has received a request to support the Chadian Special Environment Fund in its accreditation to the Adaptation Fund and has provided assistance to the Democratic Republic of Congo with the elaboration of eight concept notes and two funding proposals for submission to the GCF," Felloun told OBG. "Additionally, following a GCF meeting in South Korea, ADA has offered to support the Comoros and Guinea-Bissau in their GCF project proposals." CLIMATE RISK INSURANCE: Morocco is set to help develop an index-based parametric insurance against climate change risks. Supported by the French Development Agency and the French Facility for Global Environment, the kingdom introduced a (EURO)1.5m pilot project for the adaptation of agriculture to climate change in the Maghreb. If successful, this would have lower insurance costs than other options such as state-subsidised, multi-risk insurance. However, it requires weather stations from which the rain index-based insurance draws its data, as well as expertise and capacity to operate them. \</doc>

US President Donald Trump is not invited to a climate change summit to take place in Paris later this year "for the time being". An official in French President Emmanuel Macron's administration told Reuters that the US has "a bit of a special status for that summit." The US has begun the official withdrawal process from the Paris Agreement, the global accord signed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015 that attempts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming rise to 2C. Read more What to expect from the UN's latest climate talks The withdrawal would only be eligible to take effect on 4 November 2020 per the rules outlined in the agreement, just days before the next presidential election. Climate change might be worse than thought after scientists find major mistake in water temperature readings The day of the announcement in June of this year, Mr Macron and leaders from Germany and Italy banded together to say in a statement that despite Mr Trump being open to changing the Paris Agreement, it could not " be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies." Over a thousand American governors, mayors, and CEOs also said they would stick with the commitments outlined in the accord as well. In the months following, the Trump administration and Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has dismantled key legislation like the Clean Power Plan, which would have reduced US power plants' carbon emissions by 2030 to a level 32 per cent lower than they were in 2005 and help achieve goals in the accord. US officials will likely still be invited to the 12 December summit but not at the presidential level.

Governments are starting to develop anti-methane emission policies that could impact the meat and livestock industry as part of their response to the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. World leaders who participated at November\' s COP23 (conference of parties) climate summit in Bonn, Germany, were advised by a key investor group to reduce livestock methane if greenhouse gas emissions were to be tackled effectively. The HYPERLINK https://www.globalmeatnews.com/Article/2017/08/16/Factory-farming-in-Asia-creates-economic-risk Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Indeed, FAIRR analysis said the 10 highest-emitting agriculture sectors, including the US, Australia, Germany and the UK, collectively create emissions equivalent to consuming 1.6 billion barrels of oil. Other negative environmental impacts of the livestock sector included water scarcity, deforestation and biodiversity loss, all of which have indirect impacts on either boosting carbon emissions or removing carbon sinks, according to the FAIRR report. Livestock are therefore responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) according to the Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO), or around 7.1 gigatonnes of GHG emissions each year. As for governments that are leading the way in developing such climate change policies, a 2016 report by the Danish Council on Ethics (Det Etiske R\'e5d), an advisory body to the Danish parliament (Folketing), examined whether the choice of consuming foods with a large environmental footprint should be left to the consumer? It asked the parliament to consider whether regulation should be introduced to reduce the climate impact of food consumption \- and called for the HYPERLINK https://www.globalmeatnews.com/Article/2016/04/28/Denmark-mulls-beef-tax-to-tackle-climate-change introduction of a tax on red meat EU members mull meat tax Last year, green opposition party The Alternative put forward a follow-up proposal for a Danish meat tax of DKK17 (US$2.70) per kg of beef. Politicians have rejected both proposals thus far, but the debates have raised public awareness of the issue and policymakers have agreed  action is needed to lower meat consumption if commitments under the Paris Agreement are to be met  , said the FAIRR report. Germany has also faced calls from its federal environment agency to tax all meat and dairy products at the standard 19% VAT rather than the current 7%, suggesting that lower rates of taxation amount to  environmentally harmful subsidies  . In Sweden, a 2016 Green Party proposal suggested an SEK20 (US$2.40) per kg levy on beef, payable by the consumer. Further motions on the idea are planned. Also, in Australia, a sum of AU$5 (US$4) is levied against each head of cattle per transaction, the majority of which is paid to Meat and Livestock Australia for programmes including animal welfare, nutrition and environment and sustainability. California-based non-profit organisation Climate Action Reserve has drawn up greenhouse gas emission offset protocols, including a cap-and-trade offsets programme it describes as a market-based incentive to invest in methane reduction projects at livestock facilities. Investors 'should not overlook' livestock emissions FAIRR, whose supporter investors manage more than US$4 trillion in assets participating in its activities, in its white paper, The livestock levy: are regulators considering meat taxes?, released to investors in December, called on financiers to anticipate policy responses from other governments, which \- like energy-related emissions schemes \- could enable methane-reducing technology providers to tap government subsidies. At the Bonn summit, founder Jeremy Coller said:  It\' s two years since Paris rang the starting bell on the low carbon transition and investors have tended to focus on high-emitting sectors like energy, transport and extractives. Investors should not overlook the livestock sector where some of the biggest climate risks and opportunities exist.  He added that while early discussions were under way, no developed country had yet mentioned specific plans to tackle livestock emissions in its INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contribution) towards meeting the Paris targets of keeping global warming below 2\'b0C.  Too many delegates at COP23 are fluent in low-carbon automotive innovations, yet still rely on cows and pigs as the outdated technology to supply the world\' s protein demand, said Coller.  The next stage of the Paris talks must put cows alongside cars.  'Practical challenges' for the meat change And in its communiqu\'e9 following the Bonn summit, the UN-supported Climate and Clean Air Coalition said:  The agriculture sector is a significant contributor to the global climate challenge.  Solutions exist that can reduce emissions while increasing productivity building resiliency, and improving the livelihoods of farmers. We resolve to develop policies and measures to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector and help improve the productivity, resilience and livelihoods of farmers.  Countries have now been asked to submit their views to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by 31 March 2018, on what should be included in COP discussions looking at  the collective efforts of parties in relation to progress towards the long-term goal  (identified in the Paris agreement of 2015).  While the concept of a meat tax to improve public health and/or environmental outcomes is currently at an embryonic stage, and faces several practical challenges for how implementation might work, it is on a clear path that is likely to end with taxation in some form,  said the FAIRR paper. The FAIRR report concluded:  It is highly probably that over the medium to long-term some form of taxation on meat products will be implemented in some jurisdictions.  If this does happen, it will inevitably be against some stiff opposition. Assistant Professor Tara Felix, a beef specialist in the Department of Animal Science at the Pennsylvania State University, told GlobalMeatNews :  I think many believe it would be challenging if not impossible to pass such a tax.  And US-based rancher and blogger Amanda Radke is a good example of probable industry opposition. She warned on her The Beef Daily blog:  If this meat tax comes to fruition and our product is lumped in with items like tobacco, carbon and sugar, I\' m afraid consumers will no longer be able to afford to eat meat, and the health repercussions may be quite troubling.  \</doc>

Interview:\~President Juan Manuel Santos What are the country's economic priorities following the peace agreement? PRESIDENT JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Colombia is successfully facing the challenge of making the transition from an oil-rich economy to a diversified economy. This will bring equal opportunities to all Colombians, including the members of FARC, who will enter into a programme of reincorporation into the civil and economic life of the country. Furthermore, Colombia is going through a real revolution in its infrastructure. The country is in a construction phase, and the economic benefits of these investments will be recognised for many years. Infrastructure projects, particularly the 4G road concession programme, are structured in such a way that private sector investment resources multiply and those of the public sector complement them with long-term planning. How is Colombia progressing in its goal to become Latin America's most educated nation by 2025? SANTOS: Jornada \'danica . Today in Colombia more than 690,000 students can attend school eight hours per day. In the latest Programme for International Student Assessment, a test which aims to evaluate education systems, Colombia was one of only three countries out of 71 to improve in all areas. Access to higher education rose from 37% to 50%, and we expect this number to reach 57% by 2018. We are implementing a very ambitious infrastructure plan to solve the deficit of schools throughout the country, by which we aim to build in four years what would normally be built in 80 years, a total of 30,000 new classrooms. Likewise, we are working on excellence programmes for our teachers, expanding bilingualism throughout the country and delivering more than 2m computers and smart tablets with internet connections for students. How can the public and private sector work together to implement the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development? SANTOS: Colombia is an environmental powerhouse, with the most biodiversity per sq km on earth. We had the honour to co-lead the Sustainable Development Objectives part of the Agenda 2030, and are committed to their implementation. In addition, peace is a great enabler of private investment in renewable energies and sustainable development. Colombia has five areas of focus namely, biodiversity, climate change, sustainable production and consumption, conservation of the seas and water management. In the tax reform implemented earlier this year we created green taxes to discourage the use of fossil fuels and plastic bags. We are also fulfilling part of our commitments to the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change , which set out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C. \</doc>

'Our relationship with the World Bank Group is growing and your presence in Fiji will not only benefit Fiji but all Pacific countries, as together there are many opportunities for the development of the Pacific Region.' 'An enhanced presence in Suva will enable us to better deliver in Fiji and the Pacific and increase our contribution to the region's development in a variety of sectors, from fisheries to climate change,' said Kwakwa. The establishment agreement also includes a potentially larger presence for the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group and the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets. 'Entrepreneurship and private sector dynamism is an important engine of economic growth. IFC looks forward to deepening our engagement with the government on supporting private sector development to achieve more inclusive growth,' said IFC Director for East Asia and the Pacific, Vivek Pathak, who was represented at the ceremony by IFC Country Manager for the Pacific, Tom Jacobs. Kwakwa also met with Attorney General and Minister for Economy, Hon. Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, to discuss the increased World Bank Group presence in Suva, as well as Fiji's presidency of October's COP23 meeting in Bonn, Germany. Kwakwa's visit to Fiji comes ahead of the 48th Pacific Islands Forum Leaders' Meeting in Apia, Samoa, where she will meet with heads of state and development partners, and lead the launch of the World Bank's flagship report for the region Pacific Possible, which has identified the key transformational opportunities and risks for the region until 2040. The Vice President's travel through the region also includes a visit to Kiribati on Thursday to meet with government officials and representatives of non-governmental organizations, and to visit projects supported by the World Bank.

"Among the lessons I learned eleven years ago," explains Al Gore, "was that a movie can be the most effective way to communicate with tens of millions of people." The former Vice President of the United States, suited, silver-haired and sitting across a table from me in a Mayfair hotel suite, is talking about An Inconvenient Truth. His 2006 documentary about the cataclysmic dangers of climate change, the film proved the perfect platform - earning $49m at the box office, winning an Oscar and even gaining Gore a share of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. It also won him a fair share of detractors, as television and online commentators were swift to dismantle his claims on global warming. A decade on and Gore is back with a follow-up, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power. Directed by Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk, it follows him across the globe on his ceaseless quest to educate and negotiate, including at the 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris. Given President Trump's recent decision to withdraw America from the Paris Agreement, Gore's new film feels like a sharp and timely reminder of what's at stake. When Gore took the film to Cannes in May, he was hopeful that Trump would stay in. As he told me then, "I have criticised Donald Trump's policies and many of his appointees but I have engaged with him nevertheless and met with him after the election and have continued conversations with him, focused on only one thing - the reasons why the United States should stay in the Paris Agreement." Yet even then he was uncertain about Trump's position. "He is nothing if not unpredictable." If the subsequent reversal by Trump must've felt like a body blow, Gore isn't letting it show when we meet for a second time. "In that speech, Trump said he was elected to represent Pittsburgh not Paris. And the very next day, the Mayor of Pittsburgh [Democrat Bill Peduto] said, 'Well, I'm still in! Our city is still in Paris and we're going to go 100 per cent renewable.' Atlanta has now made that commitment. Many cities have already achieved that including [Republican-run] Georgetown, Texas, as portrayed in the movie." Additionally, over a thousand mayors, businesses, investors and academic institutions have signed a pact called "We Are Still In". "It looks as if the US is going to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement, regardless of Trump," says Gore. "It kind of illustrates the law of physics that says for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The reaction to Trump is quite strong and very beneficial to the climate." Still, for all the positivity that Gore exudes, it must feel like two steps forward one back. He likens it to previous social revolutions in human history: the abolition of slavery, the anti-Apartheid movement, gay rights and equality for women. "All of these have at times seemed impossible and produced despair for the advocates. The late Nelson Mandela said, 'It's always impossible until it's done!' If someone had told me in the US, even seven years ago, that gay marriage would be legal in all 50 states, and accepted and celebrated by two thirds of the American people, I would've said, 'I sure hope so but what are you smoking?'" Certainly An Inconvenient Sequel comes with a hopeful message; the climate crisis may have accelerated but so has the interest in alternative energy sources. Solar and wind power technologies, says Gore, "have been developing with great speed and have now fallen in cost to the point where in a growing number of areas in the world, it is now cheaper to get electricity and economic growth from renewable [sources] compared to the old dirty fossil fuel-based approaches." Early reviews have criticised the film for being vainglorious, showing Gore as he evangelises on climate change, even depicting him as instrumental amid the negotiations in Paris when it came to dealing with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Compared with the slideshow-lecture approach taken by Gore in An Inconvenient Truth, the sequel is more 80 Days Around The World, but it's hard not to be struck by sobering shots of Miami streets flooding or ice shelves melting in Greenland. As Gore-centric as the film is, the former politician - who was born in Washington DC with a father who served for 18 years as US Senator for Tennessee - doesn't come across, in person or on screen, as someone out for himself. He may have spent two terms under Bill Clinton in the White House, but his subsequent loss running for president led him to change direction. "One of the world's leading environmentalist politicians", as the Nobel committee dubbed him, his work will surely be remembered by future generations. Much of his skill comes in recruiting others - with his Climate Reality Project, now with ten branches across the globe, dedicated to training environmental activists. One hundred per cent of the film's profits go to funding the CRP, though Gore suggests every individual can help, even those who do not dedicate their lives to green issues. Use your vote wisely, he says, and look for climate-friendly alternatives when buying products in the marketplace. "It not only helps you be a part of the solution, it sends a powerful signal to business and industry." A father of four, the 69-year-old Gore tells me how each of his children has taken up green issues - including oldest daughter Karenna, who features in the film and works for the Centre For Earth Ethics in New York. He has four grandchildren now "and another on the way" and you sense that first and foremost, Gore is concerned about the planet he will leave behind. "I think constantly of what world they will inherit," he says, quietly, all too aware that his mission is far from complete. Such is his passion, even in the twilight of his career, Gore's own energy appears renewable. Don't be surprised if, in ten years time, a third film is made with an ageing Gore once again putting mankind under the microscope. "We will reach a point where we cross the political threshold that has characterised every successful social revolution in human history," he says. "Even then the work will continue. We are going to win this." 'An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power' opened on 18 August \</doc>

Video highlights what New York City would look like if sea levels continue to rise over the next 60-80 years Called 'Two \'b0C ', it pulls inspiration from the Paris Agreement which aim is to keep warming below 2\'b0 C (3.6F)   Water in the video was created using 3D simulation\~software and people were removed using Photoshop Experts have warned that New York City could one day be submerged by rising sea levels and now that the US has pulled out of the Paris Agreement, many Americans are left wondering what the future holds for the Big Apple. However, a video has surfaced online that has revealed the catastrophic effects of climate change on the massive city, which could become a reality over the next 60 to 80 years. 'We are concerned with global warming, and the rising waters is only one representation among others of global warming,' Max told DailyMail.com in an email. 'We considered this video as an alert so that people become even more aware of the danger.'\~ 'The Paris Agreement limited to 2 degrees : these 2 degrees were already dangerous, but the recent US withdrawal is unconscious.'\~ 'We don't need to be specialist or scientists to consider this act as unconscious.'\~ two\'b0C - New-York City from Claire&Max on Vimeo. WHAT IS THE PARIS AGREEMENT? United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. China and the United States had already committed to backing the deal in September 2016, with their greenhouse gas output accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world's emissions. To go into legal force, countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions had to sign on. The deal asks that the countries signing on reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Right now 147 countries have ratified the agreement to the 197 who attended the convention.\~ The aim is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius - 3.6F - this century. Part of the reason the Paris Agreement was successful was that ratifying countries can decide independently how to reduce their emissions rather than being told how much to cut by. The binding part of the agreement makes countries report on their progress decreasing emissions, while the actual setting of emission-reduction targets is non-binding.\~ The United States said it would try to reduce emissions from its 2005 level by 17 percent in 2020 and 26 to 28 percent by 2025. The nearly four minute video begins with an image of New York City that may be unsettling - the water has risen so high that many of its monstrous skyscrapers are barely peaking up from a watery grave. Fifth Avenue, Wall Street and Time Square, all of which used to be filled with hundreds of people on any given day, are shown completely empty and submerged in water. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par And Grand Central Station, which attracts people from all over the world, looks more like a large watering hole instead of a busy train station. The video continues to show different areas of New York, all of which tell the same story, but what may be one of the most unsettling aspects is that a city that has 8.4 million residents and 50 million people visiting each year is completely empty. 'Climate change is a new marker in our history. Man can now affect the climate, we are now in the anthropocene era,' said Max. 'Fortunately we have become aware of it and we must put all possible means to ensure that future generations enjoy a better environment. 'Antoine de St Exupery said :' We do not inherit the land of our parents, we borrow it from our children.' 'The video was done with 2 steps : first, we deleted the people of the streets (like our precedent work in Pairs 'Hypocentre') and then we add the water,' he continued. 'The water is a 3D modelization. We choose NYC because like Paris, NYC is our 'laboratory' for our experimental films.' 'We are fortunate to be able to come regularly to NYC and we love deeply NYC.\~ The title of the clip, 'Two \'b0 C', was inspired by a recent study from a team of American researchers that noted 2  C global warming is dangerous and could have catastrophic effects on our world over the next couple of decades. 'The IPCC , an intergovernmental panel of experts on climate change, predicted an average increase of 1 meter by 2100: their model underestimated the melting of the ice,' Claire and Max shared in a blog post. 'For James Hansen [one of the American researchers], these 2 \'b0 would still remain dangerous because it integrates in its recent models the melting of the ice: it estimates an increase of 5 to 9m by 2080.' The video was shared online two days prior to Donald Trump making the announcement that the US was pulling out of the Paris agreement - citing it was bad for American jobs and bad for the environment. Trump complained in the White House's Rose Garden that major polluters like China are allowed to increase their emissions under the agreement in a way that the US cannot. India is hinging its participation on billions of dollars of foreign aid. 'The bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,' he said. He argued later, 'The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.' 'This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,' he contended. Trump said he would end the United States' participation in the United Nations' Green Climate Fund for the same reason. Although the US president listed multiple reasons to why the nation should and is leaving the agreement, many Americans are not on board with the decision and are worried what the future holds for not just their country, but for the entire world. \</doc>

The African Development Bank achieved a 100% investment in renewable energy in 2017, a major landmark in its commitment to clean energy and efficiency. Power generation projects with a cumulative 1,400 megawatts exclusively from renewables were approved during the year, with plans to increase support for renewable energy projects in 2018 under the New Deal on Energy for Africa. According to Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, ''We are clearly leading on renewable energy. We will help Africa unlock its full energy potential, while developing a balanced energy mix to support industrialization. Our commitment is to ensure 100% climate screening for all Bank financed projects.'' The share of renewable energy projects as a portion of the Bank's portfolio of power generation investments increased from 14% in 2007-2011, to 64% in 2012-2016. The Africa Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI) whose goal is to deliver 300 Gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy in 2030 and 10 GW by 2020, is now based within the Bank, as requested by African Heads of State and Government. The G7 has promised to commit US$ 10 billion to support the initiative, which came out of COP21 and subsequently approved by the African Union. On November 8, 2017, the African Bank Group approved its Second Climate Change Action Plan, 2016-2020 (CCAP2) as a clear message of its commitment to helping African countries mobilize resources to support the implementation of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions of Regional Member Countries, in ways that will not hinder development. The approval of the action plan echoes discussions at COP23 in Bonn, Germany to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change and achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5C. The CCAP2 is designed to incorporate the Bank's High 5 priorities in the Paris Agreement, the 2030 development agenda, the Bank's Green Growth Framework and the lessons learned in the implementation of the first climate change action plan (CCAP1), 2011-2015 As part of its wider mandate under the New Deal on Energy for Africa, the Board of Directors of the African Development Bank on December 15, 2017, approved an investment of US $ 20 million in the Evolution II Fund -a Pan-African clean and sustainable energy private equity fund. The Bank's investment in Evolution II Fund reflects the High 5 development priorities of the Bank, the agenda to light up and Power Africa, and the Bank's commitment to promote renewable energy and efficiency in Africa. The Evolution II Fund is expected to contribute to green and sustainable growth by creating 2,750 jobs and building on the track record of the Evolution One Fund (which created 1,495 jobs, of which 20% were for women, and generated 838 MW of wind energy and 87MW Solar PV energy). It is estimated that the Evolution One Fund achieved 1,190,469 of Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission savings annually In line with its commitment to renewable energy and ongoing institutional reforms, in the first quarter of 2017, the Bank appointed Ousseynou Nakoulima as the Director for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. He brings global experience in developing and managing programs and partnerships for driving renewable energy, from his work at the Green Climate Fund.

Risk analysis: Environmental activists are likely to stage rallies during the COP23 conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNTCC), taking place in Bonn between 6 and 17 November. The core demand of participants, who could number up to several thousand, is that governments step up their efforts to combat global warming. Protests are likely to take place in central Bonn and near the UN campus and are likely to remain largely peaceful. Transport disruption is probable due to traffic diversions. Activists are also likely to attempt to protest at opencast brown coal mining sites across North Rhine-Westphalia, possibly hampering operations, as was the case during the 5 November protest at the Hambach coal mine. \</doc>

The world will become a hotter, wetter place as climate change takes hold over the coming decades, a Westcountry scientist will tell policymakers at this year's UN climate conference. Britain will feel the impact less directly than some areas - but will have to wrestle with the problem of migration from increasingly inhospitable parts of the globe, Professor Richard Betts from the University of Exeter siad. Scientists from the region headed for Bonn in Germany at the weekend for the start of the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) climate summit. Professor Betts, chairman in climate impacts at the University of Exeter has co-ordinated an EU-funded research project looking at high end climate impacts. He will be presenting the results at the conference, as well as representing the university. The Helix project has been looking at using computer models to establish the impacts of climate change at 1.5C, 2C and 4C above pre-industrial levels. The world will be a wetter place, with more river and coastal flooding, he said. But some areas, such as Spain and Portugal will also face worsening droughts and forest fires - outcomes we are already witnessing. "The rest of the world is being hit harder than we are," Prof Betts said. "What are the implications for migration, aid and overseas development? Will people want to come here? Do we leave South Asia to get on with it - or do we help out?" Dr Carol Turley, Plymouth Marine Laboratory's Nobel prizewinner, will also be in Bonn, where national policymakers will be looking at ways to implement last year's Paris Agreement, the climate deal adopted by 195 countries in December 2015 at the COP21 summit in Paris. It sets out a global plan on how to limit the increase in global temperatures to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels. "I'm hoping that nations will further improve their carbon dioxide emissions promises, and that the oceans get more of a say in the outcome of the negotiations," Dr Turley said. "The oceans are at the frontline. They absorb 90% of the heat energy in the atmosphere." Rising temperatures mean falling oxygen levels in seawater. The oceans also buffer the Earth's carbon dioxide, absorbing more when levels of the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rise. But the oceans pay a price: carbon dioxide mixes with water to form a weak acid, carbonic acid, making it harder for some marine creatures to build their shells and skeletons. "It doesn't look good for the oceans," Dr Turley said. She said the oceans had been overlooked in climate talks. \</doc>

Interview:\~Mohammed bin Saleh Al Sada What advantages does Qatar enjoy in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry? MOHAMMED BIN SALEH AL SADA How is the supply and demand of energy sources projected to change in the coming years? AL SADA : It is widely accepted by prominent energy analysts that global gas consumption will increase by over 50% between now and 2040. Natural gas is the fastest-growing fossil fuel and will remain the centrepiece of the energy equation. Within the natural gas segment, the LNG market is expected to grow even faster, at approximately 4.5% per annum in the same period. The market share of LNG in international gas trade is expected to grow from the current level of 33% to more than 50% by 2035, bringing its share to the same volume as piped gas. In the medium term, strong growth is expected to push total global LNG demand to about 314m tonnes per annum (tpa) by 2020. LNG supply is set for a substantial rise, and production capacity is expected to reach 400m tpa by 2020, as additional US and Australian supply enters the market. Therefore, despite the strong growth in demand, the market will experience oversupply over the next few years. However, very few new LNG projects are to come on-line in the earlier part of the next decade and, as a result, the global LNG market will start to tighten, potentially facing a supply shortage beyond 2025. Qatar intends to remain a leading player in the future as well, meeting market demand - hence the recent directive to raise the country's LNG production by 30% to reach 100m tpa and be fully operational by 2024. What steps are the government taking towards developing the renewable energy segment? AL SADA : The government believes that greenhouse gas emissions are a global challenge that can be mitigated by using fuels for power generation that emit less CO . Fossil fuels are expected to still account for 75% of the world's energy mix in 2040, and gas will continue to be the fuel of choice. It is a very practical and potent energy source that acts as a bridge, allowing for a smooth transition to a lower-carbon future. Environmental protection is a key pillar of Qatar National Vision 2030. Qatar is a signatory of the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change , and a number of public and private investments are driving developments in the solar energy sector. For example, we have the facilities to produce high-purity polysilicon for both the domestic and international market. Many buildings are equipped with solar panels, and one upcoming project is the development of a solar power project of up to 500 MW. How can public-private partnerships contribute to the success of the energy sector? AL SADA: The country aims to achieve sustainable development through the participation and growth of both the public and private sectors. Within the region, Qatar has been the first to deregulate and encourage private investment. Power generation and water production services were separated and privatised in the year 2000, when Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC) was established. Since then, several additional integrated power and water facilities have been built by QEWC to accommodate the country's increasing demand for power and water. These provide opportunities for private sector financiers and investors. \</doc>

Emmanuel Macron has vowed to replace every dollar that is withdrawn from the UN's climate change programme by Donald Trump. The French President told a UN climate summit in Bonn, Germany, that France would step in to cover the cost of US contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that Mr Trump has said he will withdraw. "I can guarantee that, starting in 2018, the IPCC will have all the money it needs and will continue to support our decision-making," he said. "It will not miss a single euro." "We need scientific information that is constantly nourished to ensure clear decision making. The IPCC is one of the major components of this work. Read more UN chief says time running out to prevent catastrophic climate change "However, it is threatened today by the decision of the US not to guarantee funding for it. Therefore, I propose that the EU replaces the USA, and France will meet that challenge." The US currently contributes around (EURO)2 million (\£31.8 million) a year to the IPCC. However, Mr Trump has pledged to pull the US out of the 2015 Paris Agreement and other international climate change initiatives. He also plans to promote coal and other fossil fuel industries. In his speech, Mr Macron also called for an EU tariff on goods imported from countries or companies that do not share its climate goals, and pledged to work to raise the cost of carbon within the EU to (EURO)30 a tonne. Representatives from almost 200 countries are currently meeting at the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP23 ) summit in Bonn, where discussions are focusing on how the Paris Agreement should be implemented.

November 7, 2017 Peruvian indigenous activists at the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, made a strong call Tuesday for indigenous peoples to be part of the solution to tackling climate change, emphasizing their traditional wisdom and practical knowledge about adaptation methods. "We don't want to speak only about climate change but about climate catastrophe [...] What can we do? There are alternatives, especially from the indigenous peoples, especially from the wisdom of indigenous women," said Roberto Espinoza, Advisor for the Interethnic Association for the development of the Peruvian Rainforest (Asociation Interetnica de Desarrollo de la Selva Peruana - AIDESEP), at a press conference. Rosalia Yampis, Director of the Women's Program in AIDESEP, also highlighted the "very important role" indigenous women can have in climate adaptation. "Women have this ancestral knowledge about seeds and what we have to sow," she told the press conference. She added that indigenous peoples are providing input to Peru's national contribution to the Paris Agreement in protecting the watershed. There are about 13 million indigenous peoples in Peru. As a national indigenous rights organization, AIDESEP works to improve the health, education and housing of these peoples. It is a member organization of the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA). We are sowing water - even if it sounds bizarre - with some special plants indigenous people know that can enhance the water cycle undergroundRoberto Espinoza According to AIDESEP, "it is amply demonstrated that indigenous territories are fundamental for the conservation of forests." In them, generally, "deforestation is minimal, even less than in some protected natural areas. Therefore, today, one of the main strategies to counteract the loss and degradation of forests in the Peruvian Amazon is to ensure the safety and sustainable management of these territories," explains the organization on its website. "There are alternatives with the wisdom and knowledge of our peoples. We, as indigenous peoples, are working on these alternatives," said Janio Sangama, from the region of San Martin, which is mostly located in the upper part of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. "When we speak about sustainable development, we are looking after the management of our resources in a more orderly way. We worry about deforestation," he added. "In San Martin, we had a big flood. We have a proposal called 'hand in hand with Government' to confront these natural catastrophes." He said that the indigenous peoples have begun sustainable production or orderly production with technologies from communities. "We have been managing alternative crops in our territories. We are not destroying our forest," he underscored. Roberto Espinoza said that "water is being reduced because of deforestation. So we are sowing water - even if it sounds bizarre - with some special plants indigenous people know that can enhance the water cycle underground," he added. Regarding reforestation, Jammek Manikusi, a member of AIDESEP, said indigenous people are concerned about the use of exotic plants, like pine and eucalyptus. "These plants have impacts on the soil. We want a natural reforestation with natural wisdom of the peoples, with more proper methodologies, more adapted to natural regeneration of soils in the Amazon." \</doc>

When Ruth Oniang'o was working as a nutrition researcher in 1980s Kenya, she noticed an ominous change in the country's agricultural landscape: regions that had once provided a diversity of nutritious food crops were being turned over to cash crops like sugarcane. Grown mostly for export, these crops were usurping land and soil that was intended for feeding people. Spurred on by what she witnessed all those years ago, today Oniang'o--a professor of nutrition and a native Kenyan--leads the Rural Outreach Program, a nonprofit that champions the role of indigenous African crops and smallholder farmers in safeguarding food security. With the ROP, Oniang'o visits hundreds of farming communities in Kenya and helps them access, grow, and share seeds for indigenous crop varieties like sorghum, cassava, arrowroot, and jute mallow--foods that are not only nutritious, but also disease-resistant and climate-resilient. This year, these efforts got her recognised as the joint winner of the 2017 Africa Food Prize. Aside from the practicalities of nutrition and food security, she's motivated by the desire to help smallscale farmers realise their importance, she says: "If farmers were to go on strike for a season only, we would starve. Then maybe we would value them." Here, Oniang'o shares her thoughts on commercialising African agriculture, the COP23 climate conference, and the trouble with that now-ubiquitous term, 'orphan crops'. Why do you choose to work with Kenya's smallholder farmers? Most of the voters are in the rural areas. Most of them are agricultural, and most of them are the poorest of the poor. So for smallholders to wield power they have to be organised. If they aren't organised and they work individually, they'll always be misused, and ignored. So I work to raise income for smallholder farmers, to raise their dignity, and their voice. You place a special emphasis on women in your work: how is that connected to farming and nutrition in Kenya? The main aim is to address rural poverty, through agriculture, and more than three-quarters of people doing agriculture [in Kenya] are women. So my focus is rural poverty and improved family nutrition, especially through women. But as I went along, I realised I needed to figure out how to bring in the men too. When we started, our field days would be mostly women, discussing women's affairs. But now we have men attending, because they see how the women have transformed. Women have become village elders, and chiefs. A woman needs the support of the family, the spouse, the whole community; you all have to rally around her for her to feel comfortable being a leader. So when men [come to me and] say 'I want my daughter to be just like you,' I say you, 'start by making your wife feel good. Then we can talk.' What do you think about the calls to commercialise African agriculture ? The whole idea of commercialising African agriculture has been around for a long time. When Kenya became independent in 1963, it was feeding its population--OK, so it was only about seven million then--on subsistence farming, through smallholder farms. Then we saw the commercialisation of agriculture. I was one of the researchers in the late 80s, [looking into] how farms were being commercialised, going into cash crops and so on. And yet people were becoming hungrier, and nutrition was being compromised. That's why the area where I started doing my interventions were sugarcane growing areas. With all the land going to sugar cane as a monocrop, people had to import food for family food consumption. And the money they were getting from sugar cane was not enough to actually purchase family food. So all I can tell you is that we haven't capitalised on African smallholder farming. We still have a lot of smallholder farmers in Africa, and Kenya feeds people from subsistence farming. We haven't seen its full potential, but we have seen the bad impacts of commercialising. And yet, you've supported the idea that in the future, Africa should become a major exporter of food. The reason I said 'in the future' is that our governments must realise that you must feed your people first, then you can look at what we can give to the rest of the world. India is now asking Africa to feed them pulses. But Africa also needs pulses for nutrition. If we don't give farmers incentives to feed into the local food system they will export that food, or go into commercial crops, which aren't necessarily food crops. So it requires a well-thought-out plan by government. Give us way forward, on how we feed our people. It's not something that you just leave open to a free market--especially when the markets are not understood by the majority of your people. When it comes to food, you must have self interest in your people. It seems that indigenous crops are gaining recognition in the African farming context--something you have been advocating for, for decades. Yes that's true. They're being called orphan crops--a term that has come onto the scene, and suddenly everybody has adopted it. Personally, I have an issue with that terminology. Why is that? Well, it's how we see orphans--as an unfortunate situation. In this case we virtually neglected these crops, and yet, they are our foundation. And, they are also still there. We have tuber crops, sweet potatoes, yams, and arrowroot. And then you have cassava--now being promoted much more as an industrial crop, to produce starch and byproducts, for example for animal feed. But we know that as a food it's also critical, and drought-resistant, growing with very little rain. We have the grains, finger millet, sorghum, which are mostly drought-resistant, using very little water. And they're nutritious. We also have insects--we know which ones can be eaten. We have mushrooms, and fruits from the wild. The other day I was in Mombasa, and I really enjoyed tamarind juice. So culturally, we need to identify with these foods; they should be given prominence. With COP23 having unfolded earlier this month, how optimistic are you that it will translate into benefits for smallholder farmers? I'm wary of these huge conferences, where resolutions come out, and commitments are made, and huge amounts of money are put forward. Yet, if you try to apply for that kind of funding, you don't get it. Maybe there are just too many demands on what's available. That said, what I do like about the conferences now is that there is a global agreement, so there's political will. But for those of us who work with farmers on the ground level, we aren't seeing resources. That's something I would really like to see--bringing it down to where it really matters. Climate change has really, practically, affected smallholder farmers. They now don't even know when to plant. They've stopped believing in the climate itself. So I need to follow the resources, and bring to them to the ground. That's where I'm happiest--making a difference on the ground. \</doc>

The International Hydropower Association (IHA) is partnering with Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) to explore options for a new model which would accelerate sustainable hydropower development worldwide. The two organisations signed a partnership agreement this week at the COP23 climate change conference in Bonn, Germany. It will see them consult on the concept of a Hydropower Preparation Facility (HPF), which would work with national governments to prioritise potential hydropower project sites according to their sustainability. The concept could see Hydropower Preparation Facilities established in countries and regions across the world, which would help governments select and prepare hydropower projects before putting them out to tender to the private sector. Under the model, a project 'blueprint', guided by the latest international industry good practice in sustainability, would be created by the facility and then auctioned off. The successful developer would subsequently repay the preparation costs when the project is commissioned, reducing the costs and risks to prospective developers. The facility itself would be resourced through a revolving donor-sourced fund. The International Hydropower Association has been engaging with governments, financial institutions and NGOs to bring forward the HPF concept following the strong support it received from stakeholders at the World Hydropower Congress in May 2017. Richard Taylor, Chief Executive of IHA, said: "The initiative is about getting the right projects built in the right place, and delivering services where they are needed most, especially in developing countries. The aim is to accelerate sustainable hydropower that fits well with local, national and regional strategies - contributing to cleaner energy systems, responsible freshwater management and climate-change solutions. The partnership with SEforALL represents a significant milestone in making this concept a reality." Rachel Kyte, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and CEO, Sustainable Energy for All, said: "We can only reach universal energy access by 2030 if the shift to renewable energy moves at speed and scale. Best practice hydropower can deliver renewable energy and storage opportunities - offering much needed flexibility. By partnering together, we can help IHA share their leadership and expertise with a much wider audience of sustainable energy policy makers and practitioners. Together, we can go further, faster towards Sustainable Development Goal 7." Hydropower Preparation Facilities could assist in defining the energy and water benefits required from a hydropower project by utilising local stakeholder knowledge and public-private partnerships at the early stage, and by checking the viability and sustainability of the project before auction. The HPF concept avoids the risk premium associated with a private developer attempting to bring forward a project with costly, often complex, assessments and planning, with no certainty that it will be permitted to proceed. By taking a system-scale approach and working closely with host governments and local communities, projects would also have a strong strategic fit within their region. IHA and SEforAll plan to hold a series of meetings and events over the coming year with key stakeholders to identify a proof of concept for the HPF model. In particular they will assess how HPFs could be driven by revolving funds and utilise refinancing models aligned with the key stages of project development. \</doc>

A majority of Australians would support phasing out coal power by 2030, including half the people in a sample identifying as Coalition voters, according to a survey by a progressive thinktank. The research funded by the Australia Institute says 60% of a sample of 1,417 Australians surveyed by online market research firm Research Now supported Australia joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance to phase out coal power by 2030. The Powering Past Coal Alliance - spearheaded by the UK and Canada - HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/16/political-watershed-as-19-countries-pledge-to-phase-out-coal was unveiled at the HYPERLINK COP23 climate talks in Bonn The survey suggests there is a core level of support across Australia's partisan divide for signing on, with 50% of Coalition voters supportive as well as 67% of ALP voters. The significant dissenters were One Nation voters, with only 36% supportive. A majority of Australians also supported increasing ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, with 58% support, including 47% of Coalition voters in the sample.

She said the Turnbull government's approach on climate and energy policy meant Australia was at risk of missing out on jobs and investment associated with a global boom in renewable energy, and was out of step with public sentiment. The research follows HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/16/political-watershed-as-19-countries-pledge-to-phase-out-coal a declaration on Wednesday at the National Press Club by the resources minister Matt Canavan that he was not interested in contemplating a discussion about a just transition for workers displaced by any phase out of coal consistent with Australia's international climate obligations. Canavan said workers suffered when industries shut down or were phased out so euphemisms like "just transitions" were best avoided. "I don't like the term transition, let's be frank, if you want to shutdown the coal industry, say it - that's what will happen." The resources minister said expanding the coal industry was "not inconsistent with the obligations we've got to reduce carbon emissions". He said countries were increasing investment in high-efficiency coal plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the Paris accord.

Cooperation on strengthening financial sector resilience. The EBRD is partnering with the Global Centre of Excellence on Climate Adaptation (GCECA) in a joint initiative to help strengthen the resilience of the financial sector to the impacts of climate change. Investors and businesses are becoming increasingly aware of the need to understand and manage the risks associated with climate change. In order to explore options for addressing these issues, the EBRD and GCECA will organise a conference entitled 'Towards a Resilient Financial Sector: Disclosing Physical Climate Risk & Opportunities', to be held at the EBRD's London Headquarters on 31 May 2018. The conference will bring together the financial, technical and policy perspectives to shape market action on climate resilience. The focus will be on improving financial sector awareness of climate risks and their impacts on investments, as well as facilitating the emergence of climate risk and resilience metrics, and identifying ways on which investors and businesses can integrate climate change intelligence into their business strategies and investment planning. Announcing the cooperation, Josue Tanaka, Managing Director, Operational Strategy and Planning, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change, said: 'We are very pleased to partner with the GCECA, the first international institution with a specific focus on climate change adaptation. Building climate resilient economies requires broad market action by businesses and investors, alongside effective government policies. We see great opportunities for working with the GCECA and a wider range of other stakeholders to enable businesses and investors to realise the value that can be created through building climate resilience.' 'We are grateful that the Paris Agreement has put Climate Adaptation on a par with mitigation but there is a long way to go. Understanding Climate Adaptation is crucial if we want to put paper into practice.' Christiaan Wallet, Operations Director of GCECA. The announcement was made today in Bonn at the COP23 climate conference which this year is focussing on the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The EBRD is organising four panels on key climate issues and Bank representatives are also taking part in many more events. The EBRD is a major investor in climate finance in many of the 38 emerging economies where it works, a driving force in energy efficiency projects, a pioneer in the development of renewable energy sources and an increasingly important player in adaptation to climate change, having signed almost 180 climate resilience investment since 2011. Under its Green Economy Transition (GET) approach, the EBRD aims to dedicate 40 per cent of its annual investment to green finance by 2020 and is well on the way to achieving this objective. The Global Centre of Excellence on Climate Adaptation helps countries, institutions and businesses to adapt to a warming climate, which is increasing the frequency of natural disasters and causing economic disruptions. It is bringing together international partners, including leading knowledge institutes, businesses, NGOs, local and national governments, international organisations and financial institutions. A technical secretariat has been created and funded by the EBRD. [Editorial queries for this story should be sent to mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk newswire@enpublishing.co.uk \</doc>

As the number of people displaced worldwide due to climate change-related events continues to grow, the United Nations and its partners are focusing on regional approaches, framed by existing international practice, to respond to the issue of 'climate refugees.' The number of disaster displacements on annual average between 2008 and 2016 amounted to 25.3 million, according to figures released by the Norwegian Refugee Council. The five countries globally that have the highest proportion of their population affected by displacements are all island States: Cuba, Fiji, Philippines, Tonga and Sri Lanka. "During this hurricane season alone for example, we saw the displacement of 1.7 million people in Cuba \£c- that's the equivalent of 15 per cent of its population," said Camila Minerva, Humanitarian Programme Manager with Oxfam in the Dominican Republic, during a press conference on 'human mobility and climate change' at the UN Climate Conference ( COP23 ), in Bonn, Germany. "The poorest and the most marginalized are five times more likely to be displaced and to remain so for longer time than people in higher income countries and it is increasing with climate change," she added. Mariam Traore, Migration, environment and climate change specialist with the UN Migration Agency (IOM) said that it is also important to remember that the slow onset effect of climate change makes people move and migrate, sometimes in a forced way. "In a country like Bangladesh, we did a survey last year and 40 per cent of the households we interviewed told us that climate change contributed directly to their decision to migrate," she added. In this context, some have suggested to create a climate refugee status, protecting those forced to leave their country because of the impacts of climate change. "The refugee legal status is provided by the 1951 Refugee Convention, which is very clear on what [basis refugee status is conferred], which is basically persecution," said Marine Franck, Programme Officer (climate change), Division of International Protection, in the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). "In the context of climate change displacement, there might be cases where there is persecution involved where this refugee status could apply but in most cases, it doesn't," she added. She recalled that in 2011, States had suggested that UNHCR create a new status of refugee for people displaced because of climate change. "But some States were not ready at all for that," she stated. Ms. Franck stressed that this issue of broadening the scope of refugee protection "is not necessarily desirable, because there is a risk of undermining the refugees fleeing persecution and violent conflict." Moreover, she explained: "We would need also to renegotiate the Convention and there is no appetite for that from States and it might not be the most effective protection tool." UNHCR thinks it is better to look at what exists at the regional level and try to have a bottom-up approach with broadening at the regional level using practices that are effective. She mentioned humanitarian protection visas, temporary protection and stay arrangements, as well as migration laws that can provide real protection. "It is much more effective because States are going to look at what their neighbours are doing and may adopt the same kind of procedures, rather than if we adopt a global convention or a new category [...] it might not be easy to negotiate and it is not also sure that States will then implement it properly," Ms. Franck said.

Here's a food truth: most Britons are happy to say "cod and chips, please" without even thinking about the sustainability impact of our favourite Friday night supper. Our love of white flaky fish has been a nightmare for fish campaigners. North Sea cod stocks plummeted from 270,000 tonnes in the 1970s to 44,000 tonnes in the early 2000s. North Sea cod stocks plummeted from 270,000 tonnes in the 1970s to 44,000 tonnes in the early 2000s But North Sea cod bounced back. In July this year, the fishery was awarded the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)'s blue tick confirming that stocks have recovered sufficiently to allow the species to be caught sustainably again. But don't get too comfortable - cod isn't out of deep water yet. So why did cod bounce back? Because an EU Cod Plan provided regulation, with caps on amounts, based on the available science and monitoring measures, not politics. Unfortunately politics, in the form of Brexit, is back. The infrastructure built through the EU's reformed Common Fisheries Policy could be dismantled. Meanwhile, a recent investigation by the World Wide Fund for Nature has uncovered underinvestment in the technology needed to monitor fishing vessels as well as intimidation of independent fishing observers. Policing agreed quotas is crucial to sustainable fishing. At the same time, environmental pressures are beginning to kick in. A recent report on UK seas and climate change showed that waters are warming by as much as 0.5% each year. Greenpeace has warned that this will mean cold water species, such as cod, being forced to move northwards, with trawling nets, the bottoms of which are weighted with metal rollers, following soon after, smashing cold water corals and destroying fragile ecosystems. The big picture: coal and cattle rethink Last week's United Nations COP23 summit was all about halting climate change. This picture, released to coincide with the talks, shows a cow standing outside the giant RWE coal-powered station in Bergheim, Germany. It's a simple snapshot of the meat, dairy and coal industries, three sectors that are in the frame for a radical rethink in terms of their carbon emissions if the Paris Climate Agreement is to succeed.

FRANCE'S Emmanuel Macron was forced to deny he had offered Saad al-Hariri 'political exile' after inviting the former Lebanese premier to Paris in an effort to defuse mounting tensions in the Middle East. GETTY Emmanuel Macron was forced to deny he had offered Saad al-Hariri 'political exile' Saad al-Hariri plunged his country into uncertainty after he announced his abrupt resignation as prime minister during a trip to Saudi Arabia less than two weeks ago. Mr Macron told reporters on the sidelines of the COP23 climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, without speculating further: "I spoke with [Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman and with Mr Hariri and we agreed that he would spend a few days in France with his family."\~ "We need a strong Lebanon with her territorial integrity respected.

Related articles Macron and Merkel speak at 'perfect opportunity' to lead Europe Macron ally concedes 'hard' Brexit would DAMAGE French economy GETTY Mr Macron also spoke with Mohammed bin Salman A presidential source later confirmed the former prime minister would arrive in France "in the coming days".\~ Mr Hariri's unexpected resignation from the Saudi capital Riyadh on November 4 threw Lebanon into political turmoil, and led to widespread speculation that he was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will. But while Mr Macron has successfully positioned himself as a broker between Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, his decision to invite Mr Hariri to France has further fuelled rumours that the former premier was coerced into resigning by the Saudis. France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, for his part, said that the Prince bin Salman had been "informed" of Mr Hariri's decision, but refused to say for how long he and his family would stay in Paris. GETTY France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian Mr Le Drian said: "Mr Hariri keeps his own agenda; the decision is his and his alone to make." Earlier on Wednesday, government spokesperson Christophe Castaner told French media that Mr Macron wanted Mr Hariri to "confirm his willingness to resign," adding that France fully supported an "independent and autonomous" Lebanon. Lebanese foreign minister Gebran Bassil, for his part, said earlier this week that he was "not sure" when and if Mr Hariri would return home. Mr Bassil said in an interview with the French daily Le Monde published on Wednesday: "The crisis will come to an end when Mr Hariri returns to Lebanon. "I can't say for sure when [Mr Hariri] will come home. But he can only prove he is free by returning home from Saudi Arabia. The situation he is in right now is ambiguous and not normal." Mr Bassil added that Mr Hariri's resignation had left the people of Lebanon feeling deeply "frustrated" because in their eyes "he is still their prime minister".

Taipei, Taiwan - Delta Electronics, Inc., (later referred also as 'Delta' and 'the company'), a global leader in power and thermal management solutions, announced it has been included in the prestigious Best Taiwan Global Brands survey as one of the top 20 Taiwanese global brands for the 7th consecutive year. With a brand value of USD $ 250 million in 2017 and an increase of 11% year-on-year, Delta delivers one of the highest growth rates in brand value and becomes the only Taiwanese brand to attain a double-digit growth rate in its value for the 5th consecutive year. Ms. Shan-Shan Guo, Delta's chief brand officer, remarked, ' 2017 is a key milestone for Delta's brand transformation. To respond to the rapid changes in the global marketplace, we adjusted Delta's organizational structure to focus on three main business categories: Power Electronics, Automation, and Infrastructure. We believe our comprehensive product portfolio will enhance our strength and agility to provide high-efficiency energy-saving solutions to our global customers. This also makes our brand communication more focused to achieve further synergies.' This November, Ms. Shan-Shan Guo was invited by ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) for a speech in its side event during the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference. During the event, which was overflowed with dozens of decision makers and climate experts, Delta shared its endeavors and accomplishments in nurturing green buildings and low-carbon mobility to not only let international audience witness Taiwanese companies' experiences in sustainability but also to elaborate but also to elaborate on the contribution of Delta's brand and technology. Delta commonly invests 6-7% of its annual revenues into research & development (R&D) to facilitate the growth of new technologies and of its solutions business. In addition to integrating software and hardware, Delta also leverages its knowledge in different industries to provide solutions for pioneering areas such as smart manufacturing and micro grids. Delta also strengthened its position and product offerings in building automation and surveillance through the acquisition of Delta Controls and LOYTEC last year, and VIVOTEK, a leading company in security surveillance, this year. Delta's business development is closely aligned with its CSR best practices. Delta provides innovative and energy-efficient solutions while proactively participating in international sustainable development events and activities. During the COP21 2015 UN Climate Change Conference, Delta organized a series of side events and shared its green building experience through the 'Delta Green Building Exhibition' held at the Grand Palais in Paris. The company subsequently replicated this exhibition in Beijing, Taipei, and Kaohsiung. These exhibitions received more than 150,000 visitors in total, including prominent government officials, business leaders and decision makers. This year, as the 11th participation at COP UN Climate Change Conferences, Delta was invited by ICLEI to share its views in ICLEI's side event. The 'Best Taiwan Global Brands' survey is organized by the Industrial Development Bureau and is executed by brand consultancy firm Interbrand to determine the value of the top global brand s from Taiwan. Being included into this distinguished ranking for 7 consecutive years not only proves Delta's commitment to its corporate mission but also the cohesive nature of corporate development and brand strategy.

Daily yoga sessions were the unexpected hit at the recent Cop23 climate talks in Bonn. Delegate demand was so high that the organisers (the Indian delegation) ran out of mats. Yoga is an accessible route to mindfulness, and a crucial tool for exposing environmental emergency Yoga is an accessible route to mindfulness, and could be a crucial tool for those exposed to environmental emergency. The American Psychological Association (APA), is just one organisation warning about the heavy psychological toll of climate change. Among those considered vulnerable to so-called climate trauma and stress are those who work directly with climate change data and policy. Earlier this year the APA published Mental Health and Our Changing Climate. One of the strategies it recommends is developing mindfulness through yoga and meditation. It's not just about self-preservation. Research by professor of sustainability Christine Wamsler focuses on the potential of mindful practice, like yoga, to make us better equipped to come up with solutions to climate change. According to her, the benefits of improving cognitive flexibility (not just physical) include the innovative thinking critical to forming sustainable solutions to crises. Unfortunately, even yoga succumbs to the forces of consumerism. Earlier this year Miami researchers found microfibres from washing yoga kits to be a contributor to ocean microplastic pollution. The green yoga movement reconnects yoga with its earth-friendly origins. Single-use water bottles are banned, mats and trousers are made of hemp and studios constructed from sustainable materials. To amplify the benefits, dispense with the studio. Research shows that health and wellness are boosted by exercising outside. It's time to take the mat into the great outdoors.

One year after the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Bonn Conference, which opens on 6 November in Germany, will be an opportunity for nations around the world to show their ambition for climate action and their determination to keep their promises. "While Paris represented one of those moments where the best of humanity achieved an agreement so important to our collective futures, Bonn represents how we will move forward to fulfill its promise", said the Executive Secretary of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Patricia Espinosa, on the margins of a ministerial meeting in Fiji on 17 October 2017 to prepare for the Bonn Conference of the Convention's States Parties. "We are running out of time to turn things around. To do so, we must significantly increase our efforts to reduce emissions and our carbon footprints," she added. The Paris Agreement, which was adopted by the 196 Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015 in the French capital after which it is named, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. A year ago, the Marrakech Climate Conference concluded with the Marrakech Action Proclamation, for our climate and sustainable development, in which the UNFCCC States Parties affirmed their "commitment" to the "full implementation" of the Paris Agreement. Today, 169 Parties have ratified the Agreement. At the Bonn Conference, informally known as COP 23 , countries will seek to move forward in completing the rule book for operationalizing the Paris Agreement. The Conference, which runs until 17 November, is chaired by Fiji, an island State particularly affected by the impacts of climate change. "Never has our work been more necessary. We see this with respect to the extreme weather events affecting almost every continent throughout the world," said Ms. Espinosa. COP 23 President and Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama agrees. "We can no longer ignore this crisis. Whether it is fires in California, Portugal and Spain. Flooding in Nigeria, India and Bangladesh. The dramatic Arctic melt. Ice breaking off the continent of Antarctica. The recent hurricanes that devastated the Caribbean and the southern United States [...] It's hard to find any part of the world that is unaffected by these events", he said at the ministerial meeting in Fiji. Bonn Conference an opportunity to boost climate risk management efforts In an op-ed published in October 2017, Ms. Espinosa, alongside the Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), Achim Steiner, and the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Robert Glasser, said the Bonn Conference "provides an opportunity to not only accelerate emission reductions but also boost the serious work of ensuring that the management of climate risk is integrated into disaster risk management as a whole." A week before the opening of the Bonn Conference, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced that the levels of carbon dioxide (C02) surged at "record-breaking speed" to new highs in 2016. The Bonn Conference will feature a series of meetings and events, including the high-level segment, on 15 November and 16 November, attended by Heads of State and Government, Ministers, and UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres. Mr. Guterres has invited leaders to consider championing six high-impact areas at a special Climate Summit in 2019. These areas are investment in clean technology, maturing carbon pricing, enabling the energy transition, risk mitigation and building resilience, augmenting the contribution of sub-national actors and business and mobilizing climate finance. "Increasing ambition is the only way to keep the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius this century, and as close to 1.5 degree as possible. By focusing on these sectors, we can substantially reduce the gap between where we are and where we need to be," said UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, at the pre-COP meeting in Fiji. Among the side events scheduled at COP 23 , several will be organized under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action to show how cities, regions, private sector companies and investors are trying to implement the Paris Agreement in the areas of energy, water, agriculture, oceans and coastal areas, human settlements, transportation, industry, and forests.

There is still a large gap between the pledges by governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the reductions scientists say are needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, the UN has said. Current plans from national governments, and pledges made by private sector companies and local authorities across the world, would lead to temperature rises of as much as 3C or more by the end of this century, far outstripping the goal set under the 2015 Paris agreement to hold warming to 2C or less, which scientists say is the limit of safety. The UN's findings come in its latest assessment of progress on climate change, published on Tuesday ahead of the COP23 conference, a follow-up to the Paris agreement, to be held in Bonn next week. There was some good news, however: the report found that carbon dioxide emissions had held steady globally since 2014. Against that, emissions of other greenhouse gases, notably methane, had increased. The "emissions gap" uncovered by the UN does not include the consequences of a US withdrawal from the Paris agreement. If the US president, Donald Trump, presses ahead with plans announced this summer to take the US out of the agreement, the picture would become "even bleaker", the report found. The US is the world's second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China. Related: Global atmospheric CO2 levels hit record high Erik Solheim, the UN's environment chief, called for urgent action: "We still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future. This is unacceptable. If we invest in the right technologies, ensuring that the private sector is involved, we can still meet the promise we made to our children to protect their future. But we have to get on the case now." There are signs that the world is moving away from its high-emissions trajectory. For instance, growing investment in renewable energy has caused the price of low-carbon power to plunge around the world, making it more attractive as an alternative to fossil fuels. However, there is also a danger that if buildings and other infrastructure, such as transport, are built along current lines, they will "lock in" high greenhouse gas emissions for the future. Instead, cities should be designed to avoid the need for cars in favour of public transport, to make room for renewable energy generation, and to cut down on the need for air conditioning. Private sector companies could also do more, according to the UN report. The world's 100 highest-emitting publicly traded companies account for a quarter of global emissions, showing the scope for reducing the prospective dangers of global warming if they were to make changes to their business practices and efficiency. The report also noted several potential short-term wins in staving off the worst effects of climate change, such as reducing the amount of soot entering the atmosphere, and phasing out the production of hydrofluorocarbons, used in air conditioning and refrigeration. The latter are powerful greenhouse gases, which when they reach the atmosphere cause warming many times greater than carbon dioxide, but there are alternatives which can be used instead. Separately, the UN reported this week that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide had reached record levels, in part owing to a strong El Ni\'f1o weather system. \</doc>

On the margins of the COP 23 climate talks in Bonn, the Green Finance Committee (GFC) of the China Society for Finance and Banking and the European Investment Bank (EIB) today launched a White Paper that provides an international comparison of several green bond standards. The new paper paves the way for enhancing the consistency of green finance definitions and standards between China and the EU. Introducing the White Paper, Yin Yong, Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said that 'the report provides a basis for future international cooperation on improving green finance definitions and standards with a view to facilitating cross-border green capital flows'. Key findings of the study were highlighted to global climate experts and representatives of the green bond community at COP 23 by Dr Ma Jun, Special Advisor to PBoC Governor and Chairman of China's Green Finance Committee, and Jonathan Taylor, European Investment Bank Vice President responsible for Asia and climate action. 'Development of green finance is a priority for China and China is now the world's largest green bond market. This year's global green bond issuance will likely expand by about 40%, and may continue to grow rapidly in the many years to come. However, the lack of clear definitions in some markets and the lack of comparability of different definitions in different markets are barriers to future growth of the green finance market and green capital flows, so efforts need to be made to enhance the comparability and consistency between different standards. This White Paper reflects on the strategic partnership between China and the European Union to promote international cooperation in this area.' said Ma Jun, Special Advisor to PBoC Governor and Chairman of China's Green Finance Committee. 'Strengthening investment in green finance is essential to support sustainable growth, improve environmental protection, and implement the Paris Agreement. The Green Finance White Paper published today will strengthen investor confidence and enhance transparency of green finance and follows months of technical assessment and market consultation by world-class experts.' said Jonathan Taylor, European Investment Bank Vice President. The study compares different use-of-proceeds classifications under the Chinese Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue, the Eligibility Criteria of EIB's Climate Awareness Bonds, the MDB-IDFC Common Principles for Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking, and identifies ways to improve comparability of disclosure and reporting. The study includes examination of sector definitions, environmental policy objectives and project eligibility criteria. The study draws from extensive discussions with market participants, including regulators, investors, securities firms, MDBs as well as other international financial institutions, external reviewers, and civil society representatives. Over the last nine months experts from the Green Finance Committee of the China Society for Finance and Banking and the European Investment Bank have mapped and compared core standards for investments eligible for financing through green bonds. 'As signatories of the Paris Agreement, the European Union and China are committed to mobilising new climate related investment by enhancing capital market frameworks. As the Bank of the European Union the European Investment Bank is committed to supporting climate related investment both through our own financing and working with others to enhance overall green investment.' added Jonathan Taylor. In March 2017 the People's Bank of China and the European Investment Bank announced the establishment of a joint green finance initiative to translate green definitions between China and those in the European market. Such a translation can help avoid duplication of verification and certification, and assist in reducing costs of green bond issuance. The Green Finance Committee of China Society for Finance and Banking was established in April 2015 with the approval of the People's Bank of China. The committee is a non-for-profit professional organisation dedicated to research and coordination of green finance initiatives of member institutions. As of October 2017, the Green Finance Committee had about 190 member institutions, including all major Chinese banks and many insurance companies, asset owners and managers, brokers, green companies, third party service providers and research institutions in the area of green finance. The financial assets under management of the member institutions amounts to RMB 120 trillion, accounting for roughly 70% of the total asset of China's financial industry. The GFC promulgated China's Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue (GB Catalogue) in December 2015. The European Investment Bank is the world's largest lender for climate related investment and pioneered the Green Bond market in 2007 by issuing the world's first green bond. Since then the EIB has issued EUR 20 billion in Green Bonds, branded as Climate Awareness Bonds, across 11 currencies, making the EIB the world's largest issuer of Green Bonds to date. EIB issuance of Climate Awareness Bonds in 2017 has already reached a record of EUR 4.3 billion. The European Investment Bank has financed projects in China since 1995 and last year the European Investment Bank Group provided EUR 84 billion to finance new investment around the world, including EUR 19.6 billion for climate related investment.

IN 1992, Whitney Houston fell head over stiletto heels for her po-faced protector, Kevin Costner, in the blockbuster thriller The Bodyguard. A quarter of a century later, the heady musk of bromance pervades as Samuel L Jackson and Ryan Reynolds wedge tongues firmly in cheek to play the targeted prey and gung-ho guardian in Patrick Hughes' high-octane action comedy. The Hitman's Bodyguard is a fitfully entertaining, testosteronesaturated romp that borrows the basic premise of the 1977 Clint Eastwood thriller The Gauntlet and orchestrates mayhem around the fractious on-screen chemistry of its two leads. Tom O'Connor's freewheeling THE HITMAN'S BODYGUARD (15) HHH HH script falls short of the filth and irreverence of Deadpool, and action sequences aren't as stylish as that comic book caper, but the cocktail of obscenities, bawdy humour and cartoon violence slips down smoothly. Reynolds and Jackson relish the potty-mouthed dialogue, but it's co-star Salma Hayek who sinks her painted talons deepest into every scene. She is a delirious delight as the latter man's snarling, sex-charged wife, who makes her entrance by severing a carotid artery with a beer bottle and spits choice expletives from her perfectly glossed lips with gusto. She perfectly embodies the film's outlandish, knockabout spirit. A bodyguard for hire is only as good as his last job. Michael Bryce (Reynolds) is one of the best protection agents in the business with a cautious, methodical approach to his work. "Boring is always best," he instructs his team. Out of the blue, he is contacted by his old flame, Amelia Roussel (Elodie Yung). She is an Interpol agent, who should be shepherding hitman Darius Kincaid (Jackson) to The Hague, where he is due to testify against East European dictator Vladislav Dukhovich (Gary Oldman). Instead, she is hiding in a safe house with Darius in the aftermath of an assault on the transportation cavalcade, initiated by Dukhovich's gun-toting henchmen. The breach in security convinces Amelia that there must be a mole in a team led by Renata Casoria (Tine Joustra) and Jean Foucher (Joaquim de Almeida). She needs someone "out of the loop" to shadow Darius to the International Court of Justice, and Michael reluctantly agrees. En route, the two men bicker and Darius teaches Michael how to win back Amelia by reminiscing about his courtship of jailbird wife Sonia (Hayek). The Hitman's Bodyguard ricochets between European locations as the high stakes game of catch-me-if-you-can results in wanton carnage. A high speed chase around the canals of Amsterdam is orchestrated at a breathless pace, while Oldman's pantomime villain hungrily chews scenery. The identity of the Interpol traitor will come as no surprise, but brawn easily smothers brains in O'Connor's loopy, crowd-pleasing script. THE DARK TOWER (12A) .. ... BASED on Stephen King's compelling series of fantasy novels, The Dark Tower illuminates a titanic battle between good and evil in parallel universes, seen through the eyes of a conflicted 11-year-old boy. A 95-minute running time leaves no room for character development, and the emaciated script fails to make explicit the stakes or repercussions for the young hero as he blunders through thrill-starved set-pieces. His mother Laurie (Katheryn Winnick) and unsympathetic stepfather Lon (Nicholas Pauling) send him for counselling with psychiatrist Dr Hotchkiss (Jose Zuniga), who listens intently to Jake's descriptions of nightly visions about an alien world where a lone gunslinger readies his pistol against a menacing man in black. The shrink dismisses Jake's nightmares as manifestations of his grief. Lon grows weary of the boy's erratic behaviour and insists Jake attend an upstate facility, which specialises in treating troubled youths. Instead, Jake flees to an abandoned house. Inside, he discovers a portal to a post-apocalyptic realm called Mid-World where a mysterious man named Roland Deschain (Idris Elba) hankers for revenge against evil sorcerer Walter Padick (Matthew McConaughey), who intends to destroy a tower at the centre of the universe that protects us from malevolent forces. Each assault on the monolith produces tremors in Mid-World and on Earth. "What happens in one world echoes in others," warns Roland, who surmises that Jake's visions are evidence of psychic abilities. The Dark Tower fails to shift out of first gear. A solid performance from rising star Taylor cannot distract attention from the painfully disjointed narrative and an absence of suspense. The apocalypse beckons and it can't come quickly enough. AN INCONVENIENT SEQUEL: TRUTH TO POWER (PG) HHH HH MINUTES into Jon Shenk and Bonni Cohen's tub-thumping sequel to Oscar-winning 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, it becomes apparent that there is one renewable energy source the world has yet to harness. It is a steady, irresistible thrum that won't destroy the ozone layer, and could power the planet for decades: former United States Vice President Al Gore's boundless determination to prick consciences about the effects of global warming. Gore loudly bangs a drum for action and words on climate change, spreading his message during a turbulent period of political upheaval including the election of Donald Trump, who withdrew the US from the Paris climate accord. Canadian Prime Justin Trudeau the UN Climate "With all these new threats, there's never been a more important time to speak truth to power," Gore sombrely observes, providing snappy subtitle for the sequel. Like its predecessor, the film incorporates segments from Gore's slide-show lectures, which have been updated with scenes from Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and flooding in Florida, the state which famously denied him the keys to the White House in the 2000 presidential election against George W Bush. Breathtaking footage of the statesman atop a rapidly intercut with snappy soundbites that anoint Gore as the lone voice of reason capable of deviating us from self-destruction. "Big money has so much influence now," he laments. "Our democracy has been hacked." Nowhere in the film is this more pronounced than footage from the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, where consensus is countered by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He rationalises that the West has enjoyed 150 years of burning fossil fuels and now India should be afforded the same opportunity. An unflustered Gore heads backstage to makes a few calls to powerful friends. Lo and behold, a few tense hours later, the accord is salvaged. Aside from lionising Gore, the sequel is blessed with scenes of undeniable emotional power. Minister and Al Gore at Conference His 24-hour reality broadcast on November 13, 2015 in Paris is interrupted by shocking news of suicide bombings and shooting in the French capital. With glistening eyes, Gore stands before the largely French production crew and delivers a heartfelt pledge of solidarity. These simple, unscripted words resonate and remind us of the undeniable power of strangers, from different cultures and backgrounds, to pull together in pursuit of a common goal - our survival. \</doc>

MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota-General Mills has joined leading companies in an agreement to end deforestation, protect national parks from illegal cocoa production and develop alternative livelihoods for affected smallholder farmers in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. The two countries produce nearly two-thirds of the world's annual supply of cocoa. The far-reaching joint Frameworks for Action, led by the World Cocoa Foundation, was announced today at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany. Cocoa is one of General Mills' 10 priority ingredients, which the company has committed to 100-percent sustainably source by 2020. More than 70 percent of the cocoa General Mills buys is grown in West African countries including Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. 'Deforestation is a significant challenge, but by aligning and working together we can help put a stop to it and positively impact climate change by rehabilitating the land,' said John Church, chief supply chain officer for General Mills. 'We also recognize there are systemic labor issues in the cocoa supply chain, and we understand it will take industry-wide collaboration to make improvements. Having the national and local governments, who are key to addressing the issues, at the table from the beginning is key.' The Frameworks for Action was developed through an extensive, multi-stakeholder process that brought together two national governments, private sector - including farmers and farmers' organizations - national and international civil society organizations, development partners, and other stakeholders in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and globally. 'The Frameworks for Action announced in Bonn, and signed by visionary companies including General Mills, protects and restore forests that have been degraded, accelerates investment in agricultural productivity and engages communities about the importance of this work to their long-term well-being,' said Richard Scobey, president of the World Cocoa Foundation. 'Most of the deforestation in the cocoa sector in West Africa is a result of poor farmers trying to earn a living by going into protected areas to cut down trees to grow cocoa. This means that we must focus on community development, community empowerment, and making sure that farmers' livelihoods are taken in to account and respected.' The Framework is centered around three themes: Forest protection and restoration: This covers the conservation of National Parks and Reserves, improving the forest cover in the rural domain, as well as restoration of Forest Reserves that have been degraded by human activities, in particular encroachment by cocoa farms among other factors. Sustainable production and farmers' livelihoods: This covers sustainable intensification and diversification of production to increase farmers' yields and income to reduce pressure on forests. Community engagement and social inclusion: This covers social safeguards through civil society and community engagement. 'This framework will help advance much of the work that we are already doing in these regions to improve the sustainability of cocoa production and foster greater economic vitality for cocoa-growing communities,' said Church. 'It is our view that a greater share of the benefit of more socially and economically sustainable cocoa production practices should accrue to the people who produce the crop. This framework will help better implement that across the region.'

The UN hopes to create an "operating manual" for implementing the Paris agreement on climate change, with talks in the next two weeks in Bonn. "We want to advance further, faster, together to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement," said Patricia Espinosa, the UN's chief official on the climate, at the opening of the talks. "We need an operating manual for the Paris agreement. This has to be the launchpad for the next level of ambition on climate change action, because we know the pledges [to cut emissions] made so far are not enough to take us to [meeting the Paris goals]." Nazhat Shameem Khan, of the Fijian presidency, said she wanted delegates to answer three questions: where we are on meeting the Paris commitments; where we want to be; and how to get there. "This needs high level commitment," she said. "We do not have the luxury of having lots of philosophical discussions. We have to roll our sleeves up and get through the agenda points." Although the document agreed in Paris was extensive, it could not set out in full detail all of the ways in which governments would be expected to implement the agreement, and the process of checking how this is being achieved. Some of these technical issues could be relatively easily resolved, but others have a broader political import that will require delicate negotiation. One key issue will be "enhancing ambition", which means making good on the commitment made in Paris to strengthen countries' pledges on cutting emissions, given that current pledges are inadequate to hold warming to no more than 2C, as required by the landmark agreement. A key date falls next year, when countries are supposed to start coming forward with higher pledges. However, Espinosa stopped short of saying that COP23 would result in a full timetable for when countries would be required to make new commitments. "That's a difficult question to answer at this point. But I remain optimistic." Elina Bardram, director general of climate action for the EU, said the bloc wanted to "flesh out the technical guidelines of implementation", including allowing for "transparency and accountability". This means ensuring not only that pledges are sufficient, but that they are being met by the national governments signed up to the Paris accord. It can be a tricky issue at the UN talks, where countries set their own targets and ways of meeting them. The EU is soon expected to set out its own progress on meeting its emissions-cutting target, and how it intends to ensure its 2030 target of a 40% emissions cut is met. Discussions would also take place on climate finance, which involves ways of helping poorer countries to cut their emissions, Espinosa promised. She declined to give any targets on how much finance should be raised and where it should come from, but said the outlook was positive. "There is a very clear tendency going in the direction of green financing," she said, referring to estimates that more money worldwide is going into low-carbon projects. She also said the US delegation was present and taking a full part in the talks. President Donald Trump announced last summer his intention to begin the withdrawal process, the only country to have done so. Despite this, the US will be party to the agreement until 2020, as the the withdrawal process will take several years. The UN said 169 countries of the 197 signed up to the Paris agreement had now ratified it. \</doc>

November 10, 2017 New commitments and initiatives in energy, water and agriculture sectors were announced on Friday, at the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, under the auspices of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action to help implement the Paris Agreement. The Marrakech Partnership aims at catalyzing greater climate action by public and private stakeholders as the Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, calls on countries to combat climate change by limiting the rise of global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and strive not to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. Cleaner energy development In Bonn, new initiatives were announced to push forward the transition to renewable energy and to show that more ambitious clean energy development can quickly become a bigger part of national climate plans submitted under the Paris Agreement. "With the price of renewable and storage technologies tumbling, and greater understanding on how to set the policy table for a cleaner energy mix and more integrated energy planning, the question before decision makers is, why wait?" said Rachel Kyte, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and CEO, Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All). Among key announcements, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) released a new report, Untapped Potential for Climate Action: Renewable Energy in Nationally Determined Contributions, which suggests there is substantial scope for countries to cost-effectively increase renewable energy. The Climate Group also announced new members to its recently launched EV100 campaign, a major new global electric transport initiative designed to make electric vehicles "the new normal." And 13 countries with the International Energy Agency (IEA) announced this week the launch of a new multi-year, 30 million euros plan to support clean energy transitions around the world. Investing faster and further in agricultural climate action Regarding agriculture, leaders and experts said that investing faster and further in agricultural climate action and to support the sustainable livelihoods of small-scale farmers will unlock much greater potential to curb emissions and protect people against climate change. "Countries now have the opportunity to transform their agricultural sectors to achieve food security for all through sustainable agriculture and strategies that boost resource-use efficiency, conserve and restore biodiversity and natural resources, and combat the impacts of climate change," said Rene Castro, Assistant-Director General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the livestock sector, for example, FAO estimates that emissions could be readily reduced by about 30 percent with the adoption of best practices. FAO released a new Sourcebook on Climate-Smart Agriculture. It recommends scaling up public and private climate finance flows to agriculture; spurring public-private partnerships; strengthening a multi-sector and multi-stakeholder dialogue; investing in knowledge and information; and building capacity to address barriers to implement climate action. Managing healthy water supplies "Sustainable use of water for multiple purposes must remain a way of life and needs to be at the center of building resilient cities and human settlements and ensuring food security in a climate change context," said Mariet Verhoef-Cohen, President of the Women for Water Partnership. The international water community co-signed on Friday what it called a "nature based solution declaration" to encourage the use of natural systems in managing healthy water supplies. Around 40 per cent of the world's population will face water shortages by 2050, accelerating migration and triggering conflict, while some regions could lose up to six per cent of their economic output, unless it is better managed. "Involving both women and men in decision making and integrated water resources initiatives leads to better sustainability, governance and efficiency", said Ms. Verhoef-Cohen. \</doc>

Global emissions of CO in 2017 are projected to rise for the first time in four years, dashing hopes that a peak might soon be reached, according to new research from UK-based Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The main cause of the expected growth has been greater use of coal in China as its economy expanded. The report points out that China's growth in fossil emissions will rise 3.5%. Researchers are uncertain if the rise in emissions is a one-off or the start of a new period of CO2 build-up. Scientists say that a global peak in CO 2 before 2020 is needed to limit dangerous global warming this century. Elsewhere, the report also maintained that CO 2 emissions are expected to decline by 0.4% in the US and 0.2% in the EU, smaller declines than during the previous decade. Increases in coal use in China and the US are expected this year, reversing their decrease s since 2013. The news comes as policymakers and delegates have been meeting at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ) in Bonn, Germany, this week (6-17 November, 2017). Lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Qu\'e9r\'e9, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at UEA, said: 'Global CO emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three year stable period. This is very disappointing. 2 emissions from human activities estimated at 41 billion tonnes for 2017, time is running out on our ability to keep warming well below 2\'b0C let alone 1.5\'b0C. 'This year we have seen how climate change can amplify the impacts of hurricanes with more intense rainfall, higher sea levels and warmer ocean conditions favouring more powerful storms. This is a window into the future. We need to reach a peak in global emissions in the next few years and drive emissions down rapidly afterwards to address climate change and limit its impacts.' Declining emissions Glen Peters of the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo who led one of the studies said: 'The return to growth in global emissions in 2017 is largely due to growth in Chinese emissions, projected to grow by 3.5% in 2017 after two years with declining emissions. The use of coal, the main fuel source in China, may rise by 3% due to stronger growth in industrial production and lower hydro-power generation due to less rainfall. 'The growth in 2017 emissions is unwelcome news, but it is too early to say whether it is a one-off event on a way to a global peak in emissions, or the start of a new period with upward pressure on global emissions growth.' The team flags that persistent uncertainties exist in our ability to estimate recent changes in emissions, particularly when there are unexpected changes as in the last few years. 'Even though we may detect a change in emission trend early, it may take as much as ten years to confidently and independently verify a sustained change in emissions using measurements of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide,' said Peters. 'Policy makers in Bonn are preparing for the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement, that will start in 2018 and occur every five years, and this puts immense pressure on the scientific community to develop methods and perform measurements that can truly verify changes in emissions within this five-yearly cycle,' said Le Qu\'e9r\'e9. \</doc>

PROGRESS on clean air is "simply not good enough", the UK Government has been told. Lillian Greenwood, chair of Westminster's Transport Select Committee, hit out yesterday after a National Audit Office (NAO) report revealed 85 per cent of air quality zones across the UK still exceed legal pollution limits seven years after the deadline. Targets were supposed to have been met in 2010, but the NAO says it will take until 2026 to meet targets for nitrogen dioxide in all zones. Labour MP Greenwood said: "It's clear that action on air quality is needed now. "Waiting for almost another decade for all parts of the UK to reach acceptable levels of air quality is a deeply disappointing prospect, and simply not good enough." Ministers were forced to publish revised clean air plans in July, after previous proposals were ruled insufficient by the courts. They now face further legal action from environmental law firm ClientEarth over the latest plans. A joint inquiry by four parliamentary committees will now take place, with evidence sessions beginning later this month. More than 150 written responses have been gathered and legal and health experts are expected to give evidence. Conservative Andrew Selous, of Westminster's Health Committee, said high levels of pollution have "significant impacts" on public health, exacerbating diseases and contributing to deaths from heart attacks, lung disease, diabetes and dementia. Mary Creagh MP, who chairs the Environmental Audit Committee, said: "The Government published its third air quality plan in July after its last two were ruled illegal by the courts. "The Government now faces its third legal challenge and unprecedented scrutiny from this super inquiry. "They must use every tool in the box to clean up Britain's polluted air." A government spokesperson defended progress, but admitted coordinated action must now be taken. She said: "Air pollution has improved significantly since 2010, but we recognise there is more to do which is why we have put in place a \£33 billion plan to improve air quality and reduce harmful emissions." The report and enquiry are revealed against a backdrop of the COP23 UN Climate Change Conference, which aims to ensure nations meet their obligations to ensure the global temperature rise remains well below two degrees Celsius this century. Scientists warn any increase on this rise would be catastrophic and a global deal was agreed in Paris last year. On Wednesday Nicola Sturgeon addressed the conference, telling delegates in Bonn: "Tackling climate change is an overwhelming moral obligation that we owe to this and future generations." She went on: "Our ambitions must live up to the scale of the challenge and our actions must live up to our ambitions." Yesterday, the UK and Canada led an alliance of 20 nations committed to ending the production of coal for energy use. France, Finland and Mexico are amongst the countries that have pledged to phase out the use of coal within 15 years. It is hoped that this initial group will grow to include 50 states before the UN holds its next major UN conference in Poland next year, with all signing up to the 2030 target. However, the biggest coal consumers have yet to join, including America, China and Germany. Responding, Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said: "With the world set to use fossil fuels, including coal, for the foreseeable future, Canada and the UK should direct efforts to advancing carbon capture and storage technology because that's much more likely to achieve global climate objectives than unrealistic calls to eliminate coal in major emerging economies." However, Jens Mattias Clausen of Greenpeace said: "This is another positive signal of the global momentum away from coal." \</doc>

Rueil-Malmaison - Schneider Electric, the leader in digital transformation of energy management and automation, will join other sustainability leaders to support and accelerate the common fight against climate change at the One Planet Summit. Two years to the day after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, and following COP23 , President of France Emmanuel Macron is organizing the milestone summit to convene those involved in public and private finance to deliver ambitious and achievable actions that will contribute to limiting global warming and its impact. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Schneider Electric said: 'Prosperity and energy are intertwined. For Schneider Electric, contributing to the process of achieving carbon neutrality is an ambitious and productive challenge that deserves the joint commitment of the public and private sectors. Schneider Electric is aligning its strategy and its activity with this essential outlook of the 21st century.' To mark the occasion of the One Planet Summit, Schneider Electric is accelerating its ambition and commitments for climate that supports the company's objectives to reduce its plants and sites carbon emission and to become carbon neutral by 2030 in a coherent industry ecosystem encompassing both suppliers and clients. The pledge is based around three complementary initiatives: Before 2020, outline a specific trajectory based on the assumption that Earth will breach the 2-degreeC warming limit by 2050 and validate it through the Science-Based Targets initiative, in which Schneider Electric has been involved for one year, and increase the impact of Schneider Electric's internal carbon price. Schneider Electric has already set a goal of cutting CO2 emissions by more than 50% in absolute value by 2050 compared to 2015. Achieve for 2030, and add to, the 10 commitments presented at COP21 in 2015 in order to build carbon neutrality within Schneider Electric's ecosystem and specifically quantify the carbon impact of 100% of its major customer projects. Starting today take action and, to ensure full transparency, monitor whether Schneider Electric has achieved its targets through the quarterly publication of its Planet & Society barometer and in connection with major open coalitions. These commitments are accelerating the results already obtained and disseminated through Schneider Electric's four barometers since 2008; for example, its energy intensity was cut by 42% between 2005 and 2017, and the carbon intensity of its logistics was reduced by 35% between 2012 and 2017. The One Planet Summit will also see Tricoire and other Schneider Electric executives collaborate with other sustainability leaders on how to deliver tangible actions on the most pressing global sustainability challenges across a series of events and roundtables. Schneider Electric will also announce several new commitments that will maintain the company's leading position at the forefront of sustainability efforts including: As a global leader at the crossroads of the energy transition and the digital transition, Schneider Electric is focusing on intelligent control, active distribution management and energy consumption. Schneider Electric is committed to bringing solutions to market that will increase the flexibility of both industrial production and all energy fields and applications. Schneider Electric's aim is to improve usage comfort and safety while sharply cutting - at the lowest cost - energy consumption and carbon emissions in keeping with the new landscape of decentralized, carbon-free and digitalized energy production. Because access to energy is a fundamental human right, Schneider Electric also intends to innovate to help the one billion people on the planet who do not have access to energy and the 10% of inhabitants facing energy insecurity, by developing affordable and reliable low-carbon solutions.

We need the right technology, not new technology and, essentially a systemic mindset to realise a sustainable transport system. That was the message delivered by Scania at this year's UN Climate Change Conference ( COP23 ). 'Possibilities rather than problems' were the focus of this year's conference says Jonas Stromberg, Scania's Director of Sustainable Solutions. Despite this, Stromberg felt there was, at times, too much emphasis on what he called 'silver-bullet technology'. 'My first line is always that the technology is not the problem, we have the technology. The problem is that procurers, cities and decision makers are not asking for cost-efficient technology, they are only asking for the next technology,' he says. Systemic approach to sustainable transport Speaking during a seminar on public transport Stromberg emphasised the necessity to use several solutions with the technology already present. He also underlined the need to approach sustainable transport systematically. 'We shouldn't only be looking at the city but also to whole regional transport patterns. Different solutions are needed for different areas, and procuring whole systems of vehicles, infrastructure and clean fuels makes it possible for us in the industry to offer really cost-efficient solutions.' Considering the whole transport system Stromberg explained that a change in mindset when it comes to procurement is fundamental. 'To understand the situation you need to understand the operators, the customers, and the cities. This is why one of our key messages was when you undertake procurement you must consider the whole transport system in a systematic way.' He also spoke of the need for CO2 taxation. 'We believe you really have to have a global CO2 tax otherwise nothing will change.' Replacing fossil fuel A CO2 emissions tax has transformed Sweden. In 1970 the nation was the most oil-dependent nation per capita of all the European countries. Now, apart from the transport sector, oil has been phased out everywhere. However, the transport sector is changing fast. Sweden has the highest replacement of fossil fuel systems in the transport sector of any country. A good example of this is Stockholm county's 2,300 strong bus fleet. Only one bus, on a small island in the archipelago, is still run on a fossil fuel - diesel - and it is soon to be replaced. For 15 years, public transport procurement in Sweden has been demanding CO2 efficiency, not necessarily new technology. It is the most cost-efficient solution and has reduced CO2 by over 90 percent. All this has been achieved with 'off-the-shelf' technology, nothing new. Scania's biogas buses in the UK are another good example of a cost-effective sustainable solution. They reduce 90 percent of emissions by 80 percent the cost of diesel. Making transport more efficient 'The strength of Swedish and Nordic climate policies is the big consensus of opinion between the opposition parties and the governing parties that we need to do more to get a sustainable society and to de-carbonise. Therefore, whatever happens in the next election, this development will continue and this is important for industry.' Wastljung underlined the importance to the panel of making the transport of goods more efficient, telling them that 'one of Scania's goals is to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% from our land transport by 2025.'

TWO members of Marvin Rees' cabinet have been sacked, bringing an end to the cross-party group. The Green Party's Fi Hance, cabinet member for Energy, Waste and Regulatory Services will leave her role, together with Tory member Claire Hiscott, who had charge of education. Ms Hance, who represented the Redland ward, had only been in Bonn two weeks ago to represent Bristol in the COP23 UN climate conference. Ms Hiscott, who was elected in the Horfield ward, was the only Conservative member on the Mayor's cabinet. Mr Rees's original cabinet when he was first elected included both Ms Hance and Ms Hiscott, together with Lib Dem councillor Clare Campion-Smith, who left in the last reshuffle. Councillor Eleanor Combley, leader of the Green Party, said: "It's disappointing, but not altogether surprising, that this has happened. The cross-party cabinet was always a political calculation by the Labour Mayor in the first place - now he (or his advisors) have clearly decided that it no longer works to their advantage. "As Marvin himself acknowledged, our Green Cabinet Member Fi Hance has done great work for Bristol. "Even though we often sought to avoid stepping on the Labour Mayor's toes, he has repeatedly shown he is unable to accept any sort of criticism, constructive or otherwise. "This is a worrying trait - a thin skin is not a helpful attribute if you want to be responsible for running a city. "Denial of views other than your own and an inability to listen reflects poor leadership. The future of Bristol is simply too important to be held hostage to one man's ego." She added they would continue to "hold the Labour administration and Mayor" to account. Conservative leader Mark Weston said: "This is disappointing but not entirely unexpected news. "The Mayor has previously reshuffled his Cabinet to remove leading Labour colleagues like Mark Bradshaw and the then Lib Dem representative Clare Campion-Smith. "Sadly, we have seen Marvin becoming increasingly political in his public actions and utterances in recent months, presumably as a means of satisfying the new left wing dynamic within the local Labour Party. "It has also been noticeable lately that the Mayor has been very sensitive to criticism and less receptive to constructive opposition. "The latest setback he received to his plan to close most of the city's libraries may be another catalyst or explanation for today's decision. "Nonetheless, this move in no way reflects badly on the diligent work undertaken by Cllr Hiscott in the challenging education brief and I am glad that the Mayor himself has been quick to concede that fact." Mr Rees said: "After winning the mayoralty and our majority in City Hall 18 months ago, I reached out to all parties and asked them to join us in working in the best interests of Bristol. We formed a cabinet which looked more like the people we represent more than any that have come before it. "The Labour Group and I are proud of these achievements but it is increasingly clear that the behaviour of other parties has made this arrangement untenable. "In my recent state of the city speech, I renewed my invitation to the other parties to drop the race for headlines and work with us to deliver for the city but they have shown no change in behaviour or no more intent to work with us, for the city. Labour's priority remains the delivery of our city aspirations, not cheap headlines. "Therefore, I have written to the leaders of the Green and Conservative groups to advise them that the cross party cabinet cannot continue. "Cabinet appointments will be announced shortly." \</doc>

Levels of carbon pollution from Britain's electricity generation have almost halved in just a few years, making the country's power system one of the world's cleanest, a report said. Emissions associated with each unit of electricity produced fell 47% between 2012 and 2016 as coal was replaced by more gas and renewables, the Electric Insights study by Imperial College London for power company Drax said. It meant Britain moved 13 places up the league table of 33 large power-consuming countries to seventh, having seen the fastest reduction in its carbon pollution from electricity generation of any country in that time. Pollution levels fell from 516 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity in 2012 to 275g in 2016, the report reveals. The amount of coal fired generation fell four-fifths in that period, it found. The countries with lower carbon pollution from their electricity system all have extensive hydropower resources, such as Norway, which has the cleanest power, or in the case of France relies heavily on nuclear reactors. South Africa and India have the dirtiest power systems in the league table, with most of their electricity generated from coal. Drop in carbon pollution makes UK power system one of world's cleanest twitter 2 Drax said the Government's carbon price floor, which sets a charge for greenhouse gas emissions from power stations which is well above a Europe-wide price for the pollution, had driven the uptake in renewables and a shift from coal to gas-fired power. Dr Iain Staffell, from Imperial College London, said Britain had entered the world's top 10 of low-carbon power for the first time. "Britain is reducing its carbon emissions from electricity faster than any other major company, and this has happened because the carbon price and lower gas prices have forced coal off the system - the amount of coal-fired power generation in Britain has fallen 80% between 2012 and 2016," he said. Drop in carbon pollution makes UK power system one of world's cleanest twitter 3 Drax has switched half its coal-fired power station to biomass, woodchip sourced from places such as southern US forests, which is not subject to the carbon price, though some environmental groups have raised concerns about how environmentally-friendly the energy source is. The company is calling for the Government to continue to support a "meaningful" carbon price in the autumn Budget to ensure the UK's commitments on climate change are met. Power generators are charged \£323 a tonne of carbon dioxide pollution in the UK, compared to \£35 a tonne in Europe. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: "The UK is a world leader in clean energy, reducing emissions faster than any other G7 nation, and our competitive approach to renewable electricity projects has reduced costs for consumers and provides long-term certainty for electricity producers. "The UK's Clean Growth Strategy has innovation at the heart of our approach, with over \£32.5 billion of Government investment in the UK from 2015 to 2021. "The message we will be taking to this week's COP23 climate change summit in Bonn is that you don't have to choose between economic growth and carbon reduction. "Industry and Government will continue to work together to deliver growth, build a thriving UK supply chain and seize commercial opportunities in the UK and abroad." \</doc>

As the world gathers in Bonn for COP23 , the UN's annual climate change conference, Professor Mike Barnes, from The University of Manchester's School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, outlines why he thinks offshore wind could be a boom industry for the UK. The UK generates more electricity from offshore wind than any other country in the world with around 5% of our annual electrical energy coming from the sector. This is expected to grow to 10% by 2020. Wind power is also a fundamental part of the Government's decarbonisation targets. Windfarm electricity capacity will rise from 5 Gigawatts (GW) currently, to between 20 GW and 40 GW in the next two decades. That will cost between GBP60 billion to GBP140 billion in the UK alone. On a global scale, the potential is even bigger. Current policy plans says the world's wind capacity could rise from 435 GW in 2015 to 977 GW by 2030. Of that 905 GW will come from onshore, but 72 GW will come from offshore wind. Offshore windfarms have numerous benefits when compared to their land-based counterparts, such as size and geography. Building large scale windfarms on land takes up valuable space which just isn't a problem offshore. But this does also come with its own challenges such as maintaining them and connecting them to the grid. Based on the UK Government's own projections for the deployment of offshore wind, the operation and maintenance of more than 5,500 offshore turbines could be worth almost GBP2bn per annum by 2025. That's an industry similar in size to the UK passenger aviation market. Electricity generated from renewable sources presently accounts for around 25% of UK power demand. Current EU targets mean that by 2020, the UK must be generating 30%. To meet these expectations the expansion of UK's offshore wind capacity has been proposed as one of the ways to achieve this. And by the end of 2015 it was reported that 92% of the worlds offshore wind installations were located in European waters. Simply put the offshore wind industry could be a huge bonanza for the UK. That is where our research comes in. HOME Offshore is a research project funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) which partners 5 leading UK universities. The project is investigating the use of advanced sensing, robotics, virtual reality models and artificial intelligence to reduce maintenance cost and effort for offshore windfarms. Predictive and diagnostic techniques will allow problems to be picked up early, when easy and inexpensive maintenance will allow problems to be readily fixed. At The University of Manchester, part of our work is also focussing on creating a new kind of circuit breaker design for offshore power networks. That's because for long-distance offshore windfarms, direct current (DC) is a more cost-effective way to bring power back to shore than alternating current (AC). Current windfarms are connected to the grid using conventional AC but the next generation of offshore wind farms, also known as 'Round Three' windfarms, will eventually lead to DC grids. Protection of these grids will require DC breakers, which is what we're developing. Getting the best value for UK bill-payers requires an assessment of technology options and will require innovative solutions, and that is what our work will provide. Renewable electricity is now fundamental part of any country's power strategy and the UK has the opportunity to lead the way in offshore wind. It is an opportunity we should grab with both hands. Energy Energy is one of The University of Manchester's research beacons - examples of pioneering discoveries, interdisciplinary collaboration and cross-sector partnerships that are tackling some of the biggest questions facing the planet.

En Fran\'e7ais Gabon is rolling out a new forestry surveillance programme to monitor green spaces and enforce sustainable development as part of its commitment under the Paris Agreement, a move backed by donor funding that should help keep its forestry sector on a long-term growth path. Systems upgrade to satellite surveillance In late May the government published decree No. 0774/PM in its official gazette, which establishes a regulatory framework to allow the state to better monitor "all activities affecting the integrity of the country's forests" including mining, energy and agro-industries. The new regulations institutionalise real-time satellite surveillance of Gabon's forests for both scientific and enforcement purposes by the Gabonese Agency for Spatial Studies and Observations (Agence Gabonaise d'Etudes et d'Observations Spatiales, AGEOS). Using an antenna in Nkok, the system allows AGEOS to study growth patterns and estimate carbon stocks, as well as identify potentially illegal logging in real time and alert quick-response teams to crack down on harmful deforestation, according to the UN Development Programme. \~ AGEOS's surveillance activity largely relies on two sets of spatial imagery - mid- and high-resolution - from separate satellite systems: Pl\'e9iades, run by the Paris-based National Centre for Spatial Studies, and Landsat, owned by the US Geological Survey. Potential impact Gabon first began exploring the possibility of satellite surveillance of its forests in 2007, eventually signing a (EURO)9m financing agreement with the French Development Agency. AGEOS began operations roughly eight years later in 2015, collecting data from a range of satellites owned by both public and private sector partners, including the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Italian-headquartered aerospace company Telespazio. However, the move to formalise AGEOS surveillance activity in the broader forestry regulatory framework - which, notably, includes the ability for the agency to raise funding through an annual levy on deeded land - could greatly improve the sector's governance in Gabon. The central African country, which is slightly larger in area than the UK, is one of the world's most forested countries at 88% of its total land area, according to the UN. As a result, preventing over-exploitation of its roughly 23m ha of forest can be challenging without the necessary surveillance capacity. New means of oversight will also be key to meeting Gabon's COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change commitment to cut carbon output in half - from 2005 levels - by 2030. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's most recent data, deforestation made up 6.4% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions as of 2011. There are encouraging signs: a more recent UN study showed a net gain in forest area of some 200 ha in forest area, or 1%, during 2010-15, mostly due to natural regeneration. International support Monitoring measures will also benefit from a new "brigade" of inspection officers, formed last month to patrol forestry activity in the district of Komo-Mondah. Funded entirely by the World Bank, local media report the group was inaugurated July 26 in Ntoum by Prime Minister Emmanuel Issoze Ngondet and will work as part of the Forestry Service to prevent illegal logging. Green growth These developments come on the heels of a relatively strong performance by the forestry sector this year. In the first quarter of 2017 production of processed wood increased by 14.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) on the back of increased efficiency in the delivery of logs and the commissioning of new processing units. Sales of forestry products accordingly rose by 10.3% in the domestic market and 10.7% in overseas markets. Lumber output registered similar growth in that period, rising by 13.6% y-o-y to 110,143 cu metres, while veneering activities grew by 9.3% and plywood by 55.2% to reach 15,976 cu metres. The growth is notable, given that timber processing activity in Gabon was relatively limited a decade ago. A 2010 ban on raw timber imports forced logging companies to expand downstream operations, swelling the ranks of log transformation facilities by 36% to 130 during 2012-14 and creating more than 7000 jobs in the process. As a result, Gabon's log processing capacities increased from 1.2m-1.5m cu metres before the ban to 2.5m this year. In March a World Bank assessment of the ban concluded that since 2010, reforms in Gabon's forestry sector had raised the sector's contribution to GDP, doubled job creation and prevented emission of 69m tonnes of CO2 equivalent. \</doc>

Climate-change policy in Germany: Huffing and puffing As climate talks open in Bonn, Germany's green credentials suffer THE PR arm of Germany's environment ministry has had a busy autumn. Over the past two weeks, colourful posters advertising the government's global initiatives against climate change have gone up all over the country. In Bonn, where thousands of delegates gathered this week for the COP23 round of international climate-change talks, journalists are being encouraged to tour the area's green projects. Barbara Hendricks, the environment minister, opened proceedings by pledging additional funds to help developing countries adjust to global warming. The world is supposed to see a pioneering green nation "ready for the future", as the poster campaign has it. But look more closely, and that is only half-true. In October the government was forced to concede that Germany will probably break its commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions (to 40% below the 1990 level by 2020) by a wide margin: without drastic adjustments, emissions are predicted to fall by only 32%. The setback comes at an awkward time. After America's exit from the Paris climate accord, Germany, along with other European countries, was expected to take the lead in implementing it. That process is supposed to make headway in Bonn. Germany will hardly be a credible leader, however, if it cannot reach its own emissions targets. The task of salvaging the country's green credentials will fall to the new governing coalition that Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) are negotiating with the Christian Social Union (CSU), their sister party, plus the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP). Climate wonks think that the parties' immediate priority should be to make a coherent plan to get out of coal. In the short term, this may involve putting some of the dirtiest plants on the back burner, says Patrick Graichen of Agora, an energy think-tank. In the longer term, many economists favour the introduction of a carbon tax. But whatever measures are taken, says Mr Graichen, "by 2040 at the latest, the last coal plants must be turned off." Such a plan looks far off. Among the coalition negotiators, only the Greens are pushing for a swift exit from coal. The FDP dislikes the level of state intervention that switching off power stations might involve, and frets about the damage such plans would do to Germany's industrial heartlands. That also worries some Christian Democrats: in North Rhine-Westphalia, newly governed by the CDU, thousands of jobs are still tied to lignite mines and power stations. Christian Lindner, the FDP's leader, suggested on November 5th that Germany might have to scale back its ambition. A compromise is needed. Maybe the scrutiny of international delegates in Bonn will help to speed it along. Retrieve Image \</doc>

The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) have set up an emergency post-disaster reconstruction financing initiative to help the Region recover from recent hurricane events. The arrangement will support investments for infrastructure reconstruction projects in the Caribbean in the wake of the recent hurricanes. The new USD 24 million financing package is an addition to the USD 120 million Climate Action Framework Loan II signed in May this year, and which remains the EIB's biggest loan to the Caribbean. Eligible investments under the new loan will include infrastructure reconstruction, with a focus on 'building back better' and integrating climate risk and vulnerability assessments into the projects. This will help reduce the Bank's Borrowing Member Countries' vulnerability to future natural disasters and worsening climate change impacts. As well as infrastructure, financing to communities for low-carbon and climate-resilience measures such as improved water resource management are also foreseen. CDB President Wm. Warren Smith and EIB Vice President responsible for Climate Action, Jonathan Taylor, signed the new agreement during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn, Germany. Small Island Developing States is a key theme for the event this year under the Fijian Presidency. Against this backdrop, CDB and EIB presented innovative solutions to climate challenges during an event focusing on climate action in the Caribbean, attended by the Prime Minister of Grenada, Dr. the Rt. Hon. Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, Hon. Allen Chastanet and other stakeholders. Jonathan Taylor, EIB Vice President said: 'In response to the devastation caused by hurricanes in the region in recent weeks, the EIB and CDB rapidly agreed to commit additional resources to support reconstruction investment projects in the Caribbean. The USD 24 million post-hurricane reconstruction initiative comes in addition to the USD 120 million loan to CDB for financing climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience projects which we signed earlier this year. We stand committed to developing our fruitful 40 year partnership with CDB, to support climate-resilient projects in the Caribbean and to help to adequately tackle the challenges related to climate change. ' CDB President Wm. Warren Smith said: 'The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most devastating the Caribbean has ever experienced, and underscored the urgent need for investment in climate-resilient infrastructure in our region. The signing of this agreement is another milestone in our longstanding partnership with EIB, and will facilitate CDB's increased support for resilient reconstruction in the Caribbean. We remain committed to work with our partners to mobilise resources needed to 'build back better' and, despite the recent setbacks, help the most vulnerable countries of our region to remain focused on meeting their goals for sustainable development.' To date, CDB has committed all of the resources under the first Climate Action Line of Credit - USD 65.6 million - for seven projects. This co-financing is associated with total project financing of USD 191 million. Since CDB's Climate Resilience Strategy was approved in 2012, 58% of projects financed have included climate change adaptation and/or mitigation elements in the climate-sensitive sectors of water, education, agriculture, and physical infrastructure such as sea defences, drainage, and roads. Using the Joint Multilateral Development Bank Methodology, climate financing represented 13% of total CDB project financing in 2015. In 2016, CDB approved USD 50 million for projects with explicit climate resilience and sustainable energy actions. A pipeline of climate action projects amounting to over USD 300 million and which may be eligible for funding from this new loan has been developed with financing of an EIB-funded technical assistance programme. The EIB has supported development and economic activity in the Caribbean with loans and equity investment worth EUR 1.6 billion (bn). The EIB is the world's largest multilateral financier of climate action with EUR 19 billion of lending for this sector in 2016, including EUR 1.9 bn targeted at developing countries. Notes to editors: The European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, is committed to supporting implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and backing climate related investment around the world. The EIB, active in more than 130 countries, is the world's largest financier of climate related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate related investment in the five years up to 2020. At COP 23 in Bonn, EIB climate experts and senior management will highlight the EIB's broad support for climate investment in diverse sectors, announcing a number of new policy initiatives and project investments.

"The Agadir Statement will be brought to COP23 next November. Its adoption is a major step towards strengthening the joint work of global non-state actors. Its signature in Agadir consecrates the efforts undertaken by the Souss Massa Regional Council during the last 10 years, in order to accompany the Moroccan civil society in its fight against climate change" said Brahim Hafidi, President of the Souss Massa Regional Council, the host of the event. Non-state actors commit through this declaration to intensify the climate action and urge the governmental parties to amplify their ambition to facilitate dialogue. This MoU is expected to be more than intent; it is a roadmap to facilitate dialogue following the Paris Agreement, to be held in 2018. Launch of the Climate Chance Observatory: A tool for assessing the progress of climate action by non-state actors for decision-makers. On September 13, the Climate Chance Observatory for Climate Action of non-state actors was officially launched. This observatory should make possible the measurement of the reality of the actions undertaken by the non-state actors, their success and their challenges. A first report will be released in autumn 2018 before the COP24 to be held in Poland. Many personalities of the climate negotiations have made the trip to Agadir (check the list in annex), thus testifying the willingness to work with non-state actors community in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and in achieving the objectives reaffirmed in 2015 during the COP21 and in line with the Marrakech Partnership. "The success of this Summit is also owed to a strong African and Moroccan presence and mobilization in workshops and meetings" highlighted Ronan Dantec. African local and regional elected representatives have launched a call for the mobilization of African civil society, of which the first step will be made at Africit\'e9s 2018 in Brazzaville. The objective is to bring a concrete answer to the initiative "we are still in" and reaffirm that specific challenges and needs in Africa can only be resolved collectively. Climate Chance: a Summit to consolidate collective climate action With over 100 side-events, the three-days Summit allowed climate actors to discuss progress together, exchange good practices on mitigation and adaptation and develop synergies and convergences on common themes: in particular access to finance, urban planning, migration flows, food security. These are the main topics on which it is urgent to act effectively and concretely between all the actors (local authorities, associations, businesses, trade unions etc.). Brahim Hafidi paid tribute to the Moroccan civil society, strongly mobilized in favor of the climate "Raising awareness about environmental protection, training to the use of renewable and photovoltaic energy, development of the green economy, these are some high-impact actions effectively implemented by the associations we, the Souss Massa Regional Council, do support". The summit was also the occasion for the signature by several local authorities of their intention to subscribe to the initiative Under2 MoU.

In the medieval legend made famous by the brothers Grimm, the German town of Hamelin is besieged by a plague of rats, until the mysterious pied piper appears and agrees, for a fee, to rid them of the infestation. The mayor then reneges on payment and the piper exacts a savage revenge on the town's ingrates by luring away their children, who are never seen again. The tale could also be an allegory for today's grim intergenerational smash-and-grab - the global economy. As environmentalist Paul Hawken put it: "We have an economy where we steal the future, sell it in the present, and call it GDP." Like the hapless mayor of Hamelin, elected officials all over the world are today blindly pursuing growth-as-usual, while the gathering climate catastrophe rumbles ever closer. We adults may, if we're lucky, get to die peacefully in our beds, but it's our children who will be left to pay the ecological piper. As COP23 Despite determined efforts by lobbyists to quash the case, it is now set to be heard in February 2018. "I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society" was the view of US district judge Ann Aiken, in denying motions filed by the Trump administration opposing the suit. Last month NGO Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE) filed a legal challenge against the Irish government over its failure to take steps to honour its climate commitments under the Paris agreement, and so endangering future generations. The FIE suit is modelled on a successful similar action taken in the Dutch courts by the Urgenda Foundation. They ruled in 2015 that the Dutch government had acted unlawfully in failing to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020. Similar cases are being brought in New Zealand, India, the Philippines and South Africa, among others. Despite being on track for climate neutrality by 2030, the Norwegian government is being sued by citizen activists for issuing oil drilling licences in the Arctic Ocean, which make a mockery of its supposed domestic green credentials. Pope Francis, the first pontiff from the global south, weighed in powerfully on the moral arguments against the havoc to the biosphere wrought by neoliberalism: "The thirst for power and possessions knows no limits. In this system, which tends to devour everything which stands in the way of increased profits, whatever is fragile, like the environment, is defenceless before the interests of a deified market." Geophysicist Dr Brad Werner made waves five years ago with the publication of his paper titled: Is Earth Fked? (the asterisks are his). When pressed for an answer to his own question, he ventured: "more or less". In his analysis, the system itself is incapable of internally responding to the deepening ecological crises that encircle civilisation. The only possible hope, he suggested, lay in active resistance. He identified this as "environmental direct action, resistance taken from outside the dominant culture, as in protests, blockades and sabotage by indigenous peoples, workers and other activist groups". Those who resist face arrest, harassment, and worse. Almost four murders a week of environmental and land defenders were recorded in 2016. With politicians failing to step up to the climate challenge, what are the alternatives? One intriguing experiment in direct democracy has just concluded in Ireland, where a government-appointed Citizens' Assembly composed of a nationally representative group of people selected at random heard detailed expert testimony on climate change from a range of experts. No lobbyists or politicians were allowed in the room. The result: 13 recommendations for sharply enhanced climate action were overwhelmingly endorsed early this month, including citizens being personally prepared to pay more tax on high-carbon activities. The recommendations will now be discussed in parliament. Democracy may be dysfunctional, but rumours of its death have, perhaps, been exaggerated. \</doc>

Ministers from governments around the world meeting in Bonn for the final days of the UN climate talks must prove they can pass "the Trump test" by moving on without the US on issues crucial to combating global warming, a leading climate economist has said. "It's about getting on with it," Lord Nicholas Stern told the Guardian. "They have to get on with it. But there are good signs." He said the recent meeting of the International Monetary Fund had proved countries were prepared to pass the test. "[We will have] the absence of the US for a little bit, but the determination at that meeting was striking. There is a determination to get on with things come what may." A former World Bank chief economist, Stern was the author of the landmark review of the economics of climate change in 2006, which showed that tackling greenhouse gas emissions sooner would cost less and yield more economic benefits than waiting for years, or decades, until the results of climate change are clearer. The COP23 Trump has begun the process of US withdrawal from the Paris agreement, which will take several years, but in the meantime the US will continue to participate in the talks. So far, the US has taken little part in discussions, but this could change in the final days. "Trump could be passive and do very little, or could be obstructive. I suspect the former, though not with great confidence," said Stern. "The officials [sent by the US to Bonn] are a long way down the pecking order, which really suggests passive disengagement rather than an aggressive blocking strategy. But there is no predicting what the Trump administration will do." Stern said this was why other major countries bore a greater responsibility for making progress without the White House. He pointed to China and India, which he expected to play a strong role in furthering the Paris agreement. "We should recognise that these countries are moving very quickly [on greenhouse gases]," he said. "My view is that [emissions from] China will peak by 2030. In India, the price of solar power has fallen to three cents a kilowatt hour [on a par with coal]. That is remarkable. The dial is really turning up in India now, which is really important." India has been a reluctant participant in previous talks. Six years ago, when the UN's climate conference was held in Durban, India and China stood alone in holding out against the proposals which led to the Paris agreement. They eventually agreed, and China went on to take a leading role in the run-up to Paris, but India's position has been less clear. The country's prime minister made an angry speech in Paris saying that developed countries should take more responsibility, but the country signed up to the ensuing agreement and since then, according to Stern, there has been much more support within the Indian government. Stern also called for more focus on the ways for poorer countries in particular to adapt to the effects of climate change. He said this should be known as fostering "resilience", rather than adaptation as it used to be known, because resilience requires a broader range of measures and skills and it makes more sense to build and retrofit cities and infrastructure in such a way as to improve their resilience to all potential natural disasters, not just the effects of climate change. He called for resilience to be built into all discussions on international development, in order to help the world's poorest to cope with the social, economic and climate-driven problems that may arise, and in some cases are already taking place. \</doc>

NICOLA Sturgeon used her landmark address at the UN Climate Change conference in Germany to call on the world's developed nations to take urgent actions to "turn the ambitions of Paris into reality". The First Minister was one of the main speakers at the event in Bonn, addressing an audience of heads of state and ministers with her appeal for the Paris climate accord to be implemented. At previous conferences, Scotland has spoken on the fringes but yesterday the First Minister was asked to speak to the main hall on behalf of the world's regions and devolved governments. She told delegates: "We must now urgently agree the specific pledges - and agree the operating manual which will enable us to limit global temperature increases to well below 2C and preferably below 1.5C. "Now, that doesn't simply require impressive targets for the next two decades. It requires urgent action in the next two years as well and it requires all countries, developed countries especially, to contribute fair shares." The Scottish Government has set a target to reduce emissions by 42 per cent by 2020. Sturgeon said she was aiming for an "early decision" to set an even more ambitious target of "net zero emissions" in the years to come. While Scotland, as a devolved nation worked well with the UK on climate change, where her government could go further, Sturgeon promised that it would. "Scotland works closely on climate change with partners around the world, from California to Malawi," she said. "We also work with the UK Government. We welcome the strength of their commitment to the Paris Agreement. "However, Scotland will go further where we can - for example, we have recently set an earlier target than the UK for phasing out new diesel and petrol cars." The SNP leader added that role of the devolved and regional government was especially important given the Trump administration's decision not to ratify the Paris agreement, with the President calling it "unfair". The US is the only signatory to the Paris agreement not to ratify. Sturgeon said: "There is no doubt that devolved, regional and local governments are emerging as a powerful force for good in the fight against climate change. "We recognise the economic and social opportunities of a just tran- sition to create new jobs; to protect our natural environment; and to tackle pollution and save lives. "But, above all else, we understand this - tackling climate change is an overwhelming moral obligation that we owe to this and future generations." Sturgeon added: "The message of cities, regions and devolved governments around the world to UN member states is this - our ambitions must live up to the scale of the challenge, and our actions must live up to our ambitions. "If they do, we will stand with you as proud partners. We will work with you to go further and faster together." Mary Church, from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: "Climate change is a global problem that doesn't respect borders so the world's nations have to come together to decide and agree on how we are going to tackle this existential crisis for humanity. "These are bleak times in many ways, with the rise of the right and the very real impacts of climate change being already felt all around the world." Church added: "Nations and people's movements are looking for leadership. If Scotland can step up and provide some of that, all the better." The chairman of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, Tom Ballantine, said Sturgeon being asked to speak at the conference was proof the world was noticing Scotland's environmental efforts. He said: "Scotland should be proud to be invited to speak at such a high-level event during the COP23 talks. It highlights the important role we are taking in setting the ambitious targets needed to not only tackle climate change but also provide climate justice. "Climate change is happening now and is already seriously affecting the lives of the world's poorest people; those in communities that have done the least to cause the problem. "The fact that the First Minister used her speech to highlight this growing injustice, and call for urgent and early action from those who have caused the climate crisis, is to be welcomed." Ballantine added: "When it comes to climate change, what Scotland does gets noticed right around the world, so it was great to see Scotland's First Minister representing the interests of the planet's states, regions and devolved governments at this year's UN climate conference." \</doc>

Ever since the ancient Greeks speculated a continent must exist in the south polar regions to balance those in the north, Antarctica has been popularly described as remote and extreme. Over the past two centuries, these factors have combined to create, in the human psyche, an almost mythical land - an idea reinforced by tales of heroism and adventure from the Edwardian golden age of 'heroic exploration' and pioneers such as Robert Falcon Scott, Roald Amundsen and Ernest Shackleton. Recent research, however, is casting new light on the importance of the southernmost continent, overturning centuries of misunderstanding and highlighting the role of Antarctica in how our planet works and the role it may play in a future, warmer world. What was once thought to be a largely unchanging mass of snow and ice is anything but. Antarctica holds a staggering amount of water. The three ice sheets that cover the continent contain around 70% of our planet's fresh water, all of which we now know to be vulnerable to warming air and oceans. If all the ice sheets were to melt, Antarctica would raise global sea levels by at least 56m. Where, when, and how quickly they might melt is a major focus of research. No one is suggesting all the ice sheets will melt over the next century but, given their size, even small losses could have global repercussions. Possible scenarios are deeply concerning: in addition to rising sea levels, meltwater would slow down the world's ocean circulation, while shifting wind belts may affect the climate in the southern hemisphere. Recent storm surges following hurricanes have demonstrated that rising sea levels are a future threat for densely populated regions such as Florida and New York. Meanwhile the threat for low-lying islands in areas such as the Pacific is immediate and acute. Multiple factors mean that the vulnerability to global sea level rise is geographically variable and unequal, while there are also regional differences in the extremity of sea level rise itself. At present, the consensus of the IPPC 2013 report suggests a rise of between 40 and 80cm over the next century, with Antarctica only contributing around 5cm of this. Recent projections, however, suggest that Antarctic contributions may be up to ten times higher. Studies also suggest that in a world 1.5-2\'b0C warmer than today we will be locked into millennia of irreversible sea level rise, due to the slow response time of the Antarctic ice sheets to atmospheric and ocean warming. We may already be living in such a world. Recent evidence shows global temperatures are close to 1.5\'b0C warmer than pre-industrial times and, after the COP23 meeting in Bonn in November, it is apparent that keeping temperature rise within 2\'b0C is unlikely. So we now need to reconsider future sea level projections given the potential global impact from Antarctica. Given that 93% of the heat from anthropogenic global warming has gone into the ocean, and these warming ocean waters are now meeting the floating margins of the Antarctic ice sheet, the potential for rapid ice sheet melt in a 2\'b0C world is high. In polar regions, surface temperatures are projected to rise twice as fast as the global average, due to a phenomenon known as polar amplification. However, there is still hope to avoid this sword of Damocles, as studies suggest that a major reduction in greenhouse gases over the next decade would mean that irreversible sea level rise could be avoided. It is therefore crucial to reduce CO levels now for the benefit of future generations, or adapt to a world in which more of our shorelines are significantly redrawn. This is both a scientific and societal issue. We have choices: technological innovations are providing new ways to reduce CO emissions, and offer the reality of a low-carbon future. This may help minimise sea level rise from Antarctica and make mitigation a viable possibility. Given what rising sea levels could mean for human societies across the world, we must maintain our longstanding view of Antarctica as the most remote and isolated continent. \</doc>

Iberdrola Chairman, Ignacio Galan, has reaffirmed the company's commitment to fighting climate change, sustainable development and the environment at a meeting in Madrid with Spain's Minister for Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda, Alvaro Nadal, and the heads of the regional governments of Castile-Leon, Juan Vicente Herrera, and Asturias, Javier Fernandez. In this regard, Galan defended the consistency of Iberdrola's decision of phasing out all of its coal-fired power producing capacity worldwide, an energy source which represents just 1.8% of the group's total installed capacity of 48,062 megawatts (MW), with the strategic decision made by its governing board to fight against climate change. On 10th November, the company filed a permit application with the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Strategy to close the coal-fired power plants in Lada (Asturias) and Velilla (Palencia). With a combined capacity of 874 MW, both assets are located in Spain and in 2016 accounted for less than 1% of the country's total power output. Since 2001, the company has decommissioned nearly 7,500 MW of thermal power capacity across the globe. In 2013 and 2016, Cockenzie and Longannet, two large power plants in the United Kingdom with a combined capacity of 3,600 MW, were closed. Also, between 2001 and 2012 over 3,200 MW of fuel-oil-fired plants were phased out in Spain. Meanwhile, it has commissioned renewables and environmentally friendly assets amounting to 34,000 MW. Closure of the two plants will affect neither security of supply nor energy prices (since their combined production represents less than 1% of Spain's total) nor the company's strong long-term commitment to job stability since 100% of the staff will be relocated. Instead the decision will produce environmental benefits for densely populated urban areas. During the meeting, Ignacio Galan shared some figures to highlight the group's internationally recognised environmental commitment: Iberdrola is a global leader in renewable energies with 28,800 MW installed: EUR 30 billion invested in renewables up to 2016 and another EUR9 billion planned by 2020. World leader in wind energy (16 GW): number 1 in Europe, Spain and UK; number 3 in USA. Driving offshore wind technology: by 2022 it will have installed 1,750 MW in Europe with a project pipeline of over 8 GW for the next decade in Europe and the United States. 4,5 GW pumped hydroelectric capacity in operation and construction. Furthermore, Ignacio Galan reiterated that Iberdrola, together with other leading European Energy companies, recently called upon the European Commission and Parliament to embrace higher and more ambitious binding renewable energy targets for 2030 by raising the share of renewables in the final energy demand on the continent from the current target of 27% to 35%. Iberdrola is one of the world's electric utilities with the lowest CO 2 emissions: Since the year 2000, it has reduced by 75% its emissions in Europe CO2 emissions/MWh ratio is already 67% lower than peer average in Continental Europe. Maintains its commitment to reduce its CO2 emissions intensity by 50% in 2030 and become carbon neutral in 2050. 66% of its installed capacity is emissions free. Also, Ignacio Galan stated that Iberdrola is fully aligned with the environmental targets set by the Paris Agreement, having played an active role at the climate summits in Paris (COP21), Marrakech (COP22) and Bonn ( COP23 ) while at the same time having incorporated to its business strategy and sustainability policy the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as defined by the UN for the 2015-2030 period. The company has become a benchmark in global sustainability indices - DJSI, Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World, Carbon Disclosure Project- and is a global leader in ethical finance after placing EUR6.7 billion in nine green bond issuances and receiving a EUR500 million green loan. Iberdrola pioneered the integration of combatting global warming as a priority into its corporate governance system. In 2009 it approved its Policy against Climate Change undertaking, among other measures, to support an ambitious global emissions reduction target; to promote the development of efficient technologies to bring down greenhouse-gas emissions; to advocate for an integrated and fair global emissions market while fostering the efficient and responsible use of energy involving all company stakeholders. This commitment has been incorporated to the company's by-laws as part of the social dividend as well as to the Mission, Vision and Values of Iberdrola Group.

Text of report in English by South Korean news agency Yonhap on 19 November Seoul: South Korea confirmed its commitment to reduce greenhouse gases at the 23rd session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ), the government said Sunday [19 November]. The latest gathering of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that ended on Friday in Bonn, Germany, was attended by some 25,000 policymakers, researchers, and representatives from businesses and civic groups. Seoul was represented by Minister of Environment Kim Eun-kyung as well as officials from the finance, industry and transportation ministries. At the gathering South Korea proposed five joint proposals as well as its own plan to the UNFCCC secretariat. Officials also highlighted ongoing efforts by the government to move towards eco-friendly energy solutions that are in keeping with the Paris Agreement. South Korea was one of the early entities to endorse the international pact that aims to reduce greenhouse gases across the board. The landmark deal aims to keep the global average temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in order to reduce risks of triggering debilitating climate change. Besides greenhouse gas issues, Kim met with senior officials from China on the sidelines of the COP meeting that kicked off from Nov. 6 to discuss ways to reduce the fine dust that affects both countries.

The European Investment Bank (EIB), Societe Generale and Brittany Ferries are pleased to announce the success of the first green maritime financing under EIB's EUR 750m Green Shipping Guarantee (GSG) programme put in place last year by the EIB and Societe Generale. The new vessel 'Honfleur' will be Brittany Ferries' first Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) powered ferry. It is scheduled to enter into service in April 2019 on its Caen-Ouistreham (France) and Portsmouth (UK) route. The signing ceremony took place yesterday at the Ministry for Europe & Foreign Affairs, at Quai d'Orsay in Paris, and was attended by Jean-Yves Le Drian, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs. In 2016, as part of the investment plan for Europe ('Juncker Plan') and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the EIB and Societe Generale signed a EUR 150m guarantee framework agreement to support shipbuilding, and the modernization of existing vessels for sustainable transport and the protection of the environment, in line with the objectives of COP21. The French shipping company, Brittany Ferries, is today a pioneer in the green maritime transport sector with the signature of the first ship financing supported by the bank of the European Union under the GSG programme whose action is primarily focused on respecting the environment and the fight against the effects of climate change. With the acquisition of its new ship Honfleur, Brittany Ferries confirms its momentum to develop LNG, currently the cleanest fuel source, thus contributing to a significant improvement in the environmental performance of its fleet. Societe Generale acted as the main arranger of the EUR 142.6m financing for the acquisition of the Honfleur ferry commissioned by Brittany Ferries, which includes a tranche of EUR 49.5m fully guaranteed by the EIB. 'This green financing in the maritime sector is a 'first' at the European level,' said EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle. 'This is a particularly innovative financing, successfully carried out thanks to the European guarantee under the Juncker plan, the support of the CEF and Societe Generale's pilot role in this sector. By structuring riskier financing in a new sector, the bank of the European Union strongly reaffirms its commitment to sustainable, responsible and sustainable growth on an international level. Our goal is to support the efforts of French shipowners to develop a more environmentally friendly maritime transport thanks to an adapted and attractive financing tool. The environmental performance of the 'Motorways of the Sea' is at the heart of our climate action in accordance with the commitments made at COP21 and the priorities of the French Government's Major Investment Plan. ' Jean-Marc Roue, Chairman of Brittany Ferries' supervisory board said: 'Brittany Ferries is doubly proud today. It is the very first shipping company to benefit from the framework agreement concluded in 2016 between the EIB and Societe Generale, under the GSG Programme, thanks to the Juncker Plan and the CEF!. But also, thanks to this financing it becomes the first French passenger transport company to pave the way towards energy transition using LNG. Located in four European Union countries, Brittany Ferries is a truly European company and places its ambition to lead by example at the top of its priorities, as the recent COP23 requested of both States and businesses.' Severin Cabannes, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Societe Generale commented: 'The success of this emblematic transaction is the result of a close collaboration between the EIB and Societe Generale, pilot bank in the implementation of this GSG programme, and the long-standing relationship with our client Brittany Ferries. On this occasion, Societe Generale reaffirms its support to its clients for the development of green maritime transport. This transaction, which is part of Societe Generale's 'Sustainable & Positive Impact Finance' offer, also demonstrates our capacity to innovate and our pioneering spirit to develop financing solutions that integrate the environmental challenges of our clients.' The intervention of the EIB, combined with the European guarantee, has made it possible to optimise the structure of the financing by significantly reducing the financial burden borne by Brittany Ferries. Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, said: 'This financing will enable Brittany Ferries to improve the energy efficiency of its vessels and thus reduce their ecological footprint. This low carbon project goes in the direction of history, with the One Planet Summit just getting underway. And more and more clean energy projects will be financed under the European Fund for Strategic Investments 2.0.

In a statement on Wednesday announcing the deal, Fiji said the bond would raise money to support climate change mitigation and adaptation. The latter is crucial for small island states like Fiji, which are already coping with severe effects from climate change, such as Tropical Cyclone Winston, which caused losses amounting to almost a third of Fiji's GDP in 2016. Fiji is expected to use its presidency of COP to push hard for greater ambition in cutting carbon emissions by the high polluting nations, and for more support for vulnerable countries to survive climate change. At the request of Fiji's Reserve Bank, the World Bank and International Finance Corp assisted the government with the deal. It took place under a broader three year capital markets development project supported by the Australian government. The deal will follow the Green Bond Principles, and has been evaluated by Sustainalytics US. Projects to be funded with the proceeds include investments to make Fiji's 300 islands more resilient to climate change, as well as to green its economy. It wants to achieve 100% renewable energy and reduce CO2 emissions in the energy sector by 30% by 2030. In the statement, Frank Bainimarama, Fiji's prime minister, said: "The Fijian people, along with every Pacific Islander, live on the front lines of climate change. The rising seas, changing weather patterns and severe weather events are threatening ourdevelopment, oursecurity and the Fijianway of life, along with the very existence of some of our low-lying neighbours. I have made access to climate finance a key pillar of our upcoming COP 23 Presidency, and we are proud to set an example to other climate-vulnerable nations by issuing this green bond to fund our work to boost climate resilience across Fiji." He added: "By issuing the first emerging country green bond, we are also sending a clear signal to other nations that we can be creative and innovative in mobilising funds and create win-win outcomes for countries and investors in adapting to the serious effects of climate change." The COP 23 The statement said the bond would be priced and settled between November 1 and May next year. It will have two tranches, with maturities of November 1, 2022, and November 1, 2030. The five year tranche will have a 4% coupon, the 13 year 6.3%. "This is the first time the chair of a COP has brought out a green bond to coincide with it," said Kidney. "Last year the Moroccans arranged for a state institution to do one, this time it's full sovereign. Let's hope every COP brings out bonds and they get bigger and bigger." Green bond issuance did not have to be by sovereigns, he said, but it helped to send a message that this was a way to find finance to green the economy. Banks and companies would take their lead from governments. \</doc>

DEERFIELD, Ill.- Mondelez International today announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Forestry Commission of Ghana, Ghana Cocoa Board and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), reinforcing its commitment to reduce emissions in its cocoa supply chain across Ghana. Through Cocoa Life, Mondelez International's signature sustainable cocoa sourcing program, the company will take a leading role in implementing projects to deliver the Ghana Cocoa Forest REDD+ Program (GCFRP) which aims at tackling deforestation and forest degradation. 'Deforestation makes up the largest part of our carbon footprint, which is why it's so important for us to address this issue head on. Through this collaboration, we can be even more efficient in safeguarding the environment and helping cocoa farmers become resilient against climate change,' said Hubert Weber, Executive Vice President and President Europe at Mondelez International. 'This partnership builds on Cocoa Life's ongoing forest protection efforts. It's an exciting new chapter in our work in Ghana and fits with the commitment we made by signing the Cocoa & Forests Initiative Framework for Action at COP23 .' As one of the largest cocoa-producing countries, Ghana supplies about 20 percent of the world's cocoa. According to the GCFRP, Ghana also has one of the highest deforestation rates in Africa at 3.2 percent per annum. This is primarily due to unsustainable expansion of cocoa and other agricultural crops. Mondelez International is contributing $ 5 million over five years to the GCFRP, which aims to significantly reduce the high rate of deforestation and forest degradation, as well as their associated greenhouse carbon emissions, from cocoa farming within Ghana's High Forest Zone. Together with these partners, Mondelez International will execute an action plan in key Hotspot Intervention Areas, focusing on: Mapping all land uses, including cocoa farms Implementing climate smart cocoa practices to increase yields and sustainability Legislative and policy reform to support program execution Coordination and measurement, reporting and verification 'The Ghana government is promoting public-private partnerships, which are critical for sustainable economic growth in all sectors, including the forestry sector. It is, therefore, encouraging that Mondelez International's Cocoa Life program is partnering with government to implement an integrated landscape approach to sustainable cocoa production and forest management,' said John Peter Amewu, Minister for Lands and Natural Resources in Ghana and signatory of the Cocoa & Forests Initiative. 'Cocoa Life is a valuable asset to the realization of the Joint Framework for Action under the Cocoa & Forests Initiative, as it brings on board advanced environmental protection strategies at farmer, community and national levels.' Since 2013, Cocoa Life has worked with the Ghana Cocoa Board and UNDP to promote environmentally sustainable production practices while conserving ecosystems and natural resources in cocoa landscapes across Ghana. Mondelez International is also a founding member of the Cocoa & Forests Initiative, in which 12 leading cocoa and chocolate companies are partnering to reduce deforestation in the cocoa supply chain. About Cocoa Life Cocoa Life aims to create empowered and thriving cocoa farming communities, reaching more than 200,000 farmers across six countries and benefiting more than a million people by 2022. Mondelez International's ultimate goal is to sustainably source all the company's cocoa supply, mainly via Cocoa Life. By working in partnership with farmers, NGOs, suppliers and government institutions, Cocoa Life is part of Mondelez International's Impact for Growth - a commitment to driving business growth with positive change in the world.

November 8, 2017 HYPERLINK https://www.gov.uk https://www.gov.uk - Four new research hubs will develop robotic technology to improve safety in off-shore wind and nuclear energy - \£368 million from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for artificial intelligence and robotics research announced - Government also commits to \£316 million worth of funding for smart energy systems innovation More than \£368 million of investment from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for robotics and artificial intelligence projects aimed at improving safety in extreme environments has been announced by the government. This investment will develop robots and artificial intelligence able to take on jobs in the freezing depths of the North Sea, dealing with extreme environments in the process of nuclear energy production, the hostile vacuum of space, and heat of deep mining. In her keynote speech to the Innovate UK Conference in Birmingham today (8th November), Climate Change and Industry Minister Claire Perry set out how British experts and innovators are leading the world in this new sector, receiving support from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. The government is working with business and academia in order to encourage investment in robotics and artificial intelligence - a priority area of the Industrial Strategy. Almost \£345 million will be used to set up four new research hubs based at the University of Manchester, University of Birmingham, University of Surrey and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The centres of excellence, managed by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), will be responsible for developing robotic technology to enable safer working environments in space and deep mining and the hazardous and harsh environments of nuclear energy and off-shore wind. As well as receiving government investment, the four hubs will be supported by \£352 million of industry support from commercial and international partners, and UK Space Agency is co-funding the University of Surrey hub. Minister for Climate Change and Industry Claire Perry said: Britain leads the world in innovation and technology and through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, we are making \£368 million available to projects in robotics and artificial intelligence with applications in clean renewable energy generation to ensure the UK is the place new technology is nurtured. Next week, I will be at the COP23 conference in Germany, and it will be abundantly clear there that, if we want to truly make a difference to our climate as well as take advantage of the economic opportunities of our transition to a low carbon economy, it will come down to continued innovation. The investment announced by the Climate Change and Industry Minister today also includes: - \£34.3 million for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to fund five research projects at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), and the Universities of Exeter and Southampton, to develop sensors capable of working in the ocean's extreme conditions - \£316.5 million for a collaborative research and development competition, run by Innovate UK, with winners set to include more than 70 businesses, 13 universities and 10 research organisations - funding of \£33 million for 17 studies which focus on demonstrating how artificial intelligence can operate in extreme environments, following a separate competition run by Innovate UK Professor Philip Nelson, Chief Executive of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, said: These new Robotics Hubs will draw on the country's research talent to nurture new developments in the field of robotics and provide the foundations on which innovative technologies can be built. The resulting outcomes from this research will allow us to explore environments that are too dangerous for humans to enter without risking injury or ill-health. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is helping us achieve a joined up approach to research, discovery and innovation. Ruth McKernan, Chief Executive of Innovate UK, said: These pioneering projects driven by the very best minds in UK research and industry exemplify the huge potential of what can be achieved through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund and the long-term benefits for the UK economy. These are just the first competitions in robotics and AI, there will be further opportunities for businesses in the coming months. Professor Duncan Wingham, Chief Executive of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: These sensors will help us to better understand our oceans, helping us to manage them sustainably for the future. The projects will develop ambitious new technologies that work in hazardous and extreme environments, maintaining the UK's world-class status in marine robotics. Other industries, such as the water, aquaculture and industrial waste, are also likely to benefit from these technologies. Today's announcements follow the publication of the industry-led Made Smarter review, which predicted Britain's manufacturing sector could unlock more than \£3450 billion over the next decade and create thousands of jobs if it successfully embraced digitisation, robotics and artificial intelligence. Alongside the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, BEIS has also been working with Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Dr. Jerome Pesenti to establish how to grow the UK can grow and support its burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. In April, the government announced \£31 billion of investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for cutting-edge technologies to create jobs and raise living standards. Other areas receiving government support include cutting edge healthcare and medicine, battery storage and satellite and space technology. Ahead of attending climate change talks at COP23 in Germany next week, the Minister also announced \£316 million for research into two new smart energy innovation competitions, which build on Government's ambition to fund over \£32.5 billion in clean technology innovation, as set out in last month's Clean Growth Strategy. These will focus on creating technologies which will reduce demand on the electricity grid at peak periods and to increase demand at times when low-carbon generation is at its peak, saving money and cutting emissions. These new competitions will also be used to explore ways that smart energy systems can help to reduce energy use by schools, and small hospitality businesses. This comes following the government publishing its Smart Systems and Flexibility Plan in July this year, which set out a range of measures to reduce the regulatory burdens of making our energy system more smart. The minister also announced the winners of the first phases of two energy innovation competitions looking into the feasibility of energy storage and non-domestic demand side response, with \£3400,000 awarded to nine companies across the UK.Notes to editors: Summaries of the EPSRC hubs: National Centre for Nuclear Robotics Led by: Professor Rustam Stolkin, University of Birmingham ISCF funding: \£311.3 million Project partners: Universities of Bristol, Edinburgh, Essex, Lincoln, West of England, Lancaster University, Queen Mary University of London. The National Centre for Nuclear Robotics will aim to develop advanced robotics and AI technologies for nuclear industry applications. These are required to help deal with nuclear waste, and alleviate the need to send humans into hazardous environments. These advances are also needed to maintain and monitor the UK's existing nuclear power stations, and facilitate the safe building and operation of new-build nuclear power-plants.

Scientists say warming of the planet by 2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F) will trigger a 'tipping point' Passing the 'tipping point' could cause freak weather events and species loss   New predictions were based on world population and 'carbon intensity' data Limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C is the global target set by the 2016 Paris Agreement A study using powerful new statistical tools found there is only a five per cent chance that Earth will warm by 2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F) or less by the end of this century. The new predictions also reveal that there is only a one per cent chance that warming will be limited to 1.5\'b0C (2.7\'b0F), which is the target set by the 2016 Paris Agreement. NEW PREDICTIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE\~   Five per cent chance that Earth's warming will be limited to\~2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F) One per cent chance that warming will be limited to 1.5\'b0C\~(2.7\'b0F) 90 per cent chance that temperatures will rise by 2.0 to 4.9\'b0C (3.6 to 8.8\'b0F) Global temperatures will rise by a median value of 3.2\'b0C (5.8\'b0F) 'Our analysis shows that the goal of two degrees is very much a best-case scenario,' said lead researcher Adrian Raftery, a professor of statistics and sociology at the University of Washington. 'It is achievable, but only with major, sustained effort on all fronts over the next 80 years.' The new projections found there is a 90 per cent chance that temperatures will increase this century by 2.0 to 4.9\'b0C (3.6 to 8.8\'b0F). 'Our analysis is compatible with previous estimates, but it finds that the most optimistic projections are unlikely to happen,' Professor Raftery said. 'We're closer to the margin than we think.' Researchers decided to come up with a new method for calculating future climate change after noticing flaws in the modelling used by the\~Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 'The big problem with scenarios is that you don't know how likely they are, and whether they span the full range of possibilities or are just a few examples. 'Scientifically, this type of storytelling approach was not fully satisfying.' The new research focused instead on three quantities that underpin the scenarios for future emissions. These included total world population, gross domestic product (GDP) per person and the amount of carbon emitted for each dollar of economic activity, known as 'carbon intensity'. 'Countries argued for the 1.5\'b0C target because of the severe impacts on their livelihoods that would result from exceeding that threshold,'\~said co-researcher Dargan Frierson, an associate professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington. WHAT IS THE PARIS AGREEMENT? The Paris Agreement is the first large-scale global agreement to combat climate change, coming together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. China and the United States committed to backing the deal in September 2016, with their greenhouse gas output accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world's emissions. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par But on June 1, Trump announced that the US will pull out of the Paris agreement, saying he wanted to negotiate a 'better deal' for American citizens. To go into legal force, countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions had to sign on. The deal asks that the countries signing on reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Right now 147 countries have ratified the agreement to the 197 who attended the convention. The aim is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius 2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F) this century. Part of the reason the Paris Agreement was successful was that ratifying countries can decide independently how to reduce their emissions rather than being told how much to cut by. Counties, instead, put forward their best efforts through 'nationally determined contributions.' The binding part of the agreement makes countries report on their progress decreasing emissions, while the actual setting of emission-reduction targets is non-binding.\~ 'Indeed, damages from heat extremes, drought, extreme weather and sea level rise will be much more severe if 2\'b0C or higher temperature rise is allowed. 'Our results show that an abrupt change of course is needed to achieve these goals.' Professor Raftery previously worked on United Nations projections for future world population. His 2014 study used Bayesian statistics, a common tool used in modern statistics, to show that world population is unlikely to stabilise this century. The planet likely will reach 11 billion people by 2100. In the new study, Professor Raftery expected to find that higher populations would increase the projections for global warming. Instead, he was surprised to learn that population has a fairly small impact. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE EXCEED 2\'b0C?\~ A study using new statistical tools found there is only a five per cent chance that Earth will warm by 2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F) or less by the end of this century. Experts have previously decided that any warming above 2\'b0C (3.6\'b0F) would be 'unacceptably high' and could have disastrous consequences for the planet. A previous report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published in 2014 found that if undeterred, global warming will cause storm surges, flooding and heatwaves across much of the world. The report said that violent conflicts, food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years. It argued that rising temperatures will exacerbate poverty and damage land and marine species.\~ It highlighted that in recent decades, Earth has seen changes in water resources as a result of melting glaciers and differences in rainfall, and reductions in wheat and maize yields. Species including fish stocks are shifting their ranges, coral reefs are being damaged and wildfires are becoming more frequent. Food security will be hit by reduced yields in the major crops of wheat, rice and maize, while climate change will also exacerbate existing health problems, and lead to more heat wave-related deaths, malnutrition and disease. Increasing numbers of people are set to be displaced by extreme weather events, and the impacts of rising temperatures could help increase the risk of violent conflicts by worsening problems such as poverty, the report said. Recent extremes such as heat waves, droughts, floods and wildfires show how vulnerable humans are to variations in climate, the study warned. And the greater the rise in temperatures, the more likely the world is to see severe and widespread impacts, or even reach 'tipping points' which trigger abrupt and irreversible changes to the planet. That is because most of the population increase will be in Africa, which uses few fossil fuels. What matters more for future warming is the carbon intensity, the amount of carbon emissions produced for each dollar of economic activity. That value has dropped in recent decades as countries boost efficiency and enact standards to reduce carbon emissions. How quickly that value drops in future decades will be crucial for determining future warming. The study finds a wide range of possible values of carbon intensity over future decades, depending on technological progress and countries' commitments to implementing changes. 'The bad news is they are unlikely to be enough to achieve the target of keeping warming at or below 1.5 degrees.' The research was published in Nature Climate Change.\~ \</doc>

From Gdansk to Katowice, over 1,000 kilometres of Polish railways will be modernized and upgraded with the help of a EUR 650m loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) announced today. EIB funds will help finance 15 different segments of railway infrastructure across the country, improving train speeds and passenger comfort, and saving nearly 50,000 tonnes of CO2 per year by shifting traffic from road to rail. The segments are part of the Polish Master Plan for Railway Transport to 2030. The works will be implemented by the state owned Polish rail infrastructure manager PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe over the period 2016-2023 and will be mostly located on the Trans-European Transport Network ('TEN-T'), including the core Baltic-Adriatic Corridor. They include the modernisation of the railway accesses to the major Polish ports like Gdansk, Gdynia, Swinoujscie and Szczecin, and works on the 'Centralna Magistrala Kolejowa' ('CMK'), the only high speed line in Poland, between Warsaw and Katowice. Other project components are spread throughout the Polish territory, notably in the industrial areas in the south east, and are expected to support economic growth coherently with the EU's and Poland's wider convergence and cohesion objectives. 'The improvements on Polish railways over the past decade have been enormous. I'm glad that the EIB has been able to spearhead change by providing long-term affordable finance for the network including the current loan,' said EIB Vice President Vazil Hudak, overseeing the bank's operations in Poland. 'This latest transaction is particularly important in the light of Poland's growing international role in climate action efforts and its presidency of COP24 in Katowice next year'. The EIB has financed Polish railways with investments worth 2.8bn over the past 13 years. This latest loan represents a variant of the railway financing model used so far, as it does not simply follow the usual pattern of co-financing of EU grants, but it also includes a number of smaller projects which do not otherwise benefit from the EU support. 'Modernization of the railway infrastructure is an example of exemplary cooperation between the Polish Government and the EIB in the area of supporting projects in our country. Thanks to this contract and the very favourable financial conditions, I am confident that the implementation of the project will contribute relevantly to the sustainable development of infrastructure in Poland, which is very important to the economy and life quality of Poles', said Deputy Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. 'Funds provided by the EIB will enable the improvement of travel comfort on long distance routes and in regions and agglomerations. Railway will become more competitive mean of transport. Transport of goods will be facilitated, among others on the connections to ports. Modernization of important routes on the Trans-European Transport Network ('TEN-T'), including the core Baltic-Adriatic Corridor will positively influence the development of international trade exchange' said Mr. Ireneusz Merchel, President of PKP Polskie Linie Kolejowe SA. Notes for editors: On November 9th, 2017, the EIB has signed with the Polish Ministry of Finance an agreement for a EUR 650m loan aimed at financing 15 schemes of railway infrastructure upgrading, modernisation and selective renewal covering an overall length of around 1,150 km. The schemes are part of the Polish Master Plan for Railway Transport to 2030 approved by the Polish government. The project will help achieve climate action goals thanks to the modal shift of freight and passenger traffic from road to rail. The schemes will allow for greenhouse gas emissions savings estimated by EIB at 47,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in an average year of operation over a 30-year assessment period. About the European Investment Bank (EIB): The European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, is committed to supporting implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and backing climate-related investment around the world. The EIB, active in more than 130 countries, is the world's largest financier of climate-related investment and largest single issuer of green bonds. A quarter of all EIB financing supports climate action and the EIB is committed to providing USD 100 billion for climate related investment in the five years up to 2020. At COP23 in Bonn, EIB climate experts and senior management will highlight the EIB's broad support for climate investment in diverse sectors, announcing a number of new policy initiatives and project investments.

Bonn, Germany - As global leaders gathered at COP 23 in Bonn, 18 key leaders in their industry verticals, united in the Hydrogen Council coalition, came together to launch first ever globally quantified vision of the role of hydrogen, developed with support from McKinsey. In addition to being a key pillar in of the energy transition, the study shows that hydrogen has the potential to develop US $ 2.5tn of business, creating more than 30 million jobs by 2050. Taking the Hydrogen Council's vision for hydrogen to the next level, the study entitled Hydrogen, Scaling up outlines a comprehensive and quantified roadmap to scale deployment and its enabling impact on the energy transition. Deployed at scale, hydrogen could account for almost one-fifth of total final energy consumed by 2050. This would reduce annual CO2 emissions by roughly 6 gigatons compared to today's levels, and contribute roughly 20% of the abatement required to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius. On the demand side, the Hydrogen Council sees the potential for hydrogen to power about 10 to 15 million cars and 500,000 trucks by 2030, with many uses in other sectors as well, such as industry processes and feedstocks, building heating and power, power generation and storage. Overall, the study predicts that the annual demand for hydrogen could increase tenfold by 2050 to almost 80 EJ in 2050 meeting 18% of total final energy demand in the 2050 two-degree scenario. At a time when global populations are expected to grow by two billion people by 2050, hydrogen technologies have the potential to create opportunities for sustainable economic growth. 'The world in the 21st century must transition to widespread low carbon energy use,' said Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation and co-chair of the Hydrogen Council. 'Hydrogen is an indispensable resource to achieve this transition because it can be used to store and transport wind, solar and other renewable electricity to power transportation and many other things. The Hydrogen Council has identified seven roles for hydrogen, which is why we are encouraging governments and investors to give it a prominent role in their energy plans. The sooner we get the hydrogen economy going, the better, and we are all committed to making this a reality.' Achieving such scale would require substantial investments; approximately US$ 20 to 25 billion annually for a total of about US$ 280 billion until 2030. Within the right regulatory framework - including long-term, stable coordination and incentive policies - the report considers that attracting these investments to scale the technology is feasible. The world already invests more than US$ 1.7 trillion in energy each year, including US$ 650 billion in oil and gas, US$ 300 billion in renewable electricity, and more than US$ 300 billion in the automotive industry. 'This study confirms the place of hydrogen as a central pillar in the energy transition, and encourages us in our support of its large-scale deployment. Hydrogen will be an unavoidable enabler for the energy transition in certain sectors and geographies. The sooner we make this happen the sooner we will be able to enjoy the needed benefits of Hydrogen at the service of our economies and our societies,' said Benoit Potier, Chairman and CEO, Air Liquide. 'Solutions are technologically mature and industry players are committed. We need concerted stakeholder efforts to make this happen; leading this effort is the role of the Hydrogen Council.' The launch of the new roadmap came during the Sustainability Innovation Forum in the presence of 18 senior members of the Hydrogen led by co-chairs Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of Toyota and Benoit Potier, Chairman and CEO, Air Liquide and accompanied by Prof. Aldo Belloni, CEO of The Linde Group, Woong-chul Yang, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Company and Anne Stevens, Board Member of Anglo American. During the launch, the Hydrogen Council called upon investors, policymakers, and businesses to join them in accelerating deployment of hydrogen solutions for the energy transition. It was also announced that Woong-chul Yang of Hyundai Motor Company will succeed Takeshi Uchiyamada of Toyota in the rotating role of the Council's co-chair and preside the group together with Benoit Potier, CEO Air Liquide, in 2018. Mr Uchiyamada is planning to return as Co-chairman in 2020, coinciding with the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, an important milestone for showcasing hydrogen society and mobility. Kawasaki is working to develop and commercialize infrastructure technologies needed to build a hydrogen energy supply chain, ranging from production to transportation, storage, and utilization. We have started Wind Power to Gas demonstration project in Hokkaido this year1, and will start world first demonstration of heat and power supply by hydrogen gas turbine co-generation system in the city area of Kobe in 20182. Also a pilot demonstration will be launched in 2020, to validate long distance carriage of liquefied hydrogen in the bulk of ship between Japan and Australia3. For this demonstration, we have accomplished basic design and, now, are in the construction phase including detail design. Kawasaki will continue our effort to introduce a large volume of hydrogen into the society in a manner that is safe, stable and affordable to handle and to realize hydrogen society. About the Hydrogen Council: Launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos in early 2017, the Hydrogen Council is a first-of-itskind global CEO initiative to foster the role of hydrogen technologies in the global energy transition. Current members include 18 leading multinationals - Air Liquide, Alstom, Anglo American, Audi, BMW GROUP, Daimler, ENGIE, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai Motor, Iwatani, Kawasaki, Plastic Omnium, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil, The Linde Group, Total, and Toyota - as well as 10 dynamic players from across the value chain - Ballard, Faber Industries, Faurecia, First Element Fuel (True Zero), Gore, Hydrogenics, Mitsubishi, Mitsui & Co, Plug Power, and Toyota Tsusho. The coalition collectively represents total revenues of over EUR 1.5 trillion and more than 2 million jobs around the world.5 To find out more: HYPERLINK http://www.hydrogencouncil.com www.hydrogencouncil.com About Hydrogen Council meetings at COP 23 : The Council will gather at COP 23 to conclude the first year of its activity. While in Bonn on 13-14 November 2017, CEOs and other senior representatives will participate in a range of high-level roundtables, interactions with policy-makers as well as the media and the broader stakeholder community. The Hydrogen Council is led by two Co-Chairs from different geographies and sectors, elected by Steering Members for a two-year term, each year one of the two Co-chair mandates is renewed for continuity.

The European Investment Bank (EIB), says its president, Dr Werner Hoyer, has been the driving force for the commitment among multilateral development banks (MDBs) across the world to redouble their efforts to ensure that the targets on climate change set out in COP21 are met. The legally-binding agreement signed by 195 countries in Paris in December 2015 established the long-term goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature to well below 20C above pre-industrial levels. The EIB's claim to leadership among MDBs in the fight against the long-term damage created by climate change may sound bold. But it is borne out by the bank's track record in environmental stewardship. As the largest multilateral provider of climate finance worldwide, EIB has made a commitment to channel at least 25% of its investments into projects which have a significant positive impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and counter the impact of climate change. Outside the EU, it has established a supplementary target of allocating 35% of its lending to climate action projects by 2020. Jonathan Taylor, vice-president at the EIB, says that against the backdrop of a balance sheet of b,,560bn, these targets equate to some very large numbers. Last year, the bank's climate lending reached b,,19.5bn, and in the five years to 2020 this total will comfortably exceed b,,100bn. "In terms of sheer volume, we have done more to address the problem of climate change than any other lender, and we have done so over a sustained period of time," says Christopher Knowles, head of infrastructure funds and climate action. Taylor emphasises that the 25% lending target refers to projects with a "significant" climate impact, and that climate change aspects of our environmental standards are now firmly embedded across the bank's entire financing programme, known as climate mainstreaming. "In other words, climate in everything we do," says the EIB's chief climate change expert, Nancy Saich. Saich says that the EIB has already played a key leadership role among MDBs in the promotion of mainstreaming. In Paris in 2015, it provided leadership on the establishment by several MDBs and the members of the IDFC of the first "Mainstreaming Climate Principles". Saich says that work on these common principles, standards and definitions will intensify with the relaunch at COP23 in Bonn later this year. Managing climate risk Another element of mainstreaming, says Saich, is the broader management of climate risk. "We need to do this because things are changing very fast, not just in terms of extreme weather and the effects of global warming, but also in low-carbon technologies, for example in industries such as vehicle manufacturing," she says. "We need to look both at all our new investments and our existing portfolio, and find ways to assess the physical risk of underlying assets for us and our clients, and also to identify and measure potential stranded assets." Establishing benchmarks In mainstreaming, as in other areas of the global climate mitigation market, a clear pattern is emerging of the EIB establishing benchmarks and standards that others are following. Take the leadership role it has played in the global green capital market, which it kickstarted in 2007 by launching its first Climate Awareness Bond (CAB). Since then, the EIB has established itself as the largest source of supply in this fast-growing market, issuing some b,,20bn of green bonds in the last decade, the proceeds of which have supported over 150 projects in close to 50 countries. The EIB has also acted as a pioneer in the market by issuing in 11 different currencies to date and, most recently, by establishing a new benchmark at the long end of the curve with an b,,1bn 2047 issue in June. As with the EIB's lending, its leadership in the green bond market extends well beyond its direct market activity. Aldo Romani, deputy head of funding euro, says that one added value of green bond issuance is the common language it creates among all market participants. Comparability serves both market efficiency and accountability vis-C -vis public policies. Although issuance volumes have mushroomed in recent years, green bonds still account for a tiny proportion of the global market and the growth of their share will be helped by more comparable taxonomies and standards facilitating the encounter of supply and demand. Already, the EIB has taken important strides towards enhancing co-ordination and comparability within the market, catalysing universal support for the Green Bond Principles (GBP) and coordinating the dialogue among MDBs before COP21 on impact reporting harmonisation. The recent interim report of the European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance has recommended that the EC invites EIB to co-ordinate the development of an EU classification of climate change finance. Romani adds that the EIB also aims to build a "Rosetta Stone" of existing climate mitigation definitions. "By creating a translation device allowing people to establish equivalence between different lexicons and classifications, you remove a significant source of complexity. This allows you to use one of the existing classifications as a universally-accepted unit of account for the transparent comparison of eligibility criteria in each sector," he explains. Risk-sharing Risk-sharing and the promotion of increased private sector activity across the wider market for green investment is fundamental to EIB's strategy in the sphere of climate change. "The investment gaps are so large that government budgets and MDBs can't close them on their own," says Knowles. This is why a cornerstone of the EIB's strategy in the green market is the absorption of the junior risk in a number of funding structures and guarantee mechanisms. This support has underpinned the development of a number of funds in higher risk areas of the global green market, which would have been unlikely to generate sufficient investor support without a commitment from the EIB. "When we invest in climate action projects, we ask a lot of questions, which initially may not make us the most popular co-investor," says Knowles. "But it means that when investors choose to partner with us, they know that projects have been exposed to very thorough due diligence." This has created a powerful multiplier effect. Knowles says that the EIB has a portfolio of about b,,2bn in over 50 infrastructure funds, but that this represents no more than about 10% of these funds' total capital. The remaining 90% comes from more than 500 private sector investors drawing comfort from the imprimatur of the EIB's due diligence. An early example of this process was the Green for Growth Fund (GGF), a public-private partnership launched in 2009 and supported by the EIB and KfW, which focused initially on the promotion of energy efficiency in the western Balkans and has recently expanded to North Africa. Today, private investors hold about 20% of this b,,410m fund, which helps reduce energy use by 1.3MWh, saving 329,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. More recently, the EIB has built on its success in risk-sharing in investment funds by diversifying into some less well-covered areas of the global environmental protection market. One example is the EcoEnterprises Fund, in which EIB is a co-investor, which provides mezzanine financing and equity to support companies benefiting biodiversity through the sustainable use of natural resources, principally in Latin America. Public sector partners Acting as a driving force in the market for climate action investment has also involved searching for partners elsewhere in the public sector which are equally committed to ensuring that the world meets the targets prescribed by the Paris Agreement, and prepared to support the de-risking of the EIB's support for climate mitigation as co-investors. This was the genesis of GEEREF, a fund of funds initiative initiated by the European Commission in 2006 with funding from the EU, Germany and Norway. By the end of 2016, GEEREF had invested in 12 private equity funds across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, backing renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. A more recent initiative has been the establishment of the Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform, under which the Luxembourg government is committed to making b,,30m of funding available to investment vehicles based in the Grand Duchy financing high impact climate projects both within the EU and globally. To put this total into perspective, it amounts to a quarter of Luxembourg's commitment under the Paris Agreement. "We will use this platform to seed smaller, high risk funds, and hopefully we'll announce the first deals during COP23 in Bonn in November," says Knowles. Aside from continuing to engage with potential partners from the private and public sector to mobilise increased investment for green investment, EIB recognises that the need to extend beyond climate change mitigation, which refers to the reduction or prevention of greenhouse gas emissions. Given that emissions are unavoidable, equally important is climate adaptation. This refers to the anticipation of the adverse effects of climate change and taking proactive measures to prevent or minimise the damage caused by factors such as worsening droughts, more extreme weather events or rising sea levels. Taylor explains that climate adaptation has captured less attention among investors than climate mitigation, in part because impact assessment is much harder to measure. It is easy enough to quantify the emissions prevented by the construction of a renewable energy plant; it is much less straightforward to put hard numbers on the economic benefits of a project aimed at mangrove conservation to protect coastal areas. Nevertheless, forest conservation is another area that the EIB has pioneered, co-investing, for example, in Althelia Ecosphere, an innovative fund which has been developing multiple revenue streams from forest protection and sustainable land use in countries ranging from Kenya to Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. According to Knowles, the bank is monitoring similar climate adaptation opportunities in areas such as the marine sector, where artisanal fisheries are under threat from mismanagement and overfishing. \</doc>

Last week, the leaders of 53 independent member countries of the Commonwealth met in London to address key global challenges and work together for a more prosperous, secure, sustainable and fair future of its 2.4 billion citizens. London is the financial centre for the Commonwealth , and London's role will be even more significant in the years ahead as we strengthen these historical relationships. And London Stock Exchange Group, as throughout its 300 year history, remains committed to its core purpose - providing access to sources of equity and debt finance for companies of all sizes from all over the world. It was a fantastic week at London Stock Exchange, celebrating the Commonwealth as part of CHOGM (Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting), welcoming leaders from around the world. We celebrated partnerships with some of the smallest members of the Commonwealth through to the largest ones. Commonwealth shared values should help progress the causes of the future, supporting young people and tackling challenges such as climate changes and building democratic norms. On Monday, we hosted a partnership agreement between the UK and the International Solar Alliance (ISA), a UN sponsored body to support renewable energy targets across the world. They estimate a need of financing over $1000 bn by 2030 and India, in particular, is taking the lead, financing several billion through green bonds in London in recent years. On Tuesday, we greeted His Excellency Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta, President of Kenya and h is delegation, together with The Rt Honourable Penny Mordaunt MP, to open trading on Tuesday. Kenya listed its most recent sovereign bond on London Stock Exchange, which was seven times oversubscribed. The morning was a celebration of the close relationship between Kenya and the UK, with ELITE, London Stock Exchange Group's capital raising programme for high growth firms, the Nairobi Securities Exchange, and Financial Sector Development, Africa, signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), to support Kenyan SMEs at an early stage, in governance, transparency and operational best practices. The partnership was praised by International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt, as "a way to defeat poverty, boost trade and investment, and deliver on the ambitions of countries that want to stand on their own two feet." And with the Kenyan Ministry of Energy & Petroleum, we recently signed an MoU to support capital raising for state-owned companies. On the same day, with the support from the British Government, and in partnership with PwC, we launched the report, Companies to Inspire Africa, One year later', which features 100 African companies that raised capital or announced a significant corporate development in the last year. The week continued, as we crossed the Indian Ocean, with Fiji's first international sovereign green bond, which started traded on London Stock Exchange's International Securities Market on Wednesday. We were pleased to welcome The Hon Prime Minister of Fiji and President of COP23 , the international climate change conference, Frank Bainimarama, and the UK Minister for Energy and Clean Growth, Claire Perry, to open the market. The issuer represents the first from an emerging economy. The significance of this listing can not be overstated and highlights how Fiji is leading the way in providing innovative solutions to overcome the problems inflicted on island states by climate change. From the blue waters of Fiji to the colourful skies of Nigeria on Thursday, when we welcomed Nigeria's Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment, the Honourable Okechukwu Enelamah, and Minister of State for Trade Policy, The Right Honourable Greg Hands MP to open trading. With nine Nigerian companies listed on our markets with a market cap of $6.5 bn, London Stock Exchange is proud of the relationships with companies active in Nigeria, stretching back many years. We recently supported Nigeria's $2.5 bn Eurobond programme issued in February this year, for infrastructure investment, followed by the landmark Diaspora Bond issued in June 2017, raising $300m. In partnership with the Nigerian Stock Exchange, these bonds are also listed in Nigeria, as part of the two exchange's commitment to dual listings. We look forward to forging new trade and investment ties at the heart of the Nigeria-UK relationship. London channels investment across the Commonwealth into large and small companies; supports governments in harnessing international investment for infrastructure and green growth, and provides technology to exchanges across Africa, India and beyond. International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt, highlighted the pivotal role that financial markets play in supporting prosperity and growth across the Commonwealth, "opening the door to a future free from aid dependency by building partnerships, sharing knowledge and opening up markets across the Commonwealth". The UK capital continues to flourish as an international financial centre, open for business. A globally trusted regulatory and legal framework, the most internationally diverse, deep and liquid pool of capital, and a proven ability to constantly be at the forefront of financial innovation, make London and the UK ,the ideal home for companies and investors worldwide. \</doc>

RoseannaCunningham - image credit: David Anderson Roseanna Cunningham looks troubled. Gesticulating around the table as she speaks, the Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform is running through a long list of looming uncertainties for her portfolio. Scrolling down her tablet, she reels through the areas causing her concern. "Air quality, biodiversity, chemicals, flood risk management, marine environment, natural environment, biodiversity, pesticides, waste packaging and product regulations, waste producer responsibility regulations, water quality, water resources, land use," she says, before pausing for breath. There is, of course, plenty within her portfolio for her to worry about. With a brief covering everything from conservation to land reform, Cunningham is responsible for marine planning, air quality, flooding and crown estates as well as being tasked with reducing Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions, without holding direct power over key sectors such as energy, transport or agriculture. Meanwhile, a climate change sceptic sits in the White House at a critical moment in global efforts to tackle climate change. Cunningham spent last week in Bonn, representing the Scottish Government at the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and before that, she was meeting with members of the 'Green 10' - ten of the largest European environmental organisations and networks. Given the current state of the world, it's fair to surmise that both meetings will have been slightly tense ones. But it's Brexit and its effect on her list of policy areas which is preoccupying the cabinet secretary. Last year, in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, Cunningham used an appearance at the Scottish Parliament's Environment Committee to warn that the impact of the decision on areas of environmental policy represented a "big unknown". \</doc>

May 18, 2017 Climate Change Minister Paula Bennett and Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee have today announced that New Zealand will provide $ 1.3 million to support Fiji's presidency of the United Nations Climate Change Conference later this year. "At last year's conference in Marrakech, Fiji was selected to take up the role of president of this significant event," Mrs Bennett says. "This is a major undertaking for any country and these important talks will bring together climate experts officials and leaders from around the world. "In addition to our financial support, New Zealand climate change ambassador Jo Tyndall will be available as an on-call adviser." Mr Brownlee says the conference will be important for maintaining momentum in negotiating the rules which will bring the Paris Agreement on climate change into effect. "This is also the first time a Pacific Island nation has taken leadership of this conference. "Given the significant impact of climate change on the Pacific, we are committed to supporting Fiji's presidency and helping them to ensure the talks are successful," Mr Brownlee says. The conference begins on 6 November 2017 in Bonn, Germany. \</doc>

How investors can profit and reduce risks from climate risk, US renewables, the microfinance sector and the growth of ESG regulation. With Germany's attempts to keep climate change on the political agenda for the G20 (Group of 20), a new report from Deutsche Asset Management (Deutsche AM) examines the value of investing in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The second Sustainable Finance report is particularly timely in the bank's home market of Germany, as the country is currently President of the G20 and as the city of Bonn prepares to host the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP 23 ) at the UN Convention on Climate Change in November. Michael Lewis. Head of ESG Thematic Research, Deutsche AM, said: 'ESG investing is gathering momentum. Our report shows how it has moved on from risk management and downside protection towards more positive motivations for ESG investing.' The Sustainable Finance report features five main articles, examining key trends including: The growth of ESG assets and how the regulatory environment is affecting ESG investing. Measures to address climate risk - examining physical and regulatory risks arising from climate change and how the low carbon transition is a major investment opportunity. US renewable energy sector - highly relevant for investors' search for yield. Sustainable real estate - one of the asset classes with the strongest reasons for, and benefits from, incorporating sustainability. Microfinance sector and investment diversification. Deutsche AM celebrates 20 years of supporting microfinance investment vehicles. Deutsche AM has long recognised the importance of ESG within its investment approach and was among the early signatories to the UN supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in 2008. At the end of 2016, Deutsche AM had 9.9 billion euros of ESG assets under management.

Dominique Duval, who had already been running Agricole's Asia Pacific sustainable banking business from Paris, moved to Hong Kong in November. Agricole's sustainable banking team, headed by Tanguy Claquin, has also recently added Hugues Delafon, a managing director and former head of corporate debt capital markets. It now has eight members in Paris, plus Duval. "This demonstrates our leadership in Asia Pacific and confirms that we want to be committed to the region," said Duval. She said Cr\'e9dit Agricole was top of the league table for bookrunning green bonds in Asia Pacific. Duval expects China to be particularly busy with green bond issuance in 2018. "With France, it's the largest issuer of green bonds," said Duval. "It makes sense "" they have plenty of green investments to be made and because of their commitments during COP 21 and COP 23 ." "We are also expecting other countries in the region to be busy," Duval added. The governments of Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia are all expected to issue green bonds. Natixis has also recently installed a senior sustainable finance banker in Hong Kong, although in this case it was an external hire. Chaoni Huang, formerly of S&amp;P Trucost, was appointed in December as director of green and sustainable solutions for Asia Pacific. The green and sustainable solutions hub at Natixis, headed by Orith Azoulay in Paris, is somewhat unusual in that it combines not just acting for green bond and loan issuers, but creating equity and debt structured products for investors; fundamental environmental, social and governance research; and corporate advisory. Thus it includes staff on both the private and public sides of the market. Natixis's corporate and investment bank wants to double its green revenues by 2020. \</doc>

Representing Alstom and the Hydrogen Council, Henri Poupart-Lafarge has appeared as part of a panel at One Planet Summit, an event co-organised by the French Presidency, the United Nations and the World Bank. Mr. Poupart-Lafarge was there as CEO of a world-leading mobility company and on behalf of the Hydrogen Council following its meeting at COP 23 in November. Other panel members included Isabella Lovin, Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation and Climate and Deputy PM, Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, and Monica Araya, Founder and Executive Director of Nivela, Costa Rica. Sustainable transportation is at the centre of any discussion about limiting global emissions. At today's Summit, Mr. Poupart-Lafarge explained the Hydrogen Council's aim of ensuring that all hydrogen used in transportation be completely decarbonised by 2030. 'We need partnerships, to be all around the table establishing the right technical, financial and legislative environment to allow this decarbonised hydrogen to emerge. As part of a broader energy policy, we know that hydrogen can play a key role in clean energy storage.' With the launch of the Coradia iLint in 2016 - the world's first Hydrogen fuel cell train - followed by a first contract for 14 trains signed with Germany's Lower Saxony region in October 2017, Alstom is ahead of the curve in driving decarbonisation in the mobility sector. Indeed, the innovation is proof that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are feasible, both technically and commercially. 'What we need to develop is everything around it: the infrastructure and complete decarbonisation of the hydrogen used.' The One Planet Summit, co-organised by the French Presidency, the United Nations and the World Bank, marks the two-year anniversary of 2015's Paris Agreement. Assembling critical public and private stakeholders, the Summit aims to establish the financial alignment and concrete financing solutions that will enable the realisation of the Agreement's objectives, both in terms of emissions reduction and the protection of populations against the consequences of climate change.

Fiji Airways, Fiji's National Airline, has today unveiled the revolutionary 'Resort Check-In' feature at the Sofitel Fiji Resort and Spa on Denarau Island. The Resort Check-in facility, believed to be a first for the Pacific, will remain a permanent feature at the resort lobby. Speaking at the official launch this morning, Fiji Airways Managing Director and CEO Mr. Andre Viljoen said this is yet another customer experience enhancement for guests. 'We've designed this experience so guests simply get to the resort lobby and check themselves and their bags in for their Fiji Airways flights,' he revealed. 'We issue the boarding passes, tag and take bags off guests, leaving them free to enjoy Fiji for a few more hours.' All bags are transferred to Nadi International Airports and loaded on the guests' respective flights. 'This way, our guests can get a bite to eat, enjoy the pool, or go shopping at Port Denarau, before making their way to the airport. And at the airport, they bypass the airport check-in process and head straight to security. It's all about adding value on departure day, allowing them a hassle -free ending to their Fijian holiday.The next time guests see their bags after checking these in at the resort, is on the baggage claim belt of their destination airport.' Fiji Airways has piloted the Resort Check-In feature and received overwhelmingly positive response from guests during the trial phase. The feature was also activated during the Fiji International Golf tournament at Natadola and the Pre- COP 23 convention at the Sheraton Fiji Resort earlier in October. 'The activations were hailed success, from resort management, our own teams and most importantly - the guests themselves. We expect more resorts in Fiji to come on board with us to offer this service to our mutual guests.' The Resort Check-in feature is a complimentary service for Fiji Airways guests.

The Estonian presidency of the Council briefed EU ambassadors in Brussels this morning on the "~Trialogue' talks between the EU Council, Parliament and Commission, which ended last Thursday evening without an agreement. The issues at stake are complex, but ultimately affect how the burden of cutting greenhouse gas emissions "" and EU funding to tackle the work "" are shared among different actors in the EU. "After 30 hours of negotiations we couldn't reach the agreement we were hoping for, so we will need another Trialogue in the next couple of weeks," said a person familiar with the talks. COP 23 , this year's Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, will take place in Bonn from November 6 to 17, and the EU urgently wants to be able to announce there that it has reformed the ETS, ideally in the first week of the talks. The ETS, the world's largest and oldest carbon emission trading system, will begin its fourth phase in 2021, and much of the rules about how it will operate from then until 2030 have been agreed. But there are still details to be thrashed out, which affect how tightly the ETS is likely to be able to limit carbon emissions in the Union. All parties want to tighten the system, which has suffered from an oversupply of permits to emit greenhouse gases. The traded unit, the EU Allowance (EUA) to emit one tonne of CO2-equivalent, trades at about \'e2,\£c7, far too little to deter companies from emitting. The question is what methods should be employed, and how these should be calibrated. On some topics the Council could be seen as more ambitious for stricter control of emissions "" on others, the Parliament appears bolder. Last week's talks "" already the fifth Trialogue on the issue "" are said to have had a "good spirit to move things forward". The disagreements are not of the visceral kind that cannot be overcome "" the difficulty is more that the ETS is so complex that if one variable is altered, it affects other parts of the system, so agreeing changes is hard. The negotiation is broken into three "~clusters'. The first concerns strengthening the ETS, essentially through different means to reduce the oversupply of EUAs, as well as some issues concerning maritime emissions. The Parliament wants to insert a clause that would require the linear reduction factor to be reviewed at some point during Phase 4, which could give a chance to further tighten the ETS. Already agreed is a Market Stability Reserve, which has been likened to a central bank for the carbon market. From January 2019, it will begin absorbing permits from the market, if there is an excess. The quantity of EUAs the MSR can absorb will be doubled, from 12% of those created in each year to 24%. The Council wants this temporary increase to go on for five years, the Parliament for four. Another instrument proposed is that the MSR will start permanently cancelling some of the permits it has bought. The Council wants this to begin from 2024, Parliament from 2021. Observers are confident agreement can be found on these points. The second "~cluster' of the negotiations is about how much of the new EUAs each year are allocated freely to polluters in some sectors and how much are auctioned. The auction share has been set at 57%, but there is a conditional adjustment factor that can be applied to that, which the Parliament wants set at 5% and the Council at a lower figure. Despite the approach of Brexit, the UK is still fully involved in these talks as an EU member. The third cluster concerns funding "" money that can be allocated to organisations in the EU that want to make improvements to lower their carbon emissions. For example, an Innovation Fund has been allocated the proceeds of 400m permits, but there are disagreements on which part of the ETS process these are sourced from "" for example, whether they all come from the auction share. Possibly a bigger disagreement is that the Parliament wants projects that apply for funding from the ETS-related funds to have to meet an emissions performance standard (EPS) of 450g of CO2 per kWh. The Council does not envisage inserting such a condition. Modern combined cycle gas turbine power stations can typically meet this standard, while coal-fired ones cannot, unless they use at least some carbon capture and storage technology. Older open cycle gas turbine plants might not comply. \</doc>

The Prince of Wales has praised the "resilience" of the people of Dominica as he saw for himself the damage wreaked to the Caribbean island by Hurricane Maria. Charles stood among the ruins of Pichelin village, which was battered by torrential flooding and high winds in September, and sympathised with the residents who have remained. With a mangled car behind him, the heir to the throne chatted to locals stood in front of the village general store whose front was swept away by the deluge that brought whole trees, huge boulders and other debris down from hill tops. Marilyn Leatham, 53, from a neighbouring village, said: "The Prince told me 'you're resilient people - hold on'. It means the world to us to have him here and it means the world is thinking of us. "And the Prince makes us feel proud as people - we will bounce back." Charles, with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, walked through the village shaking the hands of locals and stopping to chat briefly and even watched a dance performance by local school children. "The car next to my grandmother's store was across the street and the water just picked it up and tossed across the street." Dominica's prime minister Roosevelt Skerrit joined the prince for the visit. Speaking last week at Cop 23 , the UN's climate change talks, he said about the natural disaster: "When dawn broke, the scenes of utter devastation across this once lush green island were heartbreaking." He told delegates at the global summit in Bonn, Germany: "In some areas where houses once stood there lay mounds of dirt and debris, others had their roofs blown off, landslides scarred the landscape, trees were uprooted or laid bare and flood waters raged. "All utilities were non-functional." Mr Skerrit added: "Two months later 95% of the country remains without electricity, our water systems are compromised, and many citizens remain displaced and in shelters." \</doc>

The burning of fossil fuels around the world is set to hit a record high in 2017, climate scientists have warned, following three years of flat growth that raised hopes that a peak in global emissions had been reached. The expected jump in the carbon emissions that drive global warming is a "giant leap backwards for humankind", according to some scientists. However, other experts said they were not alarmed, saying fluctuations in emissions are to be expected and that big polluters such as China are acting to cut emissions. Global emissions need to reach their peak by 2020 and then start falling quickly in order to have a realistic chance of keeping global warming below the 2C danger limit, according to leading scientists. Whether the anticipated increase in CO2 emissions in 2017 is just a blip that is followed by a falling trend, or is the start of a worrying upward trend, remains to be seen. Much will depend on the fast implementation of the global climate deal sealed in Paris in 2015 and this is the focus of the UN summit of the world's countries in Bonn, Germany this week. The nations must make significant progress in turning the aspirations of the Paris deal into reality, as the action pledged to date would see at least 3C of warming and increasing extreme weather impacts around the world. Related: The COP23 climate change summit in Bonn and why it matters "Global CO2 emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three-year stable period. This is very disappointing," said Prof Corinne Le Qu\'e9r\'e9, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the UK's University of East Anglia and who led the new research. "The urgency for reducing emissions means they should really be already decreasing now." "There was a big push to sign the Paris agreement on climate change but there is a feeling that not very much has happened since, a bit of slackening," she said. "What happens after 2017 is very open and depends on how much effort countries are going to make. It is time to take really seriously the implementation of the Paris agreement." She said the hurricanes and floods seen in 2017 were "a window into the future". The new analysis is based on the available energy use data for 2017 and projections for the latter part of the year. It estimates that 37bn tonnes of CO2 will be emitted from burning fossil fuels, the highest total ever. The main reason for the rise is an expected 3.5% increase in emissions in China, the world's biggest polluter, where low rains have reduced low-carbon hydroelectric output and industrial activity has increased. India's rise in emissions was modest compared to previous years at 2%, while the US and EU are both on track for small falls. 2017 is likely to be the hottest year ever recorded in which there was no El Ni\'f1o event, a natural global cycle that temporarily nudges up global temperature. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere also saw a record jump in 2016, and other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture and industry are also rising. "The news that emissions are rising after the three-year hiatus is a giant leap backwards for humankind," said Amy Luers, executive director of Future Earth, a global research initiative. "Pushing the Earth closer to tipping points is deeply concerning. Emissions need to peak soon and approach zero by 2050." Related: The seven megatrends that could beat global warming: 'There is reason for hope' However, climate economist Prof Nicholas Stern, at the UK's London School of Economics, said: "I would not be alarmed. There will be some fluctuations, for example around poor rains and hydro. We should also remember that the methods used to calculate emissions will have their own errors." He said there is strong climate action in China : "It has a very clear strategy, particularly on coal and energy efficiency and they are getting, and will get, results." But Stern said it remains vital that all countries ramp up the ambition of their emissions pledges and that richer countries support action across the world. Climate scientist Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University in the US, said the research was authoritative but also urged caution, noting that the 2% projected rise in emissions is small relative to the overall uncertainties in the data. "It seems to me they are over-interpreting the 2017 numbers and jumping the gun a bit. Can't we wait until the actual numbers are in to do a post-mortem?" The ability to monitor emissions quickly and accurately is of growing importance. The Paris agreement is based on voluntary cuts by nations, and without verification that pledges have been fulfilled, the trust that underpins the deal could be eroded. "This puts immense pressure on the scientific community to develop methods that can truly verify changes in emissions," said Le Qu\'e9r\'e9. \</doc>

Feedback is our weekly column of bizarre stories, implausible advertising claims, confusing instructions and more A gloomy forecast DONALD TRUMP may be wedded to the Republican dogma of small government, given that many key positions are still vacant almost a year after his inauguration. But Feedback suspects that if the president has been slow to choose his nominees, it is only because he is carefully selecting the ones who will most irritate his Democratic opponents. Witness the most gripping TV to come out of the US recently, the bleakly comic series known as "hearings on nominees for the Environmental Protection Agency". Here, visibly exasperated Democrat senators interrogate the scientific credentials of candidates whose r\'e9sum\'e9s might struggle to reach the bottom of the page they're printed on.

This week, it was Kathleen Hartnett White's turn in the hot seat. Selected to direct the Council on Environmental Quality, a role that oversees federal environmental policy, Hartnett White was grilled so thoroughly by senators that at times it felt like the Capitol's sprinkler system might kick in. "Modern air is a little too clean for optimum health." The surprising conclusions of toxicologist Robert Phalen, who is the latest addition to Trump's science advisory board Asked if she stood by previous comments that carbon dioxide was not dangerous to the environment, Hartnett White said that atmospheric carbon was in fact a plant nutrient, with none of the characteristics of a pollutant that could harm human health. Excuse us while we hyperventilate into this paper bag. Changeable weather SENATOR Sheldon Whitehouse wanted to know if Hartnett White thought the law of thermal expansion applied to seawater? "I do not have any kind of expertise or even much layman's study of the ocean dynamics and the climate change issues," she replied. Reassuring stuff. And to the all-important question: Hartnett White told the panel that while she did believe climate change was real, there was much uncertainty over the extent to which human activity was to blame. Would she rely on scientists to clarify that uncertainty, Senator Ben Cardin wanted to know. "No, I've had that question for a very long time," Hartnett White replied. With such a lack of confidence in our ability to change the environment, and a refusal to be informed otherwise, Feedback wonders what Hartnett White hopes to achieve in her role as the US environmental https://www.facebook.com/theguardian/videos/10156163592166323/?hc_ref=ARR0GSfMYoA-P5rwmes4GUSvNCe5VT8ItrKta7BMFbE1xnUymwIln55ugHliDKj924w policy advisor . Brightening up FEW will have identified lumps of coal as the solution to sexual assaults \- unless stuffed into a stocking as an improvised weapon. But one advocate of this unlikely ally is Rick Perry, US secretary of energy, climate change sceptic and the country's leading champion of all things combustible. Speaking at an energy policy discussion earlier this month, Perry suggested that not only were fossil fuels instrumental in lifting developing countries out of poverty, but they also had the capacity to reduce sex crime. "When the lights are on," he told delegates, "you have light that shines, the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts." The remarks ignited a storm of criticism online (a source of energy we've yet to harness, sadly) with Michael Brune of the conservationist Sierra Club calling on Perry to resign from his post. That might not be much in the way of punishment to Perry, who had previously called for the Department of Energy to be scrapped, and then took on its leadership without realising that the main focus of his role would not be governing oil, coal or other fuels, but overseeing the US nuclear arsenal. A warm front IT MAY feel like the US strategy to tackle climate change is to will it out of existence by ignoring all evidence for it. Certainly, this would explain why so many Puerto Ricans are still reading by candlelight. However, do not despair. California's governor Jerry Brown has emerged as the leading voice of reason.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that time is running out to keep global warming low enough to prevent devastating climate change, adding that it is the "defining threat of our time." The director of the world body was speaking at the UN climate change body's annual negotiations ( COP23 The accord was signed by nearly 200 countries - most recently previous holdouts Syria and Nicaragua - in an effort to curb global carbon emissions and keep global warming to under 2C. Read more Trump is not invited to our next climate change summit, says France The agreement goes into effect in 2020. The Secretary-General asserted that the world may have only five years to take measures needed to meet the most ambitious target of keeping global warming at 1.5C, the recommended target by an independent panel of scientists. Mr Guterres said world leaders should "show courage in combating entrenched interests" in climate change. It appears to have been a thinly veiled criticism of the US delegation's appearance at the conference. The US remains the sole country that has initiated withdrawal procedures from the deal, which unless stopped will go into effect on 4 November 2020. On 13 November the official US delegation - half the size of what it has been in the two previous Obama administrations - held an event during which industry representatives from coal, oil/gas, and nuclear power were prominently featured. The presentation was interrupted for nearly 10 minutes by youth activists chanting and singing. Activists are a common presence at the UN meeting every year, but this time their ire was in full force opposing the US' starkly different message from the rest of the world, several people attending the meeting told The Independent . During the panel Trump international energy issues advisor George D Banks said it was "c ontroversial only if we chose to bury our heads in the sand." "Without question, fossil fuels will continue to be used, and we would argue that it's in the global interest to make sure when fossil fuels are used that they be as clean and efficient as possible," Mr Banks said. Climate change might be worse than thought after scientists find major mistake in water temperature readings As the New York Times reported, "the American presentation came the same day that a new study showed that [carbon] emissions were rising worldwide after three years on a plateau." Mr Guterres also said: "it is fitting that this conference is led by Fiji, a nation on the front lines" of climate change. "When the front line is decimated, the whole army is lost," said Mr Guterres. Small island nations issues with sinking amid rising sea levels and the damage after several recent hurricanes in the Caribbean have gained particular prominence at this year's talks. In another apparent criticism of Mr Trump, he said about the idea of coupling economic growth with use of fossil fuels: "today that dogma is dead". Mr Trump had said the reason for US withdrawal from the accord was because it put American workers at an "economic disadvantage." Mr Guterres pointed to the rapid growth of India and China, while becoming leaders in solar power, as well as the increase in carbon markets - or places for companies to trade emissions credits as an incentive to go 'green' - as evidence. Conference participant Simon Chin Yee, a research fellow for the European Centre for Energy and Resource Security, told The Independent that observers will "need to watch countries that were trailing their tails going into" the conference during which the Paris accord was signed. Those who were on the fence about making large cuts to their carbon emissions rates though they signed the agreement may "use the US withdrawal as an excuse to stall the negotiations" on how best to implement the agreement as well as make concrete financial commitments, Mr Chin Yee explained. Germany, Australia, and Japan are just some of the world's developed countries that have been criticised by activists and scientists for still using coal. Norway still attributes a significant portion of its GDP to oil reserves. Mr Chin Yee said the key to considering the meeting a "success" despite the impending withdrawal of one of the world's worst polluters is for countries to come together on how to implement the agreement as soon as possible. Another American delegation also made an unofficial appearance in Bonn. California Governor Jerry Brown , former New York City Mayor and UN special envoy on cities and climate change Michael Bloomberg , and former Vice President Al Gore were all in attendance at a pavilion outside of the official conference venue. The purpose of the pavilion and its exhibitions is to showcase how Americans - at the sub-national level - are still fighting climate change in spite of the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle Obama-era environmental regulations domestically.

December 5, 2017 Leipzig, Germany -- During the World Climate Conference COP 23 in Bonn, good news and announcement of Oliver Gediminas Caplikas. Greening Deserts projects want to plant over 100 billion trees worldwide, especially in Europe and Africa during the next years. Together with the nations and awesome projects like Greening Coasts, Great Green Wall, Great Green Wall North Africa, The Green Belt Movement and the Trillion Trees Campaign the goal can be reached fast and efficient. Alone the Sahara is an area of 9,500,000 square kilometres, this is equal 950,000,000 ha (950 million hectares). If just on 10% of this area trees would be planted, it could convert 95 million hectares dry and barren wasteland into fertile landscapes. The idea is to establish greening camps and connect schools, universities and other institutions to the Greening Deserts projects and partner programs. A broad education, culture and science is very important for the projects. With active participation and real support of the concerned regions and financial help of all nations and goverments we can start with first preperations still this year and in 2018 on site - and see first results still that year. With our worldwide greening, forestation, afforestation, reforestation and research projects we can reduce global warming significantly. To cool down cities or urban areas (Global Cooling), more parks, city forests or urban woods and green roofs (rooftop greening) are required. Greening Deserts finished an extensive but easy to understand business plan, concept, market study and master plan for professional greening and research in surface mining or post-mining landscapes. This concept is an special extract of the general concept and main masterplan of Greening Deserts projects and can be used for many kinds of deserts or drylands, savannas or grasslands. About Greening Deserts: Greening Deserts projects are for arid or dry, hot or cold regions. Offering professional greening services and solutions for coastal, subtropical, cold and semi-arid areas nearby water sources like lakes, rivers, seas or oceans! Greening Deserts is a cultural, educational, economic, social, scientific and sustainable agriculture project using classical greening or gardening methods but also new and alternative techniques like hydroponics, permaculture and vermaculture. In short, Greening Deserts is an economical, educational, cultural, social, scientific and sustainable project to reduce desertification and global warming.

The US states, cities and businesses that have signed up to reduce greenhouse gas emissions despite president Donald Trump's threats to withdraw from the Paris agreement would, if put together, have the clout of the world's third biggest economy, after the US and China. To date, 20 US states and more than 50 of its largest cities, along with more than 60 of the biggest businesses in the US, have committed to emissions reduction goals. Added together, they have an economic power of about $10tn, placing this group behind only the US as a whole ($18.6tn) and China ($11tn) in terms of GDP. On Saturday at the Bonn conference on climate change, these groups joined together to make "America's pledge", a commitment to combat global warming, in stark opposition to the Trump administration. "This is very powerful," said Paul Bodnar, a former lead negotiator at the climate talks for the US under Barack Obama. "These states and cities would be larger than 195 out of the 197 countries signed up to the Paris agreement." Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, led the group in vowing to take measures, such as reducing coal-fired power and investing in renewable energy and efficiency, which would substantially reduce their carbon output. But some delegates want the companies and local governments involved to go further, by submitting reports on their progress towards their emissions-cutting goals to be subject to the kind of monitoring and accountability that is required from national governments under the UN process. They have put forward a draft text which, if accepted, would mean such voluntary commitments were made in line with UN standards, and could therefore be included in the national greenhouse gas inventories required from countries. Kevin Conrad, of Papua New Guinea, told the Guardian: "We welcome their contributions, but they should be accountable [on their progress in meeting their voluntary goals]. Will they be willing to be reviewed on their results, not just on the blather?" He said the draft text was aimed at giving these contributions "a legitimacy" under the UN's rules. "They should be transparent," he said. "We do not want to pre-judge America's Pledge, we just want rigour on the results." The group's commitments fall outside the pledges under the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, and are likely to fall short of the requirements on carbon-cutting under the pact. Trump has vowed to withdraw the US from this agreement, the first to bind developed and developing countries to a specific temperature goal. At the Bonn COP23 Current pledges under the Paris agreement are inadequate to reach this goal and it is estimated they would bring the world to 3C of warming, which would cause drastic changes in sea level rises, bring droughts and floods to many areas of the world, and make agriculture impossible in huge swaths of the globe. However, consensus on how to strengthen the pledges is proving elusive, and is unlikely to be finalised at these talks. Meanwhile, the Trump White House has indicated its priorities, to the consternation of many delegates, by scheduling a meeting at the talks focusing on the future of coal and how its use can be continued with new technologies. The America's Pledge report will be released in the alternative US headquarters at the talks, the US Climate Action Center. The giant inflatable dome sits on the edge of the conference - which many of its supporters claim is a sign of its endorsement as a semi-official player. Despite the geographical proximity of the "America's Pledge" delegation, there are limits to what non-state actors can do. They are excluded from many of the technical talks and cannot tap into federal funds that states use to finance commitments to slow climate change or reduce its impacts. More importantly, it is harder for them to set a course for the country. But while that is missing, Antha Williams, head of the Bloomberg Philanthropies environment team, said it was necessary to fill the void. "It would be better if we saw leadership from the White House, but the overarching point is that cities, states and companies that represent more than half of the US are showing their support for climate action." Nick Nuttall, communications chief of UN Climate Change, said the organisers were willing to work constructively with non-state actors. "We are extremely supportive of the whole mass of cities, states and territories who have been aligning themselves with the Paris agreement," he said. "American cities and states have been very active, which is welcome - and it mirrors what is happening elsewhere in the world." His comments were echoed by several delegates. But some climate activists warned against expecting too much from the America's Pledge team. Thanu Yakupitiyage, of the NGO 350.org said the climate pledges by many mayors and governors were a welcome step, but she urged still greater ambition and concrete policies to phase out fossil fuels. "America's Pledge is a start and we'll be holding our elected officials, including governor Jerry Brown, to his word. As we look towards the climate summit that the governor has announced for 2018, we want more than words; we want a tangible action plan and steps taken," she said. \</doc>

The world's leaders are meeting - again - for talks on climate change. This year's Conference of the Parties (the 23rd, hence COP23 ) to the United Nations climate treaty in Bonn, Germany, is not expected to be a deal-clinching, make-or-break one like Paris in 2015 or Copenhagen in 2009. That doesn't make it insignificant - the hope is that negotiators will make meaningful progress on implementing the provisions of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Countries have agreed that they want a whole range of operational rules, deliberately left vague in Paris, to be agreed by the 2018 COP in Katowice, Poland. These include rules over financing for climate adaptation in developing countries, and for a new market mechanism to help implementation of the agreement, among others. Climate negotiations typically involve several years of glacial progress followed by a flurry of extraordinary spectacle, involving negotiators staying up for two days straight to get a deal done. This dynamic is exhausting, and usually produces distinctly underwhelming results announced with great fanfare, along with the launch of yet another a new initiative or network. It all invites a weary cynicism about what we expect the UN process to achieve. But if the Paris Agreement is to be anything other than a farce, it must avoid the sort of design which needs heroic politicians parachuting in once every five years. Rather, it needs countries to pay attention, to continue working patiently, revising and improving their strategies to 'bend the curve' on emissions and deal with the mess that climate change is already causing. Here then are five things that should happen: 1. Enough with the oil, coal and gas already Parties - nearly 200 countries plus the EU - could explicitly recognise that the 'net-zero' emissions goal in the Paris Agreement means the end of fossil fuels. What would that mean in practice? They'd make substantive policy announcements with serious effects, like eliminating fossil fuel subsidies - which even the IMF thinks are out of hand - or a coal phase-out by 2025. They'd also begin to think through how to arrange serious funding for renewables, the electrification of motorised transport and a ramping up of 'technology transfer'. 2. Sharpen the teeth of the pledges It was clear from the outset that these emissions cuts, taken together, would still see the world shoot past the 2-degreeC target, let alone a 1.5-degreeC one. Collectively, they could agree to accelerate the process of reviewing these commitments but to trigger this, countries seeking to lead would need to do this unilaterally. 3. Show us the money Industrialised countries could announce new investments in the Green Climate Fund. There are lots of fine words about this fund, but richer nations have not put their money where their mouths are. It was supposed to be raising US$ 100 billion a year by 2020, but countries have so far put in just over US$ 10 billion in total (and that includes US$ 3 billion from the US, whose status is now threatened by US president, Donald Trump). This is hopelessly inadequate in the face of the need to both finance zero-carbon development in developing countries and help those already facing 'loss and damage' from climate change. New and substantial cheques and means to simulate private financing of low-carbon development are needed. 4. Clarify the rules Parties could agree on certain rules a year ahead of schedule. Last year, at COP22 in Marrakech, it was decided those rules that had been left vague needed to be agreed on by 2018, in order to help the first stocktake of progress in implementing the agreement. These things tend to take a long time. Take the example of the market mechanism, for instance (article 6 of the agreement). After they were introduced in the Kyoto protocol of 1997 it took a further four years for everyone to agree on their operational rules. This is all too slow. Now we have those earlier models to draw on, quicker progress would be a sign they are getting on with things. 5. Fantasy technologies are exposed as delusions Parties could explicitly accept that 'negative emissions' technologies are no substitute for aiming for zero emissions. The idea of 'net-zero' emissions - and many of the IPCC's scenarios - increasingly rely on weird and wonderful technologies to take carbon out of the atmosphere. The latest of these is Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage: you grow plants, which absorb CO2, then burn them in power stations to generate electricity, capture the emitted carbon and store it underground. The trouble is, no-one knows if it can really work - but, at the same time, many are using this as a sort of magical escape clause to avoid the end of fossil fuels (see 1 above). A recognition that this is wishful thinking would be useful. All five of the above are pretty unlikely. The chances are that negotiations will continue along the path of nothing happening until the last minute (if then). But here's one that will almost certainly happen, but will be largely meaningless. The Climate Action Leadership Network, already announced at the UN Climate week in September will be fully launched, as the latest in a set of such efforts to keep up the semblance of momentum in the negotiations. Meanwhile, renewable energy technology will drop in price independently of all the fine words, and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will continue to grow.

Millions of viewers of the BBC's Blue Planet II will have seen footage of a turtle trapped in a plastic sack and a pilot whale nursing its dead calf. It's likely to have died from drinking its mother's plastic-contaminated milk. The episode prompted environment secretary Michael Gove to tweet : "Still haunted by last night's #BluePlanet2 - the imperative to do more to tackle plastic in our oceans is clear. We @DefraGovUK will work urgently to identify further action." It seems everyone agrees that the issue of ocean plastic is one that requires urgent attention, and the business community has started to respond. It's like if your sink is overflowing - the first thing you do isn't clean it. You turn off the tap. It's the same with plastic But the task is mammoth and multi-faceted; consumer goods companies struggle to deal with the issue holistically. A new collaboration between global company Henkel and the social enterprise Plastic Bank may provide a template for future action. The manufacturer of brands such as Schwarzkopf, Loctite and Persil (outside the UK) has teamed up with Plastic Bank to help prevent plastic from reaching the ocean, while also providing opportunities for people in Haiti. When we see marine animals caught in plastic, or huge floating islands of rubbish, the impulse is to demand it be cleaned up. But, according to David Katz, Plastic Bank's founder, "Cleaning the ocean is the last thing we should be doing." "It's like if you walk into your kitchen and your sink is overflowing - the first thing you do isn't to clean it up. You turn off the tap. It's the same with plastic." Plastic Bank's approach is to turn waste plastic - of which about 8m tonnes is dumped into the oceans every year - into an asset for some of the world's poorest people, to stop it from ever reaching the sea. It was this idea of recycling having a social impact, alongside an environmental one - an approach the organisation calls Social Plastic - that appealed to Henkel, says Marie-\'c8ve Schr\'f6der, corporate senior vice-president for international marketing in their beauty care business unit. "Plastic Bank was the only partner we could identify that combined environmental benefits and social benefits. It's not just about recycling plastic and helping the environment. It also provides a permanent revenue opportunity, often for women." Related: Where health meets eco-consciousness: the gym made from used aerosol cans The scheme was launched in Haiti, says Katz, "because it is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and because when you look at the ocean currents, all the plastic that is washing up on Europe's beaches comes from places like Haiti". The Caribbean nation is a substantial source of plastic because it lacks recycling infrastructure. With nowhere to go, the plastic just lies on the ground until it rains, when it is washed into the sea. Plastic Bank pays people above market prices to collect waste and take it to collection centres. It is then ground into flakes and transported abroad (on cargo ships that otherwise would have returned empty to North America or Europe, for instance). Henkel's packaging experts are currently researching ways of incorporating the plastic collected into its product packaging in the future. Collectors can convert the plastic either into cash or other goods, such as cooking fuel, or vouchers that pay for schooling or mobile phone charging. "Often, the collectors are homeless, and a phone number is like your ID - it's the only way people can contact you and it is the tool connecting you to life and society," Schr\'f6der says. The first bottles containing recycled ocean plastic - obtained from Plastic Bank and other sources - will hit the shelves in the second half of 2018, says Thomas M\'fcller-Kirschbaum, head of global research and development in Henkel's laundry and home care unit. "A growing number of customers are asking for sustainable solutions and they want to be able to see what is being done. Ocean plastic will only be a small part of the recycled material that we use, but it is very visible, so it's important. We want to change our supply chain and move towards a circular economy." The partners are planning to expand to other markets in 2018, including Ethiopia, India, Indonesia and Brazil, and Plastic Bank is set to announce links with other fast-moving consumer goods companies, to add to its partnerships with Shell, IBM, Marks & Spencer and Henkel. The organisation was recently awarded a Momentum for Change Lighthouse award by the United Nations at the COP23 Climate Change Conference, in recognition of its "practical and scalable efforts to address climate change and set sustainable development goals". Katz spent a week at the Vatican, including a meeting with the Pope, looking at ways the world's 1.2bn Catholics could help to tackle the issue. "What if each of them could bring 500g of plastic a week to church with them? That is enough to change the world," he says. Another initiative seeking to redefine the future of plastics is the New Plastics Economy, which kicked off earlier this year and is led by circular economy experts the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. It aims to look beyond today's incremental improvements "to create a shared sense of direction, to spark a wave of innovation and to move the plastics value chain into a positive spiral of value capture, stronger economics, and better environmental outcomes". Already, six participants - including Mars, M&S and PepsiCo - have pledged to use 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging by 2025 at the latest. \</doc>

The country's largest customer-facing organisation, IndianOil Corporation (IndianOil), has adopted 2018 as the 'Year of Trust.' From Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) to daily price revision of petrol & diesel, to the decision to leapfrog BS-VI fuels supply to Delhi by April 1, 2018, two years before its actual implementation date, are a few instances where policy-makers trusted the delivery potential of IndianOil. 'The observanceof 2018 as the 'Year of Trust' is a unique opportunity to sustain the Company's trust among its customers and stakeholders by enhancing our capabilities and our integrity, as individuals and as an organisation,' said IndianOil Chairman, Sanjiv Singh while unveiling the corporate theme for the year 2018. 'Backed by our inherent strengths as a team and as an organisation, it would be a great project to make TRUST an enduring value across our supply chain,' he added. Every second Indian is served by IndianOil employees, channel partners and their team members through more than 47,000 customer touch points. 'Our core values inspire us to give our best. Among these, TRUST is the keystone and the active DNA of our organisational culture,' said Mr. Sanjiv Singh. The decision follows the tradition started by the organisation in the year 2016 of adopting calendar year-based on IndianOil's corporate values- Care, Innovation, Passion and Trust - when the organisation completed 10 years of formalising the corporate Core Values. Year 2016 was the 'Year of Core Values', while the year 2017 was observed as the 'Year of Innovation and Technology.' Starting from refineriesand pipeline networks to bulk storage terminals and fuel stations, adoption of smart technologies,e-portals for customer convenience and efficient use of SAP have resulted in greater efficiency. Now, a full-fledged CRM (customer relationship management) solution is being implemented to engage more closely with customers. IndianOil during 2017 also selected 11 innovative research proposals for support with its start-up fund. The resolution to adopt 2018 as 'Year of Trust' comes at a particularly important moment as India joins countries like France and China to stand by the accord to meet the challenge for a low-carbon sustainable future in the COP-23 Bonn Summit held in November 2017. For India, moving in consonance with the commitment would mean an increased share of Natural Gas and Renewables in the future energy mix. Being a market leader IndianOil will be once again leading this national agenda in the coming years.

Standing among the ruins of Pichelin village, which was battered by torrential flooding and high winds in September, Charles told residents facing the aftermath in Dominica to 'hold on'. With a mangled car behind him, the heir to the throne spoke to locals in front of the village general store, whose front was swept away by the deluge that brought whole trees, huge boulders and other debris down from hill tops. Khalin Thomas, the 26-year-old granddaughter of the store's owner, described the force of the hurricane, which has left 95 per cent of the country without electricity.\~ 'The car next to my grandmother's store was across the street and the water just picked it up and tossed across the street,' she said. 'We managed to survive the hurricane somehow, the village is between two rivers - but luckily we're still here.' Charles walked through the village shaking the hands of locals, stopping to chat and even watched a dance performance by local school children. Marilyn Leatham, from a neighbouring village on Caribbean island, said the royal visit emboldened her. The 53-year-old said: 'The Prince told me "you're resilient people - hold on". It means the world to us to have him here and it means the world is thinking of us. 'And the Prince makes us feel proud as people - we will bounce back.' He was accompanied by International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Dominican prime minister Roosevelt Skerrit on the three-day visit.\~ Mr Skerrit described the devastation last week while speaking at Cop 23 , the UN's climate change talks. 'When dawn broke, the scenes of utter devastation across this once lush green island were heartbreaking,' he said. He told delegates at the global summit in Bonn, Germany: 'In some areas where houses once stood there lay mounds of dirt and debris, others had their roofs blown off, landslides scarred the landscape, trees were uprooted or laid bare and flood waters raged. 'All utilities were non-functional. 'Two months later 95% of the country remains without electricity, our water systems are compromised, and many citizens remain displaced and in shelters.' \</doc>

News this week that Fiji was planning to become the third national government to issue a green bond suggested the republic of 900,000 people might be taking advantage of the hot global market for green-themed debt to bring international capital to the island. Fiji has issued Eurobonds in dollars three times before, most recently in 2015 for $200m. But the green bond issue will be in Fiji dollars, which means it will be sold more or less entirely to domestic investors. "If you look at the press release from the prime minister's office and presidency position that Fiji has taken as part of COP 23 , and being the third sovereign to issue green bonds, it fits into the issues that much of the Pacific is subject to, around climate change," said Andrew Cross, deputy treasurer at the International Finance Corp in Singapore. The IFC and World Bank together provided technical assistance to Fiji for the deal, which was arranged and is being placed by the Reserve Bank of Fiji. The IFC normally works with the private sector, but has lots of experience of issuing green bonds and helping emerging market banks and companies issue them, so its expertise was applicable, and it also had a local officer based in Suva. The book for the bond closes on October 31 and the deal may be priced on November 1. "The green bond is very consistent with the sovereign's agenda around highlighting many of the issues that smaller island nations face," said Cross. "Given that green bonds typically price flat to a country's credit," it seemed an appropriate instrument to use. Cross added that recent evidence suggested green bonds often traded more tightly than ordinary bonds, and that there was some evidence they could be issued at tighter spreads. Vital signs Signalling was a very important part of Fiji's presidency of COP 23 , Cross said. "Fiji is taking a very responsible approach and taking advantage of that leadership opportunity," he said. "If you look at how they want to use the proceeds, especially around renewable energy, they are matching the type of liability with the type of funding they are wanting to do." Vivek Pathak, regional director at the IFC for East Asia Pacific in Hong Kong, said: "They want to be able to demonstrate and showcase" how they are addressing climate change. "There is no better way than to lead by example," he went on. "The reason this is important is we would like to see more of this asset class developing in emerging markets. Fiji is a small country, but in many ways it has a well developed private sector with some big banks operating there. We want to be able to convince some of the banks and corporates that are involved in renewable energy to issue green bonds." Earlier this year the IFC set up with Amundi an innovative and potentially powerful $2bn Green Cornerstone Bond Fund, which will buy green bonds issued only by emerging market banks. The fund is soon to begin operating. Part of the IFC's contribution is to use its extensive networks to stimulate banks to issue green bonds, proactively originating deals as well as just buying them when they appear. "We are talking to a few banks," said Pathak, "for example, one in the Philippines, about issuing green bonds. Based on conversations with a number of banks in the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, we are seeing increasing interest. Banks want to diversify their sources of funding, and even if they have MTN programmes, this is a new asset class that's emerging." Deals the Cornerstone Fund can buy could be in local currency, although it is looking now largely at hard currency deals. Sometimes the Fund might buy the whole of an issue, other times it might buy part of one that is issued to the open market. Pathak said this would be "on a case by case basis". Cost-effective funding Although the green bond has a communicative function, Fiji was also very careful to make sure it was cost-effective, the IFC executives said. The decision to issue it domestically flowed from this, and from its wider programme of managing the government debt and developing the country's capital markets. "We have with the Reserve Bank of Fiji a capital markets development project," said Pathak. "To have more Fijian private sector entities tap the capital markets for funding" would be very important, he said, adding that "green bonds are going to be a critical component." Fiji's local bond market is quite well developed. The green bond's five year tranche is likely to appeal to local banks, while the 13 year is aimed at pension funds. The deal's size, of F$100m ($50m) made it digestible by the local market, while in the international market it might have been on the small side, perhaps requiring Fiji to pay a price premium, the IFC executives said. More importantly, had it issued in dollars, the government would have been left with foreign exchange risk. The World Bank and IFC are not investing in the bond, nor providing swaps or other assistance for international investors to buy the bond. Asked whether Fiji might have done better to use the popular green label to attract international capital, so that local savings in the banks and pension funds could have been invested in other domestic uses, so that these were not crowded out by the government, Cross said: "If you look at the local bond market, is the sovereign able to place its bonds "" are they freely tradable, is it relatively liquid? In some countries there is actually a shortage of local government debt. So you are not crowding out, you are enabling local investors to acquire some of the assets to back the liabilities they are putting on their balance sheets. The Reserve Bank of Fiji take a considered approach to working through these issues." \</doc>

The world is showing its commitment to fighting climate change, writes Scottish environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham. We have seen some real messages of solidarity coming from the annual United Nations' climate talks in Bonn this week, with delegations of senior US politicians and captains of industry defiantly declaring that much of America still supports the Paris Agreement. Over the next week both the First Minister and myself will be joining these discussions, as part of Scotland's commitment to contain global temperature rises to well below two degrees Celsius, and to pursue efforts to limit the rise even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. HYPERLINK http://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/melrose/doddie-weir-interview-i-have-mnd-but-i-m-a-lucky-man-1-4610447| http://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/melrose/doddie-weir-interview-i-have-mnd-but-i-m-a-lucky-man-1-4610447| Doddie Weir interview: I have MND, but I'm a lucky man'\ Sadly the need for action on climate change is greater now than ever. Over the past week we have heard from world-leading experts that concentrations of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere surged to a record high in 2016. The BBC's boundary-pushing Blue Planet 2 series showed us in graphic detail how marine life across the globe is struggling with the damage caused to their habitats by changing climates. Closer to home, new research published last week warned that our important cod, herring and haddock stocks could disappear from Scotland's west coast by 2100 as a direct result of warming sea temperatures. That is why the Scottish Government is committed to taking action and staying at the forefront of the global fight against climate change through our draft Climate Change Bill and recent Programme for Government, which has been described as our "greenest" yet. Our climate targets are already the most ambitious in the UK and our proposals for the new Climate Change Bill will set long-term targets in direct response to the Paris Agreement. We received almost 20,000 responses to our bill consultation and are currently considering those responses. We are also finalising our Climate Change Plan. The draft plan set out a package of transformational measures and interventions across transport, heat, electricity generation and energy efficiency to help us build on our world-leading climate change ambitions and reduce emissions by 66 per cent by 2032. The finalised version will be strengthened by the bold new low-carbon commitments, which were set out in the 2017 Programme for Government - including phasing out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2032. These commitments are all geared towards transformation. We have signalled a step change in our ambition towards a low carbon economy by announcing low emission zones in Scotland's four biggest cities by 2020. This will help make people's homes and businesses more energy efficient. By acting on climate change, Scotland is also benefitting from the investment, growth and trade of the low carbon transition, with almost 60,000 low carbon jobs across the country. As well as our climate leadership through domestic action, Scotland plays an active role internationally. EU membership has been significant for our environmental ambitions. Despite Brexit we will continue to work to ensure Scotland continues to benefit from the EU's powerful voice. We are supporting the Under2 Coalition, a commitment by almost 200 progressive states and cities, covering more than 1.2 billion people to reduce their greenhouse gas emission towards net-zero by 2050. I am pleased that one of Scotland's first engagements will be a meeting of the Under2 Coalition hosted by the governor of California Edmund G Brown, where we will follow up on the next steps of our Co-operation Agreement signed by the First Minister and the governor earlier in the year. Both Scotland and California have committed to the Under2MoU which delivers ambitious domestic measures to reduce carbon emissions and provide leadership in the spirit of the historic Paris Agreement. In fact, earlier this week it was fantastic to meet young members of Friends of the Earth Scotland and hear about their own experience of attending COP23 and taking part in the climate march. It was inspiring to hear how passionate they are, and how they have been promoting Scotland's interests to international audiences. And from 19-21 November in Edinburgh, the Scottish Government will host our first-ever Arctic Circle Forum - a break-out event of the international co-operation network the Arctic Circle Assembly, which the First Minister spoke at in Iceland last month As well as contributions by ministers from Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, the forum will include a keynote address by Lord Deben, chairman of the UK's Committee on Climate Change, the independent body that advises the UK and devolved administrations on tackling and preparing for climate change. Titled Scotland and the New North, the forum will see attendance by business interests, academics, governments, charities and NGOs from around the world. Focusing on innovation, science and sustainable development, co-operation among northern nations in response to climate change will be a central theme and there's still time to register attendance by going to HYPERLINK http://www.arcticcirclescotland.com www.arcticcirclescotland.com Making sure everyone understands the role they play in tackling climate change is part of the challenge. While the concept of global warming can seem worlds away from our everyday lives in Scotland, everyone can play a part. The reality is that individuals, making small changes like turning down a thermostat, or recycling more household waste, or cycling instead of taking the car, cumulatively can have a big impact on safeguarding our environment. Sadly the most damaging effects of climate change are in developing nations and fall disproportionately on the very young, the very old and the very poor. That's why Scotland was the first national government in the world to establish a Climate Justice Fund, which now supports 11 projects in some of the planet's poorest communities in four sub-Saharan African countries. That's just one of many commitments Scotland has made to ensure that we remain an open, outward-looking country that works to strengthen our partnerships around the world. At UN level, support for the Paris Agreement has been almost universal and looks to be unstoppable. The need for that international cooperation is greater than ever and will be vital if we are to prevent the most serious effects of climate change. \</doc>

IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, with support from the Government of Canada, has completed an $ 80 million financing package for the construction and operation of a new, grid-connected, 50 megawatt wind farm to help diversify the Dominican Republic's energy matrix and ease its dependence on imported fossil fuels. Parques Eolicos del Caribe (Pecasa) will be one of the Dominican Republic's largest wind farms and is expected to reduce greenhouse gases by about 91,000 tons CO2 equivalent per year, which is roughly comparable to taking 20,000 cars off the road. Pecasa is owned by Paris-based Akuo Energy SAS. 'As a country that is particularly sensitive to climate change, the Dominican Republic has both a proactive policy to diversify its energy mix and implement more sustainable economic development, and very abundant resources in terms of renewable energy. Established in the region for many years now, in 2016 we thus decided to open a regional office there to act as a bridgehead for our buoyant growth strategy in the Caribbean. The Pecasa funding ratified today launches this growth cycle, and we are very proud to already have the IFC by our side to support our expansion', says Eric Scotto, CEO and co-founder of Akuo Energy. Fuel imports account for almost 80 percent of the Dominican Republic's energy needs. This dependence has led to high electricity prices, which create a burden on the economy. Like many of its Caribbean neighbors, the Dominican Republic is vulnerable to the environmental impacts associated with fossil fuels and climate change, such as rising sea levels, coral bleaching and changes in the frequency of tropical storms. It has set an ambitious target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2030. 'Pecasa supports the Dominican Republic's goals for ramping up renewable energy with a new, low-carbon power source,' said Luc Grillet, IFC Senior Manager for Central America and the Caribbean. 'The project will help the country's competitiveness and reduce greenhouse gases. IFC looks forward to continuing to support investments in the country's power sector in line with ongoing progress on the National Pact for the Reform of the Power Sector.' Over the past 25 years, the Dominican Republic has seen some of the strongest economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean. Investments in the country's energy sector are crucial to its sustained growth, and to improving Dominicans' standard of living. On average, energy demand has grown by 3.6 percent over the last five years. Located on the country's northern coast, about 260 kilometers from Santo Domingo, Pecasa has a total project cost of $ 125 million and is expected to become operational in the first half of 2019. IFC arranged a financing package which includes $ 18.5 million for IFC's own account, $ 18 million from the Dutch Development Bank (FMO), $ 17 million from the IFC-Canada Climate Change Program (a partnership between the Government of Canada and IFC), $ 15 from million Proparco, the French development finance institution, and $ 11.5 million from the German Investment Corporation (DEG). Pecasa's construction will be made possible thanks to the government of Canada's instrumental contribution, which helped make the financing package viable. 'At COP23 , Canada and the UK launched the Powering Past Coal Alliance for the phase down of coal-fired electricity. Using clean, renewable energy is key to tackling climate change and creating good, middle-class jobs. And the Government of Canada is proud to support this private-sector led initiative which is helping the Dominican Republic reduce its reliance on fossil fuels by adding wind power as an energy source,' said the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change. Pecasa will sell all its energy output to the government-owned power company, Corporacion Dominicana de Empresas Electricas Estatales (CDEEE), through a dollar-denominated power purchase agreement for a 20-year term. This IFC investment complements a $ 358 million program of the World Bank and a group of development partners aimed at improving the Dominican Republic's power grid by reducing energy losses and increasing revenue collections. Addressing the challenge of climate change is a strategic priority for IFC. Since 2005, IFC has invested $ 18.3 billion of its own funds and mobilized an additional $ 11 billion from other investors to finance climate-smart projects across the globe. This includes investments in the Dominican energy sector related to the distribution of liquefied natural gas, and the construction of wind farms and power lines. Since the Dominican Republic became a member of IFC in 1961, IFC has invested more than $ 1 billion in the country's private sector. IFC currently has a $ 384 million portfolio in the Dominican Republic, including $ 172 million mobilized by partner institutions. About the IFC-Canada Climate Change Program The IFC-Canada Climate Change Program promotes private sector financing for clean energy projects and received funding under Canada's fast-start financing to catalyze investments in renewable, low-carbon technologies that would not otherwise happen. The Government of Canada is committed to support climate change action and will deliver $ 2.65 billion between 2015 and 2020 to support developing countries' transition to low carbon economies and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Viewpoint:\~His Majesty King Mohammed VI We have thought it through carefully, and it is now so obvious: it is time to return home. At a time when the kingdom is among the most developed African nations, and when a majority of member states looks forward to our return, we have decided to join our family again - a family we had not really left. In fact, despite having been absent from AU institutions for so many years, our links, which were never severed, have remained strong, and African sister nations have always been able to rely on us. Strong bilateral relations have thus been significantly developed. Since 2000 Morocco has signed nearly 1000 agreements with African countries in various fields of cooperation. By way of comparison, between 1956 and 1999, 515 agreements were signed, whereas 949 agreements have been signed since 2000 - in other words, almost twice as many. During this period I, personally, was keen to give fresh impetus to this action by making more visits to various African subregions. On each of the 46 visits I paid to 25 African countries, numerous agreements were signed in the private sector. My action has been particularly geared towards the field of training, which is at the heart of my country's cooperation with sister nations. This has enabled a number of African students to continue their higher education in Morocco, thanks to the thousands of scholarships given to them. Furthermore, major strategic projects were set up during my visits to these countries. First, I had the pleasure of launching the Africa Atlantic Gas Pipeline Project with His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This project will of course allow natural gas to be transported from gas-producing countries to Europe, but more than that, it will benefit the whole of West Africa. It will, indeed, contribute to creating a regional electricity market and be a substantial source of energy which will help develop industry, improve economic competitiveness and speed up social development. Moreover, it will help build more peaceful bilateral and multilateral relations, and thus create an environment conducive to development and growth. Secondly, as part of projects aimed at improving agricultural productivity and promoting food security and rural development, fertiliser production plants have been set up with both Ethiopia and Nigeria. These projects will benefit the continent as a whole. This is the objective of the initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture, or the AAA Initiative, which we promoted during the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change . As soon as it was launched, the initiative was backed by some 30 African countries. The AAA Initiative is aimed at providing more significant funding for the adaptation of small-scale African agriculture. It will also support the structuring and acceleration of agricultural projects in Africa through four programmes: rational soil management, sustainable management of agricultural water, climate-related risk management and solidarity-based funding for promoters of small projects. Lastly, our ties have also remained strong as far as security and peace are concerned. Since its independence, Morocco has contributed to six UN peacekeeping missions in Africa, engaging thousands of troops in various theatres of operation. Moroccan forces are still present today in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Morocco has also conducted a number of mediations which helped achieve substantial progress towards peace, namely in Libya and the Mano River region. My vision of South-South cooperation is clear and constant: my country shares what it has, without ostentation. Within the framework of clear-sighted collaboration, Morocco - which is a major economic player in Africa - will become a catalyst for shared expansion. We are acting to stop people from living on the fringes of society, with no work, no health care, nowhere to live and no access to education. We are acting so couples, particularly those from mixed marriages - between Moroccans and sub-Saharans - will not be parted. All this constructive action to help migrants has bolstered Morocco's image and strengthened the bonds we had already forged. Some say that, through this commitment, Morocco is seeking to gain leadership in Africa; I tell them that it is to Africa that the kingdom is seeking to give the leadership. As soon as the kingdom becomes a member and is able to contribute to the agenda of activities, its action will, on the contrary, help bring about unity and progress. We participated in the creation of this beautiful pan-African edifice, and we naturally look forward to regaining the place that is ours within it. Morocco has always considered that its strength comes primarily from the integration of the Maghreb subregion; it is, however, clear that the flame of the Arab Maghreb Union has faded, because faith in a common interest has vanished. Today, we regret to see that the Maghreb Union is the least integrated region on the African continent, if not the whole world. Intraregional trade has reached 10% between members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and 19% between countries in the Southern African Development Community, while it is still stagnating at less than 3% between Maghreb countries. Similarly, while ECOWAS countries are moving forward on ambitious integration projects, and ECOWAS is offering a reliable space for the free movement of persons, goods and capital, economic cooperation between Maghreb countries is at a low level. If we do not act by following the example of neighbouring African subregions, the Maghreb Union will crumble due to its chronic incapacity to live up to the ambitions of the Marrakech Treaty, which gave birth to it 28 years ago. All this confirms that Morocco is right to choose Africa. By doing so, my country has opted to share and transfer its know-how; in concrete terms, it is offering to build a safe, solidarity-based future. We enthusiastically invite African nations to join our country's dynamism and to give new impetus to the whole of our continent. It is time for Africa to benefit from Africa's wealth. We must work to enable our land, after decades of looting, to enter an era of prosperity. Admittedly, colonialism is not the sole cause of Africa's problems; however, its negative impact persists. For a long time, we have looked elsewhere to seek help in making a decision, a commitment. Is it not time for this tropism to be stopped? Is it not time to look towards our continent? To consider its cultural wealth, its human potential? Africa should be proud of its resources, its cultural heritage, its spiritual values; and the future should strongly support this natural pride. Africa can and must validate, on its own, its elections and thus endorse its citizens' free choice. It has regulatory tools and legal institutions, such as Constitutional Councils and Supreme Courts, which can settle electoral disputes and appeals. These institutions could be reinforced if need be, but they exist, they are operational. Otherwise, what is the use of having them? Africa is governed today by a new generation of uninhibited leaders. They are working for the stability, political openness, economic development and social progress of their peoples. They are working with determination, resolve and conviction, without caring about being graded or assessed by the West. For several decades, the growth rates in some countries in the North have not exceeded those in some African countries. And yet, these countries with ailing economies, poor social situations and weakening leadership assume the right to impose their development model on us. I repeat: I consider the notion of third-worldism to be outdated. Such practices bear signs of economic opportunism. The respect and benevolence shown to a country should no longer depend on its natural resources and the profit expected. This is the path to solidarity, peace and union chosen by my country. We reaffirm our commitment to the development and prosperity of African citizens. We have the means and the genius; together, we can fulfil our peoples' aspirations. Inspired by the king's speech at the 28th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa \</doc>

\~ The kingdom is taking steps to improve the collection, processing and valorisation of waste. During the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change , which took place in Marrakech in November 2016, the government signed funding agreements with the Dutch Development Bank (FMO) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to enhance solid waste management. While progress has been slow, areas with potential for development include controlled landfills, sorting and valorisation of waste through recycling, composting and energy generation. Nevertheless, the road ahead has various challenges, including how to integrate informal workers, deal with pollution and functionally incentivise the valorisation of waste. However, these issues can be overcome, as illustrated by the variety of solutions deployed on the ground. INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT: The FMO and the EIB signed an agreement during COP22, creating a facility for BMCE Bank to fund initiatives that enhance solid waste-management practices and standards. The deal includes a loan facility of (EURO)20m to support solid waste-management projects as part of a partnership between the FMO and the EIB, each of which is contributing (EURO)10m. In addition, the agreement includes a comprehensive technical assistance package to be provided by the FMO in support of studies on waste management, expert studies for certain projects and the undertaking of a mission for BMCE, its waste-management clients and Moroccan regulators to the Netherlands, to demonstrate the best international waste-management practices. These measures aim to support the government in reaching its waste-management targets, as outlined in the National Solid Waste Programme (Programme National des D\'e9chets M\'e9nagers, PNDM). GOVERNMENT PLANS: The PNDM will contribute to the modernisation of household waste management under the 2008-22 National Strategy for Waste Management and the National Strategy for Sustainable Development frameworks. The targets of these programmes included achieving a professional collection rate of 85% in 2016, 90% in 2020 and 100% in 2030; completion of controlled landfill sites in all urban areas by 2020; rehabilitating or closing down all existing disposal sites by 2020; extending household waste-management master plans to all municipalities and provinces; developing sorting, recycling and reuse to achieve a 20% recycling rate by 2020; and training and raising awareness among all stakeholders. MODERNISATION: In line with the targets of the PNMD, the authorities are working to modernise waste-management practices through the creation of 75 new landfills, along with the rehabilitation or closure of 220 existing disposal sites. However, progress has been slower than anticipated, with the government extending the deadline from 2015 to 2020. "As of April 2017 there were approximately 24 new controlled landfills, with a number of others under way or planned, and existing disposal sites, including uncontrolled ones, being rehabilitated or closed down," Loubna El Abed, head of the department for the valorisation of non-dangerous waste at the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment, told OBG. As of 2016, 85.2% of urban household waste was collected and 26 disposal sites had been rehabilitated or closed, while seven were being closed down, 20 were under construction and 19 remained in the planning stage. The recycling rate stood at 10%. According to local media, an estimated 60% of waste was processed at controlled landfills in 2017. SEGMENT-SPECIFIC ACTION: An important part of waste-management modernisation efforts focuses on adding value through recycling, composting and the production of energy. Following the adoption of the "extended producer responsibility" principle and related instruments such as green taxes included in the National Charter for the Environment and Sustainable Development (Law No. 99-12) published in 2014, the authorities have outlined the types of waste to be developed in coordination with private sector stakeholders, including plastics, batteries, tyres, motor oils and food oils. Some of the products - such as used batteries, motor oils, food oils, paper and cardboard, and agricultural plastics - have already been subject to public-private partnership regulations for the valorisation of waste. "The plastics segment has a green tax, and the tyres and motor oils segments should also get theirs if the related instruments are approved," El Abed told OBG. "In addition, used batteries rely on a system of private sector contributions, whereas food oils, paper and cardboard are self-financed." INDUSTRIAL WASTE: In April 2016 the General Confederation of Moroccan Companies joined the ministries of environment, interior and industry to create the Coalition for Waste Valorisation, a non-profit organisation, to strengthen the segment's legal framework, develop waste chains and waste-management services, and train, fund and raise awareness. Morocco generates 1.6m tonnes of industrial waste per year, of which 21.25%, or 340,000 tonnes, is hazardous. The kingdom can process 300,000 tonnes of hazardous industrial waste; however, some companies mix industrial waste with other types of waste at landfills, complicating the issue. Some businesses are taking action on a local level. For example, Suez Environnement, a French firm operating in Morocco through multiple subsidiaries, provides waste-management services to local companies, municipalities and the Ouled Salah industrial area. POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT: Although the number of waste valorisation initiatives has grown, just 26% of recycled products are derived from landfill waste, according to local media reports. The recycling segments with the highest recovery rates include scrap metal, of which 120% is recycled, meaning more metal waste is recovered than discarded annually. The glass recovery rate is around 92%, paper and cardboard 17.5%, and plastic 8%. In these segments, informal waste collection was valued at Dh165m ((EURO)15.2m) in 2010. Market middlemen made Dh234m ((EURO)21.7m) and wholesalers Dh363m ((EURO)33.6m). In addition to recycling, composting and energy generation hold significant potential. The landfill in Oum Azza, serving 13 municipalities in Rabat, stands out in this regard. Managed by Teodem, the local subsidiary of French firm Pizzorno Environnement, Oum Azza holds the largest waste valorisation centre in the Maghreb region, including two sorting lines and an annual processing capacity of over 850,000 tonnes. Pizzorno Environnement is working with Swiss company El\'e9phant Vert, a producer of biofertilisers and biopesticides, to create compost from green waste. It is also exploring energy generation by tapping into the biogas generated from waste decomposition. Since 2016 the landfill in Fez has supplied electricity to the city through a bioelectric facility and provides one-third of the city's energy needs for public lighting. Organic waste in Morocco represents around 60% of waste - compared to 30% in Europe - indicating a relatively large potential energy source. "However, the biogas subsector requires vast amounts of waste which will lead to transport issues," Manfred Schweda, owner and founder of sustainable energy company Generizon, told OBG. "At the same time, butane gas has become so cheap that many consumers prefer it." Meanwhile, French cement company Lafarge Holcim is set to invest approximately Dh55m ((EURO)5.1m) in a sorting centre that will process 90,000 tonnes per year through mechanical biological treatment and produce alternative fuel from household waste. The fuel produced is expected to power the Bouskoura cement and clinker production unit. CHALLENGES: Challenges remain for the development of waste management. The informal nature of services, especially in collection, remains an issue. Around 3-5% of waste is collected by informal waste pickers, with studies indicating that 7000 people work in this informal industry. Some companies, including Pizzorno Environnement in Oum Azza and Suez Environnement in Mekn\'e8s, have tackled this challenge by incorporating 150 and 170 informal waste pickers, respectively, into the workforce of their landfills and sorting units through cooperative agreements. Dealing with landfill leachate - the liquid from decomposing organic waste - has also proven difficult. Furthermore, it remains unclear how the development of waste valorisation in specific segments will be incentivised, and how revenue from the plastics green tax will be utilised. According to official data, the tax raised Dh200m ((EURO)18.5m) for the National Environment Fund in 2014 alone. However, while the funds were expected to support plastic recycling, as of October 2016 they had yet to be used, generating some uncertainty. El Abed told local media in late 2016 that a performance contract to establish a plastics valorisation ecosystem, based on funding from the green tax and the Industrial Development Fund, had yet to be signed. No further progress on this had been reported by early 2018. \</doc>

At a car factory in this city named after Toyota, the usual robots with their swinging arms are missing. Instead, workers intently fit parts into place by hand with craftsmanship-like care. The big moment on the assembly line comes when two bulbous yellow tanks of hydrogen are rolled over and delicately fitted into each car`s underside. While much of the world is going gung-ho for electric vehicles to help get rid of auto emissions and end reliance on fossil fuels, Japan`s top automaker Toyota Motor Corp is banking on hydrogen. Toyota sells about 10 million vehicles a year around the world. It has sold only about 4,000 Mirai fuel cell vehicles since late 2014, roughly half of them outside Japan. The Mirai, which means "future," is not cheap at $57,500, but Toyota loses money on each one. Still, the company`s goal is to sell 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles a year by about 2020. Hydrogen fuel cells don`t suffer the EVs` main drawback of limited range. The Tesla Model S can go about 300 miles (480 kilometers) on a single charge, although that varies depending on driving conditions, and that`s quite a distance for an EV. Other models run out of juice quicker, at about half that, because the longer the range, generally the heavier the batteries. And electric vehicles usually take hours to charge. The Mirai can run for 502 kilometers per fueling, under U.S. EPA conditions, and fuels as quickly as a regular car. Toyota`s chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, believes hydrogen is an ideal, stable fuel for a future low-carbon society. "In this light, hydrogen holds tremendous potential," Uchiyamada, known as "the father of the Prius," the world`s top-selling hybrid car, said during a tour of the factory. "Hydrogen doesn`t exist in the natural world on its own, but you can create hydrogen from various materials," he said. The Prius turned out to be a good bet for Toyota. The Mirai could be the same. But not everyone shares Uchiyamada`s enthusiasm for hydrogen. A fuel cell mixes hydrogen with the oxygen in the air to generate electricity that can power a motor. Producing the highly flammable gas and getting it into the vehicles requires energy. Ultimately, the idea is to convert energy from renewables like wind and solar power into hydrogen, or even make hydrogen from sewage waste. Unlike a gas-powered internal combustion engine, the only byproducts from a fuel cell are electricity, heat and water. There are no emissions of pollutants that can cause global warming. Yet the energy unleashed is powerful: Hydrogen is the fuel that sends NASA rockets into space. So fuel cells could be used to power cars, trains, buses, trucks and forklifts, and to provide electricity and heat for homes. Detroit-based General Motors Co, Mercedes-Benz of Germany, Japan`s Honda Motor Co and Hyundai of South Korea have also developed fuel cell vehicles that are on the roads in extremely limited numbers. The global stock of electric vehicles will soon surpass 2 million, according to the International Energy Agency. It`s projected to climb to between 9 million-20 million by 2020. Fuel cell vehicles are scarcely a presence. The Hydrogen Council, made up of 28 companies that are promoting hydrogen fuel, said in a report this week that it expects hydrogen to power about 10 to 15 million cars and 500,000 trucks by 2030. It also forecasts it will be widely used for industries, heating and power and power storage. The group met this week in Bonn, on the sidelines of the COP23 U.N. meeting on the environment. Toyota and other manufacturers pursuing hydrogen fuel cells face some significant hurdles. Japan has an ample 28,000 EV charging stations but only 92 hydrogen fueling stations, and they are costly to build. Hydrogen is viewed as potentially hazardous: the 1937 Hindenberg disaster, when 36 people died when the hydrogen-fueled airship caught fire and crashed, ended an earlier era of hydrogen-powered passenger travel. A fill-up with hydrogen takes about as long as at a gas pump, while EV charging takes about 30 minutes using special equipment for quick charging. Regular charging can take hours. "I`m not claiming that hydrogen will replace any form of energy, but it will find its place in the world energy mix," Benoit Potier, chief executive of French industrial gas company Air Liquide, and a chair of the Hydrogen Council, said in a telephone interview. Air Liquide has been working on producing, storing and distributing hydrogen fuel for more than four decades. Potier says he expects costs for making the gas will fall as its use becomes more widespread. In one step toward widening use of hydrogen, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, an aerospace, motorcycle and ship manufacturer, is developing a technology to make hydrogen in Australia using "brown coal," peat or low-grade coal for shipment to Japan in tankers it plans to make. Not all Japanese automakers are sold on the idea. Manabu Satou, general manager of technology at Toyota`s rival Nissan Motor Co., finds it an "utter mystery" why anyone would be so set on fuel cells when China, the world`s biggest car market, is going for conventional EVs. "If we are talking about a form of great energy like hydrogen, then why not just go all the way to a nuclear car?" said Satou, whose company leads in EV sales with its popular Leaf compact. Ryuichi Kino, who has written about electric vehicles and energy, views fuel cell vehicles as an excessively expensive, futuristic technology. "If it focuses too much on fuel cells, Japan is going to end up super-ultra-Galapagos," he said, alluding to the secluded Pacific islands that are home to unique species that don`t exist elsewhere. For most automakers, fuel cells are an area just for research, while EVs already are commercialized, Kino said. But he allows that a technological breakthrough could bring a hydrogen-based sea change in the global race toward automotive "electrification." "Winners could become losers, and losers could become winners. It`s still anyone`s game," Kino said. 2017 Global Data Point. \</doc>

The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Province of Limburg have signed a loan agreement to support investments in regional sustainability projects. The EUR 30 million loan will be guaranteed under the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), part of the Investment Plan for Europe of the European Commission. The loan will be channelled to the Limburgs Energie Fonds (LEF), a fund established by the Province of Limburg and managed by Finquiddity, that invests in small to medium sized projects in and for Limburg in the areas of reduction of CO2 emissions, removal of asbestos in buildings and circular economy initiatives. The investments financed will contribute to EU priority objectives and will support the 2020 Climate Action Objectives. 'Smaller and local projects will be key to upholding the Paris Agreement, and innovative ways to finance these will be more and more needed. This includes using public money in the form of loans and guarantees, rather than subsidies.' said EIB Vice-President Pim van Ballekom. 'Combating the effects and causes of climate change should be high on everyone's agenda and we are very happy that, thanks to EFSI, we can support the Province of Limburg in this initiative.' Daan Prevoo, regional minister for Sustainablity and Energy in the Province of Limburg added: 'In addition to the environmental and economic advantages, LEF has also made substantial progress with regards to trade and the labour market. Hundreds of jobs have already been created through almost 30 projects that have been realised thanks to LEF-investments. A very promising prospect, given the fact that many projects are still in the application phase!' Jyrki Katainen, Vice-President of the European Commission, added: 'Investments in energy-efficiency projects and the circular economy are at the core of the Investment Plan for Europe's objectives. In EFSI 2.0, 40% of investments should go to projects that are helping to reach the COP 21 climate goals. The fund set up by the Province of Limburg will lead to a greater number of sustainable investments and jobs in the region. With COP 23 still underway, this project is showing the way for climate-friendly growth.' Jan-Willem Konig of the Limburg Energie Fonds (LEF) observed: 'This commitment from the EIB endorses all the hard work we have put in over the last few years to build the fund to what it is now. With these funds the LEF will boost its financing capacity, allowing us to accelerate the innovative sustainable energy market.' The LEF will support on average around 10 new projects that will help to reduce CO2 emissions each year. Climate action is one of the main priorities of the 'Juncker Plan' and so far, some EUR 9.6 billion has been made available for sustainable projects in the energy sector.

Five months ago, Trump quickly cemented his legacy as the country's worst-ever president by inexplicably starting the process to withdraw from the Paris climate accords. With even war-torn Syria now signing the agreement, the leadership of every world country has announced its intent to tackle the existential threat posed by human-caused climate change, except the United States. It's the US vs. the rest of the world, as Syria agrees to sign Paris climate accord HYPERLINK https://t.co/Q1tkxuiHaspic.twitter.com/hnV2wHmLHL https://t.co/Q1tkxuiHaspic.twitter.com/hnV2wHmLHL - Akshat Rathi (@AkshatRathi) November 7, 2017 The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 Most Americans admit the mistake of 2016 However, a year later, Americans are already recognizing this error. Trump's approval rating is around 38%, and has not touched 40% in over six months. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats enjoy an 8-10% lead over their Republican opponents. Those polling results translated into a landslide Democratic victory in the 2017 elections last week. The clearest result came in Virginia's gubernatorial election, in which Republican candidate Ed Gillespie ran a Trump-like culture war campaign. He also took the standard Trump administration line on climate change, acknowledging only that humans play some undetermined role while supporting America's withdrawal from the Paris climate accords and opposing all policies to address the problem. Gillespie's campaign was praised by Trump and Steve Bannon, until he lost the race by 9%. Translating the shift to election wins will be difficult Last week's election results showed that Trump has strongly mobilized Democrats to vote, even in off-year elections. In Virginia state House of Delegates elections, Democratic candidates similarly beat their Republican opponents by more than 9% in total votes. However, due to gerrymandering and geographical disadvantages (Democrats tend to cluster in cities), unless recounts change the results of close races, Democrats will only hold 49% of the seats in the Virginia House. That structural disadvantage holds across the country. Estimates are that Democrats need to beat Republicans by 7-8% in overall congressional votes in order to win a bare majority of the seats. With a current lead of 8-10% in the generic congressional ballot, they have a chance to take the House in 2018, depending on what happens over the next year. We saw that same structural advantage hand Trump the presidency in 2016. While he lost the popular vote by over 2% (nearly 3 million votes), Trump won the Electoral College, as was the case in 2000 with Bush v. Gore (Gore won the popular vote by a half million votes). America has a bizarrely unbalanced election system in which people who live in sparsely populated areas (predominantly rural Republicans) are disproportionately represented in the government. It will take a landslide election for Democrats to overcome that structural disadvantage, but last week's results demonstrate that Trump and the Republican Party have become so unpopular, it very well might happen in the 2018 and 2020 elections. That would give Democrats the opportunity to undo Republican gerrymandering after the 2020 census. The Supreme Court is also currently considering a critical gerrymandering case. Regarding the presidency, betting markets currently give Trump approximately a 35-40% chance of winning a second term ( which seems overly bullish ), and Democrats a 55% chance of retaking the White House in 2020. If that happens, the next president can quickly begin reversing the damage the Trump administration has done to American climate policies and its standing in the world. America's divide is on display at COP23 At the UN climate talks in Bonn, the 'We Are Still In' coalition of US states, cities, tribes, and businesses has been given a US Climate Action Center. Meanwhile, the US government for the first time doesn't have a pavilion, and the Trump administration perversely plans to promote fossil fuels and nuclear power in a presentation at the meeting. As Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) noted, If you show up at a climate conference to talk about coal, you're likely to be ignored. I think the We Are Still In delegation will get more attention than the executive branch. We've gone from the indispensable leader to being the only country not engaged in climate change. Many people in Congress are troubled not only from a climate standpoint but a geopolitical standpoint. China is happy to take that leadership from us. Indeed, China is stepping into the global leadership role that the United States has shrunk from under Trump's "America First" platform. Chinese carbon pollution is approaching a peak 15-20 years ahead of schedule, and its leaders relish the opportunity to take America's place as a global leader. America Last, for now Americans embrace the notion that their country is the greatest in the world. But what does it say that the United States is the nation that is responsible for the largest fraction of overall carbon pollution and global warming over the past 200 years, and is the only country in the world that refuses to take steps to address the existential threat we created? That lack of responsibility and willingness to protect the well-being of future generation is not the behavior of a great nation. However, that is almost exclusively a Republican Party position, and the party and its president are currently supported by fewer than 40% of Americans. Most of its leaders seem unwilling to reverse the party's slide toward anti-climate culture wars-based isolationism, but with accelerating climate change and a growing population of non-whites, these are positions that will cost them elections. As we saw last week, the 'Trump base' is relatively small, and structural advantages won't be enough to withstand landslide elections. America's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement won't take effect until the day after the 2020 elections. The next president can quickly reverse that withdrawal, making America the last country to sign on, but resuming its global leadership role. While the Trump administration has exceeded everyone's fears in its anti-environment, anti-climate actions, the damage is temporary. While the American majority fights to wrest control of its government away from the isolationist climate-denying minority, the rest of the world (literally) is moving forward to tackle this problem. \</doc>

The Inter-American Development Bank Group, principally through its private-sector arm IDB Invest, and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy of the UK (BEIS) announced today they are partnering to create the UK Sustainable Infrastructure Program (SIP). The announcement was made during a joint side event in the context of the COP 23 climate conference in Bonn, Germany. BEIS is expected to make an initial contribution of approximately GBP177 million to the program, which constitutes the largest partnership effort of the IDB Group and the Government of the UK in Latin America and the Caribbean. SIP will support IDB Group efforts to accelerate sustainable infrastructure development in the region by catalyzing private sector investment for the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of the Paris Agreement. 'Infrastructure is crucial to economic growth and development, but there is an infrastructure investment gap in the region that needs to be closed,' said IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno. 'We welcome this partnership as an excellent example of how to mobilize resources to finance infrastructure that is sustainable, low carbon and climate resilient.' An innovative aspect of the SIP is that can provide a wide range of instruments - including grants for technical cooperation and blended finance for loans, equity and guarantees - to fully address barriers to private investment, and respond flexibly to borrowing countries' priorities and needs. Claire Perry, UK Minister of State for Climate Change and Industry in a recorded address said: 'I'm pleased to announce the UK's latest climate finance funding commitment through a GBP177 million investment into the new UK Sustainable Infrastructure Program in Latin America. This will be delivered by our partners at the Inter-American Development Bank with the UK fund spending bilaterally in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru - four countries with big ambitions on climate action. My colleagues in Latin America have made great strides in meeting their ambitious NDC commitments, and I am proud of the work that the UK has undertaken to support them to achieve this.'

Ennshafen - RAG, Ennshafen OO GmbH and Iveco Austria today opened Austria's first liquefied natural gas (LNG) filling station at Ennshafen port as part of the Zukunftsforum LNG conference. The event was attended by the Deputy Governor of Upper Austria, Michael Strugl, as well as other prominent guests from the worlds of politics and business. RAG completed construction of Austria's first LNG filling station in a period of just a few weeks, and it is now open to the public. 'This is a milestone in establishing LNG as an environmentally friendly fuel for goods vehicles, and RAG is making a highly important contribution to achieving Austria's climate targets. Thanks to our filling station, LNG has finally arrived in the country,' commented Markus Mitteregger, RAG's Chief Executive Officer, on offering a competitive, clean and affordable alternative to conventional fuels for goods transportation by road. 'The Ennshafen logistics hub in central Upper Austria is the ideal choice for the site of the country's first LNG filling station. Port handling and a high density of goods vehicle traffic go hand in hand. As a Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) hub, Ennshafen offers the infrastructure required for the first step in establishing this new fuel in Austria. Further expansion phases are already in preparation. This is a key step in developing the waterway transportation chain, which will enable us to continue to meet high standards of environmental friendliness in the coming decades,' commented Werner Auer, Managing Director of Ennshafen OO GmbH, highlighting the advantages of the Ennshafen port site. Deputy Governor of Upper Austria Michael Strugl added: 'Groundbreaking energy solutions are essential for a modern business location. Upper Austria is prioritising this with the 'Energy' action area in its 'Innovative Upper Austria 2020' economic and research programme. The purpose of the programme is to support the optimal development of energy infrastructure and energy research in terms of flexible systems, and to adapt to continually increasing demands, especially with regard to integrating renewable energy sources. With the first LNG filling station in the country, Upper Austria has demonstrated that practical implementation of this programme is a priority for us. The province has shown once again that it is leading the way internationally, with a view to boosting its position as a high-quality business location in the long term.' RAG has been using an Iveco Stralis NP - the first truck to run on LNG in Austria - since April 2017. Further Iveco Stralis NPs were delivered to selected customers in September 2017. More than 2,000 trucks of this type are on the road in Europe. As IVECO Business Director Karl-Martin Studener explained: 'The Iveco Stralis Natural Power truck is already playing an active role in environmentally friendly goods transportation. Zero fine particulates and 70% less nitrogen oxide bear witness to that. Significantly lower natural gas consumption in comparison with diesel means reduced carbon dioxide emissions, and also helps transport contractors to optimise logistic costs.' LNG made in Austria - from domestic natural gas Approximately 12 tonnes of LNG can be kept in storage at the Ennshafen site at present - equivalent to the amount required to refuel between 60 and 90 trucks. RAG delivers natural gas using its own LNG tankers. Some of the gas comes from RAG's gas reservoirs in Austria, and is processed at the company's LNG plant in Gampern, Upper Austria. Currently, about two tonnes of LNG a day is produced there, which can then be used at the Ennshafen LNG filling station. This is enough to refuel 10-15 LNG-powered trucks a day. 'The potential for the future is significantly greater - this is reflected in developments in Germany and throughout Europe. That is why we are planning to expand our own LNG production, in order to increase the availability of Austrian-made LNG. We also plan to open further LNG filling stations on major transport routes in Tyrol, Upper Austria, Styria and the Vienna area,' Markus Mitteregger explained. What is LNG Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been converted to a fluid state by cooling it to a temperature of around -160-degreeC. The expansion ratio of natural gas from liquid to gaseous form is 1:600, meaning that large volumes of energy can be transported and stored as LNG. It can be produced in Austria or transported to customers in specially designed road, rail and sea tankers. As well as being easy to transport and store, LNG offers another significant benefit: it is very economical and efficient. As highly pure natural gas that consists of almost 100% methane, it has an average gross calorific value of about 10.0 kWh per cubic meter of gas or 13.7 kWh per kilogram. Advantages of trucks that run on LNG 95% reduction in fine particulates Over 70% reduction in nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2) No AdBlue/catalytic convertor needed LNG technically mature for use in industry and heavy goods vehicles, and available for the long term Using LNG as a fuel reduces noise emissions by about 50% Infrastructure is under implementation along the LNG Blue Corridors - principle routes for LNG heavy goods vehicles in Europe Zukunftsforum LNG -LNG for the future conference LNG - fuel of the future protecting our climate and environment The Paris Climate Change Conference set the goal of securing supplies of sustainable and affordable energy for the future, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency. This enormous challenge will only be met through huge collaborative efforts. A major focus is road traffic, which generates around 45% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Medium- and long-term forecasts predict growing road traffic volumes, especially heavy goods traffic. As a result, numerous EU initiatives, such as the LNG Blue Corridors project, are promoting increased use of environmentally friendly, low-emission natural gas and LNG as a transportation fuel. In the future, gas produced from renewable sources (biogas and gas generated from wind and solar, using power to gas) might also be used in addition to conventional natural gas. So ready supplies of gas will be available for use as a fuel for the long term. 'Gas is the energy source of the future, and its use as a fuel for trucks underlines its advantages. There are large reserves of gas worldwide, it is environmentally friendly and inexpensive, and now it can even be produced renewably. As the fourth-largest gas storage operator in Europe, RAG can guarantee reliable gas supplies. We are also channelling significant efforts into projects to manufacture gas using renewable energy,' Mitteregger pointed out, emphasising the high degree of supply security offered by gas. RAG is closely involved in research and development on the manufacture of renewable gas, as part of two projects supported by the Austrian Climate and Energy Fund A win-win situation all round: benefits for the environment, transportation companies and consumers LNG-powered trucks are already firmly established in the USA and China. There are LNG filling stations in a number of European countries, and now these environmentally friendly vehicles have arrived in Austria. Until now LNG has primarily been used to transport natural gas in large quantities across the world's oceans, without the need for pipelines. Recent years have seen the discovery of its potential as a fuel for transportation of goods by road and sea. 'LNG is a global megatrend,' said Timm Kehler, Managing Director of Zukunft Erdgas. 'The available quantities of LNG and its applications are both growing at breathtaking speed, fundamentally changing not only the gas industry, but the entire energy supply sector and transportation worldwide. This presents markets and market participants with new challenges as far as taking advantage of the opportunities and developing lines of business is concerned. Close collaboration between the gas industry, manufacturers, transportation firms and policymakers is vital, because we will only be able to harness the potential of LNG and effectively position it as an alternative to conventional truck fuel by working together. The first steps in introducing a new technology are certainly the most difficult. But the fact that they are being taken nevertheless, for instance here in Upper Austria, is very encouraging and means we can be optimistic about further developments.' Above all, LNG makes an important contribution to security of supply. Natural gas is temporarily stored in underground storage facilities, so that it is available whenever it is needed - regardless of the time of day or year, or the weather. 'Transportation plays an essential role in a functioning economy. This means it is all the more important to make transportation environmentally friendly and forward-looking. We are convinced that our natural gas is playing a key role in this,' Mitteregger added, underlining the importance of gas for the future of transportation. 'RAG is investing in pioneering LNG infrastructure, driving forward this groundbreaking, environmentally friendly development. Commissioning our first LNG filling station at Ennshafen port is an important initial milestone in this process,' Mitteregger concluded.

This important goal of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris will only be achieved by means of huge collaborative efforts. For years, RAG has been working on innovative solutions that take account of changes in energy policies and the situation in the energy industry. The company has been producing natural gas in Austria for over 80 years. For a number of years now, RAG has been carrying out research into power to gas technology. This should make it possible to convert excess wind and solar energy into gas, which can be stored in natural underground gas reservoirs. Energy sources that take the form of gas can make an important contribution to meeting climate protection targets, and have a comprehensive range of uses - they can be used for heating, for transportation and in industry. About Ennshafen OO GmbH Ennshafen is not only Austria's newest public port, but also its most modern. The port and neighbouring business parks in Upper Austria and Lower Austria form the largest contiguous industrial zone in the Upper Danube region, with an area of over 350 hectares. As a result of extensive investment in infrastructure and state-of-the-art technology, the port has become a logistics hub for three different modes of transportation, and an important business location for the Enns-Perg-Amstetten area, providing employment for more than 2,000 people.

\~ As Morocco's main urban centres become increasingly congested in the face of population growth, economic development and migration from rural areas, the need for improved urban transport systems has become more acute. Authorities have reacted by ramping up investment policy interventions in recent years. Notable projects include new or extended tram systems in Casablanca and Rabat, the rollout of improved bus services in Casablanca and the introduction of the continent's first bike-share scheme in Marrakech. GRAND CASABLANCA: Among the directives that will underpin the development of urban transport in the country's commercial capital is Casablanca's 2015-20 Strategic Development Plan (SDP). The comprehensive scheme aims to elevate Casablanca to a well-connected financial centre that is also a top destination for travel and living. Four pillars drive the strategy: quality of life; connectivity and mobility; economic, educational and administrative excellence; and leisure and entertainment. From a total budget of Dh33.6bn ((EURO)3.1bn), Dh27bn ((EURO)2.5bn) has been allocated to mobility and infrastructure. In addition to the tram and bus network projects, the plan envisages 15 park-and-ride facilities, the realignment of key road junctions and a video surveillance centre to regulate the city's traffic. TRAM NETWORK: Casablanca's first tramline, T1, was inaugurated by King Mohammed VI in December 2012, following three years of construction. A further investment of Dh4.15bn ((EURO)384.3m) was made to the city's tram system in 2017, including the extension of T1, the continued construction of T2, and preparatory works for two additional lines, T3 and T4. Construction of T2 started in January 2016, with platforms installed along 15 km of the line's 17-km route, and rails laid along 7 km by the end of the year. The installation of electricity substations is already well under way, and the first carriages were delivered in August 2017, with additional planned shipments set to follow every two months until the end of 2018. Engie Ineo of France and Engie Cofely Maroc were awarded contracts for a combined $52m in December 2016 to provide equipment for the extended T1 and T2 lines. This includes the installation of signalling equipment on both lines, CCTV, intercoms and public address systems, as well as access control and fire-detection systems. The target date for T2 to become fully operational was set for October 2018. According to a report by Global Mass Transit, the four-line tram network will eventually cover a total of 105 km. The T3 line will span 14 km from Lahraouyine to Gare Casa Port, while the T4 line will run 14 km to connect Mohammed VI Avenue to Sidi Ma\'e2rouf. The main work on the third and fourth lines is expected to be completed in 2021 and 2022, respectively. CHANGES UNDER WAY: Concluding a selection process that began 12 months prior, in June 2017 R\'e9gie Autonome des Transports Parisiens of France was selected to operate and maintain the city's tramlines from 2017 to 2029. The three candidates vying for the job were RATP Dev, Transdev of France, and West Midlands Travel of the UK in partnership with Alsa Transport of Spain and National Railways Office (Office National des Chemins de Fer, ONCF). Operation and maintenance is a grand undertaking, as traffic on Casablanca's tramlines amounted to 36m passengers in 2016, and the figure is only expected to grow. In 2017 the price of a disposable tram ticket was increased to Dh8 ((EURO)0.74) in order to encourage the uptake of rechargeable tickets, which cost Dh6 ((EURO)0.56) for an unlimited journey. However, ticket prices continue to be subsidised by the municipal authorities to the tune of around 40%, which amounted to a total of Dh103m ((EURO)9.5m) in 2016. Efforts are under way to replace the funds for subsidised tickets with advertising revenues. Further increases in ticket tariffs may be warranted once the new lines become operational. INTERCITY RAIL: The Rabat-Sal\'e9 tramway that links the two cities entered into service in May 2011. The network currently consists of two lines, extending 19 km and counting 31 stops with capacity for 120,000 a day. Work began in January 2017 to extend line 2 by 2.4 km from the Moulay Youssef terminus, and by 4.6 km at the Sal\'e9 end. These works entail some Dh1.4bn ((EURO)129.6m) in investment and are scheduled for completion by mid-2019. It is projected that these extensions will allow for additional capacity of 50,000 passengers per day. In total, some 29 km of line extensions, financed by investments of Dh5.6bn ((EURO)518.6m), are foreseen by 2022. The network is eventually set to include a link to the future ONCF-Agdal high-speed rail system, with plans to connect the city of Temara for the first time. TAKING THE BUS: In contrast to the ultra-modern tram system, the bus network - which still forms the backbone of the kingdom's urban transport system - is widely viewed as beset with operational challenges. This is due in part to the proliferation of informal bus services, which do not necessarily meet the standards of their officially provided counterparts. In the face of these challenges, authorities are trying to improve the service. For example, a renewed Urban Transport Plan for the Rabat-Sal\'e9-Temara area is expected in the first half of 2018, succeeding a call for tender for its provision. Moreover, following the awarding of the operation of Casablanca's tramlines in late 2017, local development company Casa Transport launched a tender process for operation of the city's bus network from 2019 onward, when the concession of the current operator, M'dina Bus, is due to expire. For its part, M'dina Bus launched Morocco's first-ever electric bus, called M'dinaEbus in late 2016. In accordance with Casablanca's SDP, Casa Transport foresees the development of two additional high-quality bus routes extending 24 km. Such rapid transit solutions - known locally as the bus \'e0 haut niveau de service - have already been successfully pioneered in Marrakech, but they have yet to be rolled out extensively in the country's other principal urban centres. MANAGING TRAFFIC: Alongside investing in public transport as a way to encourage people to leave their cars at home, Morocco's urban authorities are also taking steps to optimise traffic management so that congestion can be mitigated even as the total number of cars on the road continues to increase. Road traffic in Casablanca alone increased by 3.5% in 2016, for example. In early 2017 the Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Logistics launched a new national travel mobile application, MarRoute. This provides commuters and passengers with the latest news and information regarding traffic and road conditions across the country. The application is free to download and populated by announcements by municipal governments, but it is also designed to be a two-way participatory service for users to share their traffic concerns, thereby contributing to the quality of information available both to the authorities and to other road users. Since early 2016 a Dh460m ((EURO)42.6m) video surveillance system has been in operation in Casablanca, both as a security measure and to help regulate traffic. It consists of 760 CCTV cameras, 220 km of fibre-optic wiring, two central stations and 22 mobile stations. The system will be integrated with existing video surveillance systems on the tramway, at the ports and at airports, as well as in some commercial establishments. A further Dh520m ((EURO)48.2m) of investment has been allocated to traffic-regulation measures under the SDP. This includes the Dh15m ((EURO)1.4m), 2466-sq-metre video surveillance building located at the Casablanca police headquarters, which is set to serve as the nucleus of the traffic monitoring system. ON YOUR BIKE: Morocco marked its hosting of the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change event with the launch of Medina Bike, Africa's first bike-sharing scheme, in December 2016. Some 300 bikes were made available across 10 docking stations around central Marrakech. Passes can be bought by the day, week or year for Dh50 ((EURO)4.63), Dh150 ((EURO)13.89) and Dh500 ((EURO)46.30), respectively. The concept was developed with the UN Development Organisation and promoted by Morocco's Ministry of Environment, with an international tender launched to secure the required equipment. Smoove of France was awarded the contract in partnership with Estates Vision, a local company. LOOKING AHEAD: While demographic and economic pressures are likely to lead to further traffic congestion, maintaining the momentum created by COP22 in November 2016 is crucial to ensuring Morocco's cities are suitably equipped with public transport options. Additional initiatives will likely be necessary to provide financial and operational sustainability over the medium to long term, and ensure that public efforts such as the tram networks and Medina Bike spur more innovation over time. Moreover, it will likely be necessary to extend investments beyond the main cities to improve public transport systems in secondary centres, where an increasing number of Moroccans are choosing to live. These developments should help the country achieve its carbon emission reduction targets, while improving the quality of life for inhabitants in urban centres. \</doc>

The pace of change is rapid. A growing percentage of investable assets are now believed to incorporate ESG factors. These assets have grown an estimated 33% in the US alone since 2014, according to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investments.1 Moreover, a striking 75% of European and US investors plan to make low-carbon or climate related investments, a Q3 2016 HSBC Sustainable Financing survey found. In recent years more investors have become involved in this space. People are realising that green financing makes sense." reports Jean-Marc Mercier, Co-Head of Debt Capital Markets. "ESG is really coming up and becoming a more mainstream product." "We are well and truly out of incubation and into a rapid growth phase," adds Victoria Clarke, Head of Sustainable Bonds, EMEA. The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, known as COP 21, played a significant role in this blossoming of the market. "It probably woke up the private sector," Mercier believes. "Now there are significant numbers of entities using sustainable finance." COP 21 required the 175 signatories to the Paris Agreement in April 2016, (although this number has now reached 195 signatories), to develop plans ("~Independent Nationally Determined Contributions') to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. For example, China has already published guidelines for a "~Green Financial System' and plans to introduce a carbon tax by 2020. This process seems to have influenced governments to start issuing green bonds. "The size and credibility of sovereign issues is bringing private capital into sustainable finance and exactly meets the call from investors for increased diversity of credits, tenors and projects," comments Clarke. "There is a fantastic dynamic to the market," Mercier judges. "It is vibrant. We have new issuers, new investors - more diversity." He looks for another year of growth in 2017 as a decline might undermine confidence in what is still a "nascent" area. The consensus for global green bond new issue volume this year among analysts is around USD130bn, Clarke notes "" though she cites initial forecasts as high as the ratings agency Moody's USD200bn2. Reaching the consensus mark would represent double-digit growth on 2016's USD100bn. "That would be a nice step on the previous year," affirms Clarke, who describes the market's strong "~hockey stick'-shaped growth curve as "exactly what you'd want to see from a young but promising new market". A few snapshots from Mercier's global itinerary indicate the growing momentum in sustainable finance. "I met a client in New York last week and the first question was on the environment. That would never have happened in the past. But after the FSB Task Force [on Climate-related Financial Disclosures - TCFD] issuers will listen," he recalls. At the end of 2016 the TCFD, convened by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) a year earlier, recommended a set of voluntary climate-related disclosures for companies and other entities that make financial filings. "As a private sector solution to a market issue, the Task Force has focused on the practical, material disclosures investors want and which all capital-raising companies can compile," FSB Chair and Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney commented. Mercier shares similar anecdotes from events in Spain and the Gulf. At May's Third Instituto de Credito Oficial (ICO) Sustainable Bonds Forum in Madrid, which HSBC sponsored, "the room was absolutely packed." In the forum's opening speech Spain's Secretary of State for the Economy and Business Support, Irene Garrido, affirmed that "the ever increasing presence of this type of financial instrument, linked to environmental or social objectives, goes to show that our society is increasingly demanding that economic growth and development be accompanied by the sustainability of economic progress; of the participation of citizens in the development benefits and the equitable distribution of them; and of respect for the environment". Corporate push Equally, "everyone was listening" when Mercier cited corporate green bonds by the energy-related duo EdF and Repsol at recent meetings in the United Arab Emirates. The emergence of corporate green bonds is a particularly notable development, he believes. While multi-lateral development banks (MBDs) such as the European Investment Bank and the World Bank pioneered the green bond format "" "they are natural market leaders as this is in their DNA," Mercier observes "" it has now expanded to reach an increasingly diverse range of issuers, including industrial companies with substantial carbon footprints to manage. Issuing green bonds whose proceeds they commit to investments in environmentally-friendly plant and equipment (or in retro-fitting existing assets to increase efficiency) is doubly valuable, he notes. For one thing, it enables companies to meet the increasingly ESG-conscious expectations of their consumers and other stakeholders. For example, a 40-nation poll by Pew Research Centre in 2015 found a majority in every country views climate change as a serious problem and a global median of 54% believing it is a very serious problem.3 For another, green bonds enable companies to reduce their climate-related risk "" precisely their new area of disclosure under the TCFD recommendations. "They care about this and it is what their clients and investors want. This is why green financing has seen such growth," Mercier argues. "Visionary" companies that have already issued green bonds and altered their information flow to highlight environmental impacts for their investor reporting, have stolen a march on the competition. They will be especially well positioned for the TCFD era, he notes. Mercier also dismisses charges that issuers receive no premium for undertaking green bonds. He considers the product's ability to attract investors who may never have bought an issuer's debt previously a form of premium, and notes that green new issues tend to be sold at less of a discount than those on non-green offerings Landmarks ahead While the arrival of sovereign issuers of green bonds (HSBC arranged the first offering in this category "" EUR750m for the Republic of Poland in December 2016) is clearly a watershed for the market, new landmarks still lie ahead. "It is likely that we'll see more sovereigns in the next 12 months, with many now making public statements of interest or releasing green bond related country specific guidelines, China, India and Brazil for example." Clarke comments. She also sees continued significant potential for sub-sovereign entities like cities, regions and provinces to make use of sustainable finance. "They all are spending money on sustainable projects and projects to enhance society's wellbeing. We just need to get them to fund in green and social bond form so that they can show investors and the market what they are doing." In addition, new MDBs and regional development banks continue to enter the market. Notably, the New Development Bank established by Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa began its activity in capital markets with a CNY3bn green bond "" the first by an international institution onshore in China "" in July 2016.4 MDBs were also the driving force behind the Green Bond Principles (GBPs) "" a set of undertakings co-ordinated by the International Capital Market Association that govern the market and provide forums for debating. Mercier characterises the GBPs as a "very useful group between us, issuers and investors." Even so, Clarke emphasises the need for further education of potential issuers. This would reassure them "that the green bond format is not as restrictive as some believe it to be". Examples include there being no requirement to segregate funds as issuers can use the "~earmarking' method, while the GBPs ask them to report annually until full allocation - not daily or monthly as some may believe. Building blocks Sustainable finance is far from limited to plain senior unsecured green bonds. While these represent the highest-profile part of the market, particularly since France's EUR7bn green government bond (OAT) in January, the green bond category alone also includes green asset-backed securities (ABS), green covered bonds, green equity-linked notes, green hybrid securities and green subordinated capital. All of these instruments have important roles in building out the field, Clarke stresses. "I am not biased, and encourage everything since the market needs diversification. With TenneT and TSKB we were excited to help broaden this market and we believe there is so much potential still to tap." In March Dutch electricity firm TenneT issued the first-ever green hybrid5, while Turkey's Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi issued the first sustainable Tier 2 subordinated offering6. HSBC was joint lead manager on both transactions - a EUR1bn perpetual bond and a USD300m 10-year bond, respectively. "We can tailor structures relevant for issuers and their funding needs, so we encourage everything that can be credible in green/social/sustainable," Clarke adds, noting that "plenty of sustainable investment projects are not yet coming to market in green bond format". Greening the economy The rise of sustainable finance offers banks and other market players a chance to boost their somewhat tarnished standing, Mercier suggests. "This is very exciting for the industry. It is an opportunity to change the image that was ours after the [global financial] crisis by helping to green the whole economy." A further spur to the field would be capital relief or other incentives to banks on their lending to green and socially-beneficial projects. "That would be a key vector of change," Mercier believes. Clarke is cautious over incentives that would involve "rigid standards and controls", but emphasises the value of public policy statements of support for sustainable finance and guidance structures, such as the ICMA Green Bond Principles7 and Social Bond Guidance8. The UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that countries adopted in 2015 have also impacted the market positively, she notes. "From water management and waste minimisation to smart cities, the SDGs have got investors and issuers talking about the very broad areas that all have their place within sustainable finance, and have shown that they can be innovative." The SDGs emerged against a background of striking technological progress. For example, the cost of utility-scale solar power and wind power is down 85% and 66%, respectively, since 20099. In addition, she hails the impact of private-sector initiatives like the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition (PDC) of 27 asset owners and managers. PDC was founded by Amundi, Sweden's AP4 pension fund, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative in 2014. Although relatively few green bonds have yet been offered directly to the public apart from a few MDB structured debt issues, major asset managers are starting to provide exposure to the product through funds, Mercier notes. Both he and Clarke cite the new USD2bn fund recently launched by the International Finance Corporation and Amundi as a landmark in this development. The World Bank affiliate will contribute USD325m to seed the fund, which will buy green bonds from emerging market banks. Asset managers will contribute the remainder10. Following the initiative, "there is plenty more that MDBs and asset managers could do and we are excited to see what comes through.," Clarke believes. "The economy is really going the same way as the forces of good," Mercier concludes. "Issuers want to do sustainable finance to reduce their risk and investors want to de-risk too. It is a fabulous virtuous circle." 1 HYPERLINK http://www.ussif.org/files/Infographics/Overview%20Infographic.pdf http://www.ussif.org/files/Infographics/Overview%20Infographic.pdf 2 HYPERLINK https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Global-green-bond-issuance-could-rise-to-USD206B-in--PR_360880 https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Global-green-bond-issuance-could-rise-to-USD206B-in--PR_360880 3 HYPERLINK http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/ http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/ HYPERLINK https://renewablesnow.com/news/brics-dev-bank-announces-cny-3bn-green-bond-issue-532886/ https://renewablesnow.com/news/brics-dev-bank-announces-cny-3bn-green-bond-issue-532886/ 5 HYPERLINK http://www.globalcapital.com/article/b124wz5gjqqw7f/tennet-readies-green-hybrid-first 6 HYPERLINK http://www.tfreview.com/news/deals/tskb-returns-bond-market-us300m-tier-2-notes-issue 7 HYPERLINK http://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/green-bonds/green-bond-principles/ 8 HYPERLINK http://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/green-bonds/guidance-for-issuers-of-social-bonds/ http://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/green-bonds/guidance-for-issuers-of-social-bonds/ HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-17/lower-cost-wind-and-solar-will-drive-energy-storage-technology https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-17/lower-cost-wind-and-solar-will-drive-energy-storage-technology HYPERLINK https://renewablesnow.com/news/ifc-amundi-to-set-up-usd-2bn-emerging-markets-focused-green-bond-fund-565924/ https://renewablesnow.com/news/ifc-amundi-to-set-up-usd-2bn-emerging-markets-focused-green-bond-fund-565924/ \</doc>

"The world has great expectations for IMO delivering an ambitious greenhouse gas reduction strategy for the international shipping sector. We are confident that this initial IMO strategy, once adopted next year, will match the goals and philosophy of the Paris Agreement on climate change, while also fully recognising that the sustainable development of the world and its peoples is critically dependent on the continuing smooth flow of global trade, about 90 per cent of which is transported by sea." This is the key message from Esben Poulsson, Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping, speaking on the eve of IMO World Maritime Day, whose theme this year is 'Connecting Ships, Ports and People'. Mr Poulsson stressed that ICS and its member national shipowners' associations are committed to helping IMO agree upon some truly ambitious CO2 reduction objectives which IMO can present at the 2018 Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC Paris Agreement. 'IMO is the only body which can deliver further GHG reduction measures that will have a meaningful impact on the emissions of the entire global shipping sector. It is vital that IMO remains in control of this critical issue, building on the real progress already made with its package of technical regulations that became legally binding across the entire world fleet in 2013, the very first global agreement of its kind adopted for a major industrial sector." ICS (in collaboration with BIMCO, INTERCARGO and INTERTANKO) has recently made a detailed submission to IMO on the possible contents of its GHG reduction strategy. The industry proposes that IMO Member States - the same States that are parties to the UNFCCC Paris Agreement - should agree an initial objective of holding the total CO2 emissions of the international shipping sector below 2008 levels, but that IMO should also set an ambitious goal for the percentage by which the sector's total CO2 emissions should be reduced by 2050, compared to 2008, compatible with the legitimate concerns of developing nations about the potential impacts on trade and economic development. "The global shipping industry has now come forward with clear proposals on how IMO can help it decarbonise as quickly as possible, complete with some serious objectives, numbers and dates. It's now up to governments to present their own ideas, in order that IMO can deliver a suitably ambitious strategy which can be adopted next year." said Mr Poulsson.

April 11, 2018 The regional strategic meeting of the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG Africa) ( HYPERLINK http://www.UCLGa.org www.UCLGa.org ) for the Eastern Africa Region took place at Intercontinental Hotel (Nairobi, Kenya) from 9 to 10 April 2018. The meeting organized in collaboration with the Council of Governors (COG) of Kenya was attended by 10 countries representing 14 national associations of local government including Rwanda, Burundi, Madagascar, Comoros, Uganda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. They were represented by the presidents of the national associations of local governments, leaders of the Network of Locally Elected Women (REFELA) and their permanent secretaries. Proceedings were opened by Amb Tuneya Hussein Dado, Cheif Administrative Secretary, Ministry of Devolution and ASALS in the presence of Hounourable, Governor Josphat Nanok Koli, Chairperson Council of Governors (CoG), Mr. David Andre, Mayor of Victoria Seychelles, UCLG Africa Vice President, Eastern Africa Region and Mr. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi, Secretary General of UCLG Africa. In his remarks, Amb Tuneya Hussein Dado reiterated the importance of strengthening local governments and the key role played by UCLG Africa in uniting local governments across Africa. On behalf of the Council of Governors of Kenya (CoG), Honorable Josphat Nanok Koli, welcomed the delegates and wished everyone a nice stay in Nairobi. He expressed his happiness to host the first of the five UCLG Africa regional strategic meetings that will take place in the five regions of Africa (North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa). He also mentioned the commitment of the CoG to be part of UCLG Africa and its cooperation and decentralisation agenda. Mr. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi, UCLG Africa Secretary General in his remarks, reminded participants of the importance of UCLG Africa regional strategic meetings. "They are key in the life of UCLG Africa. It is therefore critical that members take full advantage of their gathering here to share knowledge on the situation of decentralization and sub national and local governments in their respective countries and to make inputs in reflecting on how to improve this situation for greater involvement of subnational and local governments in the definition and implementation of the development and integration policies and strategies set forth by Agenda 2063 of the African Union" said Mr. Mbassi. "The regional strategic meetings also provides a moment for members to reflect on what is happening at both the continental and global levels, particularly on how it impacts on sub-national and local governments mandates and actions", he added. During the first day of the meeting two sessions were held to address UCLG Africa Network in the Region. Through this topic, participants shared their experiences on the state of decentralisation in their countries and the key challenges it faces. They also received information on decentralized cooperation partnerships, and on UCLG Africa Pan Africa Peer Review. Candidates to host a Peer Review mission and to be part of Peer Review teams were registered. The second session addressed the functioning of UCLG Africa networks and how these networks can contribute in enhancing the delivery capacity of subnational and local governments. As a reminder, UCLG Africa networks include: the network of locally elected women of Africa (REFELA); the network of City Managers (MAGNET); the network of City Chief Finance Officers (FINET); and the network of City Chief Technical Officers (TECHNET). This session also focussed on the role of local and regional governments in implementing African and Global Agendas such as, the African Charter on Values Principles of Decentralisation, Local Governance Local Development; the setting up of the High Council of Local Authorities as a consultative body of the African Union; the role of subnational and local governments of Africa in the implementation of Agenda 2063 of the African Union, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Climate Change Agenda. UCLG Africa members in the East Africa Region are being invited to advocate for the ratification by their country of the African Charter on Values Principles of Decentralisation, Local Governance Local Development. Since its adoption, in Malabo in 2014, the charter has been signed by 12 countries and ratified by only 3 countries, 2 of which are in the East Africa region (Madagascar and Burundi). The Charter will become a legal instrument of the African Union when signed and ratified by 15 countries, and deposited at the Africa Union Commission. During the presentation on the role of African local governments in the implementation of SDGs, participants were given an example on the role played by local authority in Nigeria. The UCLG, the world body organisation of Local authorities have also developed a toolkit that was shared with members. On the Climate Agenda, National Associations of Local Governments were encouraged to join the global covenant of mayors for climate and energy where the Africa chapter is hosted by UCLG Africa in its West Africa Regional Office (WARO). The UCLG Africa Climate Task Force was launched during COP23 to assist African subnational and local governments prepare funding requests eligible to the green climate fund. Members were informed about the local government transparency and integration aiming at providing voluntary members a tool to address the daunting issue of corruption in the subnational and local governments' administrations. The participants were also informed about the role they are expected to play in the implementation of European Union cooperation agenda. In 2013 the EU adopted a Communication that recognizes for the first time local authorities as public authorities in their own right. Following this recognition the European Union concluded a framework partnership agreement with international and continental associations of local governments, among which UCLG Africa. Participants were also informed that according to the provisions of the 2013 EU Communication on local authorities national associations having a monopoly situation in their country can access EU cooperation funds allocated to local governments without going through a call for proposal, provided they present to and discuss with the EU delegation an implementation program agreed upon by the members of the said national association. The participants were further informed about the beginning of the negotiations of the Post Cotonou Agreement that will frame the cooperation relations between Africa Union and European Union for the coming 20 years.

The regional strategic meeting of the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG Africa) ( HYPERLINK http://www.UCLGa.org www.UCLGa.org ) for the Eastern Africa Region took place at Intercontinental Hotel (Nairobi, Kenya) from 9 to 10 April 2018. The meeting organized in collaboration with the Council of Governors (COG) of Kenya was attended by 10 countries representing 14 national associations of local government including Rwanda, Burundi, Madagascar, Comoros, Uganda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya. They were represented by the presidents of the national associations of local governments, leaders of the Network of Locally Elected Women (REFELA) and their permanent secretaries. Proceedings were opened by Amb Tuneya Hussein Dado, Cheif Administrative Secretary, Ministry of Devolution and ASALS in the presence of Hounourable, Governor Josphat Nanok Koli, Chairperson Council of Governors (CoG), Mr. David Andre, Mayor of Victoria Seychelles, UCLG Africa Vice President, Eastern Africa Region and Mr. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi, Secretary General of UCLG Africa. In his remarks, Amb Tuneya Hussein Dado reiterated the importance of strengthening local governments and the key role played by UCLG Africa in uniting local governments across Africa. On behalf of the Council of Governors of Kenya (CoG), Honorable Josphat Nanok Koli, welcomed the delegates and wished everyone a nice stay in Nairobi. He expressed his happiness to host the first of the five UCLG Africa regional strategic meetings that will take place in the five regions of Africa (North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa). He also mentioned the commitment of the CoG to be part of UCLG Africa and its cooperation and decentralisation agenda. Mr. Jean Pierre Elong Mbassi, UCLG Africa Secretary General in his remarks, reminded participants of the importance of UCLG Africa regional strategic meetings. "They are key in the life of UCLG Africa. It is therefore critical that members take full advantage of their gathering here to share knowledge on the situation of decentralization and sub national and local governments in their respective countries and to make inputs in reflecting on how to improve this situation for greater involvement of subnational and local governments in the definition and implementation of the development and integration policies and strategies set forth by Agenda 2063 of the African Union" said Mr. Mbassi. "The regional strategic meetings also provides a moment for members to reflect on what is happening at both the continental and global levels, particularly on how it impacts on sub-national and local governments mandates and actions", he added. During the first day of the meeting two sessions were held to address UCLG Africa Network in the Region. Through this topic, participants shared their experiences on the state of decentralisation in their countries and the key challenges it faces. They also received information on decentralized cooperation partnerships, and on UCLG Africa Pan Africa Peer Review. Candidates to host a Peer Review mission and to be part of Peer Review teams were registered. The second session addressed the functioning of UCLG Africa networks and how these networks can contribute in enhancing the delivery capacity of subnational and local governments. As a reminder, UCLG Africa networks include: the network of locally elected women of Africa (REFELA); the network of City Managers (MAGNET); the network of City Chief Finance Officers (FINET); and the network of City Chief Technical Officers (TECHNET). This session also focussed on the role of local and regional governments in implementing African and Global Agendas such as, the African Charter on Values Principles of Decentralisation, Local Governance Local Development; the setting up of the High Council of Local Authorities as a consultative body of the African Union; the role of subnational and local governments of Africa in the implementation of Agenda 2063 of the African Union, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Climate Change Agenda. UCLG Africa members in the East Africa Region are being invited to advocate for the ratification by their country of the African Charter on Values Principles of Decentralisation, Local Governance Local Development. Since its adoption, in Malabo in 2014, the charter has been signed by 12 countries and ratified by only 3 countries, 2 of which are in the East Africa region (Madagascar and Burundi). The Charter will become a legal instrument of the African Union when signed and ratified by 15 countries, and deposited at the Africa Union Commission. During the presentation on the role of African local governments in the implementation of SDGs, participants were given an example on the role played by local authority in Nigeria. The UCLG, the world body organisation of Local authorities have also developed a toolkit that was shared with members. On the Climate Agenda, National Associations of Local Governments were encouraged to join the global covenant of mayors for climate and energy where the Africa chapter is hosted by UCLG Africa in its West Africa Regional Office (WARO). The UCLG Africa Climate Task Force was launched during COP23 to assist African subnational and local governments prepare funding requests eligible to the green climate fund. Members were informed about the local government transparency and integration aiming at providing voluntary members a tool to address the daunting issue of corruption in the subnational and local governments' administrations. The participants were also informed about the role they are expected to play in the implementation of European Union cooperation agenda. In 2013 the EU adopted a Communication that recognizes for the first time local authorities as public authorities in their own right. Following this recognition the European Union concluded a framework partnership agreement with international and continental associations of local governments, among which UCLG Africa. Participants were also informed that according to the provisions of the 2013 EU Communication on local authorities national associations having a monopoly situation in their country can access EU cooperation funds allocated to local governments without going through a call for proposal, provided they present to and discuss with the EU delegation an implementation program agreed upon by the members of the said national association. The participants were further informed about the beginning of the negotiations of the Post Cotonou Agreement that will frame the cooperation relations between Africa Union and European Union for the coming 20 years. Attention was called on UCLG Africa members to advocate and lobby their national governments to have them include local governments as key partners at the different steps, from the negotiations stage to the definition and implementation stages, which implies that the territorial and local level should be recognized as the critical level for the implementation and impact assessment of the impact of EU cooperation programs. Engagement with the EU delegations was also recommended to follow up on the implementation of the 2013 Communication and on the post Cotonou Agreement negotiations that will start soon (presumably in September 2018). The 8th Edition of the Africities Summit was announced and will be hosted in Marrakesh, Morocco, between November 20th - 24th 2018. The Members were invited to attend in numbers. They were also reminded that they are expected to participate in the General Assembly of UCLG Africa and the Network of Local Elected Women of Africa (REFELA) that will be held during the Summit in Marrakesh.

\~ The first green shoots of renewable energy have begun to appear in Kuwait as new solar projects come on-stream and recognise the potential to cut costs, reduce emissions and divert fuel to export markets rather than domestic consumption. In November 2016 the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah, demonstrated the country's commitment to international efforts to reduce global warming by attending the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change in Marrakech. Four years earlier, at COP18 in Doha, Sheikh Sabah had stated that Kuwait would aim to meet 15% of its energy demand through renewables by 2030. Pilot Projects While 15% is the target for renewable energy's contribution to the power generation mix by 2030, no roadmap has been published giving clear indications of how many GW of generating capacity might be supplied by solar or wind. An official video promoting the state of Kuwait's first independent water and power company, Al Zour North One, predicts that by 2030 the population of the country may have reached 6m, requiring installed capacity of 28.8 GW. If renewables are to make the desired contribution by that time, 4.32 GW of installed solar and wind capacity will have to be built. To put this in context, the first solar plant built for Kuwait Oil Company, SIDRAH 500, which opened in 2016, had an initial capacity of 10 MW. In 2017 a further 60 MW of renewable capacity is due to come on-stream at Shagaya Renewable Energy Park 100 km north of Kuwait City. So, by the end of 2017 Kuwait will have around 70 MW of installed renewable energy against a 2030 target of 4320 MW, which means the solar sector will have to grow by 6000% in 12 years. While that may seem an impossible dream, there are environmental, economic and political factors, which may speed progress in the years to come. Kuwait Research Scientists have been carrying out research into the potential of renewable energy in Kuwait for decades. According to a research paper delivered to Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1981, the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) established a solar power research programme in 1976. A solar house was built, solar-powered air conditioning was used in schoolrooms, and applications for desalination and agriculture were also produced. Although global warming was not at the forefront of their agenda in 1981, the researchers noted that while the affluence of the population and the availability of cheap oil might combine to prevent development of the technology, this could be outweighed by positive factors, such as the need to preserve oil wealth for future generations, the availability of capital to develop technology combined with progressive attitudes to home design and technology among Kuwaitis, an industrial base capable of manufacturing components and the government's willingness to allow experimental solar generation sites on its buildings. Kuwaiti scientists in the 1970s also noted that peak demand for both air conditioning and desalinated water coincided with the times of day and year when solar power was most abundant. However, in the 1980s plans for solar power in Kuwait were abandoned when the price of oil collapsed. However, the arguments put forward 40 years ago have stood the test of time and have been given added impetus by climate change concerns. In September 2016 a consortium including Chinese solar panel maker JinkoSolar and Japan's Marubeni Corporation bid just $0.0242 per KWh for a 350-MW plant in Abu Dhabi, a world record low price. Growth Drivers JinkoSolar has also established a foothold in Kuwait, providing 5 MW of photovoltaic (PV) panels for the first phase of Shagaya Renewable Energy Park in 2016. The integrated renewable project at Shagaya is being built for the Ministry of Water and Electricity and KISR by the Spanish company TSK. In addition to 5 MW of PV modules, the site will have 5 MW of thin film to produce 10 MW of PV energy. In addition, TSK is installing 50 MW of thermal solar technology, including its own parabolic trough collectors at the site. Shagaya will have the capacity to store electricity for nine hours, enabling it to release power to coincide with peak demand. The Shagaya initiative was first conceived in 2009, but not formally announced until 2013. By 2030 it will include 1150 MW of concentrated solar power (CSP), a 700-MW PV plant and a 150-MW wind farm, providing a combined total of 2 GW of installed capacity. The CSP element will be developed over time with 23 individual projects of 50 MW each and 14 solar PV projects sharing the same site with the wind farm. The combined renewable energy output for the scheme will be 5000 GWh annually, saving 12m barrels of oil equivalent. The site will have four substations and connect with the national grid. Energy Mix According to KISR, residential customers account for 61% of Kuwait's electrical consumption, with commercial and industrial customers using 16% and 3%, respectively, and 21% used by others, presumably public sector buildings. When it comes to fuel consumption, electricity and water production accounts for 55%, transport for 17%, the oil industry for 27% and residential for 1%. The feedstock used in generating electricity and desalinating water uses a mix of fuels with gas oil accounting for 0.5%, natural gas for 27%, crude oil for 29% and heavy fuel for 44%. Kuwait has been a net importer of natural gas since 2009, and in 2015 it imported 3.1m tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG), 15% more than in the previous year. Kuwait's main source of LNG has been Qatar, but it has also taken cargoes from Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, Oman and the US. According to the IMF, Kuwait's per capita energy consumption was 10 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) in 2014. Compared to a world average of 4 toe per capita, this rank Kuwait as the sixth-largest consumer on a per capita basis. That consumption has also been growing at an average of 0.9% a year over 40 years, while many countries in the developed world saw negative growth during the period. Data from a BP study also shows Kuwait per capita CO emissions in 2014 were 28 tonnes, the fifth highest of any country covered in the report. The IMF estimated that in 2014, the opportunity cost of using oil to satisfy domestic demand for energy was equivalent to 7% of Kuwait's GDP. The IMF has also urged Kuwait to cut subsidies on water and electricity to reduce consumption. In May 2017 a law reducing subsidies for expatriates, but exempting Kuwaiti citizens, went into effect, raising the domestic electricity price from KD0.002 ($0.01) per KWh to KD0.015 ($0.05), while doubling the water price. SIDRAH No sector understands this loss more keenly than the oil industry itself, and it was Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) that developed the first utility scale solar project in the country in 2016. Sidrah 500 consists of 32,450 solar panels on a 36-ha site. The solar panels, which can collectively generate 10 MW, are housed on single-axis trackers so that they can move with the sun. Sidrah 500 is connected to the national grid through KOC's own substation. The electricity produced by the plant powers 29 electric pumps in the Umm-Gudair oilfield in west Kuwait, a first for the oil business. This use of solar power not only reduces the amount of electricity KOC has to take from the grid, but also enables KOC to feed in any excess power generated. SIDRAH 500 was developed after the emir's statement on renewables in Doha in 2012, and it has since established proof of concept for many people in Kuwait. "In Kuwait there have been many sceptics about the feasibility of solar, those who felt that dust storms and other weather conditions might make it infeasible, but we have been able to show the performance is exceeding expectations and that we have a project working flawlessly, despite the dust and wind conditions, which is connected to the grid," Raed Sherif, renewable energy consultant at KOC, told OBG. "We are waiting to see how the plant will operate during the hot summer months. Once the plant demonstrates reliable operation during summer, there will be a huge potential to expand the use of renewable energy across KOC." PPP Project Another factor that may speed up the development of renewable energy projects is the liberalisation of rules governing public-private partnerships (PPP). Among the PPP utility plans midway through the tendering process in early 2017 is the Al Abdaliyah Integrated Solar Combined Cycle plant. Solar will contribute 60 MW under this scheme, with a gas turbine generating 280 MW. The first conventional water and power PPP began operating in Kuwait in 2016, and if this funding mechanism proves popular, companies specialising in solar power generation may become more interested in developing schemes in Kuwait. REDO Renewable Energy Development Organisation (REDO), a New York-based non-profit, is trying to persuade Kuwait's government to invest in solar for public buildings. "Our argument is that if, as a government, you can cut fuel bills by 15%, you are potentially saving millions of dinars, and the great thing about government buildings such as offices and schools is that their demand for electricity for air conditioning coincides with the hottest time of the day," Fadel Jerman, consultant and head of oil and gas at REDO Kuwait, told OBG. \</doc>

Final Portrait (15)  Stanley Tucci, 90 mins, starring: Geoffrey Rush, Armie Hammer, Cl\'e9mence Po\'e9sy, Tony Shalhoub, James Faulkner, Philippe Spall Final Portrait is a slither of a film, an account of how, late in his life, Swiss sculptor and artist Alberto Giacometti (Geoffrey Rush) painted a picture of American writer, James Lord (Armie Hammer.) This isn't a biopic as such. It unfolds over a period of only a fortnight or so in Paris in 1964. Almost the entire story takes place in the artist's studio. Actor turned director Stanley Tucci doesn't indulge in flashbacks to Giacometti's childhood. Nor does he explain how or why Giacometti started sculpting those haunting, skeletal figures. Instead, Tucci concentrates on Giacometti's relationship with the American. It quickly becomes apparent that Giacometti has no real intention of actually finishing the portrait. Like Penelope fending off suitors in The Odyssey, he continually undoes the work he has spent days completing???and then he starts it all over again. Geoffrey Rush has always excelled at playing highly strung visionaries. Here, with his tweed jacket, a cigarette hanging on his lip and his great shock of hair, he captures his character's restlessness, drive and extreme insecurity. During the film's more bathetic moments, when he is throwing out priceless lithographs or acting up as the tortured genius, he resembles Tony Hancock as the hapless artist in the Paris garret in debunking British comedy, The Rebel. At other times, he is closer to one of those despairing figures trying to make sense of the metaphysical meaninglessness of existence in plays by Samuel Beckett (who was Giacometti's friend and collaborator.) Money means nothing to the artist. He'll throw wads of notes under the bed. He has a very devoted and long suffering wife, Annette (Sylvie Testud) but is far more interested in his lover Caroline (Cl\'e9mence Po\'e9sy), a prostitute who swans into his studio whenever she likes and seems to entrance him. He flaunts his relationship with Caroline in front of Annette. She puts up with his infidelity and untidy domestic habits. That (it is implied) is the price for living with genius. Hammer's American man about town is as suave as Giacometti is unkempt. The artist, though, can see beyond the young American's outer poise and polish. As he scrutinises his sitter's face, he tells Lord he has the face of a brute. "Side on, you look like a degenerate." Lord gives as good as he gets, which is one reason why Giacometti tolerates him and welcomes his company, even if he remains suspicious of his motives. Tucci recreates the mid 1960s by shooting the film in a very grainy, desaturated fashion. He makes sure we're aware that we are in bohemian Paris by including swirling accordion music on the soundtrack as well as one or two scenes of the artist quaffing wine at his favourite bistro. "Oh, fuck!" Giacometti groans again and again throughout the film as he realises the work is not living up to his expectations. The sittings, which he said would last for a day or two, are extended and Lord has to keep on re-arranging his flight to America. We catch occasional glimpses of characters close to Giacometti, his brother and his dealer among them. There are fleeting references to other artists, Picasso among them. "The man's a thief," Giacometti complains. There's a jaunt around Paris in a sports car very badly driven by Caroline, and one or two walks in the cemetery. The artist has the occasional temper tantrum and Lord worries that he will never get home. We learn even less about Lord than we do about Giacometti. There are no new love affairs, no murders, no conspiracy. As a result, the film risks seeming as undernourished as Giacometti's own spindly, sculpted figurines. The Hitman's Bodyguard (15)  Patrick Hughes, 118 mins, starring: Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, Salma Hayek, Elodie Yung, Richard E. Grant What redeems it partially is the comic interplay between the two stars, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson, who behave as if they're making a tongue in cheek comedy and always seem to be tipping us the wink that they know the premise here is utterly ridiculous. Director Patrick Hughes clearly feels the same way, filling the film with bluesy rock music and love songs that both undercut any potential dramatic tension and distract us from noticing the holes in the screenplay. Jackson plays Darius Kincaid, the "hitman" of the title, a hired killer so notorious that he has been locked up in Manchester of all places. Darius is required to give evidence in the International Court In The Hague against Belarusian dictator Dukhovich (Gary Oldman), who has been slaughtering his own people and plenty of foreigners too. The question is whether Darius can reach the court alive when half of eastern Europe is out to kill him. The hitman and the bodyguard heartily loathe each other. Both have complicated romantic lives. The hitman's girlfriend, the glamorous but borderline psychotic Latin American spitfire and barmaid Sonia (Salma Hayek) is behind bars in Amsterdam. The bodyguard, meanwhile, blames his former beloved, Interpol agent Amelie (Elodie Yung), for the collapse of his career. Jackson and Reynolds are like two flashy jazz performers riffing off each other, seeing who can come up with the most profanities and trying shamelessly to upstage one another. Inevitably, the more they bicker, the more they resemble an old married couple. Also good value, Gary Oldman plays the thuggish eastern European villain as if he is a more gnarled version of his vampire aristocrat in Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula. That film may have been shot 25 years ago but Oldman's accent is still the same. It's revealing to read the end credits. After the actors' names come those of the stunt artists - and there are hundreds of them, working in the UK, the Netherlands and Bulgaria. The CGI is variable, An early explosion, when the bodyguard is ushering a coked up financier (Richard E. Grant in a very hyper groove) to safety, isn't at all convincing. The chases, especially those in Amsterdam and the Hague, down canals and along Dutch motorways, are staged with enormous relish. They involve speedboats, cars and motorbikes. Plot-wise, the film makes no sense whatsoever. It's a mystery why actors of the calibre of Jackson, Reynolds and Oldman wanted to appear in such low grade exploitation fare it but at least they give the impression of enjoying themselves. The Odyssey (PG)  J\'e9r\'f4me Salle, 120 mins, starring: Lambert Wilson, Pierre Niney, Audrey Tautou, Laurent Lucas, Benjamin Lavernhe, Vincent Heneine The real journey in this biopic of French scientist, sailor, explorer and global TV personality Jacques Cousteau is into the character of a thoroughly contradictory man. This is a frustrating film because it never seems certain what story it is trying to tell. Is it a Jules Verne like maritime adventure? Is it a family drama about a father and his estranged son? Is it an essay about the environment? Is it a portrait of a womanising narcissist who looked good with a snorkel in his mouth and flippers on his feet? The title, The Odyssey, suggests an epic voyage but the storytelling is very choppy. What the film does convince us of is the purity of Cousteau's original vision. Underwater diving for him is akin to flying, a transcendent and magical experience. It also shows us him as a Quixotic visionary, ready to set to sea in this boat The Calypso even if he is leaving a comfortable life behind him and never really has the financing to keep up with his dreams. Lambert Wilson's clever performance doesn't just show Cousteau the explorer. It reveals him as a bit of a slick operator. Unlike his fellow pioneering divers in the so-called "Sea Musketeers" in the 1940s, he is glib and personable in public. He can sell his vision. What may surprise British viewers who have distant memories of watching The Undersea World Of Jacques Cousteau on TV is how he funded his voyages. He took money from an oil company that predicted (correctly) he and his divers would help them find new underwater oil fields. Once US TV companies started investing in his films, he risked becoming a performing seal. The serious study of marine flora and fauna, it is suggested here, was strictly secondary to providing dramatic documentaries that featured plenty of footage of sharks and exotic underwater life (and that attracted the advertisers.) Wilson, who was once in the running to play James Bond, is better looking than the real Cousteau who used to appear on our TV screens. He portrays the explorer as a promiscuous figure who had endless extra-marital dalliances as his wife Simone (Audrey Tautou) was left to fester and drink too much on the Calypso. She had hawked off her jewellery to equip the ship in the first place. He was dependent on her but not very loyal. Nor was Cousteau much of a businessman. As his celebrity grew, he ended up with 150 salaries to pay as well as the upkeep of the Calypso. His expenses began to outstrip his earnings. Just as vexed as his marriage was Cousteau's relationship with his two sons. The youngest, Philippe (Pierre Niney), is shown here as being as contradictory as he is himself. Philippe is reckless, brattish, drives a sports car and has deep-rooted abandonment issues. (He can't forgive his father for bundling him off to boarding school when he was a boy.) Cousteau's acolytes are very suspicious of Philippe. In particular, lorry driver turned diver "Bebert" (Vincent Heneine) resents him. Philippe, though, is a talented filmmaker who has a streak of idealism his father seems to lack. He begins the film as a delinquent but evolves into its most admirable and heroic figure. The Odyssey tacks off in surprising directions. Late on, when Cousteau confesses he sometimes feels he has spent his entire life "chasing after money," the film finally begins to show off its eco credentials. Cousteau and his followers rail against the "dictatorship of materialism;" they raise awareness about pollution and begin to sound like Al Gore and his followers in An Inconvenient Sequel (also released this week.) For all its digressions and inconsistencies, the film succeeds on one key level. In its best moments, it induces the same sense of wonder as Cousteau's TV documentaries. There is stirring footage here of storms at sea and divers surrounded by sharks. Director J\'e9r\'f4me Salle also throws in some awe-inspiring scenery of Antarctica in all its "immensity, silence and pureness." (Penguins put in an inevitable appearance too.) Cousteau and his son's enthusiasm for exploring is shown as being rooted in their child-like love for such stories as 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea and for star gazing. When they're actually underwater or on the ice or gliding through the air like pilots in an Antoine de Saint-Exup\'e9ry story, all their petty feuding is quickly forgotten and The Odyssey takes on, at least briefly, a magical quality. An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power (PG)  Jon Shenk, Bonni Cohe, 98 mins, featuring: Al Gore The message hasn't changed in the decade since former US Vice President Al Gore's first, Oscar winning documentary about climate change. Big Al remains an impassioned and impressive campaigner. It's hard to say how much freedom directors Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk had in shaping the film. Whether it is their doing or Gore's, the film's structure feels artificial. It builds up to a dramatic finale at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris in late 2015. Gore is shown working heroically behind the scenes to ensure the Paris agreement on climate change is signed and that India is kept on board. This should be the pay-off but other vexing elements keep on getting in the way. There's the looming figure of Donald Trump, soon to become President himself and ready to pour scorn on Gore's environmental efforts and on President Obama for taking them so seriously. (Toward the end of the film, we see Gore making a visit to Trump Tower but, sadly, the actual meeting with the man at the top isn't caught on camera.) COP 21 itself happens in the wake of devastating 2015 Paris terrorism attacks. Even as new climate treaties are announced, there's a dispiriting sense that they won't last. Early in the documentary, Gore acknowledges that he "got really discouraged" by what happened after 2006. His first film was widely shown and sparked considerable debate - but it also provoked his opponents into trying to trash his reputation and taking to the airwaves to dismiss his "hysterical global warming theories." He talks darkly of democracy being "hacked by big business." The graphs now show that the "number of extremely hot days" are becoming much more numerous. Extreme weather occurrences are described as making typical episodes of the daily news seem like a nature "ride through the Book of Revelations." An Inconvenient Sequel is skilfully put together. As in An Inconvenient Truth (2006), lecture material is combined with Gore's reflections on his own private and political life. There's footage of him out and about in Miami Beach as the water levels rise or of him meeting Republican mayors in Texas who share his passion for renewable energy. We see him making calls to political leaders, lobbying industrialists from Silicon Valley and telling jokes at his own expense. At times, as he holds forth here about the "environment crisis" and the "democracy crisis," he reminds us of Burt Lancaster as the preacher/mountebank in Elmer Gantry. We know exactly what he is going to say but that doesn't stop his words from resonating. \</doc>

Talanoa is a Fijian term for discussions aimed at building consensus, airing differences constructively, and finding ways to overcome difficulties or embark on new projects. It is one of the building blocks of Fijian society, used for centuries to foster greater understanding among a people distributed over many small islands, and carry them through a tough existence. This week, talanoa comes to Europe, and the rest of the world. Fiji is hosting the UN's climate talks, following on from the landmark Paris agreement of 2015, and will hold the conference in Bonn, Germany. Talanoa will be the founding principle of the conference, the means by which Fiji hopes to break through some of the seemingly intractable problems that have made these 20-plus years of negotiations a source of bitter conflict. "Talanoa is a process of inclusive, participatory and transparent dialogue that builds empathy and leads to decision-making for the collective good," said Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji. "It is not about finger pointing and laying blame but about listening to each other. By focusing on the benefits of action [against climate change] this process will move the global climate agenda forward." Related: The COP23 climate change summit in Bonn and why it matters Michael Bloomberg, the former Republican mayor of New York, said Trump's White House did not speak for the rest of the US. "[This week] I'll help lead a delegation of US mayors, governors and CEOs and we will deliver a unified message: Americans remain committed to meeting our commitment under the Paris agreement, no matter what happens in Washington. We can get there." Yet the divisions likely to be caused by Trump's stance should not be underestimated. Gaining a consensus involving the US and China was arguably the biggest achievement of Paris - the first time that all developed and developing countries had signed a pact vowing to limit global warming to 2C, which scientists say is the limit of safety. The history of the UN negotiations has been littered with attempts at such an agreement that fell short - the Kyoto protocol of 1997, the Copenhagen conference of 2009 - so when the gavel came down on the Paris agreement, it was an unparalleled landmark in the history of the world's fight against climate change. The negotiations under the UN on a global agreement have been going on since 1992. Meanwhile, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have steadily increased, reaching levels not seen for 800,000 years. At Bonn, Trump's team are reportedly preparing to inflame the talks yet further, by concentrating on the supposed benefits of coal-fired power. Fiji hopes to confine the White House's activities to a sideshow. There are two substantive issues to be discussed at this conference, which will carry on whatever the US position is. First is the "ratchet" - the means by which the pledges on emissions made at Paris will be increased in future years, in line with scientific advice. Second, and of huge importance to the hosts, is the question of adaptation to the effects of climate change. Adaptation was long a dirty word at climate change conferences. Civil society groups feared that espousing, and devoting money to, the means of staving off the worst effects of warming - walls against sea level rises, dykes and floating houses, changes to agriculture to grow heat-adapted crops - would distract attention from the urgent business of reducing emissions. For Fiji and other Pacific islands, however, the effects of climate change are already being felt, and finding ways to reduce their impact will be crucial in the years to come. One way round this has been to change the emphasis. Instead of adaptation, countries are now talking about resilience - a more positive term, suggesting empowerment and action, rather than giving in to a threat. Building resilience has advantages that go far beyond climate change - improvements to infrastructure, and a better evolved response to natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes that have nothing to do with global warming - and can also help to improve the quality of people's lives, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, improved public transport systems would have a huge economic benefit in many developing countries, would reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and could be built in such a way as to be resistant against encroaching climate change. Buildings constructed with climate change in mind would also be more efficient, resistant to extreme heat, and against the storms, floods and droughts that are likely to become more frequent under global warming. At Bonn, discussions are likely to focus on how to help developing countries become more resilient, and the financing that may be available for them to do so. The latter could be a combination of overseas aid from major economies, and investment from the private sector. These discussions, however, are still at an early stage and there may be little concrete outcome on them from the talks other than a decision to keep talking. Yet the most pressing issue of the conference is likely to be the one that receives least public attention, and deliberately so. Known as the "facilitative dialogue", this is a crucial - but overlooked - rider to the Paris agreement. At Paris, countries acknowledged that their pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions fell well short of the reductions advised by scientists. In order to forge the agreement, they made a compromise: in future years, they would ratchet up their pledges to the levels required. This made agreement at Paris possible, but it effectively put off the toughest negotiations to future years of talks. The difficulty of resolving this should not be underestimated. Currently, none of the world's biggest emitters can agree on how any such ratchet mechanism would work. Should countries, for instance, take on more stringent emissions goals simply by adding a certain amount to their current pledges? Or should their future pledges be calculated based on their projected economic growth? How should the responsibility for historic emissions be taken into account? What status should be given to scientific advice on how to keep within the 2C limit? Most countries want to ensure that their pledges are entirely of their own devising, rather than reached in consensus with the rest of the UN, but it is unclear what would happen if these pledges are inadequate. The work is made harder still by deficiencies in collating reliable and up-to-date data on each country's emissions. The discussions on the ratchet mechanism are known in the UN jargon as "the facilitative dialogue", a name that disguises the fraught nature of these negotiations. Given the lack of consensus among major countries on how any such ratchet mechanism should work, and the adamant refusal of the US to take part in further pledges, it may take much more than talanoa - and years more of tough negotiations - to come up with a solution to this conundrum. \</doc>

April 10, 2018 Yesterday, 9 April, SSE joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a joint UK-Canada initiative, launched at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP23 , in November 2017. Powering Past Coal brings together a diverse range of governments, businesses and organisations that are united in taking action to accelerate clean growth and climate protection through the phase out of traditional coal power by 2030. Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Since 2008, SSE's strategy has been to reshape our generation portfolio away from coal and towards renewables and efficient gas generation. If we want to avoid dangerous climate change, then it is clear from the Paris Agreement that there is no place in the future for electricity to be generated from unabated coal. "Joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance entrenches SSE commitment to the phase out of unabated coal by developing new, lower carbon electricity generation in a way that is good for people, good for the environment and delivers sustainable business growth too." \</doc>

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to make an early decision on the date Scotland seeks to aspire to cut emissions output to zero. In a keynote speech to the UN Climate Change Conference, COP23 , in Bonn, Ms Sturgeon pointed to the Scottish Government's commitment eight years ago to cut 2020 emissions by 42 per cent. She said: "We are on course to meet that target and are now proposing to increase our ambition for the years beyond.. "Scotland will go further where we can - for example we have recently set an earlier target than the UK for phasing out new diesel and petrol cars." \</doc>

It's not just the fashion industry that has a massive waste problem. We all do. Our wardrobes are bulging with clothes, many of which we don't wear. The number of garments produced globally has doubled since 2000 to more than 100bn items. If you are anything like me, you will feel as if you own a good proportion of them already. Part of the reason retailers love Black Friday so much is because they have such huge excesses of stock to offload As we approach Black Friday, which has now spread from a single day of splurge buying to an entire week, we are about to be bombarded with discounts and offers to buy everything from a new fridge to a cashmere jumper ( just you wait, there will be mountains of cheap cashmere). Part of the reason retailers love Black Friday so much is because they have such huge excesses of stock to offload. Cheap clothes mean small profit margins so the fast fashion model relies on massive volumes to create profit. So by buying excessive amounts of cheap clothes, we all become part of one of the biggest and most troubling waste problems facing the world. The fashion industry was responsible for the emission of 1,715m tons of CO2 in 2015, about 5.45% of the 32.1bn tons of global carbon emissions in 2015 (according to Copenhagen Fashion Summit's 2017 Pulse of the Industry report ). In light of the world's governments' gathering for COP23 for 11 days of talks on how to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions which began on 6 November 2017, we need to think hard about the rate at which we produce - and profligately discard - our clothes. We need to make our existing wardrobes work more efficiently. It would help if we could see what we have to start with - so a wardrobe clear-out is a great place to start. According to a recent report by Greenpeace, After the Binge, the Hangover, our attitude towards shopping is a bit like our addiction to sugar. It might give us a quick buzz but it doesn't make us happy. The average person buys 60% more items of clothing and keeps them for about half as long as 15 years ago. According to Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), consumers in the UK now keep our garments for an average of just 3.3 years. There's a need for greater transparency not just on production supply chains but on what the industry is doing with its mountains of waste. "We need to find ways to break free from our addiction, reverse the throwaway culture and discover new ways to love our clothes," says Orsola de Castro, co-founder of Fashion Revolution, the global campaign to promote a more transparent and sustainable fashion industry. "Far from being a part of the problem, we can all, enthusiastically and creatively, become a part of the solution." Fashion Revolution's latest fanzine, Loved Clothes Last (the print version is available now, for \£315, from Fashionrevolution.org ; and free as a download from 1 December) includes contributions by experts including Rebecca Earley, Elizabeth Cline, Tom of Holland, Andrew Brooks, Kate Fletcher, and Greenpeace, with advice, tips and inspiration on how to make your clothes stand the test of time. To help us resist the temptations of Black Friday, here is a 12 -step guide to caring for your clothes and make more of what you already have. 1 Learn how to master the basics of how to sew. If you can sew on a button, you need never get rid of a shirt or cardigan again just because it's missing a button. There are lots of courses on learning to sew. The Sewing Directory will point you in the right direction. 2 Clothes worth wearing are worth repairing. Don't throw something away just because it has a hole in it. If you can't sew, try using an iron-on patch to cover a hole. Embroidery specialist Hand & Lock has a patch shop where you can choose from a range of embroidered patches. 3 Celebrate the life your clothes have led with darning. If you do it in a contrasting colour, you can make a feature of your mending. Tom of Holland runs the Visible Mending Programme to highlight the disappearing art of clothing repair. And if you feel daunted by the idea of doing it yourself, Tom accepts commissions to do your mending for you. 4 A single pair of nylon tights will take between 30-40 years to decompose in landfill. Cheap tights are a false economy as they tend to ladder more quickly. Old-fashioned remedies such as applying transparent nail varnish around a small hole to stop it spreading might seem crude but are actually quite effective. 5 Buy second-hand and keep an open mind. So many clothes are given away because they have a missing button or a small bit of damage that can be easily rectified using your newfound (or rekindled) mending skills. A single pair of nylon tights will take between 30-40 years to decompose in landfill. 6 Invest in decent hangers. Clothes really appreciate being hung up properly and on the right hangers. Hang skirts and trousers appropriately. Muji has a really good range of hangers, lint rollers and cedar wood products designed to help repel moths. Give your clothes space. There's nothing worse than cramming in another item of clothing into a crowded wardrobe. Some clothes prefer to be folded, like T-shirts and jumpers. Don't cram them into drawers so they get squashed. 7 Follow care instructions. Make sure you iron at the right temperature, and wash at 30C where you can. If you are unsure of what different care labels mean, here's there's a comprehensive guide. 9 Stains are not the end of the world. You'd be amazed at what a bit of distilled white vinegar and salt can remove. Try it on everything from grass to blood to sweat. For red wine, you can use a combination of salt, detergent and a stain removal stick followed by a 30C wash. Treat a stain as soon as it occurs. 10 Look after your bags by stuffing them with tissue paper when you are not using them, to keep their shape. Take bags to be repaired at a shoe menders. A broken buckle or strap can usually be replaced. There is an added incentive: a well-looked-after bag will keep its resale value remarkably well if you choose to sell it on when you have finished with it. Depending on your budget, Vestiaire Collective, eBay and Depop are great marketplaces for buying and selling bags. A leather bag takes 50 years to decompose in landfill. Treat your shoes to a shoe tree - or stuff with newspaper when you are not wearing them. 11 Treat your shoes to a shoe tree - or stuff with newspaper when you are not wearing them. Give your trainers a rest with a sachet of charcoal deodoriser. Washing canvas trainers in the washing machine is a great trick and makes them look almost as good as new. Try to swap your shoes around so you get a rest from each other. Keep on top of shoe repairs so that soles and heels don't get too worn down and worn out. 12 Buy the best quality you can afford. If you appreciate the quality of a garment, you are more likely to treat it with respect. A sure way of assessing the quality of a garment - and how long it will last - is to turn it inside out and look at how the seams are finished. A hurried bit of overlocking is a sure sign your garment won't stand more than a few washes. And if you become attached to a beautifully finished French seam, you may have to indulge your fancy by shopping vintage - it's no coincidence that even high street clothes made pre 1990s are much better quality than their equivalent today. \</doc>

\~ Faced with rising consumption by its industries and power generators, Abu Dhabi is determined to leverage its domestic natural gas assets to reduce its reliance on imports. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has developed an integrated Gas Master Plan as part of its 2030 Strategy that will see it investing in the expansion of its sour gas facilities, while ensuring it minimises wasteful use of associated gas in its oil fields. The plan also includes a revision of ADNOC's gas pricing structure to ensure it receives a fair price for its gas. Strategic Targets Omar Al Suwaidi, director of gas management at ADNOC, has said he wants to ensure a sustainable and economic gas supply to meet Abu Dhabi's future demand. "We believe that we can shrink our energy imports substantially by tapping undeveloped deep and sour gas reserves, unconventional gas resources and deploying innovative technology, such as carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS)," said Al Suwaidi. However, the economics of gas in Abu Dhabi presents challenges if these aims are to be met while also pursuing efficiencies in production. If ADNOC is to adhere to its vision of improving efficiency and profitability, it needs to ensure it can produce its own gas as cheaply as possible and sell it for the highest price. However, this straightforward equation is complicated by long-standing supply contracts that govern the price Abu Dhabi pays for some of the gas it imports, and the amount it charges UAE utilities for the gas it produces itself. In October 2016 a new long-term gas sales and purchase agreement was signed by Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy, which is majority-owned by Mubadala Investment Company and is behind the 48-inch subsea pipeline that has supplied the UAE with gas from Qatar since it was completed in 2007. At that time it was capable of carrying 2bn standard cu feet per day (scfd), but with investments and upgrades in 2015, capacity was increased to a total of 3.2bn scfd. In May 2014, when the average Japanese import price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was $16.79 per million British thermal units (Btu), selling gas for power generation and water desalination in Abu Dhabi rather than exporting it represented an opportunity loss of around $15 per million Btu. However, at that time, when Brent crude cost $110 a barrel, Abu Dhabi could afford to be generous with domestic utility companies, whose water and electricity were also being passed onto customers at a highly subsidised rate. In November 2016, when Brent crude was just over $50 a barrel, ADNOC was much more focused on efficiencies. At that time, Al Suwaidi said the company had initiated a gas price restructuring exercise to ensure it received a fair price for its gas. At the same time, ADNOC was also feeling the effects of a fall in the export price of its own gas, with the Japan import price at $7.18 per million Btu in November 2016, or almost $10 cheaper than it was two and a half years before. Development Expense The spot price paid for imported gas in Japan is also a useful benchmark for firms working with ADNOC to develop the reservoirs of sour gas that lie beneath its desert sands. Unfortunately for Abu Dhabi, some of these reservoirs contain natural gas with very high levels of poisonous hydrogen sulphide. This content makes the gas difficult and expensive to extract and process. One example of this is the Bab sour gas project. "Bab is one of the most technically challenging projects in the world - with almost 40% sulphur content", Ali Al Janabi, chairman of Shell Abu Dhabi, told OBG. "This results in gas processing and development costs that are currently not economical for Abu Dhabi compared to alternative sources." In January 2016 the Japan import price was $7.85 when Royal Dutch Shell announced it was pulling out of its 40% share in the Bab project, an agreement it had entered into in 2013. In common with all international oil companies, Shell was going through a process of cutting costs and reducing its exposure to higher-risk projects globally; the previous year Shell had halted work on five other developments around the world. "Bab is considered a project that must happen, but with more than 40% sulphur content and the fact it is dry gas makes it incredibly challenging," Saif Alghfeli, CEO of ADCO, told OBG. "There are perhaps smaller fields like this in the world, but nothing that has the size potential of 1bn scfd," he added. Growing Attractiveness Although a new partner for the Bab development project had not been announced at the time of writing, another of ADNOC's international partners did reveal plans to increase investment in another of the emirate's sour gas reservoirs in November 2016. Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) owns a 40% concession of the $10bn Abu Dhabi Gas Development Company (Al Hosn Gas). In a joint statement with ADNOC, the company announced the facility would increase sour gas processing by 50%. Vicki Hollub, president and CEO of Oxy, said, "We look forward to working on the next phase to optimise the plant's expansion. Demand for domestic gas is rising, and processing additional sour gas from new and existing reservoirs makes sound business sense." The Al Hosn Gas facility produces 1bn scfd, which is then processed to make 500m scfd of network gas, 4400 tonnes per day of natural gas liquids, 33,000 barrels per day of petroleum condensates and 9000 tonnes per day of granulated sulphur. In April 2016 Abu Dhabi Ports and the German exploration and production company Wintershall signed a contract to set up a facility at Mugharraq Port in the Al Dhafra Region. The facility will cater to Wintershall's offshore drilling activities in the Shuwaihat sour gas field. At the same time, the facility will expand Abu Dhabi Ports' existing services to the exploration and production sector in Abu Dhabi. Uwe Salge, general manager, Middle East, of Wintershall, told OBG, "Working with Abu Dhabi Ports around Mugharraq will help facilitate our work around sour gas in the Al Dhafra Region. It signifies another area in which the energy industry can contribute to development." The field is being developed as a joint venture with Wintershall, Austrian company OMV and ADNOC - which is the major stakeholder. "We are very happy with the appraisal results received so far at Shuwaihat and look forward to further discussions around bringing these fields to the development phase with ADNOC," Salge told OBG. OMV, in which International Petroleum Investment Company - prior to its merger - had a 25% interest, and ADNOC are also partnering with Oxy in a four-year exploration and appraisal project of Ghasha and Hail, two potential sour gas fields in the Al Dhafra Region. Emerging Producer ADNOC says the expansion of the Al Hosn Gas plant would make Abu Dhabi one of the world's largest producers of sulphur. Today, at full capacity, the Al Hosn Gas facility is capable of producing 3.3m tonnes a year, and could generate almost 5m tonnes upon completion. ADNOC says it wants to nurture a downstream industry of firms using sulphur manufacturing processes to help diversify the economy. According to ICIS, an international energy information company, 27m tonnes of sulphur was produced from processing natural gas globally in 2015, while a further 28m tonnes was produced as a by-product of oil refining. According to ICIS, 90% of sulphur produced is burnt to produce sulphuric acid, of which around 54% is used to produce fertilisers, 14% is used in the chemicals industry, and 9% each is used in petroleum refining, ore leaching, and plastics and rubber manufacturing. ADNOC hopes to see the existing urea and ammonia production operated by its downstream subsidiary FERTIL expanded in order to take advantage of the increased input. FERTIL currently has a daily capacity of 3300 tonnes of ammonia and 5800 tonnes of urea, and exports 1.9m tonnes a year. Carbon Capture Another way in which the energy sector can extract the most value from its natural gas is to reduce the amount it reinjects into its wells to boost oil production. One solution, which also enables the emirate to reduce carbon emissions, is through CCUS. Ali Al Janabi, chairman of Shell Abu Dhabi, told OBG, "Carbon capture technologies have significant potential, particularly after the world subscribed to the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change , and will be important to minimise CO levels in the environment." In 2013 ADNOC and Masdar formed a joint venture, Al Reyadah, to develop this technology for use in Abu Dhabi. In 2016 Al Reyadah began a project with Emirates Steel (ES) in which gas is captured from ES facilities, compressed and dehydrated at Al Reyadah's facility, and transported as CO gas for injection into ADNOC onshore oil fields as part of enhanced oil recovery, thereby freeing natural gas from use in the process and allowing it to be used for power generation. Al Reyadah, which is operating the world's first industrial-scale carbon capture facility from a steel plant, will capture approximately 800,000 tonnes of CO annually. The project was inaugurated in November 2016 by ADNOC's group CEO and chairman of Masdar, Sultan Al Jaber, who said, "This project will allow for the more productive use of a valuable commodity, natural gas, whether for power generation or as petrochemicals feedstock, or for export." In light of the Al Reyadah project, sustainability continues to take centre stage across the whole of the oil and gas value chain. One prominent example of this trend is Intecsa Industrial, a Spanish engineering procurement construction (EPC) company, engaged in a number of projects with Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company, including a waste-disposal facility for radioactive material, located in Ruwais. "We definitely see a theme of more sustainable and environmentally friendly factors, which opens up these kinds of projects to companies with the right expertise," Jose Carlos Gil, executive director of Intecsa Industrial, told OBG. "It has nonetheless been a tense situation for all EPC contractors, with ongoing restructuring and substantial levels of competition. We expect that 2017 will be an improved year," he added. \</doc>

AKUO Multi-countries Renewable Energy Programme. The EIB is continuing its partnership with Akuo Energy for a new programme of European renewable energy projects totalling EUR 330m of investment. Specialist in financing renewable energy projects, Natixis Energeco has reiterated its immediate support for the operation. The European Investment Bank (EIB), Akuo Energy, the leading French IPP in renewable energy and Natixis Energeco have today announced the signing of a tripartite agreement for the deployment of a new EUR 330m investment programme in renewable energy assets owned by Akuo Energy. The signing of this agreement brings the conference organised by the European Commission and the Ministry for an Ecological and Solidarity Transition, notably devoted to the need to develop the financing offer for investments in energy efficiency, to an end. Adnan Z. Amin, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), said at the Bonn COP 23 that 'energy efficiency and renewable energy are two sides of the same coin, inseparable for the success of the energy transition'. This agreement is another illustration of the major role the EIB is playing in financing the energy transition. A portfolio approach This programme was scaled in accordance with a portfolio approach that incorporates both technological (solar, wind, hydraulic and wood biomass) and geographical (European Union) eligibility criteria. On a similar model to that of the previous programme deployed by the EIB in favour of Akuo Energy, this new credit line could furthermore total 50% of the scaled total investment, or a net figure of EUR165 million euros. On the basis of this criteria, the programme should thus enable the project debt financing of some forty assets held by Akuo Energy, all of them identified and having a total capacity of almost 400 MW. -1This conference is an event associated with the One Planet Summit. This financing again illustrates the unrelenting work of the EIB and its partners in favour of climate action undertaken by private-sector players and which here translates into the availability of credit lines at attractive and enticing financing conditions. Natixis Energeco and CIC have reiterated their support Key partners for this programme's deployment, a number of commercial banks will participate in this operation. In this respect, Natixis Energeco has already announced its immediate assistance to structure the investments. CIC has also confirmed its involvement in the operation. The two French commercial banks had already taken part in the deployment of the first programme granted to Akuo Energy by the EIB in November 2015. Ambroise Fayolle, Vice-President of the EIB, says: 'The fight against global warming lies at the heart of the European Union bank's priorities, with it devoting at least 25% of its annual business to this issue. I am delighted to be able to continue our fruitful cooperation with Akuo Energy and its financial partners like the BPCE Group through a new programme of renewable energy projects in France and elsewhere in the EU totalling 330 million euros. By providing them with optimal financing conditions, the EIB is lending its support to the development of players involved in the energy transition.' Eric Scotto, Chairman of Akuo Energy, adds: 'Two years after the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change, we are very pleased to see that our partners are still as eager as ever to participate in the fight against global warming alongside us. In particular, and within a context where the competitiveness of renewable energies has more than ever been established, the financing lines put in place by the EIB, a key player in the set-up, represent valuable tools to support their deployment at minimal cost. We would also like to wholeheartedly thank the Natixis Energeco and the CIC teams who have again answered our calls and confirmed their further reiterated commitment to the energy transition'. Stephane Pasquier, CEO of Natixis Energeco, concludes: 'We are proud to again be able to contribute to Akuo Energy's remarkable development. This agreement will enable us to intensify our long-term commitment to renewable energy. The continued support provided to this sector by the EIB and its reaffirmed trust in us is helping reinforce the competitiveness of renewable energy in France, thus meeting European guidelines.'

December 5, 2017 The Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Mr Esben Poulsson, has praised the positive role played by the Chinese Government in supporting the global regulatory framework for merchant shipping provided by the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO). In his keynote speech to the Marintec conference in Shanghai today, Mr Poulsson welcomed China's close adherence to the implementation of national maritime regulations, applicable to visiting foreign-flag ships, in a manner consistent with the international maritime safety and pollution prevention Conventions adopted by IMO. He said that China generally avoided the tendency - unfortunately displayed by some other IMO Member States - towards adopting unilateral shipping regulations at variance to rules agreed internationally. EU Member States, for example, despite what were understood to be undertakings to the contrary, appear to be pressing ahead with the implementation of a regional CO2 data collection system for ships (including visiting non-EU flag ships) which is very different to that agreed by IMO for global application. The United States, meanwhile, shows no signs of ever ratifying the IMO Ballast Water Convention, and has adopted type-approval standards for the new treatment systems required that are different to those agreed by IMO. This creates enormous practical and legal challenges for ship operators which trade to the United States. Mr Poulsson particularly highlighted China's efforts to engage constructively in the development at IMO of new environmental regulations applicable to international shipping, and China's support for pragmatic solutions for their successful implementation worldwide. With regard to the current development of an IMO CO2 reduction strategy for shipping, Mr Poulsson said that "ICS was very encouraged that China, in collaboration with other important emerging economies, has come forward with its own vision of what an IMO CO2 strategy might look like, and has actually gone to the effort of developing a possible draft text." He continued: "We think that this text, proposed by China and others - if combined with the CO2 reduction objectives put forward by the shipping industry and other governments - could actually provide the makings of a truly ambitious agreement, which will provide a signal to the world that IMO is very serious about reducing shipping's CO2 emissions, and that it has a detailed plan for the development of further measures." With respect to the IMO Ballast Convention, the ICS Chairman welcomed the pragmatic approach taken by most IMO Member States, including the Government of China, which had accepted the arguments, made by ICS and others, that there is little logic - from an environmental protection standpoint - in requiring thousands of ships to comply until they can be fitted with systems that have been approved under the more stringent IMO standards which have only recently been agreed. While commending China's strong engagement with IMO, which he viewed as £ source for good', Mr Poulsson suggested that China's ability to contribute to positive outcomes during IMO discussions could be further strengthened if the China Shipowners' Association became a full member of ICS, alongside its other 36 member national shipowner associations in Asia, the Americas and Europe. "We enjoy good relations with the Chinese Government at IMO, and we very much hope that CSA will become a full member of ICS in the near future," Mr Poulsson told the Marintec audience, which comprised both Chinese shipping industry representatives and senior government officials. - End - For further information please contact Debra Massey on +44 1296 682675, email HYPERLINK dmassey@elabor8.co.uk Notes to Editors The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) represents the worlds' national shipowners' associations, whose membership covers over 80% of the world merchant fleet, at the various intergovernmental bodies that impact on shipping, in particular the UN International Maritime Organization.

November 13, 2017 Bonn, Germany -- As global leaders gathered at COP 23 in Bonn, 18 key leaders in their industry verticals, united in the Hydrogen Council coalition, came together to launch first ever globally quantified vision of the role of hydrogen, developed with support from McKinsey. In addition to being a key pillar in of the energy transition, the study shows that hydrogen has the potential to develop US$ 2.5 tn of business, creating more than 30 million jobs by 2050. Taking the Hydrogen Council's vision for hydrogen to the next level, the study entitled Hydrogen, Scaling up outlines a comprehensive and quantified roadmap to scale deployment and its enabling impact on the energy transition. Deployed at scale, hydrogen could account for almost one-fifth of total final energy consumed by 2050. This would reduce annual CO2 emissions by roughly 6 gigatons compared to today's levels, and contribute roughly 20% of the abatement required to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius. On the demand side, the Hydrogen Council sees the potential for hydrogen to power about 10 to 15 million cars and 500,000 trucks by 2030, with many uses in other sectors as well, such as industry processes and feedstocks, building heating and power, power generation and storage. Overall, the study predicts that the annual demand for hydrogen could increase tenfold by 2050 to almost 80 EJ in 2050 meeting 18% of total final energy demand in the 2050 two-degree scenario. At a time when global populations are expected to grow by two billion people by 2050, hydrogen technologies have the potential to create opportunities for sustainable economic growth. "The world in the 21st century must transition to widespread low carbon energy use," said Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation and co-chair of the Hydrogen Council. "Hydrogen is an indispensable resource to achieve this transition because it can be used to store and transport wind, solar and other renewable electricity to power transportation and many other things. The Hydrogen Council has identified seven roles for hydrogen, which is why we are encouraging governments and investors to give it a prominent role in their energy plans. The sooner we get the hydrogen economy going, the better, and we are all committed to making this a reality." Achieving such scale would require substantial investments; approximately US$ 20 to 25 billion annually for a total of about US$ 280 billion until 2030. Within the right regulatory framework-including long-term, stable coordination and incentive policies-the report considers that attracting these investments to scale the technology is feasible. The world already invests more than US$ 1.7 trillion in energy each year, including US$ 650 billion in oil and gas, US$ 300 billion in renewable electricity, and more than US$ 300 billion in the automotive industry. "This study confirms the place of hydrogen as a central pillar in the energy transition, and encourages us in our support of its large-scale deployment. Hydrogen will be an unavoidable enabler for the energy transition in certain sectors and geographies. The sooner we make this happen the sooner we will be able to enjoy the needed benefits of Hydrogen at the service of our economies and our societies," said Beno\'eet Potier, Chairman and CEO, Air Liquide. "Solutions are technologically mature and industry players are committed. We need concerted stakeholder efforts to make this happen; leading this effort is the role of the Hydrogen Council." The launch of the new roadmap came during the Sustainability Innovation Forum in the presence of 18 senior members of the Hydrogen led by co-chairs Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of Toyota and Beno\'eet Potier, Chairman and CEO, Air Liquide and accompanied by Prof. Aldo Belloni, CEO of The Linde Group, Woong-chul Yang, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Company and Anne Stevens, Board Member of Anglo American. During the launch, the Hydrogen Council called upon investors, policymakers, and businesses to join them in accelerating deployment of hydrogen solutions for the energy transition. It was also announced that Woong-chul Yang of Hyundai Motor Company will succeed Takeshi Uchiyamada of Toyota in the rotating role of the Council's co-chair and preside the group together with Benoit Potier, CEO Air Liquide, in 2018. Mr. Uchiyamada is planning to return as Co-chairman in 2020, coinciding with the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, an important milestone for showcasing hydrogen society and mobility. \</doc>

Although the UK's government ministers are reluctant to admit it, the legal advice is clear: that the Euratom Treaty, under which nuclear activities take place, is entirely separate from the EU foundation document, the Treaty of Rome. The UK could quit the latter and stay in the former. If politicians had studied the consequences of 'Brexatom' before announcing it, almost casually, in the explanatory notes of the legislation last January - and without warning to either the industry or our European partners - it is possible they might have hesitated. Unfortunately, the obsessive desire of Brexiters to rid the UK of the allegedly malign jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) swept all before it. As soon as the decision to leave Euratom was announced it was apparent that Whitehall was totally unprepared for its far-reaching implications. These include a halt to the construction of new nuclear capacity in the UK, thereby weakening the country's energy security and jeopardising its ability to continue cutting carbon emissions. Secondly, it threatens the continuing operation of the UK's existing nuclear plants on which today's electricity consumers depend. Thirdly it puts at risk the supply of medical isotopes used in scans and cancer treatment, on which thousands of patients rely. These cannot be stockpiled in advance because they decay quickly. Crashing out of Euratom has even more devastating and immediate consequences than the general "no deal" exit from the EU (about which many Brexiters remain bewilderingly and irresponsibly sanguine). There are no World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules to fall back on in the nuclear industry. Trade in all nuclear fissile materials, on which the UK's energy industry and its health service depend, simply becomes illegal on exit day. The stakes could scarcely be higher. Unless nuclear cooperation agreements (NCAs) are signed with over 30 countries before exit day, dire problems will emerge. In the longer term the UK's substantial and internationally respected role in nuclear research projects will also be in doubt. These include the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, a laboratory largely funded by the EU that employs many EU nationals. It also includes work at UK universities in the lucrative area of nuclear decommissioning, which offers great commercial opportunities for UK business. Without the guarantee of continued free movement of nuclear workers - including scientists, academics and researchers - which is currently guaranteed by Euratom, the UK's leadership in this field may soon fade. Fortunately, Whitehall officials, with help from the nuclear industry, are gradually getting up to speed. One sign is the Nuclear Safeguards Bill now weaving its way through Parliament. This will give power to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to implement current, and introduce future, regulatory safeguards. But it is only a partial solution, because it does not outline what form the UK's future relationship will take, with Euratom or other important nuclear partners outside the EU such as the USA, Canada, and South Korea. Furthermore, the government has to urgently establish a new regime to replace all the regulatory and research functions that have been carried out by Euratom for the UK since it became a member state in 1973. These include handling relations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). None of this is quick or easy. The ONR is mounting its largest recruitment drive of the last fifty years to take on all the responsibilities currently managed at EU level. Although the UK undoubtedly has the necessary talent, attracting and training qualified inspectors takes time. There is no guarantee it will be mission-ready by deadline day, currently scheduled for 29 March 2019. Although both the EU and the UK recognise that an agreement on nuclear cooperation is a priority, little progress appears to have been made. The prescriptive conditions agreed at the start of Brexit negotiations focus on three issues: the so-called divorce bill; citizens' rights; and the Northern Irish border. This restricts any progress on other critical areas, such as Brexatom. The slow pace of negotiations has not helped. Side-bar talks on a future nuclear agreement are urgently needed, so a quick nuclear deal can be reached between the EU and UK in early 2018. This would reassure the industry and potential investors. Four possibilities There are four possible outcomes for the UK when negotiations finally begin. One is full Euratom membership; another is associate membership much like Switzerland; a third is a bilateral NCA; and the last is a single free trade agreement bespoke to nuclear. The first two of these are impossible if the UK maintains its absolute rejection of the ECJ. Of the others, an NCA could lead to a full free trade agreement (FTA) and a template exists in EU/US agreements, though the EU would probably push back on automatic reprocessing rights until the ONR was fully scaled up. A bespoke nuclear FTA is therefore the most likely, but this will require a transitional period of two years or more and will probably not preserve the full Euratom benefits. Brexatom, once implemented, will remove one of the most important countries from this treaty, silencing one of the strongest pro-nuclear voices in EU discussions. This is an additional unwelcome problem for all who believe nuclear is an essential part of the energy mix for many EU member states. All this comes at a time when hostility to nuclear in the EU is worryingly widespread, although it is hard to see how the challenging carbon emissions reduction targets agreed at COP 21 in Paris in 2015 can be achieved without substantial new investment in nuclear. The 2016 EU reference scenario, the model for meeting the 2030 decarbonisation target, indicates that aggregated nuclear capacity of 110GWe is needed. On current trends, one-third of the current European nuclear fleet will be lost by 2030, so this would require 34GWe of new nuclear capacity in just 13 years. As of now only 7.5GWe is under construction, with a further 26GWe planned with no guarantee of moving ahead. An opportunity to expand cooperation Nuclear depends on close international cooperation to be successful. For that reason, NNWE believes the creation of a larger club of pro-nuclear countries, comprising EU member states and other countries bordering the EU, could now be timely. In 1957 when the Euratom treaty was signed neither the threat of climate change nor the urgency of decarbonising the electricity generation industry were understood. Today the need for new investment in nuclear plant is clear and it is important to try and convert the challenge posed by Brexatom into an opportunity. The Organisation for Nuclear Cooperation in Europe (ONCE) initiative would be based on a shared recognition that, alongside the maintenance of rigorous standards of openness, competition and safety, nuclear energy is an essential element in Europe's response to climate change. It would seek ways of ensuring that nuclear energy helps to deliver secure, sustainable and affordable electricity for the benefit of humanity. ONCE could include among its primary aims the safe delivery of nuclear energy at a price competitive with other low carbon technologies. In my view nuclear must be able to match the falling price of other low carbon energy sources if it is to achieve its full potential. If successful ONCE could compensate for the problems which Brexit imposes on the nuclear industry and create new opportunities for the sector. The announcement at COP23 of a new anti-coal group, led by the UK and Canada - both strong pro-nuclear nations - and supported by France, shows that where nuclear is adopted, unabated use of coal can quickly decline. The EU and its pro-nuclear neighbouring countries, which will soon include the UK, should help the growing economies of Eastern Europe undergo their clean energy transition, with nuclear at its heart. The potential disruption of Brexatom affects both the EU and the UK. However, as in most areas, the damage resulting from no deal is far worse for the UK. At the same time, it does offer fertile ground for a workable agreement since there is little, if any, actual hostility to continued close cooperation. Even the director of the UK's triumphant Vote Leave campaign in the June 2016 referendum has criticised advocates of Brexatom, very few of whom now appear to exist. If concluded, an agreement on nuclear issues between the EU and its former member state might start to build the trust and sense of common purpose which is sorely lacking in the current climate and which is essential for successful trade relationships in all industries.

The Paris Agreement pledges only a third of the action needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a major UN report has found. London experts have said the UN's Emissions Gap report is the wake-up call politicians across the world need. The report warned that countries and industries need to do far more to meet targets if it is to slow greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are contributing to global warming. Speaking as the report was published, professor of climate science at UCL Chris Rapley said the UN's findings should "refocus" politicians' attention on fighting climate change. He told the Standard: "This [the environment programme] we hope will encourage governments to crank up their efforts after the initial euphoria of the Paris Agreement faded and attentions turned elsewhere. The #EmissionsGap: #ParisAgreement pledges only 1/3 of action needed to avoid worst effects of climate change https://t.co/6IhlknrIntpic.twitter.com/RAg4yxN6Jm https://t.co/6IhlknrIntpic.twitter.com/RAg4yxN6Jm - UN Environment (@UNEP) October 31, 2017 "It did so perhaps because scientists' projections had showed the agreement meant we were moving in the right direction, meaning politicians thought: 'okay, we will just let the clock work now'. "This [report] shows - as expected - that the international contributions into the agreement were not high enough, and is exactly the sort of wake-up call that's needed." Tuesday's report comes as UN officials make a renewed effort to maintain momentum generated by the Paris climate accord. Read more Nature Geoscience climate change report 'dangerously misinterpreted' It aims to cap global temperature increases to 2C by 2100 compared to the average world temperature at the start of the industrial era. Edgar Guti\'e9rrez-Espeleta, Costa Rica's environment minister who heads the 2017 UN Environment Assembly, said the report shows that "we face a stark choice: up our ambition, or suffer the consequences". He added: "The Paris Agreement boosted climate action, but momentum is clearly faltering." A new round of UN climate talks known as COP 23 starts in Bonn, Germany, on Monday, when countries will take stock of their achievements and prepare more ambitious national goals. In a summary of the report, UNEP says current trends suggest even if current national commitments are met, a temperature increase of 3-degrees Celsius by the end of the century is "very likely - meaning that governments need to deliver much stronger pledges when they are revised in 2020." "Should the United States follow through with its stated intention to leave the Paris Agreement in 2020, the picture could become even bleaker," the statement said, alluding to Donald Trump's administration plan to withdraw the US from the global climate pact. On the upside, the agency highlighted "rapidly expanding mitigation action" and says carbon-dioxide emissions have remained stable since 2014, thanks partly to renewable-energy use in China and India. However, it cautioned that other greenhouse gases like methane continue to rise.

"They were told not enough was being done, and so they cranked it up. We can only hope that that is what happens here," he said. The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty that was designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out production of substances responsible for its depletion. It is hailed by many as the most successful climate agreement ever made. The potential future effects of climate change include an increasing number of wildfires, longer periods of drought, continued loss of sea ice and an accelerated sea level rise. Its effects have already had lasting effects on the environment globally, with glaciers shrinking, ice on rivers and lakes breaking up earlier in the year. While the effects the warming of the planet may vary for different parts of the world, it is widely considered to be the biggest threat humanity faces. \</doc>

Specifically, the meeting focused on catalyzing green investments to meet objectives of the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First, were opening remarks by Ivorian Minister for Safety, Environment and Sustainable Development, Anne Desiree Ouloto; and the AfDB Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth Sector Complex, Amadou Hott. Minister Ouloto noted the round table meeting was timely in addressing challenges related to sustainable development. She observed that financing climate change through investments that target reduction of green house gases and overexploitation of natural resources, helps vulnerable nations with mechanisms and instruments that are relevant, effective and accessible. 'Cote d'Ivoire supports such initiatives,' she underscored. The round table therefore presents a good opportunity to share ideas and experiences in green investment finance in West Africa and also stimulate other financial institutions and banks to engage in transition towards green economy for our nations, she added. Also addressing the participants, Vice-President Amadou Hott stressed the need for new models of financing to achieve climate-compatible development. 'The challenge of achieving climate-compatible development requires USD 1.5 trillion per annum. USD 700 billion is already flowing annually, leaving a climate investment gap of USD 800 billion p.a. Financing these investments requires new models where public finance is a vehicle to 'crowd-in' private sector finance,' he said. This involves reducing risk of green investments, increasing their investment grade and attracting institutional investors. 'AfDB is working on different approaches such as the Co-gurantee platform for renewable energy projects that we can work jointly with BOAD and GuarantCo to support renewable energy projects that require private finance', Amadou added AfDB's Director for Transformative Energy Partnerships, Astrid Manroth presented the AfDB Co-guarantee facility. Other presentations included West African Development Bank (BOAD) Green Bonds Initiative and REEF (Renewable and efficient Energy Fund) as a component of global climate change funding mechanism. All these are de-risking instruments aimed at fostering green investment in Africa. Discussions mainly centred around topics such as green climate and sustainable development investment potential in ECOWAS region, institutional framework, policies, challenges and opportunities. Options for enhancing green investment green investments including the development and access to regional and international capital markets, were also discussed AfDB Co-guarantee platform can mobilize financial resources Participants recognized that innovative instruments such as green -debt, -bonds and de-risking financial instruments (such as the AfDB Co-guarantee platform, the BOAD Green Bond programme and the FONSIS Renewable and Efficient Energy Fund etc.) can play a major role in the mobilization of financial resources. They stressed the need to develop commonly agreed standards for 'green' bond, as countries and financial institutions in the region seek low-carbon and resilient opportunities. They encouraged further awareness raising of regional financial and capital markets on investment opportunities. ECOWAS platform on finance for climate established A task force was put in place to facilitate formation of ECOWAS platform on finance for climate, with aims of knowledge management and dissemination, advocacy, investment mobilization, and coordination of investment efforts and activities, among others. The task force will also consider ways to enhance the existing ECOWAS Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) platform to enable it perform the platform functions. Participants agreed to hold the next meeting in mid-September 2017, to be hosted by the West African Development Bank (BOAD) in Lome, Togo. The ECOWAS platform on finance for climate will be launched at COP 23 , which will take place in November 2017. The meeting attracted more than 35 participants including representatives from UNFCCC, ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE), FONSIS, GuarantCo, West African Development Bank (BOAD), Bouygues, Sunu (a leading insurance company) and the Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres (BRVM), among others. This meeting comes at a time when countries across Africa are working towards diversifying their economies, to encourage investment and to move beyond dependence on low value-added commodity exports - and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Yesterday, 9 April, SSE joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a joint UK-Canada initiative, launched at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP23 , in November 2017. Powering Past Coal brings together a diverse range of governments, businesses and organisations that are united in taking action to accelerate clean growth and climate protection through the phase out of traditional coal power by 2030. Alistair Phillips-Davies said: "Since 2008, SSE's strategy has been to reshape our generation portfolio away from coal and towards renewables and efficient gas generation. If we want to avoid dangerous climate change, then it is clear from the Paris Agreement that there is no place in the future for electricity to be generated from unabated coal. "Joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance entrenches SSE commitment to the phase out of unabated coal by developing new, lower carbon electricity generation in a way that is good for people, good for the environment and delivers sustainable business growth too."

Good morning, this is Graham Russell bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 6 November. Top stories An investigation into how some of the world's biggest businesses and global figures in politics, entertainment and sport have sheltered their wealth in secretive tax havens launches today. The Paradise Papers - based on millions of pages of documents - expose the global environments in which tax abuses can thrive and the complex and seemingly artificial ways the wealthiest corporations can legally protect their wealth. The material for the Paradise Papers has come from two offshore service providers and the company registries of 19 tax havens and was obtained by the German newspaper S\'fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with partners including the Guardian. There is a video explainer here. Among the revelations: Extensive offshore dealings by Donald Trump's cabinet members, advisers and donors, including substantial payments from a firm co-owned by Vladimir Putin's son-in-law to the shipping group of the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. Twitter and Facebook received hundreds of millions of dollars in investments that can be traced back to Russian state financial institutions.   The Australian arm of the global mining giant Glencore moved billions of dollars through Bermuda. At the centre of the leak is Appleby, a law firm with outposts in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. Appleby says it has investigated all the allegations, and found "there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients", adding: "We are a law firm which advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business. We do not tolerate illegal behaviour." The Australian Taxation Office says it is ready to use information from the Paradise Papers to launch new investigations into global tax avoidance. The tax office has been working for several months with partner agencies across the world in anticipation of the new data release by the ICIJ, it said on Monday. "I am confident the ATO is in a position to respond decisively to this data release," said Mark Konza, the tax office's deputy commissioner, international. "We know and trust that most people do the right thing, and that many taxpayers identified as part of the leak will be meeting their Australian tax obligations. However, we investigate all leads and have the resources and expertise to take action against taxpayers or intermediaries found to be caught up in the illegal use of offshore structures or providers." Pauline Hanson gets on her "battler bus" today on a slightly belated start to her electoral mission to conquer Queensland. One Nation is hitting the road to make up for time as a result of Hanson being overseas when the election was called, and will start in Brisbane before heading north along the coast. The electorate offensive will reach Townsville by the end of the week, before going on to far north Queensland at the weekend. The latest Galaxy poll, published yesterday, showed 54% of respondents were worried the state would go backwards under a government controlled by Hanson's party, an increase of 5% in less than a year. While the poll confirmed Labor voters were the most worried, it also revealed 61% of LNP voters were concerned about a One Nation-dominated future. There has been a 99% rise in rates of gonorrhoea infection in Australia's cities but a 9% drop in rural areas over the past five years, according to a new report on the nation's sexual health. The annual surveillance report on HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections, which is released by the Kirby Institute in Sydney on Monday, shows there were 23,887 new diagnoses of gonorrhoea in 2016, with about three quarters of them in men. Men aged between 25 and 29 and women between 20 and 24 saw the largest increase in gonorrhoea infections. Labor is not letting go of the citizenship issue - it's calling for the Coalition to agree to universal disclosure in place of the audit others are demanding. Labor and the Greens plan on opening the week by prosecuting the government over its refusal to allow either a citizenship audit or disclosure plan despite lingering questions over MPs' eligibility. Alex Hawke and Josh Frydenberg were the latest Liberal MPs to be questioned about their citizenship status, something both strongly deny is in doubt. Late on Sunday Penny Wong called for Hawke and the Victorian Liberal Julia Banks -who denies claims she has Greek citizenship by descent - to go the high court. "Australians can no longer believe [Malcolm]Turnbull or his MPs when they say trust us," Wong said. Sport The goals are flying in from every angle and Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are on course to smash just about every scoring record in history. Their latest victim, Arsenal, suffered a 3-1 defeat that means they have lost four of their first six away games. Manchester United, City's closest rivals, lost 1-0 at Chelsea courtesy of a \'c1lvaro Morata header and are now eight points behind. The success of Dimitri Petratos in this season of the A-League is a case study for the future success of the competition, writes Jonathan Howcroft. He argues that players including Petratos, Daniel De Silva and Kearyn Baccus indicate that the competition must provide opportunities for local talent with high ceilings - particularly after failed experiments overseas. This should be prioritised over team success. Thinking time Matthew Abbott has covered sad stories around the world, from the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh to the South Sudan civil war, yet his work last year at Manus Island profoundly affected him. Here he writes about how in covering previous situations, there always seemed to be some kind of hope or will to fight. But on Manus, all that is left is a sense of despair. The common feeling among the men he meets is a desire to die. Miriam Lancewood has been living off grid, in the wild, for seven years now, a far cry from her previous life as a teacher in Australia. She can still pinpoint the exact moment she knew she had truly broken with social norms. "It was when the idea was born to wash my hair with urine," she recalls. Now she and husband, Peter, are walking across Europe to Turkey, with a tent and little else. The big question she keeps wondering about in the wild: where are all the women? And yes, it's Melbourne Cup week, when everyone goes over the top for a horse race and when the world's racing elite ply their annual quest, before going home wondering what the hell happened, again. It is a hangover from another era that gives annual licence to a national hangover, and no other national event can so conjure Australia's historic and reckless will to party. This year's Cup can boast a record-equalling 11 international runners, and Michael Hutak guides you through what to expect this year. What's he done now? The president will have plenty on his plate now so it's good that he got to relax with a round of golf with Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and world No 4 Hideki Matsuyama. They didn't keep score and held up white baseball caps bearing the message "Donald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater". But his next two destinations - South Korea and China - are expected to pose bigger challenges on the two defining issues of the trip: North Korea and trade. Media roundup There is not much room left on the front page once various pictures of horses have been squeezed in alongside the offers of Melbourne Cup expertise and sweepstakes (looking at you, Herald Sun ), but some did try. The Mercur y carries the story of Jo Siejka - a first-time Labour candidate and the only woman in a field of seven - who has triumphed in the one-time Liberal heartland of Pembroke. She credited her success last night to her positive campaign. The win is a huge boost for Labour ahead of Tasmania's state election. "Pem-broken" is the headline. The Fairfax papers look at the continuing citizenship rumblings, focusing on Alex Hawke and the Senate presidency. They also say Labor and the Liberals "have undertaken sweeping behind the scenes audits of all their MPs" despite being publicly opposed to the idea. And the Daily Telegraph targets housing affordability, saying red tape is preventing developers building on land that has already been released for residential development. In the past five years, just 115,000 houses were built despite enough land being released to take 805,000 new dwellings, it reports. Coming up The Australian Electoral Commission will hold a special count today to determine who will replace the disqualified senators Fiona Nash, Larissa Waters, Scott Ludlam and Malcolm Roberts. The UN climate change conference kicks off tonight in Bonn, Germany. It will run for 11 days, during which you can find all our COP23 coverage here.

PRINCE Charles has met with survivors of Hurricane Irma and Maria on a visit to the damaged British Virgin Islands - as its most famous resident Sir Richard Branson said the disaster had pulled the islanders together. PA Prince Charles met with the survivors of Hurricane Maria and Irma during his trip to damaged islands Charles was taken to see battered and crushed high school buildings on the main island of Tortola during a day spent witnessing for himself the destructive power of Hurricane Irma in the region. His motorcade stopped at Elmore Stoutt High School, the main secondary school on the island, which has been left to the elements after being badly damaged in September by the category 5 storm. Billionaire Virgin boss Sir Richard met Charles on Tortola at a reception for organisations and individuals who played their part in helping during the aftermath of the natural disaster. He told the Press Association: "As far as the British Virgin Islands are concerned the people were magnificent in the way they pulled together, everybody's helping everybody. Related articles Will Prince Charles step aside for William? Prince Philip marriage reconciliation attempts 'ignored' by Diana PA Charles was taken to see battered and crushed high school buildings on the main island of Tortola "People have lost their homes and others are putting them up, everybody's helping trying to get water back and electricity back on, and it's been tremendous." Sir Richard decided to remain on Necker, his private Caribbean island in the BVI, and brave the storm with his staff when it struck in September. Later a Virgin Atlantic Antigua flight was loaded with essential items to help the recovery effort, including blankets and bottled water. PA The Prince of Wales talks with staff and volunteers at the Red Cross Following the hurricane, the businessman called for a "Disaster Recovery Marshall Plan" - the US initiative that helped with the rebuilding of western Europe following the Second World War. Sir Branson added: "Strangely I sometimes think that in these crisis situations the community comes out even stronger after, then before.\~ "In times of trouble people pull together like never before, it's been like a war situation." Earlier Charles visited Barbuda and witnessed similar scenes of homes with their roofs blown off and houses standing at weird angles after being ripped from their foundations. PA The Prince of Wales looks at pictures of Virgin Gorda Today the Prince of Wales will visit the island of Dominica to meet survivors of Hurricane Maria which battered the country with high winds, torrential rain and flooding. Charles is on the final day of a three-day tour of the Caribbean to see for himself, with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, the destruction caused when Hurricanes Irma and Maria passed through the region in September causing destruction in their wake. Dominica's prime minister Roosevelt Skerrit speaking last week at Cop 23 , the UN's climate change talks, said about the natural disaster: "When dawn broke, the scenes of utter devastation across this once lush green island were heartbreaking."\~ PA Charles showed his support at the Youth Empowerment Project PA Sir Richard Branson said the disaster had pulled the islanders together He told delegates at the global summit in Bonn, Germany: "In some areas where houses once stood there lay mounds of dirt and debris, others had their roofs blown off, landslides scarred the landscape, trees were uprooted or laid bare and flood waters raged. All utilities were non-functional." Mr Skerrit said: "Two months later 95% of the country remains without electricity, our water systems are compromised, and many citizens remain displaced and in shelters." Almost all agriculture crops were lost, the nation's rainforests - an important tourist attraction - were decimated and the debris is hampering a return to normal life. PA The Prince of Wales visits the Youth Empowerment Project during a visit to the island of Tortola GETTY Charles visited teachers and students at the YEP youth center During his visit to Dominica, Charles will visit a number of settlements to learn how residents were affected by Hurricane Maria and how they are rebuilding their lives and communities. Charles will attend a reception at the Roseau Botanic Gardens where he will present its director with a letter from Richard Deverell, director of Kew Gardens, of which the Prince is patron, promising to offer support and assistance where needed. The UK Government has now committed \£392 million to help recovery and long-term reconstruction in the region with Dominica receiving \£317 million of the total.

Global carbon emissions are on the rise again in 2017 after three years of little-to-no growth, according to researchers at the University of East Anglia and the Global Carbon Project. It was previously hoped that emissions might soon reach their peak after three stable years, so the new projection for 2017 is an unwelcome message for policy makers and delegates at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 23 ) in Bonn this week. The research, published today simultaneously in the journals Nature Climate Change, Earth System Science Data Discussions and Environmental Research Letters, reveals that global emissions from all human activities will reach 41 billion tonnes in 2017, following a projected 2% rise in burning fossil fuels. The figures point to China as the main cause of the renewed growth in fossil emissions - with a projected growth of 3.5%. CO2 emissions are expected to decline by 0.4% in the US and 0.2% in the EU, smaller declines than during the previous decade. Increases in coal use in China and the US are expected this year, reversing their decreases since 2013. Lead researcher Prof Corinne Le Quere, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at UEA, said: 'Global CO2 emissions appear to be going up strongly once again after a three year stable period. This is very disappointing. 'With global CO2 emissions from human activities estimated at 41 billion tonnes for 2017, time is running out on our ability to keep warming well below 2C let alone 1.5C. 'This year we have seen how climate change can amplify the impacts of hurricanes with more intense rainfall, higher sea levels and warmer ocean conditions favouring more powerful storms. This is a window into the future. We need to reach a peak in global emissions in the next few years and drive emissions down rapidly afterwards to address climate change and limit its impacts.' Key findings: In 2017, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry are projected to grow by 2% (0.8% to 3%). This follows three years of nearly no growth (2014-2016). (GDP to rise 3.6% according to IMF figures). Global CO2 emissions from all human activities are set to reach 41 billion tonnes (41 Gt CO2) by the end of 2017. Meanwhile emissions from fossil fuels are set to reach 37 Gt CO2 - a record high. China's emissions are projected to grow by 3.5% (0.7% to 5.4%), driven by a rise in coal consumption (GDP up 6.8%). India's emissions are projected to grow by just 2% (0.2% to 3.8%) - down from over 6% per year during the last decade (GDP up 6.7%). US emissions are projected to decline by -0.4%(-2.7% to +1.9%), with coal consumption projected to rise slightly (GDP up 2.2%). EU emissions are tentatively projected to decline -0.2% (-2% to +1.6%), a smaller decline than the previous decade (GDP up 2.3%). CO2 emissions decreased in the presence of growing economic activity in 22 countries representing 20% of global emissions. Renewable energy has increased rapidly at 14% per year over the last five years - albeit from a very low base. Atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 403 parts per million in 2016, and is expected to increase by 2.5 ppm in 2017. Dr Glen Peters of the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Oslo who led one of the studies said: 'The return to growth in global emissions in 2017 is largely due to growth in Chinese emissions, projected to grow by 3.5% in 2017 after two years with declining emissions. The use of coal, the main fuel source in China, may rise by 3% due to stronger growth in industrial production and lower hydro-power generation due to less rainfall.' 'The growth in 2017 emissions is unwelcome news, but it is too early to say whether it is a one-off event on a way to a global peak in emissions, or the start of a new period with upward pressure on global emissions growth.' The team flags that persistent uncertainties exist in our ability to estimate recent changes in emissions, particularly when there are unexpected changes as in the last few years. 'Even though we may detect a change in emission trend early, it may take as much as 10 years to confidently and independently verify a sustained change in emissions using measurements of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide,' said Dr Peters. 'Policy makers in Bonn are preparing for the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement, that will start in 2018 and occur every five years, and this puts immense pressure on the scientific community to develop methods and perform measurements that can truly verify changes in emissions within this five-yearly cycle,' said Prof Le Quere.

ADB President Takehiko Nakao with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Takehiko Nakao today met with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and Finance Minister Snyder Rini in Honiara. Marking his first official visit as ADB President to Solomon Islands, Mr. Nakao discussed ways ADB can further enhance its support to help the country meet its development goals. Mr. Nakao's program includes a visit to East Guadalcanal to view the achievements of ADB-supported road and bridge projects, meetings with Central Bank Governor Denton Rarawa, meetings with development partners, discussions with non-government organizations and members of the business community, and an official address to Cabinet Ministers at the Prime Minister's office, where he will discuss potential opportunities for ADB assistance and policy priorities for Solomon Islands. He is also expected to participate in a ground-breaking ceremony to kickstart the upgrading of the University of the South Pacific's Honiara Campus, which is supported by a $ 15.4 million concessional loan from ADB. The President commended Solomon Islands for progress in transport, renewable energy, and public sector management. 'We must continue to work together to support broad-based economic growth, rural development, and improved access to basic services,' said Mr. Nakao. 'There is no room for complacency as challenges remain.' The Asian Development Outlook 2017, ADB's flagship annual economic publication, says economic growth in the Solomon Islands accelerated modestly in 2016 to 3.2%, but will moderate to 3% in 2017 and 2.8% in 2018 as the effects of expansionary fiscal policy dissipate. Tourism offers an untapped source of future growth and implementing the national tourism development strategy will help unlock this potential. ADB's support in Solomon Islands is aligned with the government's National Development Strategy 2016-2035. It is also guided by ADB's Pacific Approach 2016-2020, under which ADB is scaling up its financing in Solomon Islands and other Pacific countries, reforming its procurement and other business processes to suit the unique development context in the Pacific, and strengthening its country presence. With the opening of its Extended Mission in Solomon Islands in February 2017, ADB is better placed to support the government in project implementation, coordinate with partners, and foster knowledge sharing. Solomon Islands has been an ADB member since 1973. Since joining, ADB has approved 19 concessional loan projects totaling $ 123.42 million, 15 grant projects totaling $ 160.52 million, and 75 technical assistance projects totaling $ 31.2 million to the country. ADB supports the country's medium-term comprehensive economic reforms. Since 2010, ADB provided four budget support operations which have focused on fiscal discipline and improving economic productivity through state-owned enterprise reforms, fostering an enabling environment for the private sector, and improved access to finance and strengthening financial inclusion. Following the 2014 floods, ADB approved $ 12.8 million for the Transport Flood Recovery Project which is constructing and climate-proofing bridges and roads in priority locations. The Sustainable Transport Infrastructure Improvement Program approved in 2016 is a $ 78.8 million program, jointly financed by ADB and the Government of Australia, to improve the existing transport system in Solomon Islands by providing better access to markets, schools, and clinics and boosting services for rural communities. Through the government's National Transport Plan, ADB is working with government and development partners to strengthen government agencies to deliver priority transport infrastructure. ADB plans to join the Government of Australia and the World Bank Group in supporting the Tina River Hydropower Project, which will support the development of renewable energy for Honiara, and when commissioned will provide 68% of the city's power. Climate change is a significant risk to Solomon Islands and the Pacific. ADB is strengthening its climate actions by scaling up annual climate financing to $ 6 billion by 2020. ADB is investing $ 1.5 million to assist Fiji's Presidency of the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and will join the Government of Fiji's COP 23 Advisory Panel in November 2017. These events will highlight the unique climate change challenges in the Pacific. The proposed ADB-assisted Pacific Disaster Resilience Program will provide participating countries including Solomon Islands with quick-releasing finance to support early recovery and reconstruction activities following natural disasters. ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members-including 14 Pacific developing member countries. In 2019, Fiji will be the first ADB Pacific Developing Member Country to host an ADB annual meeting. In 2016, ADB assistance totaled $ 31.7 billion, including $ 14 billion in cofinancing.

HONIARA, SOLOMON ISLANDS --Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Takehiko Nakao today met with Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and Finance Minister Snyder Rini in Honiara. Marking his first official visit as ADB President to Solomon Islands, Mr. Nakao discussed ways ADB can further enhance its support to help the country meet its development goals. Mr. Nakao's program includes a visit to East Guadalcanal to view the achievements of ADB-supported road and bridge projects, meetings with Central Bank Governor Denton Rarawa, meetings with development partners, discussions with non-government organizations and members of the business community, and an official address to Cabinet Ministers at the Prime Minister's office, where he will discuss potential opportunities for ADB assistance and policy priorities for Solomon Islands. He is also expected to participate in a ground-breaking ceremony to kickstart the upgrading of the University of the South Pacific's Honiara Campus, which is supported by a $ 15.4 million concessional loan from ADB. The President commended Solomon Islands for progress in transport, renewable energy, and public sector management. "We must continue to work together to support broad-based economic growth, rural development, and improved access to basic services," said Mr. Nakao. "There is no room for complacency as challenges remain." The Asian Development Outlook 2017, ADB's flagship annual economic publication, says economic growth in the Solomon Islands accelerated modestly in 2016 to 3.2%, but will moderate to 3% in 2017 and 2.8% in 2018 as the effects of expansionary fiscal policy dissipate. Tourism offers an untapped source of future growth and implementing the national tourism development strategy will help unlock this potential. ADB's support in Solomon Islands is aligned with the government's National Development Strategy 2016-2035. It is also guided by ADB's Pacific Approach 2016-2020, under which ADB is scaling up its financing in Solomon Islands and other Pacific countries, reforming its procurement and other business processes to suit the unique development context in the Pacific, and strengthening its country presence. With the opening of its Extended Mission in Solomon Islands in February 2017, ADB is better placed to support the government in project implementation, coordinate with partners, and foster knowledge sharing. Solomon Islands has been an ADB member since 1973. Since joining, ADB has approved 19 concessional loan projects totaling $ 123.42 million, 15 grant projects totaling $ 160.52 million, and 75 technical assistance projects totaling $ 31.2 million to the country. ADB supports the country's medium-term comprehensive economic reforms. Since 2010, ADB provided four budget support operations which have focused on fiscal discipline and improving economic productivity through state-owned enterprise reforms, fostering an enabling environment for the private sector, and improved access to finance and strengthening financial inclusion. Following the 2014 floods, ADB approved $ 12.8 million for the Transport Flood Recovery Project which is constructing and climate-proofing bridges and roads in priority locations. The Sustainable Transport Infrastructure Improvement Program approved in 2016 is a $ 78.8 million program, jointly financed by ADB and the Government of Australia, to improve the existing transport system in Solomon Islands by providing better access to markets, schools, and clinics and boosting services for rural communities. Through the government's National Transport Plan, ADB is working with government and development partners to strengthen government agencies to deliver priority transport infrastructure. ADB plans to join the Government of Australia and the World Bank Group in supporting the Tina River Hydropower Project, which will support the development of renewable energy for Honiara, and when commissioned will provide 68% of the city's power. Climate change is a significant risk to Solomon Islands and the Pacific. ADB is strengthening its climate actions by scaling up annual climate financing to $ 6 billion by 2020. ADB is investing $ 1.5 million to assist Fiji's Presidency of the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and will join the Government of Fiji's COP 23 Advisory Panel in November 2017. These events will highlight the unique climate change challenges in the Pacific. The proposed ADB-assisted Pacific Disaster Resilience Program will provide participating countries including Solomon Islands with quick-releasing finance to support early recovery and reconstruction activities following natural disasters.

New coalmines will leave more people in poverty, Oxfam has said in a new report, calling on Australia to commit to no new coalmines and to end public subsidies for coalmining. The report comes as the Queensland and federal governments continue to push for the controversial Adani coalmine in the Galilee basin, signalling potential infrastructure support and "royalty holidays". The government's support for the mine, which would be the biggest in Australia, has been met with a fierce campaign of resistance from environmental, legal, social justice and human rights groups. Related: Queensland Labor denies split over Adani 'royalties holiday' The Oxfam report, More Coal Equals More Poverty, says the climate change impacts of coal-fired power will disproportionately affect the world's poor and - with most of the energy-poor households in developing countries beyond the reach of electricity grids - new coal-fired power plants won't bring them energy. "Renewables are the clear answer to bringing electricity to those who currently live without it," the report says. "The real cost of burning more coal will be measured in further entrenched poverty - through the escalating impacts of climate change and humanitarian disasters, increasing hunger and deaths and disease caused by pollution." The Oxfam report cites the example of the two most populous nations on earth - with emerging middle classes in the hundreds of millions - China and India, which have recently suspended or abandoned plans to build new coal-fired power plants in favour of renewable energy. China has suspended more than 100 planned or partly-constructed coal-fired plants and has earmarked more than $493m for renewables projects over the next three years. India's draft 10-year energy blueprint, released in December, predicts 57% of the country's total electricity capacity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2027, far above the Paris climate accord target of 40% by 2030. India and China also have nuclear power. The Oxfam report calls on the Australian government to prohibit new coalmines in the country and to end public subsidies for coalmining. It identified, in particular, the Indian conglomerate Adani's proposed Carmichael coalmine in the Galilee basin, which would be the largest coalmine in Australia's history. The state and federal governments are supportive of the mine. The federal resources minister, Matt Canavan, has consistently said the mine is " great news for regional Queensland and... will boost the Queensland and Australian economies". The federal government's Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility is considering funding Adani's coal rail line to the coast, while the Queensland government has reportedly offered Adani a "royalties holiday" worth more than $300m from state coffers. But the mine faces a financing impasse. Globally 19 banks, most recently Westpac, have either specifically or by way of stated policy committed to not funding the Adani project. Subsidising coal-fired power plants is "clinging to the technologies of the past", the Oxfam report says. "Australia's current stance is fundamentally at odds with the global shift to renewable energy and ignores our responsibility to help protect communities from the ravages of climate change, the opportunities for new jobs and prosperity through renewable energy, and the global goals of achieving universal energy access and ending poverty." Related: Adani offered $320m deferment of Carmichael coal export royalties Oxfam Australia's chief executive, Helen Szoke, said the development of renewables in Australia had been hampered by shifting government agenda and a lack of policy certainty over several years. "Against the backdrop of an imperilled Great Barrier Reef and extreme weather disasters, Australia's carbon pollution is continuing to climb - the tragic consequence of more than a decade of climate policy paralysis and short-term political opportunism," she said. "Renewable energy is set to power the fair economies of the future and Australia can make a choice to be part of that. Through its 2017 review of climate change policies, the Australian government has the opportunity to set a credible long-term goal and plan of action." The next round of global climate talks will be held in Bonn in November. But the meeting, COP 23 , is being chaired by Fiji, which has said it will bring the concerns of developing and vulnerable Pacific states to the fore of negotiations. The Pacific - which, as a region, has the lowest per capita emissions in the world - has felt the impacts of climate first and most acutely. Pacific states, many of which are low-lying archipelagos, have experienced cyclones and storm surges of increased frequency and power and are losing arable land and, in some cases, whole islands to rising sea levels. \</doc>

Considering the lukewarm results coming out of COP 23 in Bonn, it may seem foolhardy to believe in a world where we all enjoy driverless electric cars and every school and health centre across Africa is powered by clean, affordable energy. The targets set on carbon emissions are looking fragile, while the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has dominated the headlines over the past six months. But beyond the gloom, there is one palpable reason to be optimistic. We have reached HYPERLINK http://www.crownagents.com/docs/default-source/publications/crown-agents the-solar-revolution-1.pdf?sfvrsn=2 a technological tipping point This revolution is partly driven by the trickle-down effect of innovation happening in Silicon Valley and the car industry. As big brands have striven to develop longer-lasting and cleaner batteries to power our phones, tablets and electric cars, they have forced a huge leap forward in lithium battery technology. These advances are now being utilised outside those industries. Last week in South Australia, construction was completed by Tesla on HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/23/elon-musks-tesla-battery-in-south-australia-poised-for-final-testing the world\' s largest lithium-ion battery . It can store enough renewable energy to power an astonishing 30,000 homes. Yet to my mind the bigger story will be the impact this technology can have in Africa and Asia, where close to 1.1bn people still struggle to access power and must rely on expensive, inefficient and polluting electricity from diesel or petrol generators, with little prospect of connecting to the grid. Solar energy combined with lithium battery storage makes possible the delivery of reliable, off-grid power at a residential or community level. Smart technology can accurately monitor consumption, which means off-grid solar systems can be installed and maintained cost-efficiently and cost-effectively, however remote the location. Houses, schools, health centres, even whole communities, can be powered off-grid, cheaply and without burning fossil fuels. We estimate that households in developing countries could immediately save up to 80 per cent in energy costs by switching to solar technology from diesel and petrol. The challenge in making this solar revolution a reality is not a technological one. It is one of perception and of financing. Until now, a preoccupation with upfront capital expenditure and a failure to grasp the long-term return on investment from next-generation solar have hampered the scaling of solar power across low-income countries. But solar power is not as expensive and unreliable as it once was. Yes, there are examples of expensive, failed solar projects across Africa. But that\' s not the story now. The story now is that multiple, smaller, better-managed and monitored solar projects can be implemented to power communities. One thing that has changed is an understanding of how solar projects are costed. In the past, due to the perceived risk involved with solar, projects have been costed on the basis of upfront capital expenditure. But today, the reliability of solar power and the ability to project its long-term usage means that projects should be costed using the  levellised cost of electricity (LCOE) model. This values the unit cost of generating energy through a given asset across that asset\' s lifetime, not simply on what it costs to build it and plug it in on day one. This is how most wind generation power projects are costed and it can be applied equally effectively to solar projects. Using this approach means that, for example, the real cost of off-grid solar power is now below 20 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with the 60 cents per kWh of energy generated from small diesel and petrol generators. For just $2m, for example, every primary healthcare clinic in Sierra Leone could have 24-hour power. This is a huge, game-changing level of saving that stands to transform not only the individual lives of millions living off-grid, but the productivity of whole economies. What must happen now is that donor agencies and investors take a longer view on solar and back its rollout. The supply-side issues related to fossil fuels are driving the largest sustained push towards the commercialisation and large-scale adoption of renewables, not least in solar power. In 2016, HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/renewables-growth-breaks-records-again-despite-fall-investment renewables accounted for 11.3 per cent of the world\' s energy consumption, up 1 percentage point from the previous year. This increase took place in spite of a fall in investment in renewables in 2015. It was made possible by the dramatic fall in cost and a significant rise in efficiency of solar power. The facts prove that solar provides value for money  now money must flow to allow it to be scaled. The entire world could be powered by harnessing solar energy from just 1 per cent of the sunshine that falls on the Sahara. Solar power delivered through the grid is already a reality in parts of Europe, the US and Australia. But for much of the developing world, grid power is not a reliable option. We now have the chance to give a billion people off-grid solar power, providing them with clean, affordable energy. This could be an incredible, transformative moment and a tangible, viable climate-change victory. The financial and development returns on investment are clear. Smart money  whether public or private  should back solar. Fergus Drake is chief executive of HYPERLINK http://www.crownagents.com/ Crown Agents . \</doc>

THE latest meeting to discuss action on climate change made modest progress, despite the US stating earlier this year that it will ditch the Paris agreement. "It showed that the rest of the world is steadfast in its support for the Paris agreement, despite the backwards steps being taken by the federal government in the United States," said Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics. At the COP23 Coal is one of the dirtiest fuels, in terms of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. However, CO2 emissions from coal are falling: it is losing out to other energy types. At the only official event held by the US, there were calls for "cleaner fossil fuels". This was widely condemned. "Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit," said New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. This article appeared in print under the headline "Saying no to coal" \</doc>

"Like a drop of water in a bucket, on its own is small, but if there are many, many drops, soon it is overflowing." Erietera Aram's water analogy is apposite. His country faces being lost under the waves of the Pacific Ocean. Migration is the last option. We want to save our countries Aso Ioapo from Tuvalu The i-Kiribati man is in Australia delivering his message about the reality of climate change in his country, and of its immediacy. Each discussion, he says, is like a drop of water, adding to the one before it, slowly building understanding of the existential threat to his people and place. "Climate change is not something off in the future, it's not a problem for later. We are living it now," he says. The archipelago of Kiribati - 33 tiny coral atolls spanning 3.5m square kilometres of ocean - is the world's lowest-lying country, with an average height above sea level of just two metres. Most of the 113,000 i-Kiribati live crammed on to Tarawa, the administrative centre, a chain of islets that curve in a horseshoe shape around a lagoon. "My place is very small," Aram says. "If you stand in the middle, you can see water on both sides. We are vulnerable. One tsunami, one tsunami and our whole country will disappear." Related: World Bank: let climate-threatened Pacific islanders migrate to Australia or NZ Already, there is less and less of Kiribati for its inhabitants. The coastline is regularly being lost to king tides and to creeping sea levels, and in a very real sense, there is nowhere to go. The loss of land is causing conflict - Tarawa is growing ever more densely crowded, as families living on the coastline are forced inwards, infringing on another's claim. The next round of multinational climate talks in November - COP 23 - will be chaired by Fiji, and is expected to swing particular focus of the global climate debate to the Pacific, where comparatively minuscule amounts of carbon are produced, but the effects of climate change have been felt first, and most acutely. Assuming the COP presidency, the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, said he would "bring a particular perspective to these negotiations on behalf of some of those who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change - Pacific Islanders and the residents of other small island developing states and low-lying areas of the world". But the islands' fight to be saved was everybody's, Bainimarama said. "Our concerns are the concerns of the entire world, given the scale of this crisis." Aram and compatriots from Kiribati and fellow low-lying islanders from Tuvalu are travelling with the Edmund Rice Centre, a social justice group, across Australia. They have met politicians, unions, coalminers, and officials from the CSIRO and power stations "and we think they have heard our stories, they understand how serious this is". Related: Five Pacific islands lost to rising seas as climate change hits Recent reports from groups as disparate as the World Bank, the Menzies Research Centre and the Lowy Institute have suggested allowing open-access migration from Pacific Islands to Australia as a more effective economic stimulus than aid, and as a strategy for coping with the impacts of climate change, which are already beginning to see islands across the Pacific lost to the sea. In April, the former US deputy undersecretary of defence Sherri Goodman visited Australia, and said the Pacific was "right in disaster alley" and the region would be " on the frontlines " of widespread forced migration caused by climate. The issue of a mass migration is a contentious one for the Pacific Islands facing annihilation under the waves. Many islanders are resistant, but understand it may be inevitable. "We don't want to leave our country," Aram says. "We love our land, and it doesn't have the same meaning to be living somewhere else. We don't want to be migrants of climate, but if there is no change our country will disappear into the sea." It feels terrible, he says, to worry about one's country's very existence. "What will happen to my children's country, that's why I worry. What am I leaving behind? We are the voice of the children of these vulnerable countries." Related: 'Disaster alley': Australia could be set to receive new wave of climate refugees Aso Ioapo from Tuvalu says "migration is the last option of the Tuvaluan people". "Our history and our culture are very important to us, and we believe that this is the place we are supposed to be. We don't want to lose that, we don't want to lose who we are." Tuvalu has had an increasing number of cyclones, of greater intensity, over recent years. In 2015, Cyclone Pam sent massive waves washing over some entire islands. About 45% of the country's 10,000 population was displaced, the government said. "The cyclones are occurring more regularly, and they are more powerful now," Ioapo said. "We have to face that we might have to go to another place. That is hard. But migration is the last option. We want to save our countries." \</doc>

Economy minister Mohammed Boussaid and (central bank) governor Abdellatif Jouhari were invited to address the opposition's concerns around the liberalisation of the dirham before the finance commission and both parliamentary chambers on 17 January. 34\~ L'economiste, 24 Jan 2018. 4 Boussaid underlined the importance of the reform to the international consolidation of the Moroccan economy, while Jouahri shared the feedback gathered from various trading floors, showing that the market kept working as usual. 35\~ L'economiste, 24 Jan 2018. 5 The exchange rate of the dirham continued to evolve within a 0.3% margin above or under, in spite of the increase to 2.5% implemented by the reform. 36\~ Telquel, 18 Jan 2018. 6 Boussaid and Jouhari presented simulations created by the central bank and the finance ministry proposing that a hypothetical maximum currency depreciation to 2.5% against the dollar would increase the oil price by 1.6% (0.14 dirham/litre), and that inflation would increase from 1.5% to 1.9% in 2018 in a worst case scenario. 37\~ Les Ecos, 18 Jan 2018 7 However, -based financial services company JP Morgan believes the dirham could be depreciated by 7% during the next 12 months, and that the central bank may have to embark on further flexibility steps, namely by increasing the exchange rate fluctuation margin. 38\~ Les Ecos, 18 Jan 2018 8 International Monetary Fund (IMF) general director Mitsuhiro Furusawa expressed his satisfaction with Morocco's liberalisation of the dirham in a conference in (US) on 19 January. 39\~ Telquel, 20 Jan 2018 9 Furusawa claimed the greater flexibility will allow the economy to absorb external shocks and increase its international competitiveness. 40\~ Telquel, 20 Jan 2018. 0 Furusawa estimated that the increased potential growth will have to be accompanied by inclusion measures to reduce the high youth unemployment rate, through the promotion of education, governance and reforms of the labour market. ... as new agreements between EBRD and Morocco boost private sector Morocco signed two new agreements with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) during the visit of EBRD vice president of politics and partnership Pierre Heilbronn between 24 and 29 January. 41\~ L'Economiste, 24 Jan 2018. 1 The first agreement, to stimulate the financing of the green economy, was signed with the finance ministry, while the second, to create a collaboration framework for the development of the private sector and intraregional integration, was signed by the president of the Casablanca-Settat Region, Mustapha Bakkoury 42\~ L'Economiste, 24 Jan 2018. 2 Heilbronn met BAM governor Abdellatif Jouahri, interior minister Abdelouafi Laftit , mines and energy minister Aziz Rebbah , as well as the head of the Conf\'e9d\'e9ration G\'e9n\'e9rale des Entreprises Du Maroc (CGEM) (general confederation of Moroccan companies), Miriem Bensalah-Chaqroun , and head of the Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (ONHYM) (National office of hydrocarbons and mines), Amina Benkhadra . 43\~ L'Economiste, 24 Jan 2018. 3 According to the EBRD, the agreement aims to prepare jointly a co-financing product for green investments oriented towards small and medium enterprises as well as very small enterprises. 44\~ Aujourd'hui Le Maroc, 31 Jan 2018. 4 The new offer will capitalise on the experience of the Tamwil fund, managed by the Caisse Centrale de Guarantie (CCG) 45\~ Aujourd'hui Le Maroc, 31 Jan 2018. 5 The new product will benefit from the success of the MorSEFF , a financing line for renewable energy that the EBRD created in 2015 in Morocco. MorSEFF managed to raise (EURO)110m ($136m) via partner banks BMCE Bank and to develop the green economy in Morocco. Aujourd'hui Le Maroc, 31 Jan 2018. 6 Those agreements fall in line with the engagement taken during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP22) in in November 2016, to align the Moroccan financial sector with sustainable development. The agreements are likely to attract investments looking for sustainable and environmentally compliant projects. 47\~ Aujourd'hui Le Maroc, 31 Jan 2018. 7 Spanish MEPs protest against Morocco's oil exploration growth Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis addressed concerns on 30 January about the oil exploration activities of -based energy company in Morocco's national waters near the autonomous region of the Canary Islands (Spain). 48\~ Yabiladi, 30 Jan 2018. 8 Responding to the demands of Canary Islands president Fernando Clavijo , Dastis pledged that exploration will remain within the limit of Moroccan territorial waters. Yabiladi, 30 Jan 2018. 9 Eni signed a petroleum agreement on 20 December with the Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (ONHYM) (National office of hydrocarbons and mines) for the block, located on the continental plateau and facing the Canary Islands. 50\~ Le Desk, 17 Jan 2018 0 The agreement triggered criticism, with Spanish members of the European Parliament (MEPs) presenting their complaints to the European Union. 1 Florent Marcellesi , an Equo Party MP, accused the Moroccan government on 15 January of blackmail on immigration and terrorism issues, and called for an end to negotiations. 52\~ Le Desk, 17 Jan 2018 2 The MEPs are trying to block Moroccan exploration by demanding the application of the European mechanism of environmental protection to classify the Atlantic continental plateau (separating the Moroccan coast from the Spanish archipelago) as a 'Site of Community importance '. 53\~ Le Desk, 17 Jan 2018. 3 Morocco's exploration of its on-shore and offshore resources is increasingly attracting foreign investors. Operators in oil prospection will have to spend MAD 1.52 billion ($165m) in 2018, with ONHYM responsible for MAD 51m ($5.5m), representing an increase from MAD 1.27 billion ($136m) in 2017. 54\~ Le Matin, 5 Feb 2018. 4 The investments will cover a programme of seismic acquisitions as well as the drilling of six wells with one offshore. 55\~ Le Matin, 5 Feb 2018. 5 In 2017, hydrocarbon research covered a total territory of 170,002 square kilometres, including 22 on-shore licences and 77 offshore licences, and involved 21 partners by year-end. 56\~ Le Matin, 5 Feb 2018. 6 ONHYM's efforts to maintain its partnerships and seek new ones come in a context of an evolving energy sector following the decrease of oil price on hydrocarbon investments and development projects. 57\~ ONHYM quoted in Le Matin, 5 Feb 2018. 7 Electrical interconnection project to link Portugal and Morocco Energy ministry general secretary shared with the Maghreb Arab Press on 30 January the initial conclusions of a feasibility study on a project of electrical interconnection between Morocco and Portugal . 58\~ Maghreb Emergent, 31 Jan 2018. 8 The project is expected to enable the exchange of up to 1,000MW of energy between the two countries. 59\~ Maghreb Emergent, 31 Jan 2018. 9 Preliminary results are positive, paving the way for the creation of an electricity regional market including Morocco, Portugal, Spain as well as potentially France and Germany .

In 2009, a health notice ordered its demolition, but there has been no movement to either its destruction or rehabilitation in the following years.From the nearby headquarters of Cooperpuriscal, a farming cooperative that was established by the ministry of environment and energy (Minae) and is financed by a mix of public funds and local private businesses, we head further up the mountain.We are driving to a finca "" a smallholding, which in this case has 26 cows. The finca's residential building sits at the side of the road and does not hint at the modern construction to the back: brushed steel gates and fences contain healthy-looking cows that mill around on a perfectly-level concrete floor that drains down to a sluice.The representative from Cooperpuriscal explains the overall structure that has recently been installed and (after another visit to a neighbouring finca) is clearly created to a template. All of the cows' waste is captured in solid form in a structured production chain that produces organic, rich compost for use on the farm and for sale. The slurry gets washed into a polythene-covered tank that generates enough gas for the farmer to power the whole site.The retained compost boosts the yield on the farm's crops, which now supplement the cows' grazing on pastures, which increases and stabilizes milk production. Meanwhile, the milking process uses modern equipment and feeds directly into a hygienic, on-site tank that is emptied every two days by the cooperative's dairy lorry. - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Better dairy production. Cooperpuriscal now processes 10,000 litres of milk {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell a day in its modern plant {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell The result is vastly better dairy production, lower carbon emissions and self-sufficiency. The cooperative also helps the network of fincas (25 and counting) sell by creating a single brand, dealing with the stores and turning the milk into other dairy products in its modern pasteurizing plant. The plant has been constructed using cutting-edge technology on the outskirts of the town and now processes around 10,000 litres of milk every day.The owner of the first finca, Sevvilo Jimenez Montero, says the project has increased the profitability of his farm and made it more efficient to run. He had to put up about one-third of the cost of the development (mixed with cash and subsidized access to five-year credit from Banco Nacional), with the other two-thirds coming from Minae and the cooperative. As Montero shows Euromoney around the small site, he seems as pleased with the improvements as he is bemused by our interest "" and our clearly unsuitable footwear.The finca project is part-adaptation (the more efficient processes boost yield and water capture and storage lessens the fincas' exposure to climate variability) and part prevention (carbon-releasing gases are captured and used rather than emitted). But elsewhere on the same mountain slopes the concept of climate change is less theoretical: the slow ascent of the best-yielding coffee plants to higher altitudes, as well as the changing nature of the diseases that can blight coffee production, can be clearly traced over the last 25 years.Climate actionBack in the capital San Jos\'e9, Edgar Guti\'e9rrez, the minister responsible for Minae, says he dislikes the terms "~climate change adaption' and "~climate change prevention', saying these are both different sides to the same coin of "~climate action', which he says is a more useful way to view Costa Rica's approach to climate change.And it is a long-standing history, pre-dating the famous moment in 2005 when then-president Oscar Arias committed his country to becoming carbon neutral by 2021. The country is still committed to that target, although changes to the way carbon capture is now calculated make adherence within the next four years uncertain (the country's forests are predominantly older trees that use less carbon than younger ones).Guti\'e9rrez says his country's journey to climate change leader followed its time as an environmental "predator", when aggressive farming expansion saw the country's forested area fall to 27% in the 1980s. But shocks to this economic model "" a meat import embargo from McDonalds and a slump in coffee prices "" led politicians to seek a more diversified approach to developing the economy. The political commitment to our [climate change] policies is not going to go away because of our fiscal problems -Manuel Antonio Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz Guti\'e9rrez says the government is also now focused on the target of ensuring that carbon emissions peak by 2030 and it aims to have negative carbon emissions by 2050. Aware of the vulnerability of the dollar-earning tourist industry, the government introduced regulations aimed at stopping and ultimately reversing deforestation. Now somewhere between 52% and 54% of the land is covered in forest and the aim is to peak around 60% in the coming decade.Guti\'e9rrez also says the long-term shift was underpinned by the country's investment in education, which was boosted by its decision in 1948 to disband its armed forces. Since then, an environmentally friendly outlook became an ingrained part of the country's political culture. Protecting the environment and wide-reaching, proactive regulation is now an accepted part of life in Costa Rica.The new aggressive carbon-based targets have meant the government is now working on ways to tackle its biggest challenge "" transportation. The private car fleet has doubled in the last 20 years and the transport sector is now responsible for 44% of net greenhouse gasses in the country and 81% of all fossil fuel consumption. New tax incentives are being drafted to encourage the use of electric cars. But as the country is also facing some big financial challenges, can it continue to add to its regulatory burden and finance new carbon-cutting subsidies?'Playing with fire'In July this year, a local newspaper, the Costa Rica Star, ran a story on the comments made about the country's fiscal situation by the OECD's director of economics. Alvaro Santos Pereira, Portugal's former economy and employment minister, used strikingly non-diplomatic language as he summarized the OECD's report about Costa Rica's economic situation."Costa Rica is playing with fire," he said. "Without reforms, the country's fiscal situation could become a threat"\£6 it is urgent to stabilize the public accounts. Costa Rica has much to lose if the reforms that are currently in progress are not approved. Weak fiscal performance can hurt foreign direct investment inflows. It has been shown that FDI inflows are highly sensitive to internal conditions. Therefore, further deterioration of Costa Rica's fiscal situation could undermine its comparative advantage vis-\'c3 -vis other emerging countries in attracting and even maintaining FDI, potentially weakening its successful growth model."In August, president Luis Guillermo Solis announced measures to limit government spending and issue debt in the international capital markets to limit domestic liquidity constraints, but the impact will be marginal. If the international sale occurs, it will be the first from Costa Rica since 2015.But despite the apparent inability of the political class to find a consensus on the country's financial problems, there appears to be little threat of a spill-over into its aggressive climate commitment. - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Manuel Antonio Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz, {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell Costa Rica's minister of foreign affairs {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell "The political commitment to our [climate change] policies is not going to go away because of our fiscal problems," says Costa Rica's minister of foreign affairs Manuel Antonio Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz. "We have had difficult situations in the past." And yet Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz mixes in subtle warnings with reassurance regarding the durability of the country's climate-related goals. "We have to recognize that we have, in the past, received assistance from other countries," he says. "And that's one aspect to this challenge. We are now considered a middle-income country, and the international community needs to change the paradigm otherwise countries that have moved forward in such a clear way, like we have, are going to be going backwards very soon, because from the financial point of view the fiscal deficit we have is not sustainable." Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz employs an analogy to underline his country's precarious state in regards to fighting climate change. "The way I see it is the river is ahead of us and we want to get to the other side. There are some countries beginning to set off to cross the river and there are some, like Costa Rica, that are in the middle of the river. We are now in the turbulent waters and the risk of moving further forward is very high. We need somebody to pull us to the other side. It's not that we are just putting our hands out for grants "" we want to work with everyone. But what we don't want is to be excluded because of our relative success."Vulnerable A joint study by the Guatemala-based Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Dutch development organization, Humanist Institute for Development Cooperation, found that between 2013 and 2016 Central America received just 0.7% of global climate finance. Of that total Honduras received the largest proportion, $70.2 million dollars (nearly 33%), while Costa Rica received $35.5 million (17%), Nicaragua $32.2 million (15%), Guatemala $13.2 million (10%), El Salvador $32.7 million (16%) and Panama $20.6 million (6%). The region's relatively low level of support belies its low per capita income levels and the vulnerability of the region to climate events. "Central America is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world. That has to be recognized "" we are a very narrow strip of land between two masses of water. On one side is the Pacific Ocean and the other is the Caribbean and the Atlantic. Those produce a lot of potential for disasters," says Guti\'e9rrez. He says that last November the effects on the country of Hurricane Otto cost $183 million "" equal to 0.35% of annual GDP. "These extreme climate events will become more frequent with climate change," says Guti\'e9rrez, while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the cost to Costa Rica could be about 0.5% of GDP a year within a decade. "We have to test the commitment of the developed countries in particular to put these climate change funds in place," says Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz. "The $100 billion [agreed by the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference in Paris last year] is just a starting point. That's not going to be enough to solve this issue. There are going to be more than 150 countries trying to reach the same cake, so it's definitely not enough." As well as with the scale, there is also a problem with the speed and cost of multilateral funds that are being created to finance climate change adaption and prevention. "Even if these funds materialize, we have to expedite the process of accessing these funds," he says. "It is very troublesome and very slow. The criteria are not very clear, and that is a discouragement because the country wanting to access those funds needs to invest a lot in terms of paperwork and experts and travelling. And then not to see the results as fast as is needed is very discouraging "" because this isn't a problem that is going to happen in 50 years. It is a reality now. So if you are going to put funds in place, countries need to be able to access them as soon as possible." He says he hopes that the Paris Agreement "~rule book' will be finished by 2018 and that "we can then move on to the practical". In the past, Costa Rica has worked extensively in this area with bilateral projects "" with notable donor countries ("~partners' is now the preferred term) being Germany and Spain. A sprinkling of bilateral initiatives remains, and Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz points to the visit of German environment minister Barbara Hendricks in July, when a $15 million donation was announced. "$15 million isn't going to solve our problems, but it's a very important message that Germany is sending in terms of commitment to our goals and the world not forgetting about us, because at the moment most of the aid goes to Africa." Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz also says that while most activity is now at the global level, there is an important role for other international organizations such as the Vulnerable Twenty Group (V20): "It is important to use organizations such as this to bring together developing countries who are working together. The more voices that we have, the stronger we are, the louder our message is to the developed countries."Domestic market However, while Costa Rica will strive to access international funds, its environmental mission will be won or lost in the domestic market. Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz says that the country needs to continue to work towards a lasting balance between its commitments and competitiveness. "The private sector complains that the electricity in Costa Rica is too expensive, but what is the real long-term cost of producing energy with coal?" he says. "I understand the position expressed by companies; they are focused more on profits and we need to be competitive and we have some very expensive standards. So we need to find that balance and that should be reached by being more efficient in terms of production process. You can compensate for our costs by providing first-world services and providing security." Standard & Poor's analyst Cesar Barceinas says Costa Rica's ability to diversify its economy has been one of its strongest features in recent years. The tourism industry, accounting for 12.6% of GDP in 2016, has moved up the value chain, and the country now targets "wellness" vacations. The country's average stay, at 12 days, is one of the longest in the world and Guti\'e9rrez says 80% of the dollars earned in the sector go to small businesses. "Natural reserves constitute 20% of its territory, which has made Costa Rica one of the main destinations for eco-tourism, in some ways compensating for the negative impact that its zero carbon dioxide emissions plan to 2021 could have," says Barceinas. "This plan started in 2015 and, overall, has not affected its growth rate, which indeed increased to 4.5% in 2016 versus an average of 3.1% between 2013 and 2015." The country also has a clear intention to monetize its climate change credentials and is marketing its coffee to consumers, primarily in Europe, basing its pitch on the country's lofty environmental goals. The approval of a Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action is the first such agricultural accreditation in the world. This, it hopes, will mitigate competition on price from other producers such as Vietnam. Other initiatives aim to use Costa Rica's carbon-related credentials to boost employment and further diversify the economy. The government is launching its "~Green Hub' project to attract new revenue streams to the country. "We cannot give money to other countries, but we have a lot of human talent "" our technicians and our professionals are very good," says Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz. The aim is to encourage new carbon-friendly technologies and businesses to set-up in a country that is at the forefront of reducing carbon. This would validate Costa Rica's strict environmental regulation and allow others to benefit from the expertise and knowledge being built up in the country. Costa Rica generates almost all of its power with renewables and the marketing collateral being pitched to public and private organizations around the world describes the country as "a unique set of circumstances which make it the ideal country-scale laboratory for decarbonization." An example of that innovation is an attempt by the government to set up a carbon-trading scheme to bring in revenues from international companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions by buying into Costa Rica's decarbonization. In 2013, the country announced plans to sell 16 million tonnes of carbon credits over the next eight years "" a private-sector solution to fund its 2021 carbon target. The country sold 1.2 million tonnes of off-setting to the World Bank as part of the country's Forest Financing Fund that priced carbon at $5 a tonne. "It was a very good idea, but this market is very small and it never got the international recognition we need," says Gonz\'c3\£1lez Sanz. "We are not going to change the whole structure of the world economy and introduce carbon trading by just putting a few countries together. But we continue to emphasize this concept "" at the time we didn't have the Paris Agreement and we didn't have much international momentum. Maybe it was an idea that was too advanced, too progressive and the time wasn't right. But we can always pick it up and relaunch it." This final comment strikes at the heart of Costa Rica's approach to climate change finance. It is prepared to develop and innovate national plans, but these will only be truly compelling if they are supported by the international community. Costa Rica's tactics may change "" and it may have a severe test in the coming years thanks to its inaction on fiscal and debt policy "" but the commitment does not appear to be wavering. That goal will ultimately be achieved through a mixture of projects that target the adaption and prevention of climate change throughout the Costa Rican economy, from the large-scale carbon trading projects to those targeting subsistence farming. And while the national carbon goals are being met, many of these projects will also be enhancing the lives of individuals and communities in mountain ranges that are a long way from Paris. \</doc>

Operating in the US food market? If you thought 2017 was a heady mix of challenge and opportunity, wait for 2018, writes just-food's US columnist Victor Martino, who gives you six mega-trends your business must embrace to thrive over the next 12 months. It's not far-fetched to say 2017 has been the most exciting and dynamic year in the food and grocery industry in the US since the self-service supermarket spread throughout the country over half a century ago. That challenge has not come in isolation. The rise of these small, innovative, disruptive food brands goes hand-in-hand with the rise of the smart consumer. Technology &ndash; the Internet, digitalisation, the smartphone and social media &ndash; has shifted the power from food companies (and even retailer) to the consumer. Technology has empowered consumers in ways never seen before. Armed with a smartphone, a grocery shopper can inform themselves within a few button presses about a company, its products and even the entire industry. The spotlight on food companies\~is burning brightly. Gone are the days of top-down brand marketing. Instead, 2017 is the dawning of the consumer as brand. The evolution of this era of the informed consumer will see brands exist to serve consumer needs through a variety of customer-centric means. Consumers, not brands, are now in the driving seat. Get used to it.\~ Those food companies that do not understand the revolutionary change that is happening will eventually be acquired or eliminated. It's not your father's packaged foods industry any more. As we wind up 2017, a year of dynamism and innovation in the food and grocery industry in the US (and globally) and usher in 2018, six big mega-trends will have a significant impact on the sector starting next year and for some years to come, barring a physical or economic disaster. These are front-headlight areas for food companies. The winners will be those brand-makers and marketers who get out in the vanguard of these mega-trends. Transparency Consumers want to know what a food company stands for and what is and is not in the products it sells.\~ Technology is coming (much of it is already here) to fully enable consumers to discover this information on their own.\~ The takeaway for food companies and brands is to open the book. Third party start-ups are creating enabling technology to allow consumers to be transparency entrepreneurs. Packaged foods companies should partner with these start-ups. Simplicity Clutter in every way, including with packaging and brand messaging, is out.\~ Remember, the consumer is now the brand. She will find a brand, including retailer's store brands, that give her the experiences she needs. And she will buy it where she chooses, maybe even from one of the upstart private-label, online, start-up retailers like Movebutter or Brandless. Personalisation Since consumers are the new brand, it only makes sense they want to have individual and not mass experiences with brands.\~ Personalisation, which takes various forms, is in its infancy. But it is an emerging area for start-ups like Habit &ndash; which is backed by Campbell Soup Co. &ndash; San Francisco-based Platejoy and numerous others, all which have as their mission to not only disrupt categories but, in the longer-term, the entire status quo of food manufacturing, marketing, distribution and selling.\~ These are supply-chain disruption plays as much as they are direct-to-consumer alternatives.\~ The new consumer wants brands to speak to them. It is as much about experience as it is about price (within reason) and the other three Ps of marketing: product place and promotion. Brands that incorporate personalisation into the formula and mix will be better positioned to win the new consumer. Premiumisation Consumers want simplicity. Less is more (think food retailers Aldi and Lidl, for example). But they also want better quality and cleaner products.\~ While this might sound like a conflict, it really isn't. Quality store brands from the two retailers mentioned above, Trader Joe's and many others, are leading the way.\~ A brand is a brand to shoppers. They couldn't care less about industry jargon. This is an important point. In a consumer-centric world, industry players have to get out of their own heads and into the mind of the consumer. Remember, the consumer is the brand. As such, if she can save 20% with Target's or Costco's store-brand peanut butter and feels it is as good or better than the leading manufacturer-brand in the category, she will.\~ Sustainability Sustainability, which goes hand-in-hand with transparency, is now mainstream in the food and grocery industry &ndash; and 2018 will demonstrate its importance as consumers demand increased corporate responsibility from brands.\~ If you doubt my assertion, take a look at the Twitter feeds of Emmanuel Faber, the CEO of global food giant Danone, and Amanda Sourry, president of Unilever's food division. Today I'm at # COP23 to reaffirm @Danone's climate commitment. Our business is inherently reliant on agriculture, so we will help transform the food system, and work w/ our partners to build regenerative models of agriculture based on healthy & resilient soils. #OnePlanetOneHealth pic.twitter.com/NMvVRxaE6x &mdash; Emmanuel Faber (@EmmanuelFaber) November 16, 2017 The plant-based food & drink revolution is on in the US - and it's about to go mainstream HYPERLINK https://t.co/sHwS7BbTkx #WorldVeganDay #Vegetarian &mdash; Amanda Sourry (@AmandaSourry) October 30, 2017 If you blocked out their names and job titles in the Twitter accounts, you would think the tweets were being written by the founders of sustainability-focused, food product start-ups.\~ But they're not. Instead, leaders at two of the largest consumer packaged foods companies in the world are not only talking the talk in sustainability, they have fully incorporated it into their corporate and brand mission statements and strategies and are walking the talk.\~ Sustainability is mainstream. Phygital That is not a typo. You're going to be hearing the word phygital a lot in 2018. In a nutshell, phygital means the joining together of the physical and digital realms. The brick-and-mortar store and the digital e-commerce outlet, for example.\~ In the food and grocery industry we are still talking about the physical and digital spaces largely as two separate spheres. That's because until now the technology to unite the two has been lacking.\~ However, with recent advances in AI, AR and other digital technologies &ndash; with much more on the way &ndash; it is becoming possible to envision a seamless integration between the realms of the physical and the digital. Enter phygital. Phygital is going to change how brands are marketed and sold in dramatic ways. Imagine, for example, how the seamless integration of the physical grocery store and digital e-commerce site can enable brands to personalise offerings to consumers.\~ How about transparency and sustainability? A consumer walking through a physical store wearing a pair of virtual reality glasses, or perhaps simply using their smartphone, will be able to call-up on demand not only a product's ingredients but where it was grown and from where it is sourced, including details on the grower's chemical usage and his labour practices. Brand marketing will never be the same either in the phygital world. We're already seeing a dramatic change from traditional methods through digital marketing. Does anyone remember how we lived without social media in the industry, for example? \~It has not been around long at all but we have incorporated it into the industry so rapidly we tend to think it has been around forever.\~ Such is the rapid pace today of the incorporation of digital technology. It will only become more rapid. Phygital is the future &ndash; and it is coming fast. So, hold on to your hat as you enter 2018. There are other trends that will impact the next 12 months and the years after that. However, these six mega-trends collectively comprise a good roadmap for the food and grocery industry as we end 2017 and launch into 2018. My forecast is 2018 is going to be a wild and woolly year for the industry, filled with innovation, considerable change, challenges and huge opportunities.\~ New players like venture capital firms and former tech industry entrepreneurs have discovered the industry, like it, see huge opportunity, and are here to stay and play. They bring new money, along with new perspectives to what's traditionally been a conservative, slower-moving industry.\~ For example, we all know a few industry veterans who only first heard the term disruption applied to a product category or entire industry in the last couple of years. But that's the old industry, where the consumer was riding in the back seat and brands were driving the car. But the consumer is\~the brand now, enabled by dynamic digital technology and is sitting in the driver's seat. New rules are being written. Change is the only constant. These six mega-trends are a good place to start when drawing up your blueprints for 2018. just-food columnist Victor Martino is a California-based strategic marketing and business development consultant, analyst, entrepreneur and writer, specialising in the food and grocery industry.

The Company's Investment Policy allows investment in sectors other than onshore wind and solar PV of up to 20% of portfolio value. Investment in other categories, comprising a battery storage project (Broxburn) and an offshore wind farm (Sheringham Shoal), amounted in aggregate to approximately 9% of portfolio value at 31 December 2017. Previously commissioned UK renewables capacity still owned by developers is expected to continue to provide deal flow for the Company for several years ahead. Future acquisition opportunities also lie in other areas which may include further offshore wind and storage, as well as projects that may become commercially viable without subsidy, such as onshore wind projects and solar PV as deployment costs continue to fall. In the UK, the rapidly growing offshore wind sector is likely to match the capacity of onshore wind and solar once current construction is built out. UK operating offshore wind farms now have a combined 5.1GW of generating capacity with further build-out being projected; Germany, another leader in the sector, has a further 5.3GW of operating projects. Other technologies include other types of generation infrastructure, for example hydropower, landfill gas or supporting technologies such as storage, back-up / peaking power generation or demand-side response. Being able to acquire investments in other technologies depends on the availability of projects for investment which exhibit sufficient scale of opportunity and which conform to TRIG's risk/return profile. Renewables Growth Drivers Globally, the renewables sector is enjoying impressive growth on the back of national government policies and supra-national agreement via the United Nations' climate change initiatives. It is also being stimulated by reduced costs of renewable deployment, the imperative to secure energy sources in a volatile international political climate and, in many places, real concern about local levels of pollution emanating from fossil-fuel based energy sources. Creating a system capable of delivering clean, secure and affordable energy to consumers is a key challenge for policy makers worldwide. Known as the "energy trilemma", the need for carbon mitigation, cost effectiveness and energy security continue to underpin expansion in renewables. Carbon Mitigation The Company expects the deployment of renewable energy as an alternative to polluting fossil fuels to continue to play a vital role helping countries to achieve their decarbonisation targets. There is a general consensus that continued high levels of carbon emissions (whether for power, transport or heating/cooling) are unsustainable and there remains widespread public and political momentum to implement policies to mitigate the effects of climate change. Notwithstanding the US administration's notification of their intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, as announced in June 2017, significant headway has been made in other areas. For example, in December 2017, less than one month after the successful conclusion of the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn ( COP-23 ), the French President, Emmanuel Macron, hosted "The One Planet" summit in Paris. The gathering marked the second anniversary of the Paris Agreement and was the first in a series of international summits to help countries reinforce their national climate action plans. Over the course of the summit, Climate Action 100+ was launched, an initiative where 25 of the most influential institutional investors worldwide (with over USD $26.3 trillion of assets under management) agreed to engage with the world's largest 100 largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to encourage them to address climate change. Cost Improvement Across major markets, renewables technologies have benefited from subsidy regimes, helping to create the necessary market conditions to drive cost reductions to the point that renewables are now competitive with fossil fuel generation. In turn, there have been increases in economies of scale, supply chain efficiencies and technical innovation, all of which have increased competitive pressures that drive innovation. This may lead to future renewables becoming viable for developments without subsidies. Energy Security Growth of the renewable energy infrastructure market is supported by a long-term global shift towards achieving economic growth with sustainability. Continuing increases in human population, urbanisation, industrial and agricultural production and consumption offset the benefits of ongoing energy efficiency improvements and demand management. It is important that there remains a sufficient capacity margin and flexibility of electricity supply to meet demand as other technologies, including coal-fired power stations, are phased out, while addressing the intermittency of renewables themselves. The late 20th century focus on fossil fuel and nuclear generation as the mainstay of power generation (government-controlled or recently privatised and heavily regulated) has given way to a phase where renewable energy is replacing coal and to some extent nuclear following the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The future is expected to see a continuation of the shift away from coal, while the penetration of the power market by intermittent renewables will require significant amount of flexible power - for example from batteries as well as from standby gas generation. 2.4 Portfolio As at 31 December 2017, the TRIG portfolio comprised 57 investments in the UK, Republic of Ireland and France, including 27 onshore wind projects, one offshore wind project, 28 solar photovoltaic projects and one energy storage project: Project Market (Region) TRIG's Equipment(2) Equity Net Capacity Year Interest (MW) Commissioned(1) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Vestas Roos GB (England) 100% 17.1 2013 (1.9) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Grange GB (England) 100% 14.0 2013 (2.0) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Vestas ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Vestas Garreg Lwyd GB (Wales) 100% 34.0 2017 (2.0) Siemens Crystal Rig 2 GB (Scotland) 49% 67.6 2010 (2.3) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Hill of Towie GB (Scotland) 100% 48.3 2012 (2.3) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Siemens ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Siemens Paul's Hill GB (Scotland) 49% 31.6 2006 (2.3) Nordex Crystal Rig 1 GB (Scotland) 49% 30.6 2003 (2.5) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Green Hill GB (Scotland) 100% 28.0 2012 (2.0) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Siemens ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Senvion Freasdail GB (Scotland) 100% 22.6 2017 (2.05) Siemens Rothes 2 GB (Scotland) 49% 20.3 2013 (2.3) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Earlseat GB (Scotland) 100% 16.0 2014 (2.0) ------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ---------------- ------------ Gamesa \</doc>

There are grounds for optimism on making climate change progress without Trump, writes Lesley Riddoch Can climate change talks starting today in Germany make headway, without Donald Trump? The surprising prospect is they probably will. The Donald won't be attending the two-week COP 23 talks, but the Terminator will - and Arnold Schwarzenegger's message to the American president is uncompromising; "One man cannot stop our progress. One man will not bring back the dirty energy of the past." Why the confidence? On the face of it, the situation facing the 23,000 delegates gathered in Bonn is pretty grim. A recent report suggests the Paris Agreement commitments won't bring countries anywhere near the goal of capping further temperature rises to two degrees Celsius by 2050 - a failure that's caused scientists to predict catastrophic climate change. A day later the World Meteorological Organisation said carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surged at record-breaking speed in 2016 to the highest level in 800,000 years. Thanks to Trump's controversial decision to champion coal and quit the Paris agreement in 2020, the official delegation from Washington is the smallest ever sent to climate change talks - and the most controversial, with one Trump adviser set to claim coal and other fossil fuels can curb global warming. The good news for the planet, is that he's on his own. Delegations of US governors, mayors and business people have formed the "We Are Still In", group to reassure negotiators that outside the White House, much of America still supports the Paris Agreement. The US Climate Alliance, representing 14 states and one territory, says that it speaks for around 36 per cent of the US population and would be the third biggest economy in the world if it was a nation state. "So far, not one single nation state, city or county, municipality or school district has followed Donald Trump into the ranks of surrendering to climate change - his decision (pulling out of the Paris accord) has energised our efforts." Indeed another report published last week reveals cautious cause for optimism about what can be achieved through international agreement. Eight years after the transformational Rio Summit, 33 countries had peaked in their greenhouse gas emissions and have kept declining ever since. By 2010 the number of "peak emitters" - according to the World Resources Institute - had grown to 48 countries - including the US. If all countries stick to their emission reduction targets, the total in 2030 will be 52, including all developed countries plus China and Brazil. That represents 60 per cent of the Earth's emissions - all on the way down as a result of the Rio summit. The actions of civic society groups have also delivered change. Since 2016, protesters in Europe Beyond Coal groups have helped retire 16 coal plants across Europe, with 39 more set to close, and the governments of the Netherlands, UK, Finland, France, Portugal and Italy all committing to being coal-free by 2030. But problems still abound. The Bonn climate change talks are being held just 30 miles from Europe's biggest single source of CO2 emissions - large open-cast mines near Cologne. But members of the European Environmental Bureau - Europe's largest network of environmental citizens' organisations meeting today in Edinburgh are hopeful that political parties negotiating Germany's next coalition government can be persuaded to drop coal and make a strategic shift to renewables. Once again, Angela Merkel and central government isn't leading the way - campaigners and business leaders are. Germany's largest insurer, Allianz, recently pulled out of coal completely to invest billions in wind energy. Similar winds of change are blowing in other boardrooms - especially big pension funds - and experts believe their gigantic resources could help generate the $5 trillion needed to meet the UN's sustainable development goals. But why should any of this interest Brexiting Britain? Because in the area of environmental protection like so many others, "stand-alone" Britain may yet find itself to be an EU lawtaker, not an independent lawmaker. Of course environmentalists do fear that without EU controls and directives the UK will once again become the "dirty man of Europe" it was before joining the EU. Since 1974, more than 1,100 UK environmental laws on everything from wildlife safeguards to energy efficiency, air pollution and marine conservation have been made at EU level. According to the Commons environmental audit committee, 80 per cent of our environmental rules stem from EU directives. Without EU directives and the threat of a hefty fine, the UK government wouldn't have decided recently to ban diesel cars by 2040. Without the EU's Water Framework Directive and rules on transparency we wouldn't know the quality of water in our rivers, beaches and lochs. Without the Frankovich ruling - allowing individuals to access EU courts for damage by governments who fail to implement EU rules - citizens would have little redress. Since all of these are about to disappear, it looks inevitable that the environment must suffer. After all, important environmental protections (like the polluter pays principle) are enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, which will be impossible to "roll over" into the Withdrawal Bill. Britain will also have to set up regulatory agencies and shoulder those costs alone instead of sharing them. The biggest worry is that in the race to find new trade deals, old EU protections may get watered down or ignored. But Michel Barnier and the European Parliament are apparently determined to make sure Britain can't "eco-dump" - cut standards to win contracts. In any case, possible new trading partners like Canada already configure their environmental laws to fit EU rules - it's that important a market. It may be that when the UK government finally "takes back control," it will simply knuckle down and decide to do the same. And if it doesn't the eco-minded public could apply considerable pressure. \</doc>

China's green bond market, almost non-existent until 2016, is now the biggest in the world, thanks to the government's strong push for it. A specific ordinance by the People's Bank of China in 2015 set out a "~Catalogue' of what green bonds can finance. But it allows some uses of proceeds that many European or US investors would not expect in a green bond, such as "~clean coal' power generation. This is a constraint on foreign investment flowing into Chinese green debt, although several Chinese issuers have brought deals specifically aimed at global investors, particularly the big banks, which have used their overseas branches to issue from. At the COP 23 The white paper is also endorsed by the PBoC. It is the result of a detailed consultation over the last nine months between many green bond players, including investment banks, investors, external reviewers and NGOs. On Saturday a source close to the situation said: "The document has political relevance in the context of the strategic partnership that China and the EU are forging in the areas of climate and clean energy." The aim, he said, was to reduce uncertainty in the market and support new issuance for the widest possible range of issuers. Another source said the work had three primary aims: to make it easier for Chinese issuers to design green bonds foreign investors will want to buy; to guide foreign investors in what the Chinese market contains, and how they can pick bonds that suit them; and to help the internal Chinese market.Ultimately, the white paper could form a kernel of a global green bond standard, or at least, taxonomy. The team has compared use-of-proceeds classifications drawn from the Chinese Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue; the MDB-IDFC Common Principles for Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking, prepared by the multilateral development banks and the International Development Finance Club in 2015; and the Green Bond Principles. They have "mapped and compared core standards" that define what can be financed with green bonds, so that they can be more clearly defined and understood. "Development of a common language will enhance the confidence of both Chinese and international investors," according to the statement announcing the paper. It added: "Translation can help avoid duplication of verification and certification, and assist in reducing costs of green bond issuance." The green bond market in Europe and the US has grown up without any official standard of what is green. The Green Bond Principles set out how issuers should manage and govern the process, rather than how green they have to be. Instead, consensual norms have emerged, although there deals can still split opinion, such as when Spanish oil company Repsol issued a green bond in May. Meanwhile, as many as 40 second opinion providers give their verdicts on whether deals are green. The oldest and most thorough effort to set standards has been by the Climate Bonds Initiative, an NGO. Its standards took a while to become adopted, but so far this year have been used on $13bn of the $104.5bn of total green bond issuance tracked by the CBI.While participants continually call for more clearly defined rules or guidelines on what is green, the market has flourished without these. Neither investment banks nor investors want to scare away potential issuers by laying down rigid conditions. Standards will, however, be essential if the green bond market is to receive public subsidies, as a way to stimulate green investment. The possibility of that is now increasingly discussed in green bond circles. The European Commission formed in December 2016 a High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (HLEG), which is due to produce its final report by the end of this year. Based on its interim report in July, the panel may recommend creating a European green bond standard and a classification system for sustainable assets. The work done by the China-EIB panel could feed into that. The EIB is proposing to the HLEG the setting up of a "standard-neutral taxonomy of climate mitigating activities", followed by a set of specialist working groups to replicate this for other green areas, such as adaptation, pollution control, biodiversity and natural resource conservation. According to the CBI, most of the Chinese green bond criteria are in line with its own taxonomy, but three mismatches are that the Chinese standards allow upgrades to coal-fired power stations including clean coal; large hydroelectric projects over 50MW; and bonds with less than 90% of the proceeds allocated to disclosed green assets.Of the $104.5bn of labelled green bonds issued this year, $8.8bn is classed by the CBI as not aligned with its definitions, and much of this is Chinese issuance.The CBI has also worked closely with the PBoC and other Chinese organs for several years on developing green bonds. \</doc>

CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- A joint sitting of the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces will on Monday debate President Cyril Ramaphosa's State of the Nation Address, which received a standing ovation last Friday from the members of both Houses. The joint sitting starts in the morning at 10.00 and ends at around 20.00 in the evening. On Tuesday, President Ramaphosa will reply to the debate on his address, at another joint sitting of the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces starting at 14.00. On Wednesday, the Minister of Finance will deliver the Budget Speech to a plenary sitting of the National Assembly starting at 14.00 and also introduce the Appropriation Bill and table the Division of Revenue Bill. Close scrutiny of government spending and revenue collection is key to Parliament fulfilling its constitutional mandate of maintaining oversight over executive action and policy implementation. The Money Bills Amendment Procedure and Related Matters Act of 2009, based on the Constitution's provision that: "An Act of Parliament must provide for a procedure to amend money Bills before Parliament", has empowered Parliament to make adjustments to the budget as a whole, as well as to the budgets of specific national government departments and entities. Before the Act, Parliament could approve or reject the budget, but not make adjustments to it. The Act places great responsibility on Parliament and has begun to reframe the nature of the relationship between Parliament and the executive as the custodian of service delivery. Parliamentary oversight over the budget has become a continuous exercise. Thursday's plenary sitting of the National Assembly includes condolences for Mr Laloo Chiba. Mr Chiba was elected as a Member of Parliament in South Africa's first non-racial democratic election in 1994 and again in our 1999 election. The 28 parliamentary committee meetings scheduled for this week feature a briefing from the Minister of Finance on the 2018 Budget, a public hearing on the National Research Foundation Bill and briefings and consideration of another 10 Bills.

White House sources said Donald Trump would pull United States out of Paris climate agreement that Barack Obama signed the US on to Just two countries - Syria and Nicaragua - are out of the deal and countries still to ratify it include Russia, Iran and North Korea\~   Trump had faced an intense global lobbying effort from the Pope and European leaders as well as pressure from his daughter Ivanka but went against it Ivanka Trump had advised her father against an exit from the accord that commits participants to drastically reducing greenhouse gases   United Nations secretary-general led worldwide calls for Trump to change his mind and stay in the deal Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla founder, said he would quit advising Trump if he really did pull out of deal\~   Scientists claim that without the deal to cut greenhouse emissions, global average temperatures will rise by more than 2C - \~3.6F - this century Anti-treaty lobbyists say it will cost American jobs and Trump himself has previously called scientists theory of man-made global warming a 'hoax'\~ President Donald Trump \~says he will be revealing his decision on the Paris\~ climate change \~accord tomorrow afternoon from the White House's Rose Garden. Trump said he'll put an end to the speculation on Thursday in\~ tweet \~tonight that said: 'I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3PM. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' Earlier in today, Trump said he was entertaining arguments on both sides of the issue after press reports claimed he was pulling the US from the accord. 'I'm hearing from a lot of people, both ways,' Trump said of the politicking.\~ The president would not say which way he was leaning, telling a reporter who asked if he was likely to get out, 'You're going to find out very soon.' He offered a similar response to a reporter who caught him outside the White House an hour later. 'We'll be talking about Paris very soon,' he said of an announcement. After a period of intense lobbying that spanned the globe - and his administration - White House officials told several news outlets earlier in the day that Trump was pulling the US out of the international agreement.\~ Hours later, after the initial reports ran, an official told AP the administration was looking for 'caveats in the language' and Trump's mind was not fully made up. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par A source close to the talks who favors withdraw told DailyMail.com the situation was fluid, too. 'It's it's looking good but we're not totally out of the woods yet,' said the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Myron Ebell. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer would not say whether the earlier reports were true in an off-camera briefing, telling a reporter at one point that he 'obviously' would not know if Trump had arrived at a decision. 'I think the president's comments on this, that he'll be making a decision in the next few days, stand,' Spicer said in a shorter than usual session with the press.\~ {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par European allies had begged Trump not to ditch the pact last week, and the White House said the president was considering their position.\~\~ Wednesday morning, White House sources said he was pulling out - setting off worldwide condemnation led by the United Nations secretary general. Trump's eldest daughter, Ivanka, had advised her father against an exit, as well as a series of world leaders, including the Pope and France's new president, Emmanuel Macron. Billionaire Elon Musk said he would end his role advising Trump on manufacturing if the White House went ahead with quitting the Paris deal.\~ Pulling out will mean the U.S. joins Russia, Iran, North Korea and a string of Third World countries in not putting the agreement into action. Just two countries are not in the deal at all - one of them war-torn Syria, the other Nicaragua.\~ The president said Wednesday morning in a tweet that he would be making an announcement 'over the next few days' after\~ Axios \~said he was moving forward with plans to pull the US from it. Countries which have decided to stay in Paris were swift to speak out about the impending move to pull out of the climate accord including: United Nations: Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: 'Climate change is undeniable. Climate change is unstoppable.\~ 'Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.' Finland:\~Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila said climate change won't be reversed 'by closing your eyes' and called\~the expected withdrawal £ big setback'. China: Will reiterate support for Paris agreement this week during visit by prime minister Li Kequiang to Europe, European Union official told Reuters European Union: President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani said: 'Climate change is not a fairy tale. It is a tough reality which affects peoples' daily lives.'\~\~\~\~\~ Reuters similarly reported that Trump had tasked his EPA administrator with finding a way out. Trump said after his foreign trip that he would make an announcement this week about Paris.\~ He teased his plans again in a Wednesday morning tweet that said, 'I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\~ Axios reported that Trump has taken a position - it's the method of withdraw that's still being worked out. The administration is determining between a formal exit from just the Paris Agreement, a process that could take years, and a total rejection of the United Nations climate change framework that serves as the basis for the pact. Asked by DailyMail.com whether that report and others like it were wrong - and the president hasn't made a decision yet, Spicer hedged at his Wednesday afternoon briefing that the White House kept off camera. 'No, what I am saying is that when the president has a decision to make he'll let it be known. I don't think whether it's a personnel decision or any other action that we tend to get ahead of the president, he's the ultimate decider and when he has a decision to make, I'll let you know.' Ebell, the energy expert at CEI who was also the head of Trump's EPA team during his transition, said just before Spicer's 'gaggle' that it was his belief that Trump will say he's getting the US out, 'but we're not celebrating yet.' He told DailyMail.com he was advised by a White House official, 'Don't t take this as a done deal until announced.' 'The other side is making a furious counter attack now,' Ebell said. US officials have insisted that Trump has kept an 'open mind' on the agreement that 147 nations consented to and wanted to hear from world leaders on the topic as he traveled through Europe. 'The president is thinking about what his options are and has taken in what he learned from world leaders today,' Trump's chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, said Friday. 'I think his views are evolving, and he came here to learn and he came here to get smarter and he came here to hear peoples' - world leaders' - views.'\~ Spicer on Wednesday said Trump had\~'listened to a lot of people both here and industry leaders.' 'As Director Cohn mentioned last week he's consulted with foreign leaders, he's talked to industry leaders, he's had a lot of input and ultimately he'll make a decision.\~' Emmanuel Macron, the newly elected French president, said at a weekend summit in Italy he was sure Trump would back the deal after listening to his G7 counterparts. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par That hope appeared to have been quickly dashed. At a Wednesday news conference, a government spokesman said Macron had told a cabinet meeting France would be 'very pro-active' in working to ensure the Paris accord was implemented. 'Depending on the stance some people or others are taking, we'll have to be very pro-active for France to be the homeland of the (fight against) climate change,' the spokesman said. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said of a U.S. pullout: 'It would be disappointing but I really do not think this would change the course of mankind. 'There is a much stronger expectation from our partners across the world from Africa, Asia and China that Europe should assume leadership in this effort and we are ready to do that.'\~\~ The Paris Agreement is the first large-scale global agreement to combat what scientists say is climate change, coming together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. China and the United States had already committed to backing the deal in September 2016, with their greenhouse gas output accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world's emissions. To go into legal force, countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions had to sign on. The deal asks that the countries signing on reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Right now 147 countries have ratified the agreement to the 197 who attended the convention.\~ The aim is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius - 3.6F - this century. Part of the reason the Paris Agreement was successful was that ratifying countries can decide independently how to reduce their emissions rather than being told how much to cut by. The binding part of the agreement makes countries report on their progress decreasing emissions, while the actual setting of emission-reduction targets is non-binding.\~ The United States said it would try to reduce emissions from its 2005 level by 17 percent in 2020 and 26 to 28 percent by 2025.\~ Trump's most senior aides and cabinet secretaries have lined up on either side of the issue.\~ Cohn joined Trump's daughter and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advsior HR McMaster in a campaign to remain in the accord that Barack Obama's administration negotiated. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and Vice President Mike Pence were strongly against staying in the pact that requires the US to cut emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\~ A senior official told DailyMail.com as Trump prepared to make his first trip abroad that administration lawyers was battling over a proposal that would allow the US remain in the agreement, even if it does take steps to meet its nationally determined contribution to emissions reduction.\~ 'That is not something that we can support, obviously,' the source said of the Obama-negotiated NDC that starts at 17 percent in 2020 and ramps up. Some administration lawyers said a strategy like the one that was being debated would create significant legal risk for the United States and it would be better for Trump to stick to his campaign plan of full withdraw. Kushner is said to be leaning in that direction now, too. 'His basic position is that the standards need to be changed and the question is can you stay in the Paris agreement and can you stay in the Paris agreement with the changes?' an administration official familiar with the situation told DailyMail.com.\~ The United States European allies argued in private meetings with Trump that the US, the world's largest polluter after China, must remain in the agreement that urges aggressive action to protect the environment. They signed a communique at the end of the G7 summit that excluded the United States so they could reiterate their position. Hoping, perhaps, that a divine intervention would do the trick, the Pope also tried to sway Trump when they met at the Vatican last Wednesday. The head of the Catholic Church presented the president and first lady with a copy of his 184-page encyclical on the environment during a gift giving ceremony. Trump promised the religious leader that he'd 'be reading' it. WHO ELSE ISN'T IN PARIS DEAL? Whether the United States joins them or the larger group of\~ 195 countries which signed the Paris Agreement but have still to ratify it or bring it into force remains to be seen. The 50 countries which have yet to fully implement it are: Angola Burundi Colombia   Democratic Republic of the Congo Dominican Republic Egypt Eritrea Haiti   Iraq   Kyrgyzstan   Liberia   Lichtenstein   Montenegro   Myanmar   Oman\~   Moldova   Russian Federation   San Marino   South Sudan   Suriname   Macedonia   Togo   Turkey   Uzbekistan   Yemen   Bhutan   Cape Verde\~   Czech Republic   North Korea   Ecuador   Equatorial Guinea   Guinea-Bissau   Iran   Kuwait   Lebanon   Libya   Malawi   Mozambique   Netherlands   Qatar   Romania   Samoa (ratified only)   Serbia   Sudan   Switzerland   East Timor   Trinidad and Tobago   Tanzania   Venezuela\~   Zimbabwe As Trump waffled on the issue ahead of a self-imposed deadline to make a decision before the G7 summit that was shot after Trump bumped up his departure date to add a Middle East swing to his trip, conservative organizations prodded the Republican president to stay on track. A group of heavyweights\~sent the president \~a letter \~reminding him that withdrawal is a 'key part of your plan to protect U.S. energy producers and manufacturers from regulatory warfare.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee and 15 other Republican senators sent Trump a letter of their own last Thursday, putting additional pressure on him to yank the US out.\~ The missive tipped the scales, according to Axios.\~ Foremost was the claim of 'significant litigation risk that could upend your Administration's ability to fulfill its goal' of rescinding Obama-era regulations like the Clean Power Plan. Trump rescinded his predecessor's plan to cut carbon emissions by 32 percent by the year 2030 in a March 28 executive order that was highly celebrated conservatives. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The United States' ability to meets its nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement hinged on the implementation of carbon reduction plan that Trump said he'd work to toss out. CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENTISTS GO TO WAR ON TRUMP Scientists who have campaigned for the Paris accord rushed to condemn the White House on Wednesday. 'Today's rumors from unnamed sources at the White House are an indication that some of President Trump's ideology-driven advisers are trying to bounce him into withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.\~ 'A withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is likely to make it more difficult for the United States Government and companies to make trade and business deals with their counterparts in other countries where there is greater understanding of the risks of climate change and of the benefits of low-carbon economic growth.' Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, England. 'If Paris is abandoned or weakened, I fear for the future of our children.\~ 'Even more, I fear for the future of children in developing countries, who have contributed little to the problem and will feel the impacts first. Where will they go?' {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Gabi Hegerl, professor of climate system science, University of Edinburgh, Scotland. 'While it would be unfortunate if Trump pulled the US out of the Paris agreement, the momentum is so great and supported by so many nations that it will be no more than an unwelcome bump in the road rather than anything more serious. 'Individual states such as California will carry on doing what the rest of the world knows is the right thing to do on combating climate change.' Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre at the University of Bristol,England. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, warned Trump on Wednesday that his actions are likely to have long-lasting repercussions on the US economy and the United States' standing internationally. 'I think that our credibility will be undermined,' he said on CNN.\~ Other countries like China will fill the gap with green energy jobs and 'surpass us' in those industries, he argued on the network's New Day program. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also argued that withdraw would send a 'strong message to the marketplace to direct innovative, entrepreneurial investments in the clean energy economy elsewhere.' 'The majority of Americans in both parties know that climate change is real, and want clear, decisive action to arrest its dire effects,' she said in a jab at the president who once claimed climate chance is a 'hoax.'\~ Democratic lawmakers hammered Trump in statements that called the impending retreat 'catastrophic' and 'dangerous.'\~ Diane Feinstein, a California Democrat, asked Trump to reconsider before he makes a 'reckless mistake that will have serious and dire consequences.' Putting the argument in the context of the Syrian refugees Trump has tried to keep out of the US, Feinstein said, 'The world was not prepared for 5 million refugees from Syria. What will we do when many millions more are displaced by sea level rise, agricultural failures or disease pandemics?' The Sierra Club, a liberal environmental group, said the Paris Agreement would hold fast, regardless of what Trump does in a statement that slammed him as the nation's 'climate denier-in-chief.'\~ 'Make no mistake: the Paris Agreement was adopted after decades of climate advocacy by concerned citizens across America and around the world, and it certainly will not be derailed by the ignorance of one man,' said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune.\~ Republicans like Lee who'd cheered Trump on not surprisingly came to his defense as he took fire from the left for the expected announcement. 'The decision to withdraw will afford Americans greater economic opportunity and cheaper, more flexible energy choices in the future,' the Utah senator said. UN CHIEF SETS UP SHOWDOWN WITH TRUMP OVER PARIS\~ Climate change is undeniable and it is £bsolutely essential' the world fight the problem together, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres argued on Tuesday. Trump refused to endorse the landmark climate change accord at a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday, saying he needed more time to decide. He then tweeted that he would make an announcement this week. 'If any government doubts the global will and need for this accord, that is reason for all others to unite even stronger and stay the course,' Guterres said during an address on climate change at New York University, the day before it emerged Trump will pull out. 'The message is simple: the sustainability train has left the station. Get on board or get left behind,' he said. 'The real danger is not the threat to one's economy that comes from acting. It is instead the risk to one's economy by failing to act.' The United States is the world's biggest economy and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China. 'The world is in a mess,' Guterres said. 'It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement.' 'Climate change is undeniable. Climate action is unstoppable. And climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable,' he said, describing the effects as 'dangerous and accelerating.' Big emitters led by China, the European Union and India have reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris deal, which seeks to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting to clean energies. A U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent probable that man-made greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, are the main cause of climate change since 1950. Global average temperatures have hit record highs in each of the past three years, and warming is projected to cause worsening droughts, sea level rises, floods, heat waves and extinctions of wildlife. \</doc>

Donald Trump is pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement that Barack Obama entered President says he is protecting American jobs and accuses treaty of being designed to redistribute U.S. wealth to other countries   'I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris,' he said - 'It is time to make America great again.' Obama reacted before Trump even finishing speaking, saying action means U.S. joins a small handful of nations that reject the future'   Trump told 'foreign leaders in Europe, Asia and across the world' they would not have a say over American jobs and American growth Syria and Nicaragua are only other countries not in deal whose backers say is vital to stopping average temperatures growing by more than 2C this century   Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were said to have lobbied to stay in - and were not at the Rose Garden to witness the decision being announced\~\~ Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris accord on climate change on Thursday afternoon - deriding it as bad for American jobs and bad for the environment. He dared opprobrium from foreign leaders, environmentalists, scientists and celebrities to say he was putting the jobs of American workers first. 'We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they won't be. They won't be,' Trump declared. 'I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.' The leaders of France, Germany and Italy said the decision was 'regrettable' and that the deal was 'non-negotiable'.\~ Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire, said he was quitting advising the White House, tweeting: 'Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\~ Trump complained in the White House's Rose Garden that major polluters like China are allowed to increase their emissions under the agreement in a way that the US cannot. India is hinging its participation on billions of dollars of foreign aid. 'The bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States,' he said.\~ He argued later, 'The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.' 'This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,' he contended. TRUMP'S KEY WORDS ON CLIMATE DEAL On the accord...\~ This includes ending the implementation of the National Determined Contribution and - very importantly - the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the United States a vast fortune.\~ On its cost...\~ Compliance...could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Rconomic Research Associates. The cost to the economy at this time [by 2050] would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and in many cases much worse than that.\~ America first...\~ They don't put America first. I do and I always will.\~ The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices, and in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.\~ What he wants now... {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won't be. They won't be. Trump said he would end the United States' participation in the United Nations' Green Climate Fund for the same reason. The UN program asks developed countries to provide billions in foreign aid on top of what the US already gives.\~ 'Many of the other countries haven't spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime,' he said.\~ In another slap at the European leaders who'd lobbied him last week to stick with the agreement, including France's Emmanuel Macron, Trump said his Paris exit is £ reassertion of America's sovereignty.' 'Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the US economy that our own citizens and their elected representatives,' Trump proclaimed. For nearly half an hour Trump railed against the accord he said would result in 'lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life' for families in America.\~ 'The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense. They don't put America first. I do and I always will,' he said. He outlined what he said the accord would do to the American economy: 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025; $3 trillion in lost GDP by 2050; and an average household income loss of $7,000. Among Trump's reasons for leaving the Paris agreement was the 'massive legal liability' that administration lawyers had warned him about. The Republican president also said he could not back the agreement 'in good conscience,' from an environmental stand point. 'As someone who cares deeply the environment, which I do,' Trump said, 'I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States -- which is what it does -- the world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters.' Trump specifically named India and China as countries that can do what they like to the detriment of the United States' economy. 'China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement,' he said. 'India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Think of it: India can double their coal production. We're supposed to get rid of ours.\~ 'Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants,' the president said.\~ Trump ended months of speculation in the afternoon Rose Garden event that was promoted with all the anticipation of a major press conference. He sided with conservative groups over world leaders and his daughter Ivanka, declaring that the accord poses a dire threat to the American economy and jobs market. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Sitting in the front row for Trump's outdoor speech was chief strategist Steve Bannon, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Vice President Mike Pence - all of whom were part of a push to leave the agreement.\~ Ivanka was not there to see more conservative advisers applaud loudly as her father said the United States was out of the treaty. Neither was her husband, Jared Kushner, one of his closest aides, who had also been pressing Trump to stay in, especially if the US could lower the percentage by which it has to cut its emissions. Trump said Thursday that he would be willing to sit down with world leaders and discuss a new deal for the United States that serves the country's interests. The leaders of Germany, Italy and France rejected his offer in a joint statement immediately after. A White House official could not name a country that had expressed interest in new negotiations during briefing with reporters shortly after. All the Trump representative could say was that it was the administration's belief that US allies were going to want to make a deal to keep America - the world's second largest polluter - in the accord. POLITICOS AND CELEBRITIES REACT 'Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action.' ~ Al Gore \~ 'What President Trump did today by withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord is an international disgrace.' ~Sen. Bernie Sanders\~ 'Trump is having the U.S. pull out of the Paris Climate Accord. Too bad someone didn't tell his father that he shoulda pulled out, too.' ~ George Takei\~ 'Trump alienates allies, walks away from #ParisAgreement & sabotages health care.\~His presidency is all destruction and no accomplishments.' ~Sen. Tim Kaine\~ 'California will resist this misguided and insane course of action.' ~ California Gov. Jerry Brown\~ 'Today, our planet suffered. It's more important than ever to take action.' ~Leonardo DiCaprio\~ 'Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.' ~ Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk\~ 'Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world.' ~Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein 'Congratulations President Bannon.' ~ The Sierra Club\~ 'They have a strong interest in finding common ground with the United States,' the official said. 'We don't want to get out of ahead of ourselves here,' the person added as reporters fired off follow ups. Even if the US were allowed to adjust the terms of its participation in the agreement, it would not matter at the moment. An official who briefed the press could not say what a good deal would like in the president's eyes. Prior to the announcement, an official told DailyMail.com that the United State was unhappy with its nationally determined contribution to greenhouse gas reduction in the agreement. At Thursday's briefing on the agreement, a senior official could not provide a ballpark range for reduction when pressed by DailyMail.com.\~ The briefer would not comment on Trump's overall position on climate change, either -telling reporters to 'stay on topic' when it came up. Trump presented himself Thursday as an environmentalist and shared concerns that the Paris agreement in some ways does not go far enough.\~ He said in a 2012 tweet that was not far off from his other comments in the Rose Garden that climate change was a 'hoax,' though, and has slammed the idea that human activity has contributed to the warming of the planet. Asked about Trump's beliefs on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told a reporter, 'Honestly, I haven't asked him. I can get back to you.' The president's current thinking was still an unknown on Thursday. A senior official who was put behind the podium to answer questions on Paris provided the same excuse as Spicer. 'I have not talked to the president about his personal views,' the official said. A week ago, an official close to the talks said of Trump's position on climate change: 'I think what's not real is the environmentalist sort of conception of it, which is this like notion that we're on the cusp of a major apocalypse. 'Is the climate changing? Has it changed, sure. But that's like a trite point. So what. The point is sort of, what's driving it? What are the factors that are driving it. What's the human impact?' Continuing the official said, 'Do we care about that? Yeah, sure, we care about answering those questions...the federal government will continue to fund science and continue to try to get the best science back from our scientists.'\~\~ OBAMA'S FURY AT TRUMP MOVE Obama issued a statement while the president was still speaking, saying:\~ A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children. Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future. And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.\~ The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.\~ But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\~ For days, Trump had been hinting that he would make an announcement on Paris this week, but he would not say what he had decided, even after US officials told reporters Wednesday that he was pulling out. The White House tipped its hand just an hour before the president spoke when it distributed a set of 'talking points' to allied organizations that proclaimed, 'The Paris Accord is a BAD deal for Americans, and the President's action today is keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first.' The document said the US is exiting the international climate accord because it is in the best interest of US economy. A successful businessman before he was elected, Trump has already taken steps to end the 'job-killing' regulations his predecessor enacted in order to bring the US in line with the environmental pact.\~ In a May 26, 2016 speech to a gas- and oil-friendly crowd in Bismarck, North Dakota, he had declared flatly: 'We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement.' Trump also said then that if he were elected he would stop making payments to United Nations programs that fight global warming. The talking points the White House gave to conservative organizations on Thursday said, 'The Accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama Administration and signed out of desperation.' Trump, the most unpredictable U.S. president in a century, performed as expected in his speech directly after, despite sending signals of ambivalence about his yes-or-no decision during the week and telling reporters that he was 'hearing from a lot of people, both ways.' Asked if he was leaning toward an exit, Trump would only say: 'You're going to find out very soon.' European allies had begged Trump not to ditch the pact last week, and the White House said the president was considering their position, even though that did not appear to be the case on Thursday. Trump specifically smacked leaders in 'Europe' and 'Asia' - the two continents he just visited. When White House sources said he was pulling out on Wednesday morning, the reports set off worldwide condemnation led by the United Nations secretary general. The Vatican called the move a 'slap in the face' before it was announced.\~ Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, said: 'If he really does [pull out], it would be a huge slap in the face for us. It will be a disaster for everyone.' PRIME MINISTERS, PRESIDENTS AND BUSINESS TAKE ON TRUMP Countries which have decided to stay in Paris were swift to speak out about the impending move to pull out of the climate accord including: United Nations: Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: 'Climate change is undeniable.

Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Google, Gap, Mars and Tiffany & Co. joined a group of large businesses in publishing an open letter to Trump asking him not to end the United States participation in the global warming agreement. Their ask ran as a full page ad in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.\~ Minutes after Trump's announcement, Tesla's Elon Musk said he was cutting ties with the White House. 'Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,' Musk tweeted. Hours later, Disney CEO Bob Iger made the same announcement.\~ 'As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement\~withdrawal,' Iger tweeted.\~ The billionaire had warned Wednesday that he would no longer participant in White House councils if Trump went ahead with his plans to exit Paris. It was apparent Thursday, that the president didn't care.\~ WHAT WAS PARIS AGREEMENT? United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. China and the United States had already committed to backing the deal in September 2016, with their greenhouse gas output accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world's emissions. To go into legal force, countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions had to sign on. The deal asks that the countries signing on reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Right now 147 countries have ratified the agreement to the 197 who attended the convention.\~ The aim is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius - 3.6F - this century. Part of the reason the Paris Agreement was successful was that ratifying countries can decide independently how to reduce their emissions rather than being told how much to cut by. The binding part of the agreement makes countries report on their progress decreasing emissions, while the actual setting of emission-reduction targets is non-binding.\~ The United States said it would try to reduce emissions from its 2005 level by 17 percent in 2020 and 26 to 28 percent by 2025. \</doc>

Trump tweeted at 9pm on Wednesday: 'I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3PM. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' As of Wednesday afternoon, he claimed that despite press reports that he was determined to pull the US from the accord, that he continues to entertain arguments on both sides of the issue. The president would not say which way he was leaning, telling a reporter who asked if he was likely to get out, 'You're going to find out very soon.' He offered a similar response to a reporter who caught him outside the White House an hour later. 'We'll be talking about Paris very soon,' he said of an announcement. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par After a period of intense lobbying that spanned the globe - and his administration - White House officials told several news outlets earlier in the day that Trump was pulling the US out of the international agreement.\~\~ Hours later, after the initial reports ran, an official told AP the administration was looking for 'caveats in the language' and Trump's mind was not fully made up. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par A source close to the talks who favors withdraw told DailyMail.com the situation was fluid, too.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer would not say whether the earlier reports were true in an off-camera briefing, telling a reporter at one point that he 'obviously' would not know if Trump had arrived at a decision. 'I think the president's comments on this, that he'll be making a decision in the next few days, stand,' Spicer said in a shorter than usual session with the press.\~ {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par European allies had begged Trump not to ditch the pact last week, and the White House said the president was considering their position.\~\~ Wednesday morning, White House sources said he was pulling out - setting off worldwide condemnation led by the United Nations secretary general.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'\~ Axios reported that Trump has taken a position - it's the method of withdraw that's still being worked out. The administration is determining between a formal exit from just the Paris Agreement, a process that could take years, and a total rejection of the United Nations climate change framework that serves as the basis for the pact. Asked by DailyMail.com whether that report and others like it were wrong - and the president hasn't made a decision yet, Spicer hedged at his Wednesday afternoon briefing that the White House kept off camera. 'No, what I am saying is that when the president has a decision to make he'll let it be known. I don't think whether it's a personnel decision or any other action that we tend to get ahead of the president, he's the ultimate decider and when he has a decision to make, I'll let you know.' Ebell, the energy expert at CEI who was also the head of Trump's EPA team during his transition, said just before Spicer's 'gaggle' that it was his belief that Trump will say he's getting the US out, 'but we're not celebrating yet.' He told DailyMail.com he was advised by a White House official, 'Don't t take this as a done deal until announced.' 'The other side is making a furious counter attack now,' Ebell said. US officials have insisted that Trump has kept an 'open mind' on the agreement that 147 nations consented to and wanted to hear from world leaders on the topic as he traveled through Europe. 'The president is thinking about what his options are and has taken in what he learned from world leaders today,' Trump's chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn, said Friday. 'I think his views are evolving, and he came here to learn and he came here to get smarter and he came here to hear peoples' - world leaders' - views.'\~ Spicer on Wednesday said Trump had\~'listened to a lot of people both here and industry leaders.' 'As Director Cohn mentioned last week he's consulted with foreign leaders, he's talked to industry leaders, he's had a lot of input and ultimately he'll make a decision.\~' Emmanuel Macron, the newly elected French president, said at a weekend summit in Italy he was sure Trump would back the deal after listening to his G7 counterparts. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par That hope appeared to have been quickly dashed. At a Wednesday news conference, a government spokesman said Macron had told a cabinet meeting France would be 'very pro-active' in working to ensure the Paris accord was implemented. 'Depending on the stance some people or others are taking, we'll have to be very pro-active for France to be the homeland of the (fight against) climate change,' the spokesman said. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said of a U.S. pullout: 'It would be disappointing but I really do not think this would change the course of mankind. 'There is a much stronger expectation from our partners across the world from Africa, Asia and China that Europe should assume leadership in this effort and we are ready to do that.'\~\~ The Paris Agreement is the first large-scale global agreement to combat what scientists say is climate change, coming together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States.

EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and Vice President Mike Pence were strongly against staying in the pact that requires the US to cut emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\~ A senior official told DailyMail.com as Trump prepared to make his first trip abroad that administration lawyers was battling over a proposal that would allow the US remain in the agreement, even if it does take steps to meet its nationally determined contribution to emissions reduction.\~ 'That is not something that we can support, obviously,' the source said of the Obama-negotiated NDC that starts at 17 percent in 2020 and ramps up. Some administration lawyers said a strategy like the one that was being debated would create significant legal risk for the United States and it would be better for Trump to stick to his campaign plan of full withdraw. Kushner is said to be leaning in that direction now, too. 'His basic position is that the standards need to be changed and the question is can you stay in the Paris agreement and can you stay in the Paris agreement with the changes?' an administration official familiar with the situation told DailyMail.com.\~ The United States European allies argued in private meetings with Trump that the US, the world's largest polluter after China, must remain in the agreement that urges aggressive action to protect the environment. They signed a communique at the end of the G7 summit that excluded the United States so they could reiterate their position. Hoping, perhaps, that a divine intervention would do the trick, the Pope also tried to sway Trump when they met at the Vatican last Wednesday. The head of the Catholic Church presented the president and first lady with a copy of his 184-page encyclical on the environment during a gift giving ceremony. Trump promised the religious leader that he'd 'be reading' it. WHO ELSE ISN'T IN PARIS DEAL? Whether the United States joins them or the larger group of\~ 195 countries which signed the Paris Agreement but have still to ratify it or bring it into force remains to be seen. The 50 countries which have yet to fully implement it are: Angola Burundi Colombia   Democratic Republic of the Congo Dominican Republic Egypt Eritrea Haiti   Iraq   Kyrgyzstan   Liberia   Lichtenstein   Montenegro   Myanmar   Oman\~   Moldova   Russian Federation   San Marino   South Sudan   Suriname   Macedonia   Togo   Turkey   Uzbekistan   Yemen   Bhutan   Cape Verde\~   Czech Republic   North Korea   Ecuador   Equatorial Guinea   Guinea-Bissau   Iran   Kuwait   Lebanon   Libya   Malawi   Mozambique   Netherlands   Qatar   Romania   Samoa (ratified only)   Serbia   Sudan   Switzerland   East Timor   Trinidad and Tobago   Tanzania   Venezuela\~   Zimbabwe As Trump waffled on the issue ahead of a self-imposed deadline to make a decision before the G7 summit that was shot after Trump bumped up his departure date to add a Middle East swing to his trip, conservative organizations prodded the Republican president to stay on track. A group of heavyweights\~sent the president \~a letter \~reminding him that withdrawal is a 'key part of your plan to protect U.S. energy producers and manufacturers from regulatory warfare.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee and 15 other Republican senators sent Trump a letter of their own last Thursday, putting additional pressure on him to yank the US out.\~ The missive tipped the scales, according to Axios.\~ Foremost was the claim of 'significant litigation risk that could upend your Administration's ability to fulfill its goal' of rescinding Obama-era regulations like the Clean Power Plan. Trump rescinded his predecessor's plan to cut carbon emissions by 32 percent by the year 2030 in a March 28 executive order that was highly celebrated conservatives. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The United States' ability to meets its nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement hinged on the implementation of carbon reduction plan that Trump said he'd work to toss out. CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENTISTS GO TO WAR ON TRUMP Scientists who have campaigned for the Paris accord rushed to condemn the White House on Wednesday. 'Today's rumors from unnamed sources at the White House are an indication that some of President Trump's ideology-driven advisers are trying to bounce him into withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.\~ 'A withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is likely to make it more difficult for the United States Government and companies to make trade and business deals with their counterparts in other countries where there is greater understanding of the risks of climate change and of the benefits of low-carbon economic growth.' Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, England. 'If Paris is abandoned or weakened, I fear for the future of our children.\~ 'Even more, I fear for the future of children in developing countries, who have contributed little to the problem and will feel the impacts first. Where will they go?' {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Gabi Hegerl, professor of climate system science, University of Edinburgh, Scotland. 'While it would be unfortunate if Trump pulled the US out of the Paris agreement, the momentum is so great and supported by so many nations that it will be no more than an unwelcome bump in the road rather than anything more serious. 'Individual states such as California will carry on doing what the rest of the world knows is the right thing to do on combating climate change.' Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre at the University of Bristol,England. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, warned Trump on Wednesday that his actions are likely to have long-lasting repercussions on the US economy and the United States' standing internationally. 'I think that our credibility will be undermined,' he said on CNN.\~ Other countries like China will fill the gap with green energy jobs and 'surpass us' in those industries, he argued on the network's New Day program. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also argued that withdraw would send a 'strong message to the marketplace to direct innovative, entrepreneurial investments in the clean energy economy elsewhere.' 'The majority of Americans in both parties know that climate change is real, and want clear, decisive action to arrest its dire effects,' she said in a jab at the president who once claimed climate chance is a 'hoax.'\~ Democratic lawmakers hammered Trump in statements that called the impending retreat 'catastrophic' and 'dangerous.'\~ Diane Feinstein, a California Democrat, asked Trump to reconsider before he makes a 'reckless mistake that will have serious and dire consequences.' Putting the argument in the context of the Syrian refugees Trump has tried to keep out of the US, Feinstein said, 'The world was not prepared for 5 million refugees from Syria. What will we do when many millions more are displaced by sea level rise, agricultural failures or disease pandemics?' The Sierra Club, a liberal environmental group, said the Paris Agreement would hold fast, regardless of what Trump does in a statement that slammed him as the nation's 'climate denier-in-chief.'\~ 'Make no mistake: the Paris Agreement was adopted after decades of climate advocacy by concerned citizens across America and around the world, and it certainly will not be derailed by the ignorance of one man,' said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune.\~ Republicans like Lee who'd cheered Trump on not surprisingly came to his defense as he took fire from the left for the expected announcement. 'The decision to withdraw will afford Americans greater economic opportunity and cheaper, more flexible energy choices in the future,' the Utah senator said. UN CHIEF SETS UP SHOWDOWN WITH TRUMP OVER PARIS\~ Climate change is undeniable and it is £bsolutely essential' the world fight the problem together, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres argued on Tuesday. Trump refused to endorse the landmark climate change accord at a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday, saying he needed more time to decide. He then tweeted that he would make an announcement this week. 'If any government doubts the global will and need for this accord, that is reason for all others to unite even stronger and stay the course,' Guterres said during an address on climate change at New York University, the day before it emerged Trump will pull out. 'The message is simple: the sustainability train has left the station. Get on board or get left behind,' he said. 'The real danger is not the threat to one's economy that comes from acting. It is instead the risk to one's economy by failing to act.' The United States is the world's biggest economy and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China. 'The world is in a mess,' Guterres said. 'It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement.' 'Climate change is undeniable. Climate action is unstoppable. And climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable,' he said, describing the effects as 'dangerous and accelerating.' Big emitters led by China, the European Union and India have reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris deal, which seeks to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting to clean energies. A U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent probable that man-made greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, are the main cause of climate change since 1950. Global average temperatures have hit record highs in each of the past three years, and warming is projected to cause worsening droughts, sea level rises, floods, heat waves and extinctions of wildlife. \</doc>

European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said of a U.S. pullout: 'It would be disappointing but I really do not think this would change the course of mankind. 'There is a much stronger expectation from our partners across the world from Africa, Asia and China that Europe should assume leadership in this effort and we are ready to do that.'\~\~ The Paris Agreement is the first large-scale global agreement to combat what scientists say is climate change, coming together at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 and adopted on December 12. On Earth Day of 2016, April 22, it was opened for signatures and enough European countries signed on so that the agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, four days before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States. China and the United States had already committed to backing the deal in September 2016, with their greenhouse gas output accounting for nearly 40 percent of the world's emissions. To go into legal force, countries accounting for 55 percent of the world's emissions had to sign on. The deal asks that the countries signing on reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Right now 147 countries have ratified the agreement to the 197 who attended the convention.\~ The aim is to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius - 3.6F - this century. Part of the reason the Paris Agreement was successful was that ratifying countries can decide independently how to reduce their emissions rather than being told how much to cut by. The binding part of the agreement makes countries report on their progress decreasing emissions, while the actual setting of emission-reduction targets is non-binding.\~ The United States said it would try to reduce emissions from its 2005 level by 17 percent in 2020 and 26 to 28 percent by 2025.\~ Trump's most senior aides and cabinet secretaries have lined up on either side of the issue.\~ Cohn joined Trump's daughter and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advsior HR McMaster in a campaign to remain in the accord that Barack Obama's administration negotiated. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and Vice President Mike Pence were strongly against staying in the pact that requires the US to cut emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.\~ A senior official told DailyMail.com as Trump prepared to make his first trip abroad that administration lawyers was battling over a proposal that would allow the US remain in the agreement, even if it does take steps to meet its nationally determined contribution to emissions reduction.\~ 'That is not something that we can support, obviously,' the source said of the Obama-negotiated NDC that starts at 17 percent in 2020 and ramps up. Some administration lawyers said a strategy like the one that was being debated would create significant legal risk for the United States and it would be better for Trump to stick to his campaign plan of full withdraw. Kushner is said to be leaning in that direction now, too. 'His basic position is that the standards need to be changed and the question is can you stay in the Paris agreement and can you stay in the Paris agreement with the changes?' an administration official familiar with the situation told DailyMail.com.\~ The United States European allies argued in private meetings with Trump that the US, the world's largest polluter after China, must remain in the agreement that urges aggressive action to protect the environment. They signed a communique at the end of the G7 summit that excluded the United States so they could reiterate their position. Hoping, perhaps, that a divine intervention would do the trick, the Pope also tried to sway Trump when they met at the Vatican last Wednesday. The head of the Catholic Church presented the president and first lady with a copy of his 184-page encyclical on the environment during a gift giving ceremony. Trump promised the religious leader that he'd 'be reading' it. WHO ELSE ISN'T IN PARIS DEAL? Whether the United States joins them or the larger group of\~ 195 countries which signed the Paris Agreement but have still to ratify it or bring it into force remains to be seen. The 50 countries which have yet to fully implement it are: Angola Burundi Colombia   Democratic Republic of the Congo Dominican Republic Egypt Eritrea Haiti   Iraq   Kyrgyzstan   Liberia   Lichtenstein   Montenegro   Myanmar   Oman\~   Moldova   Russian Federation   San Marino   South Sudan   Suriname   Macedonia   Togo   Turkey   Uzbekistan   Yemen   Bhutan   Cape Verde\~   Czech Republic   North Korea   Ecuador   Equatorial Guinea   Guinea-Bissau   Iran   Kuwait   Lebanon   Libya   Malawi   Mozambique   Netherlands   Qatar   Romania   Samoa (ratified only)   Serbia   Sudan   Switzerland   East Timor   Trinidad and Tobago   Tanzania   Venezuela\~   Zimbabwe As Trump waffled on the issue ahead of a self-imposed deadline to make a decision before the G7 summit that was shot after Trump bumped up his departure date to add a Middle East swing to his trip, conservative organizations prodded the Republican president to stay on track. A group of heavyweights\~sent the president \~a letter \~reminding him that withdrawal is a 'key part of your plan to protect U.S. energy producers and manufacturers from regulatory warfare.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Mike Lee and 15 other Republican senators sent Trump a letter of their own last Thursday, putting additional pressure on him to yank the US out.\~ The missive tipped the scales, according to Axios.\~ Foremost was the claim of 'significant litigation risk that could upend your Administration's ability to fulfill its goal' of rescinding Obama-era regulations like the Clean Power Plan. Trump rescinded his predecessor's plan to cut carbon emissions by 32 percent by the year 2030 in a March 28 executive order that was highly celebrated conservatives. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par The United States' ability to meets its nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement hinged on the implementation of carbon reduction plan that Trump said he'd work to toss out. CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENTISTS GO TO WAR ON TRUMP Scientists who have campaigned for the Paris accord rushed to condemn the White House on Wednesday. 'Today's rumors from unnamed sources at the White House are an indication that some of President Trump's ideology-driven advisers are trying to bounce him into withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.\~ 'A withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is likely to make it more difficult for the United States Government and companies to make trade and business deals with their counterparts in other countries where there is greater understanding of the risks of climate change and of the benefits of low-carbon economic growth.' Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, England. 'If Paris is abandoned or weakened, I fear for the future of our children.\~ 'Even more, I fear for the future of children in developing countries, who have contributed little to the problem and will feel the impacts first. Where will they go?' {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par Gabi Hegerl, professor of climate system science, University of Edinburgh, Scotland. 'While it would be unfortunate if Trump pulled the US out of the Paris agreement, the momentum is so great and supported by so many nations that it will be no more than an unwelcome bump in the road rather than anything more serious. 'Individual states such as California will carry on doing what the rest of the world knows is the right thing to do on combating climate change.' Jonathan Bamber, director of the Bristol Glaciology Centre at the University of Bristol,England. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, warned Trump on Wednesday that his actions are likely to have long-lasting repercussions on the US economy and the United States' standing internationally. 'I think that our credibility will be undermined,' he said on CNN.\~ Other countries like China will fill the gap with green energy jobs and 'surpass us' in those industries, he argued on the network's New Day program. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi also argued that withdraw would send a 'strong message to the marketplace to direct innovative, entrepreneurial investments in the clean energy economy elsewhere.' 'The majority of Americans in both parties know that climate change is real, and want clear, decisive action to arrest its dire effects,' she said in a jab at the president who once claimed climate chance is a 'hoax.'\~ Democratic lawmakers hammered Trump in statements that called the impending retreat 'catastrophic' and 'dangerous.'\~ Diane Feinstein, a California Democrat, asked Trump to reconsider before he makes a 'reckless mistake that will have serious and dire consequences.' Putting the argument in the context of the Syrian refugees Trump has tried to keep out of the US, Feinstein said, 'The world was not prepared for 5 million refugees from Syria. What will we do when many millions more are displaced by sea level rise, agricultural failures or disease pandemics?' The Sierra Club, a liberal environmental group, said the Paris Agreement would hold fast, regardless of what Trump does in a statement that slammed him as the nation's 'climate denier-in-chief.'\~ 'Make no mistake: the Paris Agreement was adopted after decades of climate advocacy by concerned citizens across America and around the world, and it certainly will not be derailed by the ignorance of one man,' said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune.\~ Republicans like Lee who'd cheered Trump on not surprisingly came to his defense as he took fire from the left for the expected announcement. 'The decision to withdraw will afford Americans greater economic opportunity and cheaper, more flexible energy choices in the future,' the Utah senator said. UN CHIEF SETS UP SHOWDOWN WITH TRUMP OVER PARIS\~ Climate change is undeniable and it is £bsolutely essential' the world fight the problem together, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres argued on Tuesday. Trump refused to endorse the landmark climate change accord at a summit of the G7 group of wealthy nations on Saturday, saying he needed more time to decide. He then tweeted that he would make an announcement this week. 'If any government doubts the global will and need for this accord, that is reason for all others to unite even stronger and stay the course,' Guterres said during an address on climate change at New York University, the day before it emerged Trump will pull out. 'The message is simple: the sustainability train has left the station. Get on board or get left behind,' he said. 'The real danger is not the threat to one's economy that comes from acting. It is instead the risk to one's economy by failing to act.' The United States is the world's biggest economy and the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China. 'The world is in a mess,' Guterres said. 'It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement.' 'Climate change is undeniable. Climate action is unstoppable. And climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable,' he said, describing the effects as 'dangerous and accelerating.' Big emitters led by China, the European Union and India have reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris deal, which seeks to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century by shifting to clean energies. A U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent probable that man-made greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, are the main cause of climate change since 1950. Global average temperatures have hit record highs in each of the past three years, and warming is projected to cause worsening droughts, sea level rises, floods, heat waves and extinctions of wildlife. \</doc>

\~ Climate change, dwindling natural resources, pressure on ecosystems from urban expansion, pollution and waste management are all global challenges that are having an impact in Abu Dhabi, whose delicate environment is characterised by extremes of temperature and landscape. Over the last few decades, extraordinary economic and population growth has increased the pressure on this ecosphere, which has long been of concern for the emirate's government. Protecting the environment has been woven into the fabric of Abu Dhabi's development plans. Sustainability and optimal use of resources are seen as vital to the future well-being of its people and the ecosphere. Authorities have crafted a host of programmes and agencies to further the sustainability agenda, while efforts to promote the environment have become pillars of emirate policy. All of this has profound implications for the emirate's future, and affords lessons for the region and the world. Challenging Times Abu Dhabi covers 84% of the UAE's land area, making the emirate's environmental health crucial to the country. Expanding at around 3% a year in recent times, its population doubled in the 10 years to 2015, when it reached 2.78m - 12 times its size in 1975. Growth in the economy and population have affected the environment in a number of ways. As economic expansion has driven up per capita income, consumption has risen for industrial goods and services, many of which have a larger environmental footprint. Moreover, increasingly higher levels of income have also altered diets in ways that require more from the environment than the local biosphere can easily provide for. Water Supply The UAE has one of the world's highest per capita incomes but one of its lowest biocapacities. With a landscape consisting largely of desert and the salty mud flats that stretch along the coast, Abu Dhabi relies on imports and industrial processes - such as desalination for drinking water - to meet domestic needs. Meanwhile, a harsh climate - average temperatures range from 22.8\'b0C to 35\'b0C, and can reach 50\'b0C in the height of summer - requires extra water to run cooling and irrigation systems, demand that is largely met by using further industrial processes that affect the local environment. Groundwater - which is used in irrigation - is currently being extracted at 25 times the natural recharge rate; the emirate receives an average of just 87.4 mm of rainfall per year. Air Quality Above ground, too, curbing pollution is a challenge. Rapid growth has multiplied the number of vehicles on roads, contributing to a deterioration in air quality. Alongside emissions from industry and other sectors, this releases gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, in addition to ozone, a secondary pollutant mainly from the transport and industrial sectors. Particulate matter, while a natural component in arid, desert areas like the UAE, is also created by the interaction of gases like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Urban expansion threatens the emirate's biodiversity. Abu Dhabi is home to 51 indigenous species of mammal, yet six are on the "threatened" list. Some 78% of the emirate's fish stocks are over-exploited, according to the "State of Environment 2016" report. Disposal of waste is a further issue: the UAE produces 1.65 kg of waste material per person per day, below the rate of 2.04 kg in the US but still a challenge in terms of management and recycling. The EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service calculated that average global temperatures in 2016 were 0.2\'b0C hotter than in 2015 - itself a record-high year. The consequent rise in sea temperatures affects marine life, while higher sea levels also contribute to coastal erosion. It also prompts more frequent extreme weather events: sand storms in Abu Dhabi have reportedly been increasing in number. This all adds up to a major set of challenges, as a series of successive international conferences have recognised. In 2015 the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change gathered leaders from more than 150 countries in Paris and produced a wide-ranging global agreement to tackle these issues. Plans & Programmes At the conference, the UAE was commended for the scale and ambition of its NDCs, with the country's sustainability programme being already well advanced. Unusually for any country, the UAE has a Ministry of Climate Change and Environment at the federal level, which has drawn up a National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan 2014-21. The emirate's key policy initiatives, including the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 and Environment Vision 2030, have long-recognised the need to balance social and economic development with environmental sustainability. The vision recognises the need to "balance economic growth with environmental sustainability", and declares that enforcement of legislation codifying this will go hand-in-hand with incentivising people and businesses to respect nature. It employs a two-pronged approach of statute and incentives: the government encourages compliance by implementing legal best practices and creating the capacity for individuals and companies to comply, while also demonstrating to them the personal and financial benefits of environmental sustainability. The development plan also highlights the role the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), the emirate's lead organisation for pursuing and coordinating policies in this sphere. The EAD was instrumental in drawing up the "State of Environment 2016" report, which is based on years of detailed research and draws on data from across the emirate and the country. A key part of the EAD's role so far has been to enable accumulation of accurate data, which in the past has often been lacking. The Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative, supported by the EAD and the UN Environment Programme, in turn connects this data work with international organisations. The EAD contains within it the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Group (ADSG), which looks for ways to drive the private sector to adopt environmentally sustainable practices. An inclusive, network-based body, the ADSG helps companies, regardless of size, to build the capacity they need to implement the emirate's targets, and helps train industry professionals and spread information in the wider business world. The EAD also supports the UAE's chapter of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), the Emirates Wildlife Society (EWS). The EWS-WWF undertakes various awareness programmes in the UAE, while developing its strategy for protected areas. "Biodiversity knows no borders", its director-general, Ida Tillisch, told OBG, so projects must engage across national frontiers to protect endangered species and environments. Much of the EWS-WWF's work is in marine conservation, on which it partners with a number of Gulf governments (see analysis). The EAD works with various national and international organisations. In a memorandum of understanding with the International Union for Conservation of Nature, it carries out a project that monitors and protects dugongs and their seagrass meadows, many of which lie around Abu Dhabi's offshore islands. The EAD also supports efforts to help migratory species, and to reintroduce species to habitats from which they have recently vanished. Other partners include Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital and Emirates Falconers' Club - falconing being an enduring tradition in Emirati culture - with which it assists in conservation to enable the practice to be passed down to future generations. Tackling Change On its 20th anniversary in 2016, the EAD identified nine key challenges facing the emirate's environment, many of which are just as applicable regionally: the unsustainable use of groundwater; declining air quality and the increasing risk of respiratory illnesses; the local impact of climate change; insufficient waste infrastructure; declining marine water quality; land pollution and soil degradation; habitat loss, alteration and fragmentation; overexploitation of wild fish populations; and unsustainable water usage in forests. For many of these issues, measuring the scale of the problem has been a substantial task, and one in which Abu Dhabi has made great strides. "In 20 years the EAD's single biggest achievement would have to be going from no real data about the environment to where we stand today," James Duthie, director of PR and communications at the EAD, told OBG. The EAD has used a Driver-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses (DPSIR) model, which is a framework for describing the interactions between society and the environment developed by the European Environmental Agency, to examine the drivers, or forces, pushing environmental change in the emirates, then the pressures those forces exert on the environment. The next step is to determine the impact of these forces on the ecosphere, human health and the economy, and then to ascertain what responses are appropriate to address these changes. Data Collection Under the DPSIR model, accumulating accurate data is key. In air quality, for example, the main pressure on the environment comes from industrial pollution, transport emissions and natural dust events. Given that these factors are airborne, Abu Dhabi may also be affected by events taking place outside the emirate. To determine the impact, as well as formulate responses, starting in Abu Dhabi and then spreading outwards, the EAD has organised a system for monitoring ambient air across the UAE, using 20 fixed stations and two mobile units to measure concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and particulate matter. A network of e-links connects the EAD's own facilities to monitoring facilities run by other entities, such as oil and gas companies, and meteorological stations in other emirates. The results of such monitoring reveal that ozone and particulate matter are the greatest challenges, though sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide concentrations generally fall within national environmental standards set by the federal UAE authorities. In response, the EAD has begun scientific inquiries into tropospheric ozone conditions to determine policies and regulations that will have the greatest effect in reducing its levels. Similar scientific work is being carried out with particulate matter - crucial work, given that there is no specific standard as yet for acceptable levels of very fine particulates known as PM25, which are more dangerous to public health than larger, coarser varieties of airborne dust. "We need to understand the composition of particulate matter, whether it is natural or anthropogenic," said Duthie. The research will provide a basis for establishing such a standard, which can then shape regulatory measures. Such work is crucial to reducing air pollution, which the World Health Organisation sees as the planet's greatest environmental health risk. Abu Dhabi plays a leading regional role in the scientific research supporting bodies such as the EAD. In one notable example, it was the first in the Gulf to complete a greenhouse gas inventory at the local, emirate level. Two cycles of this research have now been completed, the second of which introduced an additional survey of wetlands. Abu Dhabi's lead in this regard established the UAE as the only country besides the US to have such a survey, and its example in this field has since been emulated by Dubai. Reducing Air Pollution Moves have already been made to tackle air pollution. Given that transport is a major factor, one response is to cut or eliminate fuel subsidies, making petrol more expensive. At the national level, the UAE has been gradually doing this in recent times, while enforcing higher fuel efficiency and cleaner diesel requirements in the nation's vehicles. Since 2014 the UAE has used ultra-low-sulphur diesel, reducing its sulphur content from 500 parts per million to 10. At the emirate level, Abu Dhabi's Department of Municipal Affairs and Transport (DMAT) has been reducing emissions, too, with 88% of the department's buses achieving Euro 4 standards on efficiency for diesel fuel. The DMAT is also conducting research into the feasibility of introducing electric buses, and more broadly, electric vehicles. A regulation introduced in 2010 has already switched 25% of all government vehicles from using petrol and diesel over to less-polluting compressed natural gas. In industry, a programme to gather real-time data from smoke stacks is under way, with a pilot project at the Umm Al Nar power plant. Some segments are addressing the polluting effects of their processes. A carbon-capture project being engineered at an Emirates Steel plant in the Industrial City of Abu Dhabi, for example, will capture gas and re-use it in enhanced oil recovery projects by Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (see Industry chapter). Water Consumption Water also remains a major challenge. Economic and population growth have greatly increased water consumption in the UAE, where 62.6% of this comes from groundwater, 32.6% from desalinated water and the rest from wastewater. High usage is having an impact on the quality and availability of groundwater, with just 3% of it now considered fresh. Desalination plants release polluting emissions that also impact human health and discharge brine that can damage marine life. Responses to this have taken various forms. One is demand-side management through hikes in water tariffs, the most recent of which took place in January 2017. Another is the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Programme, which will collect all of Abu Dhabi's wastewater via a single pipe system and deliver it to treatment plants. Scientific research on new uses of wastewater is ongoing, notably at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, which is also looking at ways to use solar power in desalination, thereby reducing reliance on gas-fired power plants (see Utilities chapter). To protect groundwater, regulations have been established governing the drilling and usage of wells. Under a new groundwater law issued in late 2016 that placed exploitation of this resource under EAD guidelines, installation of water meters is required at wellheads and desalination plants to enable accurate measurement of water extraction. The EAD has capped consumption from wells, and oversees regular maintenance and upkeep of these to minimise losses. Professional standards for drilling wells are also being introduced. Violators of these regulations are subject to stiff fines or imprisonment, highlighting the emirate's sensitivity to water misuse. Enforcement of rules and regulations has long been an issue in environmental protection. As the EAD expands its data collection capabilities, a vital next step is to identify areas that require specific regulation, then ensure that citizens, expatriates, private enterprises and public corporations all abide by the rules. The EAD's approach is two-fold: enforce new laws by punishing violations, yet assist organisations and individuals by giving them the tools to meet required standards. "You have to help the people you are trying to regulate," said Duthie. Education and awareness are central to this. One example of such efforts is Sheikh Zayed Desert Learning Centre in Al Ain, at the entrance to a wildlife park and resort, which educates visitors in the natural and cultural history of Arabian deserts, and promotes conservation and sensitivity to the environment. Meanwhile, organisations like the ADSG work closely with businesses to inform them of the impact of their activities and then help build their capacity to change. Private businesses often have their own sustainability programmes. Rotana Group, a Riyadh-based entertainment firm that operates hotels and resorts in Abu Dhabi, has an initiative called Rotana Earth that produces regular reports on sustainability, and promotes conservation of water, energy and materials, along with better waste management and various social, economic and governance initiatives. By highlighting such projects, the ADSG aims to inspire other hotel groups to follow suit. "Fundamentally, people and companies want to do business with sustainable businesses," said ADSG director-general, Huda Al Houqani. "The ADSG provides a grandstand for people who are sustainability champions." Outlook In tackling environmental pressures, few underestimate the scale of the challenges the emirate faces. Yet for all the challenges, Abu Dhabi has made extraordinary progress in recent times, not least by placing sustainability at the heart of its development strategy. Renewable energy, smart cities, demand-side management of water and energy, and encouragement and deployment of the latest, least-polluting technologies are all areas in which the emirate surpasses many of its peers. Because many of these issues are regional or global in nature, too, Abu Dhabi's initiatives can serve as an example that inspires actors far beyond its borders. As more reliable data is collected and networks built, regulation can be fine-tuned, while education and awareness campaigns work to improve social and economic habits. While much remains to be done, Abu Dhabi is working to meet its environmental targets, and building a sustainable future. \</doc>

Jefferies nabs third co-head of EM credit trading and sales Jefferies has hired a new co-head of European emerging market credit trading and sales from Barclays. At Jefferies, Holger Sheerer will be working alongside Khurrum Sheikh and Aaron Fernandes, the current co-heads. At that point, Jefferies indicated that it was growing its EM sales and trading team. Scheerer had been at Barclays for a decade, most recently as a director on its EM trading desk, though he started at the bank as an investment grade credit trader. He previously worked for short stints in 2007 as an analyst at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Cr\'e9dit Ag puts green banker in Asia Cr\'e9dit Agricole has moved one of its sustainable banking specialists to Asia, hoping to capitalise on what it expects to be a growing market for green bonds. Dominique Duval, who had already been running Agricole's Asia Pacific sustainable banking business from Paris, moved to Hong Kong in November. Agricole's sustainable banking team, headed by Tanguy Claquin, has also recently added Hugues Delafon, a managing director and former head of corporate debt capital markets. It now has eight members in Paris, plus Duval. "This demonstrates our leadership in Asia Pacific and confirms that we want to be committed to the region," said Duval. She said Cr\'e9dit Agricole was top of the league table for bookrunning green bonds in Asia Pacific. Duval expects China to be particularly busy with green bond issuance in 2018. "With France, it's the largest issuer of green bonds," said Duval. "It makes sense "" they have plenty of green investments to be made and because of their commitments during COP 21 and COP 23 ." Some of the Chinese banks would become regular issuers, she said, while companies would also issue. "We are also expecting other countries in the region to be busy," Duval added. The governments of Hong Kong, Indonesia and Malaysia are all expected to issue green bonds. Natixis has also recently installed a senior sustainable finance banker in Hong Kong, although in this case it was an external hire. Chaoni Huang, formerly of S&amp;P Trucost, was appointed in December as director of green and sustainable solutions for Asia Pacific. The green and sustainable solutions hub at Natixis, headed by Orith Azoulay in Paris, is somewhat unusual in that it combines acting for green bond and loan issuers, creating equity and debt structured products for investors, fundamental environmental, social and governance research, and corporate advisory. Thus it includes staff on both the private and public sides of the market. Natixis's corporate and investment bank wants to double its green revenues by 2020. Citi names new Nordic heads following Winter's departure Citi has named Lars Ingemarsson and Ari M\'c3\£4kel\'c3\£4 co-heads of Nordic investment banking, partly replacing Eirik Winter, who left the firm before Christmas. Ingemarsson joined Citi in 2011 from JP Morgan, and worked at Merrill Lynch before that. He is based in Stockholm. M\'c3\£4kel\'c3\£4, who remains based in Helskini, joined Citi in 2011 from Deutsche Bank. Both report to Manolo Falco, head of EMEA CIB at Citi. Winter, who was chairman and head of investment banking for the Nordic region, left the bank at the end of last year to take on a new role elsewhere in the financial industry. Before becoming head of Nordic global banking in 2010, Winter was effectively head of European debt capital markets, with a variety of different job titles in the various different reorganisations since 2000. He joined Citi as part of the Salomon Brothers acquisition. Citi followed the announcements with the appointment on Thursday of Alexander Stiris as country head for Sweden and head of Nordic corporate banking, based in Stockholm. Stiris replaces Mikkel Gr\'c3\'b8nlykke, who has relocated to London as head of corporate banking CEE and head of corporate banking for Citibank Europe. Investcorp hires Yeates for new credit funds biz Investcorp has hired Phil Yeates as managing director and head of European credit funds, after he had spent 24 years at Rothschild. Yeates will oversee Investcorp's structuring and fundraising of closed end credit funds and separately managed accounts, a new business for Investcorp Credit Management (ICM), which manages $11bn of assets. He will be based in London and report to Jeremy Ghose, head of ICM. Yeates was a senior adviser in Rothschild's credit management business, having first joined as head of debt fund management in 1994. He was co-head of banking from 2007 to 2012. Kivinen replaces Greenbaum in Deutsche EM team Petri Kivinen is joining Deutsche Bank from Morgan Stanley to fill the gap left by David Greenbaum, who was the bank's head of origination for corporate and financials in CEEMEA. Kivinen had been at Morgan Stanley since 2010 as managing director of its fixed income operations in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (CEEMEA). He has spent 24 years as a debt capital markets banker for various clients in the CEEMEA region and has also previously worked at Credit Suisse First Boston, Renaissance Capital and Dresdner Kleinwort. Greenbaum, who was at Deutsche Bank for more than 15 years, is joining a large real estate company focused on Central and Eastern Europe as its new CFO. He joined Deutsche in April 2002 as a director in its US corporate debt origination team, before moving to head debt origination for South Asia and Southeast Asia. He became head of corporate and financial debt origination in CEEMEA in November 2013. MTN banker Kleine heads to Credit Suisse GlobalCapital understands Stefan Kleine, formerly of BNP Paribas, will be joining Credit Suisse in a non-syndicate role. Stefan Kleine left BNP Paribas a few weeks ago. According to his LinkedIn profile, he had worked on MTN and private placement syndicate for the French bank since 2014. For the four years before that, he worked on corporate debt origination for Germany, Austria and Switzerland. GlobalCapital could not determine his role at Credit Suisse, but understands it will not be on MTN syndicate. ICBC Standard Bank appoints new COO ICBC Standard Bank has appointed Gary Simpson, a former HSBC banker, as chief operating officer of global markets, a newly created role. Simpson started at ICBC in November, having worked at HSBC as the chief operating officer for commodities and FX over the past two years in London and New York. Before that, he served as head of business development at Deutsche Bank working in global and Asian commodities. Terra Firma hires three from top banks Terra Firma has hired three veteran bankers to take up senior roles within the firm. Vivek Ahuja will join Terra Firma as a partner and will work as its chief financial officer. He will manage the firm's finances as well as its portfolio businesses. Ahuja will work alongside managing partner Guy Hands, Justin King and Andrew G\'e9czy. He brings to the firm more than 20 years' experience as a CFO. Previously he worked at Standard Chartered for 17 years as the deputy group CFO. He also worked at HSBC and ANZ in finance, strategy and corporate institutional banking roles. Terra Firma has also hired former Lloyds banker Mark Elliot as a managing director. Elliotwill be responsible for expanding the support capital division to take advantage of new opportunities in the market. This is providing financing for businesses, perhaps with an equity co-investment, rather than acquiring them. Elliot previously worked at Lloyds as managing director of corporate solutions.

The following is a round-up of European news highlights available to BBC Monitoring on 25 October 2017: BALKAN/AEGEAN Albanian premier visits UAE Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama on 24 October paid an official visit to the UAE. He met Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and they discussed ways of enhancing cooperation and the possibility of opening an airline to link their countries, private television station Top Channel reported on the same day. Envoy says Turkey has no 'secret plans' for Bosnia Presidency head says Bosnia committed to reforms Russia 'surprised' by Croatia's letter to EU A "source" in the Russian embassy in Zagreb has told centre-right daily Vecernji List that Russia was "surprised" by the fact that Croatia signed a letter to the EU, along with several other countries, asking for more work to be done against "Russian propaganda and hybrid warfare". "We are sorry that the Croatian side is taking this tack at a time when the bilateral cooperation is being activated and after positive results of the Croatian president's visit to Russia," the source said, asking if the sending of the letter - just before the Croatian president's visit to Russia - was timed to "undermine" the "relaxation of relations" between the two countries, Vecernji List Online reported on 25 October. Kosovo president decrees Serbian judges, prosecutors President Hashim Thaci on 24 October decreed 40 judges and 13 new prosecutors from the nonmajority community to serve in the Serb-majority municipalities in the north, national television station RTK reported on the same day. "Kosovo is built on the constitutional principles, the principles of all-inclusiveness, equality, and freedom of each individual. Kosovo has adopted adequate measures to promote full and effective equality between community members in all areas of economic, social, political and cultural life," Thaci said. Macedonia election result pronounced valid Macedonia's State Election Commission (DIK) on 24 October announced that it had officially confirmed the result of the first round of the local elections, which were held on 15 October. The DIK rejected 23 of 24 complaints filed by the opposition nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE). A court in Skopje rejected the 24th complaint eliminating the need for a re-vote in one of Skopje's municipalities, popular TV channel Sitel reported on its website on 25 October. Voters will elect the mayors of 35 municipalities in a second round of voting on 29 October. Serbian president congratulates Chinese leader Bulgarian pilots said boycotting training flights Romanian premier plans government reshuffle Romanian Prime Minister Mihai Tudose plans to dismiss Finance Minister Ionut Misa in order to remove one of Social Democratic Party (PSD) Chairman Liviu Dragnea's trusted allies from the government, influential, privately owned Adevarul Online reported on 25 October. Cyprus, Russia leaders sign joint action plan Outgoing German minister urges Greece to tackle fiscal issues In an interview with private Greek SKAI TV on 24 October, outgoing German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble urged Athens to take responsibility for its fiscal difficulties and act on them. He rejected the idea of taking measures to reduce Greece's debt when the current bailout plan concludes in the fall of 2018. He noted that Greek politicians had a habit of using lenders as an excuse to impose cutbacks, mentioning the government's decision to cut pensions, pointing out that this was not a lenders' decision. He said that Greece's nightmare is over, adding that this year's developments are good, but there should be no backsliding, the channel's website, skai.gr and other media outlets reported on 25 October. Turkey sees Greece as 'safe haven' for coup plotters In a joint news conference with his Greek counterpart Nikos Kotzias, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu urged Greece on 24 October not to become a "safe haven" for plotters of the 2016 coup attempt, citing the 995 people who have applied for asylum since the failed coup. Responding to Cavusoglu's comments, Kotzias said the decisions on asylum seekers were made by the Greek judiciary and had to be respected even if "it does not please some", independent ekathimerini.com and other media reported on the same day. CENTRAL/EASTERN EUROPE Czech party not to nominate presidential candidate Andrej Babis, the Action of Dissatisfied Citizens (ANO) leader, announced on 24 October that the party will not nominate anyone for the presidential election. Babis has denied that there is an agreement between him and President Milos Zeman who is running for reelection, state-owned CT 24 reported on the same day. The iDnes.cz website noted on the same day that the deadline for nominating presidential candidates is 7 November. Czech party rules out support for populists The Civic Democratic Party (ODS) leadership and all its deputies on 24 October unanimously agreed that they will not form a coalition government with ANO. The party also refuses to give ANO "any form of support". ODS won 25 seats in parliament and is the only party with which ANO can create a two-party coalition, Babis-owned iDnes.cz reported on the same day. Czech party says no coalition with ANO Miroslav Kalousek, the outgoing Tradition Responsibility Prosperity 09 (TOP 09) leader, on 24 October reaffirmed after a party leadership meeting that TOP 09 will not form a coalition with ANO. Kalousek said that TOP 09 will not vote for "any Babis's puppet" for the post of speaker, Babis-owned Lidovkz.cz reported on 24 October. Czech intel says Russia, China intensify hybrid activities The Security Information Service (BIS), the Czech domestic intelligence service, said in its annual report published on 24 October that Russia and China have intensified their disinformation and hybrid activities in Czech Republic. BIS reported some Czech citizens handed over sensitive information to Russians which caused more damage than potential leaks of classified information. The terrorism threat in the country is insignificant, according to the report, economic HN Online wrote on 24 October. A military Intelligence annual report published on 24 October noted that it focused on individuals who attempted to manipulate Defence Ministry public tenders. The report claimed that "members of intelligence services, working under diplomatic cover, were collecting information which is not classified but can be used as intelligence on defence capabilities and critical infrastructure," national agency CTK wrote on 24 October. Hungarian premier says EU should focus on preserving achievements Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on 24 October called on the EU to work toward "preserving its achievements such as the Schengen system and the free movement of labour" instead of "devising ambitious new plans". Orban opined that Hungary will never accept any EU regulation that would "take away its sovereignty to decide who can stay in Hungary", major media including centre-right daily Magyar Hirlap reported on 25 October. Hungarian minister says terrorists might arrive in EU disguised as migrants Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on 24 October that an "unprecedently dangerous phase of migration" is about to come, as large areas previously held by ISIS have been retaken. Szijjarto asserted that "ISIS warriors might take advantage of the wave of illegal immigration to get to Europe" and that "there is now an even greater need to defend the outer borders of Europe, and if that fails, the remaining security of Europe may fall into ruins," independent news service Hungary Around the Clock reported on 25 October. Hungary to tighten state funding rules for political parties Fidesz caucus leader Gergely Gulyas on 24 October said that the government is set to amend the law on party campaign financing. Gulyas asserted that parties receiving less than 0.5 per cent of the votes cast on party lists in the general election should be obliged to repay the state funding provided for their election campaign, progovernment conservative daily Magyar Idok reported on 25 October. Latvia, Russia to sign border demarcation documents Lithuania to purchase Norwegian air defence systems Minister says Poland will not accept foreign intervention "Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said on Tuesday [24 October] that Poland 'will not accept external intervention' regarding efforts to overhaul the legal system," the English-language website of the government-controlled Polish Radio reported on the same day. The official was commenting on a planned fact-finding visit to Warsaw on 25 and 26 October by the Venice Commission, an advisory group to human rights body the Council of Europe. WESTERN EUROPE Arctic Council to meet in Finland On 25-26 October, the Arctic Council will convene for the first meeting of Finland's chairmanship, national broadcaster Yle.fi reported on 24 October. Some 160 participants will discuss a recently-signed agreement on scientific cooperation in the Arctic and the council's approach to an upcoming UN conference on climate change due to be held in Germany. France reports record drop in unemployment since 1996 The number of unemployed people in France dropped by 1.8 per cent in September, commercial radio Europe 1 quoted the Labour Ministry as saying on 24 October, a "record drop" since records began in 1996, according to the station. A total of 6.64 million people were unemployed in September, that is 1 per cent more than at the same time a year ago, according to the government agency that registers those looking for a job. France's Macron keeps 'low profile' on human rights in Egypt Centre-left Le Monde Online said on 25 October that French President Emmanuel Macron had refrained from "preaching" on human rights when he met his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah al Sisi in Paris on 24 October. Macron, however, stressed "the imperative need to fight terrorism while respecting the rule of law". Al Sisi is making a three-day visit to France with half a dozen ministers in a bid to boost commercial and security ties with France. Egypt is expected to buy another 12 Rafale fighter jets if the two countries agree on the financial terms of the deal. French spokesman to run for chairmanship of Macron's party Government spokesman Christophe Castaner on 25 October confirmed on commercial radio RTL Online that he would run for the chairmanship of President Emmanuel Macron's The Republic On the Move (LREM) party on 18 November. Castaner, whom RTL describes as the "cornerstone" of the cabinet, said he would leave his post as government spokesman but continue to be the minister for parliamentary relations. Macron is reported to have encouraged Castaner to run for the post and his election is likely to be unchallenged. German president to meet Putin German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will pay a "working visit" to Moscow on 25 October to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin and former President Mikhail Gorbachev at the residence of the German ambassador. Steinmeier clarified that while the trip was not a "state visit", the focus would be to determine whether trust between Europe and Russia could be regained. Steinmeier will also raise the issue of eastern Ukraine and the possibility of a UN peacekeeping mission, centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine reported on the same day. Ghanaian national arrested for selling passports in Italy's Naples Italian police arrested Ali Mustafa, a 42-year-old Ghanaian suspected of having sold some 10,000 counterfeit documents including passports and residence permits, through customers met in the Naples mosque, moderate left-of-centre daily La Repubblica reported 25 October. Released Tunisian inmates said to be flooding to Italy A Tunisian trafficker told centrist daily La Stampa on 25 October that some 20 per cent of the passengers he helps to smuggle to Italy have just been released from prison. The trafficker also stated that the local Coast Guard is in collusion with traffickers and "decides whether the sea is open or closed". Italian, Balkan ministers discuss crime, jihadist terror Italy's Interior Minister Marco Minniti and his counterparts from Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia have attended the closing meeting of the IPA 2013 Balkans initiative in Trieste, centrist daily ll Piccolo reported 25 October. Ministers announced that the joint fight against crime and jihadist terror, which produced 55 joint investigations, led to the arrest of 383 individuals and the confiscation of more than 4m euros worth of goods. According to Il Piccolo, some 3,561 archeological artefacts seized by ISIS in Syria and Iraq were confiscated. Portuguese government survives no-confidence motion Spanish Socialists, government said split over Article 155 Cristina Narbona, president of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), has told centre-left daily El Pais Online that the PSOE and the Spanish government have different opinions on the implementation of Article 155 of the constitution. Narbona hinted that she will not support the application of Article 155 if the Catalan authorities call for a new election within the existing legal framework. Spanish government spokesperson denies Catalonia violence Government spokesperson Inigo Mendez de Vigo denied that violence will be used by the Spanish government to restore the rule of law in the event of protests against the central government in Catalonia, privately owned news agency Europa Press reported 25 October. Mendez de Vigo accused British daily The Times of misrepresenting his views in an article published on 24 October and titled "Spain Will Use Force if Catalonia Protests Against Direct Rule".

Text of report in English by French Foreign Ministry website HYPERLINK http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr www.diplomatie.gouv.fr United Nations General Assembly - Press Conference of Jean-Yves Le Drian (18 September 2017) Press Conference - Initial Remarks Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to see you here as I attend my first United Nations General Assembly. I am pleased to present you with France's priorities and to tell you how we intend to address them during this highlight of the international calendar. This is a critical moment. It is marked by a troubling deterioration in the international environment. Never since the end of the Cold War have differences, tensions, and the level of conflict been so high, in a world that nevertheless is more interdependent than ever. Even worse, despite globalization, cooperation has become less evident, with the rules of the multilateral game increasingly called into question and the growing temptation to withdraw or go one's own way. Amid a growing number of crises, striving for concrete solutions is France's priority, for two reasons: first, because these crises concern us, they affect our security and that of Europe; and second, because these crises compromise the international order by weakening the norms that govern it and the balances that underpin it. In the face of this decaying situation, France has a special responsibility - because it has the means, because its voice carries weight, because it is seen as a balancing power. For all these reasons, France must be proactive, it must be creative, agile, and pragmatic, and at the same time a guarantor of such key principles as the respect for international law, and in particular, the UN Charter. It must also be vigilant when it comes to protecting vulnerable populations, or in the fight against impunity for the most serious international crimes. It is in this frame of mind that the President, who will be arriving shortly in New York, and I will attend numerous meetings devoted to every sort of crisis - military and humanitarian, as well as the promotion of human rights and development. We will have the opportunity to meet with our partners to discuss the situation in Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, and the Sahel, among others. In this regard, allow me to expand upon a few of our priorities. First, the crises. 2. CRISES Because the UN's first mission is to ensure international security, the President and I will be working especially hard in the days to come to move forward on the resolution of major international crises. I will begin with the Levant. That is our top priority. As you know, Daesh is experiencing one military defeat after another. We can now anticipate a time when Daesh will no longer hold any territory. And we must be sure that in the future we will be prepared to deal with a more diffuse but still real threat from Daesh and Al-Qaeda. Terrorism often draws its strength from a breeding ground. I'm thinking of Syria. You are familiar with the reality of the war that is raging there. We have seen more than 300,000 dead, half the population displaced, murders, torture, unspeakable suffering, chaos. After six years of deadlock, we need a realistic, pragmatic approach commensurate with a conflict that has grown increasingly international. Let me say once again: fighting Daesh and identifying the political conditions for ending the civil war are two faces of the same commitment to serve international security. This requires working together with all regional actors and the members of the Security Council. That is why the President proposed to establish a contact group bringing together representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council, given their particular responsibility, along with the main actors involved in Syria. The establishment of this group should make it possible to pool initiatives in order to move forward, reduce contradictions within the international community, and effectively support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, whom I met with yesterday. That is how we can help the Syrians themselves find the way to an agreement that thus far has proven impossible. The creation of this group will be on the agenda of the meeting of P5 ministers with the UN secretary-general Thursday morning. France's priorities are clear: First, the fight against terrorism. Second, the need for humanitarian access everywhere. Even where progress has been observed, more must be done. Third, the need for a political process taking into account the different components of Syrian society and the fate of these various communities, leading to a new Constitution. And fourth, France will remain committed to fighting impunity for the perpetrators of chemical attacks. The same holds true for the future of our whole system of collective security: one cannot violate the most fundamental norms without someday facing the consequences. As I said a few days ago at the Ambassadors Conference, France will soon be taking initiatives in this area. Libya On the subject of crises, I want to turn to France's immediate neighbourhood. We cannot allow the instability prevailing in Libya to continue, with the threats it represents for Libya's neighbours but also for Europe. That's why we are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Libyan people in the face of the challenges they are confronting: to eradicate the terrorist threat on their territory; to control migratory flows; to curb all kinds of trafficking, which also threaten us; and in order to do these things, to restore the country's political unity, a prerequisite for its security and stability. It was with this in mind que that on July 25, the President hosted Prime Minister Sarraj and Field Marshal Haftar at Le Celle-Saint-Cloud. It was an important step, because they pledged in a joint declaration to unite against terrorism and lay the groundwork for an electoral process. We must continue these efforts in order to expand the consensus between all the Libyan parties. And the presidents of the two chambers -the State Council and the House of Representatives - have a major role to play. A few days ago, I myself visited Tripoli, Benghazi, Misurata and Tobruk. I observed great fatigue among the people, confronted with the country's fragmentation. We will therefore continue our efforts to achieve an inclusive political solution. Ghassan Salame, the secretary-general's special representative, is leading this effort. I saw him yesterday evening. We support his efforts and have full faith that this mission will be accomplished. That is what the President will say on behalf of France at Wednesday's meeting on Libya chaired by Secretary-General Guterres. The Sahel To continue on the subject of crises, terrorism still represents a threat in the Sahel, as recent attacks have shown. Terrorist groups know no borders and are fuelled by trafficking, particularly drug trafficking and human trafficking. In the face of this challenge, France supports a collective, coordinated, global response. First, we fully support the efforts of the UN and MINUSMA. We support the effective implementation of the Algiers Agreement; that is the key to stabilizing this region. Much remains to be done. And I will attend an event on the implementation of the Malian Peace and Reconciliation Agreement with Mr. Guterres and President Keita. The unanimous adoption of a resolution establishing a sanctions regime against all those who hinder the implementation of the peace agreement is specifically aimed at strengthening our collective action in this area. France is also in favour of strengthening the G5 Sahel Joint Force. This regional initiative endorsed by the African Union, unanimously supported by the Security Council, and supported by the European Union offers a coordinated response with respect to security. With this force, Africa strengthens its commitment to the fight against terrorism. The G5 Sahel Joint Force may serve as a positive model for future African peace operations. In this connection, on Monday - today - the President will take part in a meeting attended by the heads of state of the Sahel, the UN secretary-general, and the EU High Representative. France itself, as you know, is engaged on the ground with Operation Barkhane. But apart from the military and political dimensions of our efforts, we are also engaged in the region's development. It is the combination of these three dimensions - defence, diplomacy, and development - that may guarantee an end to the crisis. And that's why France has adopted the Alliance for the Sahel initiative, which we launched in July and on which we are working with the G5 countries. When it comes to our commitment to the Sahel, France is in it for the long haul. We will host a ministerial meeting on this topic during our Security Council presidency a month from now. CAR This week, I will also attend a meeting on the Central African Republic with President Touadera. But I want to express my concern over the surge in violence by armed groups in recent months, particularly in the centre and southeast of the country. It has resulted in numerous victims. It is therefore urgent to implement the joint roadmap for peace and reconciliation in the CAR, adopted on July 17 in Libreville by the Central African authorities, the African Union, and the countries of the region. Burma/Myanmar In this enumeration of the main crises we are facing today, there is the tragedy of the Rohingya. The crisis that has been going on since August 25 is unprecedented in its severity and can leave no one indifferent. Along with longstanding discrimination against this population, a third of the community has now been forced into exile. 60% of the refugees are reportedly children. This situation calls for a collective response by the international community. We reiterate our call for a halt to the violence against civilians forced to flee in massive numbers and demand that the Burmese security forces guarantee their protection and reestablish safe humanitarian access. We expect Madam San Suu Kyi to make a strong statement tomorrow to this effect, and we hope an effective dialogue can be established based on the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, chaired by Kofi Annan. 3. DEVELOPMENT The urgency of crisis management should not divert attention from the need to ensure our actions are based on a long-term approach. ODA We must adopt a comprehensive approach, as I stated just now, combining security, political legitimacy and economic and human development. This will ensure stability and lasting peace. This is the reason for France's commitment, a commitment made by President Macron, to increase our ODA to 0.55% of GDP by 2022, with priority given to climate, education, gender issues and fragility in Africa. Climate With respect to climate, we want to guarantee and preserve the results of the Paris Agreement. This agreement must be implemented and it is irreversible. There is no alternative solution to achieving the goal of 2oC, just as there can be no solitary or unilateral action in this area. Those who avert their gaze now will also suffer the consequences of climate change. That's why the Conference of the Parties in Bonn from November 6 to 17 is also important. I will be there. The goal of this COP23 , under Fijian presidency, is to prepare for the Facilitative Dialogue which is the main instrument for implementing the Paris Agreement, with a view towards ensuring that the states maintain a strong and ambitious commitment. In perfect synergy with the COP23 discussions, we will again address the implementation of the agreement and notably its funding during the Paris Summit on December 12; an anniversary date. Furthermore, as you know, we intend to hold the next IPCC meeting in France during the first half of 2018 in order to support international climate commitment. But we must go further on the environmental front. This is the goal of the Global Pact for the Environment that President Macron hopes to launch; the first summit focusing on this pact will take place on Tuesday. We will address, together with an inclusive Group of Friends, the challenges posed by such a pact. As Laurent Fabius rightly noted, environmental law is fragmented and incomplete: The goal of this pact is to combine in a single text international environmental rights and principles, in order to further advance them through a process of multilateral negotiations, which we will launch after the summit. 4. REVITALIZING MULTILATERALISM UN reform and multilateral initiatives In all of the crises that I've mentioned we are paying the price for a lack of international cooperation. We are paying this price due to the duration of these crises and as a result of their intensification. This is notably true with respect to the division that is undermining the Security Council. Yet the collaboration between the P5 members, their unity, is key to resolving many crises. This is the purpose of the contact group on Syria, as I mentioned. France wants to be a unifier, it wants to unify the Security Council, which has too often been divided over the last few years to fully play its role. The UN must be better able to respond to the crises in a concrete and effective way. Like all institutions, its functioning could be improved: We are all convinced of that. That's why France fully supports the secretary-general in his determination to reform the organization to make it more effective, more transparent, more responsive. We share his global vision of the three pillars of the UN - peace and security, humanitarian affairs and sustainable development - an indivisible whole. This global view is essential. In general, the UN must decompartmentalize its action because experience has shown the extent to which security issues, emergency issues and development issues are intertwined. President Macron will take part in the high-level debate on peacekeeping hosted on Wednesday by the Ethiopian presidency of the Security Council and France also supports the secretary-general's commitment to ensuring that the UN lead by example in the fight against sexual abuse in peacekeeping operations. Ladies and gentlemen, the crises of the last decade - whether humanitarian, security, health or environmental - have clearly shown that the fates of states were linked and that the response to international challenges called for closer cooperation. In this context, we have a responsibility to defend the frameworks for action and the collectively determined rules of law, while making a commitment to strengthening the UN system, and having the capacity to support new forms of global governance, especially those that respond to the social and technological transformations of our time. This is what we have done with respect to climate change, through the method adopted for the Paris Agreement, bringing together states, NGOs, and civil society actors, and it's a method we want to pursue and strengthen. That's why President Macron will host a dialogue on Wednesday with a panel of NGOs, which I and Nicolas Hulot, Minister for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition, will attend, in order to explain our priorities as well as to involve civil society as closely as possible in our initiatives. Non-proliferation In addition, the uncertain strategic context that I described in my introduction justifies ensuring that our multilateral approach to key international challenges is rigorous and credible. In the area of non-proliferation, France refused to take part in the negotiations on a treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons because such an approach can only weaken the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; however, in the current context, it is clearly the most balanced instrument and consequently the most robust in terms of limiting the risks. In this respect, resorting to catchphrases would be irresponsible. We can create a safer environment through concrete actions. That's why I will take part in the Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty: indeed, this is concrete, credible and realistic progress in the area of non-proliferation. That's why we will also ensure that the Iranian nuclear deal is strictly enforced, while some important deadlines are looming with respect to the timeline for its implementation. It is in this context that we intend to pursue our discussions on this issue. A meeting involving all countries that negotiated the agreement - the Six + Iran - will take place on Wednesday. Cybersecurity I spoke of multilateral creativity. This is what we must also do today with respect to the digital world and cybersecurity. We will address this challenge this morning during an event devoted to this new challenge which requires greater diplomatic commitment. It will provide an opportunity for me to promote a vision of governance involving state and private actors; indeed, firms have a responsibility and a role to play in protecting and ensuring the stability of the digital space. Here again, France will take the lead in promoting the regulations needed to ensure an international order that is just and beneficial to all. Furthermore, the mobilization of the international community to combat online radicalization and the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes is essential. The Security Council resolutions, notably resolution 2178, as well as the secretary-general's plan of action to prevent violent extremism, provide a particularly appropriate framework for action and cooperation, in which we will participate. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the agenda for President Macron, for myself, for Ministre d'Etat Nicolas Hulot during this ministerial week. As you can see, French diplomacy is active working on all fronts with respect to resolving the crises and promoting multilateralism in order to continually try to achieve concrete results. I am available to respond to your questions. Press Conference - Questions from the Press Q. - A topical question about the Kurdish referendum. There's currently huge pressure from the international community on the Kurds to abandon or suspend the referendum. I wanted to know if France has joined in initiatives to propose alternatives to the Kurds. You met Mr. Barzani recently. I wanted to know if, in your view, he might be flexible about abandoning or suspending the referendum? THE MINISTER - Thank you for that question, which is very important and highly topical. We're already preparing for the post-Daesh era in Iraq. And as far as we're concerned, the post-Daesh era requires inclusive political governance, which respects Iraq's constitution and thus its federalist dimension, respects the communities making it up and respects Iraq's territorial integrity. This is the message I conveyed to Prime Minister Abadi at the end of August when I went to Baghdad. It's also what I very clearly told President Barzani. In Iraq's constitution, there are very important elements relating to Kurdistan's constitutional autonomy. These must be respected, validated and secured, and this can be done through the dialogue between Baghdad and Erbil. I think any other initiative would be inappropriate. Q. - Thank you. President Trump has been cautioned by your country and many others against pulling out of the Paris climate accord, against decertifying the Iran deal. Do you see any evidence that his administration is being persuaded by any of this? For instance, the Secretary of State suggested that the United States might stay in the Paris deal under the right conditions. THE MINISTER - The Paris Agreement was a huge step forward by the whole international community. It's unprecedented in its scope, its commitments and the speed with which it has been adopted, since a year later it had been sufficiently ratified for it to be implemented. Today the ratifications are being confirmed: There are already more than 145. So we believe the agreement is going to be implemented. It will be. We note President Trump's statements about his intention not to respect it. For the time being, no concrete action has been taken and we can still hope to persuade him. At any rate, in order to persuade, international pressure must be strong and, moreover, we mustn't stop implementing the Paris Agreement. This is why President Macron called for the climate summit of 12 December, to continue the irreversible implementation of the commitments made. Q. - I also have a topical question about the [North] Korea crisis. Yesterday the US and South Korea carried out manoeuvres to simulate the bombing of North Korea. My question is this: in your view, is this posturing or a war-based approach? And an additional question: can we at last say, at this stage in the crisis, that we can't prevent North Korea from having the nuclear bomb? THE MINISTER - The nuclear and ballistic tests North Korea has carried out recently - and you're aware of how this has been speeded up - are actions carried out in breach of the Security Council resolutions. These actions threaten international security and, firstly, regional security. So France very firmly condemned those tests. We think that this initiative has to be continued with a great deal of firmness within the Security Council and that the adoption of sanctions must be genuinely effective. That takes time. The sanctions decided in 2016 are being adopted today. The sanctions decided in 2017 will be adopted gradually. France is determined for the international community to exert maximum pressure to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. It's the only initiative possible: exerting extremely strong pressure through sanctions and bringing North Korea to the negotiating table. It's an initiative which, obviously, certain countries could join in with. I think that China's shift in this respect is interesting. But it's an initiative which doesn't require significant military action. I'll leave President Trump to provide the necessary explanations for the rest. Q. - Mr. Minister, a question about the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA. Will other signatories like France use this occasion at the UN to try and persuade President Trump not to withdraw his certification and, if he does not certify and at least the US leaving by imposing huge sanctions, can the JCPOA survive if all the other signatories remain committed? THE MINISTER - We've reaffirmed on many occasions - and the President will be sure to do so - the importance of the Vienna agreement and the fact it is being adhered to. We note that checks are being carried out, very strict ones, and so we'll be keeping an eye on the very strict implementation of the agreement. We remain vigilant but today nothing has happened which makes us think the agreement isn't being implemented. We think it's essential to maintain it in order to prevent any spiral of proliferation, not least to deter indirectly the hardest parties in Iran's government from getting involved in acquiring atomic weapons. Furthermore, at a time when we're experiencing the risks you've just mentioned concerning North Korea, it's really important to maintain this policy. At any rate, that's the position France will defend and we'll try to persuade President Trump of the pertinence of that choice. Q. - The question is whether it can survive if the United States stays, or it can survive if the other signatories remain? THE MINISTER - This will be a great responsibility, and it could lead to a process of proliferation which, at that point, it would be difficult to curtail. If one country can have access to nuclear weapons, its neighbours could move in the same direction. So the Iran agreement is absolutely essential. Q. - Mr. Minister, a couple of questions, if you permit me, on what you said regarding Syria: You said you were looking for main players besides the current members of the Security Council for the contact group. Are those main players the same as the guarantors, and I have in mind Iran and Turkey? And another clarification on your very important point on impunity. You connected it to chemical weapons; I don't know if you meant to expand it. However, is it possible and reconcilable with your position as France to say that Bashar al-Assad would have to be part of the transition - so what if he is guilty? And lastly, how relevant is your initiative when the Russians are really running the show on the ground? THE MINISTER - The situation is developing very fast in Syria. New information arrives every day that suggests that Daesh [so-called ISIL] is losing ground. The greatest risk is that Syria's future is determined by the military positions of the various parties at a given time. That would have two inevitable consequences: firstly a fragmentation of the state, which would then foster other forms of fundamentalism and radicalism that would take Daesh's place. Syria's current situation leads us to think that it is important to initiate a political process immediately, as only a political process can avoid these deadlocks and this fragmentation and this indirect call for other forms of terrorism to emerge. That is why we need to move beyond the lines that have failed to produce solutions since 2011. And that is why France wants a contact group to be set up, based on the foundation of the permanent members of the Security Council and regional states concerned by this situation. That is the subject of our discussions on Thursday. I can't give the answer before the meeting. And that is also why it is important for there to be at the same time a de-escalation process, humanitarian access for all and an attempt to reunify Syria's opposition. And that is why, too, we believe that we now need to show realism in two respects. Realism means not making Bashar al-Assad's departure a prerequisite for negotiations. That is why President Macron has taken this initiative. Realism also means not leading people to believe that he can represent Syria's future. I don't see how millions of refugees who have fled the violence he is responsible for can return if he remains in power. So, we need to initiate a political process with all those capable of conducting it. That is today's necessity, independent of prosecution on the chemical weapons and threats issue. We have already stated our views on this subject. We await the end of the inquiry by the UN joint investigative mechanism (JIM), which should present its conclusions soon. For our part, we are convinced that sarin gas was used. Q. - You mean that you want to replace the Astana process? Are you suggesting that the Astana process is over and you need to replace it? THE MINISTER - No, Astana isn't a political process. Astana is a process of resolving de-escalation zones over four individualized areas. The political process is necessary, and the process must be given every chance by supporting the representative, [Staffan] de Mistura, in his action. That's what we proposed on Thursday morning. Q. - A question on the Central African Republic. With the worsening violence in the CAR, would France be ready to send troops to Bangui again to support MINUSCA [United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic]? How will the Alliance for the Sahel be able to boost the creation of the G5 Sahel joint force? THE MINISTER - On the Central African Republic, first of all, why did we intervene at the beginning of 2014? Because at the time, if there hadn't been a buffer force we would have witnessed large-scale massacres between different communities, ethnicities and religions. France fulfilled its mission and Operation Sangaris stopped as soon as there was a presidential election, which wasn't disputed by Mr. Touadera, an uncontested general election, a United Nations mission established in the Central African Republic to guarantee the peace process and, fourthly, a European Union mission aimed at strengthening the FACA, the Central African Armed Forces. From that moment on, France's mission, mandated by the United Nations, was over and it was important for the Central Africans to take control of their destiny with the tools in place. Like you, I note an upsurge in criminal acts of which civilians are the victims. There was an agreement in Libreville. I mentioned it in my initial remarks, and this agreement must be honoured, as well as the tools enabling the agreement to be honoured. They're the tools the United Nations put in place. There's a force called MINUSCA, which is a robust force and which must fulfil its mission. And there's another force, namely the European Union force that is due to train the FACA for its mission. The message we'll be giving President Touadera is, first of all, to strengthen him - he was chosen by universal suffrage - and ensure that the neighbours can put pressure on the groups they have influence over, so that the country finally experiences a bit of calm. So the return of a French operation isn't on the agenda. But on the G5 Sahel force, there is a small link; I imagine you were also drawing it in your question. What's the big new thing about the G5 Sahel force? In terms of forces - because it depends what you include under the term G5 Sahel force - I'm talking about the joint military force, the determination to activate a tool shared by the five countries to protect their borders and combat terrorism. It's not necessarily jihadist terrorism, as you well know: it's often organized crime. But sometimes the two combine: that's gangsterism. To combat this, the five countries have decided to pool their forces. For months, for years we've been talking about an African peace force, and today it's a reality. It's such a reality that the joint force's headquarters have been established, they have a commander-in-chief, they've decided on the various forces - three groups of 1,500 troops - and, in the central area of the combat zone in Liptako-Gourma, it's at a very advanced stage of technical preparation. So for us, it's a considerable step forward for ensuring that gradually, in this zone, Africans themselves take responsibility for Africans' security. The Alliance for the Sahel, it's true, will be implemented, presented, only when we meet at the end of this month, and I'll be chairing a meeting on this. The distinctive feature of the Alliance for the Sahel is that it's a very responsive development tool, which is rarely the case. Alongside the military operation to provide security, there's an effective and visible development tool, especially in the same zones. That's a great challenge and I think we'll succeed at it.

Our global business, operating across the Automotive and Commercial Vehicles sectors, delivered a record order intake in the period, securing significant multi-year orders from a number of clients across Europe, Japan and China. This has extended the ageing of the order book, which also contains a greater degree of material content than in the prior period. The improvement in the flow of orders in the period has enabled a return to more efficient levels of operation, leading to a more profitable business. The market in Detroit remains challenging and this is reflected in the order intake during the period. We are implementing plans to reposition the business and enhance our electrification and autonomous vehicle service offering. Although our US Automotive business ended the period with another loss, the level of losses incurred have reduced compared to the prior period. The Rail business saw strong order intake across key geographies and significant growth in the closing order book, particularly in Asia. The business continues to perform well. Order intake for the Energy & Environment business was in line with the prior period. The closing order book includes a number of multi-year orders for UK Government programmes and reflects a broad private sector and international customer base. Performance Products results Performance Products had a strong first half. Revenues increased on the prior period by 22% to GBP40.6m (HY 2016/17: GBP33.4m) and underlying operating profits increased on the prior period by 15% to GBP3.9m (HY 2016/17: GBP3.4m). The current period performance was principally driven by increased volumes of engines for McLaren, particularly for the higher value 720S engine, together with increased volumes of transmissions for both Bugatti and Porsche. These have been partially offset by a reduction in sales to the Motorsport and Defence sectors. The software business also continues to perform well. MARKET AND STRATEGY UPDATE We have won good levels of new business across all sectors in the period. Ricardo's strategic focus on diversification and the ongoing development of innovative products and technologies, together with the management of complex, large-scale turnkey programmes, underpins the growth of our Technical Consulting business. Our Performance Products business also continues to perform well. In addition to the organic growth generated by our existing activities, the acquired CPC business is now being integrated into our Ricardo Defense Systems ('RDS') business. This acquisition expands upon the Group's vehicle engineering capabilities in the Defence sector and adds expertise in distributed software-based systems and fleet management technologies. In this period we have also expanded our Santa Clara Technical Centre and opened a new electrification and vehicle laboratory to support innovation in the next generation of clean, electrified and increasingly autonomous vehicles. In addition, we have extended our collaboration with Roke to develop robust solutions for autonomous and connected transport systems against cyber attacks. Our strategy continues to be underpinned by long-term trends - population growth, urbanisation, energy security and efficiency, rising demand for natural resources and increasing environmental and emission regulations. We continue to monitor the risk and potential impact of the referendum vote for the UK to leave the European Union and the subsequent triggering of 'Article 50', as disclosed on pages 39 and 40 of the Group's Annual Report & Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2017. These risks are mitigated by the strategy of broadening the base of the business to reduce exposure to any one specific customer, territory or market sector, and is shown by the spread of the Group's order intake across these categories. Ricardo is well placed to assist major international private and public sector customers across sectors including Automotive, Off-Highway & Commercial Vehicles, High-Performance Vehicles & Motorsport, Rail, Energy & Environment, and Defence, and we continue to seek opportunities to grow both organically and through partnerships and acquisitions. We believe that our overall strategy offers risk mitigation through the avoidance of cyclicality and the promotion of growth, supported by investment in excellent people through our apprenticeship programmes, graduate recruitment, and industry hires, together with our investment in the right technologies and the right assets. TECHNICAL CONSULTING Ricardo's Technical Consulting businesses provide innovation-focused services in engineering, technical and strategic consulting to the Automotive, Rail and Environmental consulting markets, together with independent safety assurance and accreditation services to private and public sector customers in the rail industry. Our capabilities are based on the application of intellectual property, know-how and knowledge developed through our investment in research and development ('R&D') and our participation in collaborative R&D programmes in several industries and geographies. These capabilities are complemented by a wide range of design, test and development tools and equipment. Our staff includes specialists in: electronics; software and control strategy; mechanical and electrical design; test and development; vehicle attribute development; prototype build; programme management; independent assurance; signalling; critical system design and development; cost estimation; atmospheric pollutant modelling; environmental science; and environmental economics. We have a global infrastructure that helps us to meet the needs of our customers. Ricardo has 50 sites in 20 countries, with technical centres in the US, the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic and China, supported by offices where a local presence is needed to service our customers. Engineers from the technical centres are deployed on projects across the globe using common engineering processes. Our Energy & Environment consulting services are delivered mainly from the UK but the business is making increasing use of Ricardo's global network in support of its growth objectives. Ricardo's Rail and Strategic Consulting businesses have global teams operating from a number of different locations. Energy & Environment Ricardo Energy & Environment is underpinned by a variety of multi-year contracts for clients that include governments, their agencies, the infrastructure and utilities sector and major corporate customers. Our value proposition is based on our in-depth knowledge of legislative challenges and future technology developments in the energy and environmental consulting sectors. The key focus for growth in our environmental consulting business is in providing additional support and developing common services for our infrastructure and utility sector clients. Our international growth is underpinned by our work to support the international climate change process following the Paris Conference of the Parties ('COP') at COP 21 in 2015, and we had a significant presence at COP 23 in Bonn. Our major area of interest at COP this year has been in climate finance; facilitating private and public partnerships to provide financial support for climate change programmes. Key themes for the business are: air quality and emissions; climate change and sustainability; energy networks and smart grids; resource efficiency and waste management; sustainable transport; water resource management; and chemical risk. Our energy engineering business retains a focus on the development of large-scale generator sets, but increasingly we are seeing collaborations around 'smart grids', energy economics and technologies as part of the electrification agenda. Across the renewables business, we continue to pursue a range of opportunities in offshore wind, community scale solutions and energy storage applications. Rail Our Rail business has continued the strong performance of the previous year, with a record order intake reported for the opening months of the current period. Activity in Europe remains buoyant, with operations in the UK, Netherlands, Spain and Denmark successfully securing new assignments. The Asian market is proving particularly strong, with a notable increase in demand across the region for systems engineering expertise including 'reliability, availability, maintainability and safety' ('RAMS') analysis, human factors engineering, and ensuring electromagnetic compatibility. These are areas in which our technical consultancy offering has long-established capability. This is perhaps best illustrated by the new partnerships recently forged with Asia's major rolling stock OEMs, where Ricardo's expertise is being used to support the introduction of their railway vehicles into service in cities such as Chicago, Boston, Tel Aviv and Melbourne. Automotive In the first half of the year we have seen good levels of activity within Passenger Cars, Motorcycles and High-Performance Vehicles in China and across Europe, while activity in the US has been focused on growth in clean energy vehicle activities led by our technical centre in Silicon Valley. We have secured a range of programmes in the electrified vehicle market across both light- and heavy-duty applications and 24% of the Group's order intake in the period was in connection with vehicle electrification programmes. This compares to 17% of the Group's order intake for the year to 30 June 2017. The pipeline remains strong, especially with the growth of new entrants seeking Ricardo's engineering expertise. \</doc>

The document has been dubbed by Aldo Romani, deputy head of funding, euros, at the European Investment Bank in Luxembourg, "a Rosetta Stone of the existing taxonomies", referring to the classification systems used by various market actors. Released last weekend at the COP 23 climate change conference in Bonn, the white paper is the result of nine months' work by the EIB and China's Green Finance Committee, part of its banking association. It has also been endorsed by the People's Bank of China. The work's immediate purpose is to open a bridge between China's green bond market and that of the West. China's green bond market, almost non-existent until 2016, is now the biggest in the world, thanks to the government's strong push for it.But although the Chinese market has the highest degree of official recognition and organisation, it is not the most attractive to Western investors. Quite apart from the ordinary regulatory difficulties of investing in Chinese bonds, the country's green bond rules allow some uses of proceeds that many European or US investors would not expect in a green bond, such as "~clean coal' power generation. This is a constraint on foreign investment flowing into Chinese green debt, although several Chinese issuers have brought deals specifically aimed at global investors, particularly the big banks, which have used their overseas branches to issue from. The EIB-China "~Phase 1' report is designed to enable Western investors to understand what the Chinese classifications of green bond uses of proceeds mean, in their own terms, and vice versa. China is interested in attracting foreign investment to its green bond market, but this is not the primary driver. It also wants Chinese investors to be able to buy foreign green investments; and wants to promote green finance as an international tool for greening the economy. But the EIB-China work could have more far-reaching consequences. Financial firms and regulators everywhere are wrestling with how to promote green finance. If that is to be done, green finance has to be defined "" but "~green' is not a precise term, and every market actor has its own view. The multilateral development banks and International Development Finance Club have been wrestling with this problem for some years. In 2015 they produced a set of Common Principles for Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking. Every year, each MDB produces its own report of the climate finance it has done, according to its own definitions, and then translates this into the MDB-IDFC harmonised taxonomy, so that the whole group can produce a joint report. When it comes to green bonds, the market "" outside a few countries like China that have official rules "" is even further from having an agreed rule. The Green Bond Principles "" which most Western issuers try to follow "" set out how issuers should manage and govern the process, rather than how green they have to be. Market participants have never wanted to be too prescriptive, for fear of scaring issuers away. But if green bonds are ever to receive public subsidies, a hard and fast standard of what qualifies will be needed. The possibility of subsidies is now increasingly discussed in green bond circles.They are a logical step, since without subsidies, green bonds rarely convey any advantage on the issuer that is big enough to change the economics of its underlying decisions on whether or not to invest in green projects. Green bonds have not, in other words, helped to increase the amount of green infrastructure being built. Sean Kidney, CEO of the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), said at the end of October that he was sure public financial incentives were coming, it was just a question of how and when. The EIB's Romani said: "In Europe, it's clear environmental protection is at the heart of EU integration. But only since September 2016 has the European Commission recognised that we need specific sustainable finance reforms." That led to the EC's formation last December of its High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) on Sustainable Finance, which is due to produce its final report by the end of this year. Having been asked by the HLEG to look at the issue of green bond taxonomies, the EIB is going to propose to it the setting up of a "standard-neutral taxonomy of climate mitigating activities" "" essentially, what it has prepared with the China GFC. This should be followed, the EIB argued, by a set of specialist working groups to replicate this for other green areas, such as adaptation, pollution control, biodiversity and natural resource conservation. The EIB and GFC draw a distinction between taxonomies and standards. Taxonomies list kinds of activity; standards decree what level of performance or improvement a project of a certain kind must show to be considered sufficiently green. Romani described the problem: "Is it possible to find a complete list of indicators that one could debate as co-referents for the market? That would provide a solid basis for additional analysis? That should be what distinguishes a universal taxonomy." The EIB and GFC invited certain groups to submit their taxonomies, and also the standards they require of a green bond, for each category in the taxonomy. The groups they asked were international financial institutions, such as multilateral development banks; and external reviewers serving the green bond market by providing second opinions. So far, only a few in each category have replied, and their requirements have been incorporated into the document. The taxonomies compared in the Phase 1 report are those of China,the EIB, the Dutch development organisation FMO, the Nordic Investment Bank, Beyond Ratings, Cicero, the CBI, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Standard &amp; Poor's. Also compared are the simple taxonomy contained in the Green Bond Principles and that of the MDB-IDFC harmonised reporting framework. The document contains detailed spreadsheets, which aim to list all the kinds of activity, such as wind power generation, and policy objectives, such as pollution control, that can be accepted as proper uses of funds for green bonds. Having a grid to compare different organisations' standards could help both issuers and investors. "If you have a full list, you can specify the activities you consider eligible, and specify a target value for the primary screening indicators," Romani said. "You could have very clear improvements. It would provide guidance to the market, but leave investors and issuers free to follow" their own standards. An ultimate aim would be to let the market embody "clear policy signals", Romani said. "The aim is to create definitions for an organised discussion that will have relevance beyond green bonds," he added. A specific ordinance by the People's Bank of China in 2015 set out a "~catalogue' of what green bonds can finance. The National Development and Reform Commission, the agency charged with ensuring economic policy decisions are implemented in the real economy, has its own catalogue, which is understood to be similar but simpler. These two catalogues are going to be harmonised by March 2018. Some other emerging markets have followed suit with their own organised guidelines for green bonds. "The document has political relevance in the context of the strategic partnership that China and the EU are forging in the areas of climate and clean energy," said Romani. It is clear China is not going to change its catalogues to harmonise with Western standards any time soon: another reason for the taxonomy translation. The clarity and discipline the taxonomy harmonisation will bring to the market are also useful for China, which sees green bonds, with their defined catalogue, partly as an instrument of state control. According to the CBI, which has developed the most thorough set of greenness standards for green bonds, most of the Chinese green bond criteria are in line with its own taxonomy. Three mismatches are that the Chinese standards allow upgrades to coal-fired power stations including clean coal; large hydroelectric projects over 50MW; and bonds with less than 90% of the proceeds allocated to disclosed green assets. Of the $104.5bn of labelled green bonds issued this year, $8.8bn is classed by the CBI as not aligned with its definitions, and much of this is Chinese issuance. The CBI has also worked closely with the PBoC and other Chinese bodies for several years on developing green bonds. \</doc>

BERLIN (Alliance News)\~- German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that the implementation of the Paris climate accord still required a lot of work, referring to the US as the "elephant in the room" that still needed convincing of its importance. Speaking at a climate conference in Berlin, Merkel said that she would use Germany's G20 presidency this year to convince those who are doubtful about whether the accord is necessary. She made no explicit reference to the US or President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly signalled the desire to withdraw from the agreement. Trump once famously said climate change was a hoax invented by China to weaken the US economy. The two-day climate conference, dubbed the Petersberg Climate Dialgoue, brings together representatives of 30 countries in order to prepare for the COP 23 UN\~climate conference taking place in the German city of Bonn in\~November.

WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - The US government has officially informed the UN indicating it will withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate change deal as soon as possible. The State Department said Friday that the US will continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings, including the 23rd Conference of the Parties ( COP-23 ) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to protect US interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration. US President Donald Trump decided to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement arguing that it is harmful to the interests of the country. The decision isolated the US from the international community in the fight against climate change. However, the State Department noted that the president indicated in his June 1 announcement and subsequently, he is open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the US can identify terms that are more favourable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers.

The EIB is investing &euro;5 million ($5.9 million) in the Green for Growth Fund to support development of energy efficiency and renewable energy in the MENA region. EIB is making the acquisition of C shares in GGF via its newly-announced Luxembourg-EIB Climate Finance Platform (LCPF), an initiative between the bank and the Government of Luxembourg. LCPF was announced this week at the COP 23 conference in Bonn. GCF expanded its focus to the MENA region in 2016, where it sees high demand for renewable energy and energy efficiency development. The fund facilitates private investment into households, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises as well as direct financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in low and middle-income countries. GCF primarily invests directly with senior debt into renewable energy projects but also provides financing via local partners that on-lend to enterprises and private households. It was initiated as a PPP in December 2009 by Germany&rsquo;s DFI KfW and the EIB with support from the European Commission, Germany&rsquo;s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the EBRD and the Austrian development bank OeEB. \</doc>

\~ While Tunisia has far fewer oil and gas reserves than its neighbours in the region, it was not until the late 1990s and early 2000s that the country's demand began surpassing domestic production. It was then that Tunisia became dependent on foreign energy imports, and began diversifying its energy mix through renewables and energy efficiency campaigns to curb consumption. Local authorities are now looking to revise Tunisia's hydrocarbons code and further promote foreign investment in the country's relatively small oil and gas industry, especially given the low lifting and breakeven costs. Nevertheless, developing local energy production through renewables and domestic oil and gas requires a number of reforms that have proven challenging to implement against the backdrop of post-revolutionary governmental and economic uncertainties. Size & Scope At the peak of its energy exports in the 1980s, the country was producing 120,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd). According to BP's "Statistical Review of World Energy 2016", Tunisia had 400m barrels of total proven crude oil reserves at the end of 2015. Domestic production hovered around 63,000 bpd in 2015, a 14.1% decrease from the year before, and a 40% decrease from 106,000 bpd in 2007, when production was at its peak. Based on US Energy Information Administration figures, the country also holds 2.3trn cu ft of natural gas reserves - regularly producing in excess of 65bn cu ft annually - as well as two large shale formations in the south, which could potentially yield up to 1.5bn barrels of shale oil and 23trn cu ft of shale gas. Domestic production of gas is expected to start declining by 2020, and the country already sources more than half of its natural gas needs from Algeria (see analysis). While Tunisia satisfied 85% of its energy needs from its domestic production in 2016, an annual 5% rise in electricity demand means the country is facing increased dependency on imports as its domestic production continues to ease. Multiple solutions to the potential future energy shortage are being examined, including the more immediate solution of providing the state-owned energy provider, Soci\'e9t\'e9 Tunisienne de l'Electricit\'e9 et du Gaz (STEG), with coal and diesel generators. However, Tunisia has a long road ahead, as any plan will entail adjusting for cost recovery by increasing prices, managing social tariffs for lower-income households, as well as promoting efficiency, and curbing demand and consumption. Governing Bodies At the end of 2016 the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines (Minist\'e8re de l'Industrie, de l'Energie et des Mines, MIEM) was divided into two governing bodies: the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Ministry of Energy, Mining and Renewable Energies (Minist\'e8re de l'Energie, des Mines et des Energies Renouvelables, MEMER). The latter is in charge of overseeing a number of state-owned enterprises operating across the energy sector's value chain. Such enterprises include: the Tunisian National Oil Company (Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activit\'e9s P\'e9troli\'e8res, ETAP), in charge of the exploration, production and trade of oil and gas; the National Oil Distribution Company (Soci\'e9t\'e9 Nationale de Distribution des P\'e9troles, SNDP), in charge of the distribution of oil and petroleum products across the country; as well as STEG, which owns exclusive rights to market and distribute gas and electricity, and thus holds a monopoly on the transportation and export of Tunisian gas and electricity. Hydrocarbons Code Voted into law in 1999, the first version of Tunisia's current hydrocarbons code entered into force in February 2000. The code provides a framework for production-sharing agreements (PSAs) between ETAP and exploration and production companies. ETAP is authorised to issue four licences: the authorisation for preliminary prospective activities (excluding seismic and drilling surveys), permits for prospecting activities other than drilling, exploration permits and exploitation concessions. The code outlines a tax regime, which includes fixed taxes based on the surface area covered by a permit, a proportional royalty based on the quantity of hydrocarbons produced and a tax on profits. In April 2017 amendments to the existing hydrocarbons code, designed to make Tunisia more competitive, were adopted. The modifications focus on improving market transparency and attracting investment, and - most importantly - harmonise with Article 13 of the constitution, which stipulates that all agreements related to permits have to be approved by law and not by decree. MEMER is also looking to significantly improve the legal code for issuing tenders to make it more efficient and transparent. Upstream Prior to the 2011 revolution, Tunisia was an attractive destination for oil and gas investment - a result of its stable, competitive and transparent bidding regime - and awarded the highest number of exploration blocks in North Africa between 2008 and 2010. However, the sector has experienced its fair share of challenges since. Frequent worker protests have affected output; disruptions to the production of the UK company Petrofac over the first nine months of 2016, for example, cost the Tunisian government $200m, according to local press reports, as it was forced to make up for the shortfall by importing gas from Algeria. The country's limited size has also become more of a constraint in the uncertainty following the Arab Spring. Compared with other major North African oil producers, including Algeria, Libya and Egypt, the scale of reserves and production in Tunisia at the end of 2015 was modest. And while Tunisia is not the only country grappling with unrest, the larger reserves and higher yields in other North African blocks make them a more attractive gamble in an otherwise risky environment. Nonetheless, still present in Tunisia's upstream sector are a large number of foreign multinational operators, including Italian oil and gas multinational Eni, Austrian oil and gas company OMW, as well as smaller companies such as PA Resources, Preussag Energie, Pioneer Natural Resources, Perenco International, Chinook Energy, Winstar Resources, Lundin Petroleum, Atlantis Holding Norway, Storm Ventures International and Candax Energy. While Tunisia's blocks may not offer the same scale as those of its regional counterparts, they are still attracting new interest. The US private equity, asset management and financial services firm, Carlyle Group, announced in May 2016 that it was going to invest $500m in Mazarine Energy, an upstream oil and gas company with assets in Tunisia, to enable the company expand further in Europe and North Africa. Major Players The UK oil and gas company BG Group was Tunisia's largest gas producer prior to its takeover in April 2016 by multinational oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell, which has been active in the country since 1992. The company was responsible for more than 60% of domestic production thanks to its 100% stake in the Miskar gas field, and its 50% share of the Hasdrubal oil and gas field. Eni, one of the oldest players in the sector, has been operating in Tunisia since 1961. The company primarily operates in the Mediterranean offshore blocks near Hammamet and in the desert in the south of Tunisia. Its offshore endeavours include a 49% stake in the Maamoura and Baraka oil fields. Onshore, the company is the operator and 50% stakeholder in the Oued Zar and Djebel Group blocks. Eni also operates and holds a 25% share of the Adam block, as well as a 50% stake in the Makhrouga-Laarich-Debbech and El Borma blocks. Eni has developed 6464 sq km since 1961, and in 2014 it produced approximately 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Other notable sector players include the Austria-based OMV, which operates and holds a 50% stake in the Nawara gas field. According to MEMER, the Nawara field alone is responsible for roughly 17% of Tunisia's domestic gas production. Downstream Tunisia has a single refinery, operated by the Soci\'e9t\'e9 Tunisienne des Industries de Raffinage, a state-owned refining company. The facility, located in Bizerte, produces 34,000 bpd - just enough to meet 30% of domestic demand. Tunisia had sought to build a second refinery north of Gab\'e8s, in Skhira, with initial capacity of 120,000 bpd, scaling up to 250,000 bpd; however, the $2bn project, which was financed principally by Qatar, was suspended in 2014 after production declines in Libya sparked concerns over the reliability of oil supply. However, building additional refineries is not the only action that can be taken. "Rather than investing in an expensive new refinery, investment in the energy sector should focus on revamping Tunisia's current refinery to reduce sulphur ratios and optimise octane ratings," Mohamed Chaabouni, managing director of Vivo Energy Tunisia, told OBG. Another important downstream player is the Tunisian lubricant company, Soci\'e9t\'e9 Tunisienne des Lubrifiants de Rad\'e8s (STLR), a joint venture between Vivo Energy and French oil and gas company Total, which has been producing local lubricants since 1974, with a total capacity of 40,000 tonnes per year. In July 2016 the SNDP announced it had acquired a 34% stake in another lubricants firm, Soci\'e9t\'e9 des Lubrifiants de Tunisie, as part of a tripartite agreement with OiLibya and Libya Oil Holdings. Total, Anglo-Dutch Shell - with its local licensee Vivo Energy - and Tunisia's Agil are the country's major downstream oil marketing and distribution operators, while the SNDP has a more than 40% market share for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In 2015 Total, which operated 155 petrol stations in the country, acquired a local LPG company, Sagaz, and was estimated to control around 28% of the LPG market in 2016. Meanwhile, Vivo Energy currently operates 170 Shell brand licensed petrol stations and controls an estimated 29% of the market for both LPG and retail petrol sectors, according to Vivo Energy's Chaabouni. Agil operates 206 stations, and OiLibya and Tunisia's StarOil are also active players in the retail market. Electricity According to the MIEM, Tunisia's energy production grew by 5% year-on-year (y-o-y) from January to April 2015, from 5204 to 5473 GWh. Independent power producers (IPPs) generated 1085 GWh in that month, while STEG produced the remaining 4361 GWh - including 3543 GWh from natural gas. In April 2014, 96.3% of the country's electricity came from natural gas, while 3.5% came from wind power, and 0.2% from fuel and gas oil. A year later, those numbers were reported as 85%, 3.7% and 10.8%, respectively. Demand for electricity similarly increased by 5% y-o-y in March 2015. The bulk of demand comes from low-voltage clients, who represented 48% of all electricity sales in March 2015, while medium-voltage clients made up 42% of the market and high-voltage clients, mainly consisting of industrial clients, accounted for the remaining 10%. However, even with increasing power generation capabilities, Tunisia may still face challenges in meeting energy demands. One possible solution in the short to medium term is a submarine transmission link to Italy, which could be used to tap into excess gas-fired power generation. The 192-km submarine cable between northern Tunisia and southern Sicily could provide Tunisia with between 600 and 1200 MW from existing plants in Italy, some of which are mostly idle. Subsidies Following the 2011 revolution, Tunisia's government increased universal energy subsidies in order to address popular unrest over rising prices, but it subsequently reversed course in 2012, marginally reducing energy subsidies with a view to gradually eliminating them, starting with industrial consumers. Energy subsidies to cement companies, for example, were halved in 2014, before being cut altogether in 2015. The government twice increased taxes on electricity for low- and medium-voltage clients by 10% in May 2014. Cutting subsidies forms a major part of the government's energy efficiency project, and while they are helping eliminate market distortions, they are also prompting concern from energy-intensive consumers - including manufacturing industries facing increasing overhead costs. However, despite the government's progressive attempts to reduce and eliminate them, energy subsidies continue to cost 5% of the overall GDP. Energy Efficiency In addition to reducing subsidies, Tunisia is looking to increase its energy efficiency by 3% per year from 2013 to 2020. To achieve this, electricity demand will need to be reduced by an average of 1.4% per year, according to the World Bank. "Tunisia has always been a regional pioneer in terms of energy efficiency," N\'e9jib Osman, energy and climate change expert from the National Agency for Energy Conservation (Agence Nationale pour la Ma\'eetrise de l'Energie, ANME), told OBG. "Tunisia has been working on controlling its consumption levels since the late 1980s in anticipation of future energy deficits," he added. Prior to 2011, Tunisia implemented an energy conservation strategy to progressively reduce demand by implementing new laws, creating a national fund to control energy, and using a series of financial incentives and mechanisms to entice the public to switch to thermal water heaters and install photovoltaic (PV) solar panels. Thanks to such initiatives, the country was able to reduce its energy intensity by 2.5% over the course of six years, from 2005 to 2011. However, during the period of political uncertainty following the 2011 revolution, Tunisia's national energy efficiency drive stagnated. "Between 2011 and 2015 energy efficiency policies were maintained, but a lack of economic growth caused a decrease in energy efficiency," Osman told OBG. Nevertheless, a law on renewable energy was passed in May 2015 that set out goals for the 2015-30 period. "However, many of the orders needed for implementation, such as a decree on contract typologies, are still missing. These are required to make this legislation sustainable," Osman added. In June 2016 a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on energy efficiency was signed between South Korea and Tunisia to allow cold accumulation - a type of thermal energy storage - to be used during peak demand periods. According to a statement by Ameur Bechir, director-general of STEG, cold accumulation will help cool water and store it for later use in air conditioning systems, which are a significant contributor to the nation's energy consumption bill. Wind As authorities look to develop renewable energy as a way to meet growing domestic consumption needs in line with international climate change and sustainable development principles outlined at the 2015 COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change wind energy is among the priorities. The wind segment is not new to Tunisia, with two existing turbine farms and a total installed capacity of 224 MW. Tunisia sourced 3.7% of its domestic power generation in April 2015 from wind power, and ongoing innovation in the segment largely suggests its role in the energy mix could significantly increase in the coming years. Tunisian start-up Saphon launched the first prototype of its bladeless wind energy converter on April 8, 2016. According to the company, the turbine's bowl-shaped sail is able to capture double the amount of wind energy as a conventional turbine, and is capable of converting 80% of wind power into energy. By comparison, traditional wind turbines convert around 59% of wind power into energy. Solar Another potential avenue for energy generation is solar. Originally drafted in 2009 and revised in 2012, the Tunisian Solar Plan looks to increase the share of renewable energy on the national grid to 30% by 2030 - with 15% coming from wind power, 10% through PV and 5% through concentrated solar energy. "In addition to this, Tunisia is looking to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 41% by 2030," ANME's Osman told OBG. "This means that we will emit 41% less greenhouse gas yet maintain the same level of GDP." Tunisia has been home to small-scale solar production since the 1980s, but the technology was mainly geared towards helping individual households reduce their electricity bill. The country has a 20% higher solar radiation level than the most radiated areas in Europe, varying from 1600 to 1750 KWh per sq metre of sun radiation annually. The total capacity of solar PV was 15 MW at end-2014 and consisted almost entirely of small-scale private residential installations whose capacity ranged from 1 KW to 30 KW. As of early 2015 Tunisia possessed just three operational PV installations with a capacity of over 100 KW: a 211-KW installation operated by the state-owned National Water Distribution Utility; a 149-KW installation in Sfax; and a 100-KW installation in the Korba region. However, a new project should significantly boost solar generation. The TuNur project, which will create Tunisia's first large-scale solar farm, and is set to open in the Tozeur governorate in 2018, in an area of the Sahara Desert with an annual solar radiation level of 2500 KWh per sq metre. The 10-MW concentrated solar power plant will generate 9400 GWh of renewable and dispatchable electricity per year, which will be transmitted via undersea cable to Germany, Switzerland, France and the UK. Not only will the plant contribute to increasing energy security in Tunisia and North Africa, but it will also help address renewable energy demand in Europe. Stakeholders include the TuNur Development Company; UK-based clean energy investors Low Carbon; Franco-Tunisian green investors Glory Clean Energy and the Maltese investment firm Zammit Group. It is expected save up to 16m tonnes of oil equivalent per year, or 1.5% of the domestic consumption. Construction began in early 2017 with an extension in the works to increase capacity to 20 MW. The STEG-issued international tender to build the TD15bn ((EURO)6.4bn) plant was won by Japanese company and general contractor Takaoka Engineering. Privatisation Although the authorities have expressed interest in welcoming additional IPPs and building more privatised power plants, in 2011 investor interest hit an all-time low. "There have been no projects since the revolution. Financing and regulations are not an issue here; the problem is the lack of a visible and credible five- to 10-year energy strategy for Tunisia. This has been delayed and modified following each of the many government changes since the revolution," Ali Hjaiej, business development director of Clarke Energy, told OBG. "In order for the power sector to truly develop and grow, STEG needs to let producers produce and agree on a tariff that works for all," he added. Attracting more IPPs and placing a larger share of power generation into the hands of private players could improve the quality, technology and efficiency of the sector. Major energy stakeholders agree that holding public tenders would help attract new investment. The authorities are still ironing out some regulatory issues, particularly regarding the difficulty in privatising the sector and continued government involvement through subsidies. "The sector's development is stinted by the lack of openness in the solar market. Current regulations are such that it takes up to one year to ultimately obtain only a 30% subsidy on solar panels," Khaled Nasraoui, deputy CEO of Tunisian solar panels manufacturer Aurasol, told OBG. "The market needs to be more open, with less government intervention." Outlook Confronted with a growing energy deficit, Tunisia is looking at different ways to improve its energy supply while conforming to international standards on climate change. As domestic production eases, further amendments to the legislation surrounding the hydrocarbons sector to make it more attractive to investors is likely. Tunisia is also looking to reduce its carbon footprint by 41% by 2020, and increase energy efficiency by 3% per year between 2013 and 2020. Coupled with the target of producing 30% of its energy through renewables by 2030, the country is committed to diversifying its energy sources and reducing its supply gap. \</doc>

"The green bond market ended up at $155bn of issuance last year," said Alzbeta Klein, director of climate business at the IFC in Washington. "This is the fastest growing asset class in the world "" up 61% year on year. We foresee continued growth. We want to move from financial institutions to corporates. And in the sovereign space we are seeing new interest." On March 16, the IFC formally launched Amundi Planet "" Emerging Green One, a $1.4bn closed end fund it has set up to buy green bonds issued by emerging market banks. The fund, which has raised private institutional money as well as cash from IFC and other development banks, has senior, mezzanine and junior tiers, and will be managed by Amundi. It is an innovative way to channel risk-averse Western money with a green bent to where it is most needed: small projects in the emerging markets. Banks are a particularly useful conduit for this, because their local networks and expertise enable them to make and risk-manage loans to whatever green projects are most needed and viable in their countries. The IFC plans to use its relationships with 750 EM banks to encourage them to bring green bonds to market. It cannot promise banks the EG1 fund will buy their bonds, since Amundi makes the investment decisions independently, but the existence of this buyer "" which can swallow a whole green bond issue "" is meant to give issuers confidence. But the IFC's efforts to enlarge the green bond market will not end there. Another fund is in the works. "The next stage is to help utilities that are tilting their energy mix to renewables "" to help them issue green bonds," said Klein. A few corporate deals the IFC has worked on are on the way. And the IFC is in discussions with some other Asia Pacific governments about issuing green bonds. Learning from Fiji To help with such conversations and foster more, the IFC last week published Guidance for Sovereign Green Bond Issuers. The pamphlet, written by Aaron Levine, a senior financial sector specialist at the IFC in Sydney, draws on the IFC's experience advising Fiji, which in November became the first government outside Europe to issue a green bond. The F$100m ($50m) bond was issued domestically, but since launch, the government has sought to list it on a foreign exchange, and a listing on the London Stock Exchange is expected in April. "With the work we had done, we thought we would draw it out and bring it into a guide," said Levine. "We'd love to see more emerging economies issue green bonds." IFC's mission is to work with the private sector, but sometimes, as with the Fiji bond, it has skills that can help governments, in collaboration with World Bank colleagues. This plays into the IFC's new overall strategy, which emphasises creating markets. "The sovereign green bond market is very nascent," said Klein. "It's not something IFC would be investing in, but we believe we can help create this market. Through the Fiji experience we can prove it was very impactful." The guide sets out the purpose of green bonds, what governments should consider before issuing, and how they should prepare for the deal, issue it and what to do afterwards. Throughout, there are tables and examples of what Fiji did. Fast mover Fiji's deal was brought to market quite quickly during 2017, after Poland and France had issued the first sovereign green bonds in December 2016 and January 2017. The idea had germinated in a conversation between Ariff Ali, governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, and Deva De Silva of the IFC's Pacific team. Fiji's presidency of the COP 23 climate change conference in November 2017 gave a particular urgency to the government's efforts, but Fijians are keenly aware of climate change anyway. In 2016 the country suffered heavy damage from Tropical Cyclone Winston, the worst ever recorded in the southern hemisphere. "Core to Fiji's presidency was the promotion of climate finance," said Levine. "They wanted to be seen to be acting on it. By being the first emerging economy to issue, the first in the region and the first that had particular climate change adaptation challenges, they wanted to send a message that finding solutions to resilience challenges is a real issue. They were finding a private sector solution to funding public infrastructure." Fiji's green bond was for adaptation projects to strengthen the country against future bad weather. Levine said the main obstacle to other governments issuing green bonds was simply the product's novelty, and the knowledge gap that went with that. There are also transaction costs. "Transparency is critical for the legitimacy of green bonds, so you invest in external opinions," Levine said. The World Bank Group supported Fiji's outlay on an external review by Sustainalytics, but Levine said this was not the most burdensome cost. The Australian government paid for the technical advice the IFC gave Fiji. Levine emphasised that for sovereigns in particular, it could be a challenge to get many parts of government to work together on defining and tracking the green projects to be financed; and that states should not forget to allocate money to cover the need to report on a green bond's use of proceeds during its life. Pay-offs for the investment So why should EM governments go to all this trouble? The guide emphasises three possible benefits: the strong demand green bonds attract, especially from new investors; they can "provide a marketing platform for a sovereign to demonstrate its efforts in combatting climate change"; and they can create markets for corporate and financial issuers. "I think Fiji was surprised at the incredible level of interest," said Levine. "The deal was heavily oversubscribed. Domestic banks, which don't typically buy government bonds [longer than one year], supported the five year tranche. The 13 year tranche had some international interest as well as domestic institutions." The guide said the bonds had been priced "marginally inside the yield curve". Fiji's experience of bringing its first deal was clearly a good one. Nigeria's first green bond, priced a few weeks later, took 18 months to bring to fruition, with advice from the Climate Bonds Initiative and Citigroup, among others. At a recent CBI conference panel, several issuers from large commercial banks such as National Australia Bank and Industrial Bank of China said it had been a multi-year process for them to get to the point of being able to issue their first green bonds. Support from the most senior executives, ideally the very top of the organisation, helps enormously to make things go faster, as does efficient governance. The IFC's report recommends appointing a steering committee, bringing together all the ministries involved as well as bodies like the central bank and even the private sector. For the post-deal reporting, it strongly recommends appointing a single project leader. Banks move slowly to market"\£6 These issues go some way to explaining why, despite the IFC's long commitment to promoting green bond issuance among its client group of EM banks, it has still produced only a smattering of deals. Successes include TSKB of Turkey in 2016 and Bancolombia and Banco Davivienda in Colombia and Poland's Bank Zachodni in 2017. But because of the shortage of deals, the Amundi Planet "" EG1 fund is only scheduled to have deployed 15% of its capital in green bonds after two years, and it could take seven years to allocate all the money. "When we originate green financing for a financial institution in emerging markets, we require a different reporting standard from that institution," she said. "They have to understand what is climate business." Green bonds the IFC supports are structured according to its standards. The banks have to take on board the IFC's categorisation of what kind of projects count as climate finance and track these. "Only after that can they issue green bonds," said Klein. "It's a fair bit of work, and that is not free." With support from the Swiss government, and perhaps in future other countries, the IFC will mount a programme of education for banks on green finance. "\£6 but interest is wide The IFC regularly surveys its client banks. "When we did the last one, 69% were interested in green finance," said Klein, "but only about 20% knew what it would look like. We decided to target the 50 biggest ones through our advisory services." Some of these have already issued and are keen to again; others are receiving technical assistance; and a third group are "not at that stage yet" said Klein. "But it goes hand in hand with the business opportunity," she said. "When you look at renewables, in 31 emerging countries, they are cheaper than fossil fuel-generated electricity. Somebody is financing them, and that somebody is banks. There is good business to be done." In 2016, about $300bn was invested globally in renewable energy, of which less than $1bn came from the IFC and less than $5bn from all development institutions. That meant $295bn came from other sources, mainly commercial banks, many of them in emerging markets. This flow of lending, even though it is dispersed among many banks, is the kind of asset that can be used for green bond financing. Banks are already financing these loans without green bonds, but accessing this market could help them tap fresh investors at attractive terms, while garnering good publicity and messaging "" exactly the mix of incentives the IFC believes could also draw more EM companies and governments to the market. \</doc>

The future of nuclear will largely be decided in large countries that consume most of the world's energy. There are always positive-sounding stories about various countries seriously considering nuclear power for the first time, but these are unlikely to have the same impact as what, for example, the USA or China decides to do on energy policy. In October, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held a three-day ministerial meeting on nuclear energy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which threw the spotlight on the Middle Eastern countries which may or may not seek nuclear energy. Some beyond the UAE (which has four reactors with construction well advanced) may eventually get there, but it is a long and slow process. Saudi Arabia is the most likely, but plans for nuclear have been discussed for many years there and are still making only slow progress. Lower oil prices do not help the major oil producers finance a shift away from fossil fuel dependence. Yet news at the end of 2017 that Bangladesh has started construction on its first reactor shows that even developing countries can begin to establish realistic nuclear programmes if the will is there. The continued operation of existing reactors is half of the battle to achieve higher nuclear shares of world electricity supply in the future. New reactor programmes attract a lot of comment and discussion but keeping those already established is vital. Germany unfortunately continues to look like a hopeless case, with few signs of any U-turn away from the decision to phase out nuclear by the early 2020s. In France and the USA, however, things look better at the end of 2017 than they did at the beginning. US and France support existing fleets In France, the practical difficulties of reducing the nuclear share from over 70% of power generation to 50% have become apparent. With only slow growth of power demand, reactor closures will be necessary and these involve a lot of jobs losses and hence conflicts with organised labour. More importantly, the German example suggests that replacing shut down nuclear plants with renewable energy is not practical and will only promote more use of dirty fossil fuels. Hence France will find it very hard to meet its environmental objectives. The difficulties of EDF financing the expenditure necessary for reactor uprates - needed to keep reactors running after 40 years - is another factor, but it is the overall national plan on energy which is the key. The Macron administration is only now finding its feet on energy matters and will be watched closely in 2018. Having become so dependent on nuclear, providing relatively cheap and clean power, what is France now going to do as the reactors age? In the USA the news from the new-build side has been terrible, with one of the twin AP1000 programmes abandoned and the other limping forward. For now, the future of the almost 100 reactors already in operation is more important. The Trump administration said it will take steps to revitalise and expand the US nuclear sector and this includes examining how power markets can disadvantage nuclear. To meet security of supply objectives, the Department of Energy has proposed a rule for consideration by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would strengthen the market position of coal and nuclear units by providing them with payments that reflect their full costs, if they have a certain amount of fuel on-site. Also state level proposals would include nuclear in mandated levels of clean energy, where it has previously been excluded. Fossil fuel plant owners and renewable energy groups, among others, have opposed all these proposals, but they at least reflect a renewed interest in serious energy planning rather than just leaving things to the market. Low gas prices have led to economic pressure on everything apart from gas generation, with renewable energy being heavily subsidised. New-build scaled back in Asia On the new-build side, things unfortunately look rather worse at the end of 2017, as can be seen in China and South Korea. There are rising concerns about the likely magnitude of the Chinese nuclear programme (August 2017, pp. 10-11 'Nuclear in China - why the slowdown?'). Future positive projections of world nuclear growth rely on a huge contribution from China, often amounting to over half of the new reactors. New reactors being commissioned are mostly Chinese units. It is clear, however, that the programme has slowed sharply with no approvals for new reactor construction starts for the past two years. The optimists see this as a temporary phenomenon, awaiting the startup of the first AP1000 units at Sanmen and Haiyang, and the EPRs at Taishan. The alternative interpretation is that China is at last facing the stream of negative issues that affect nuclear elsewhere in the world, such as rising costs, lower power demand, competition from other generation modes, a push towards renewable power and public acceptance challenges. Expectations of how many nuclear units China will commission in the 2020s and beyond are continuously revised downwards. In South Korea, the election of a President with a long-term nuclear phase-out strategy has been tempered by the approval, by a citizen's jury, of continued work at those few reactors currently under construction. These will likely be the last new reactors there and with operating reactors mandated to shut down after 40 years (irrespective of any safety consideration), the phase-out plan is still in place. It could be reversed by allowing older units to continue operating, but the government successfully tapped into a lot of anti-nuclear sentiment during the election campaign. Whatever happens (and the operating reactors in South Korea are a lot newer than those in France and the USA) there is no longer any expectation that an average of one new unit per year will be commissioned in South Korea throughout the 2020s. Climate focus Nuclear advocates continue to rely on its environmental credentials but this remains a flawed strategy. The conference statement from the IAEA ministerial conference said that nuclear power is not attracting enough investment to limit climate change, and more clarity from policymakers may be needed to support its development. It suggested that one way to spur growth of nuclear power and help limit global average temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius would be to include nuclear energy in definitions of clean energy incentives. But IAEA officials noted that only about ten countries currently do so. This is the problem. For most people, tackling climate change and dirty air in cities means more renewable power. While the problems of replacing fossil fuels and nuclear with wind and solar are gradually becoming apparent, pushing for more nuclear as a solution will not work while most people remain afraid of it. It is not going to become part of national energy plans unless something fundamental is done to address this. And to the contrary, much of the push towards clean energy will explicitly exclude it. This was highlighted in November at the 23rd annual conference of parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 23 ) in Bonn. Nobody wanted to talk about nuclear there, and it was confined to a few fringe meetings promoted by pro-nuclear organisations. One big issue this year was how to proceed following the USA's notice of withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Accord. Interestingly its delegation came and promoted the joint interests of coal and nuclear, consistent with the new policy focus mentioned above. This has the unfortunate effect of identifying nuclear with the interests of the coal lobby, which should be the real pariah in climate change. Several countries indicated less firm intentions of lowering carbon dioxide emissions, especially by maintaining a commitment to high levels of coal use. The host country, Germany, found itself in a difficult position with its lack of progress reducing emissions, as it has a long-term commitment to a high level of coal dependence along with cutting back the role of nuclear power. One fundamental question is whether the COP process and the Paris Accord have anything to do with seriously curbing climate change. They do not discuss nuclear power (nor hydropower for that matter) so how can all the people gathered there seriously be concerned about averting global warming? Are they not just there as lobbyists for the various renewable energy alternatives? Germany is providing a good example of how difficult it is for renewable technologies to achieve reduced carbon emissions, so how can they ignore two large technologies that can clearly do so, given the right backing? Each country can achieve its environmental targets by whatever means it deems acceptable, but how credible is the process when all they are talking about is renewable energy programmes that seem unlikely to achieve what is expected of them? Nuclear advocates are holding out hopes that nuclear will be included with renewables as a clean form of energy. They try to come to an accommodation with a process that has been overtaken by lobbyists who reject scientific evaluations of the merits of alternative energy options. As a result, nuclear is dumped in the 'unacceptable' box along with coal. Nuclear is attacked from all sides - from the environmentalists promoting renewable energy and from the fossil fuel interests. Although the fossil people at least are not claiming that they are serious about averting climate change, they have historically been nuclear's biggest opponent. This battle is now out in the open again in the USA, where coal, oil and gas interests can see nuclear making some (minor so far) inroads into public policy. If nuclear is not going to remain marginalised in most national energy policies, it has to try the different approach long advocated in these columns. It is not sufficient to wait for renewable energy to get found out for what it really is, which is very limited in suitability for developed economies requiring intensive and reliable energy supply. It is hard to persuade people that everything they have learned about nuclear power and radiation is wrong, but this needs to be tackled head on. If people are afraid of a technology, it is highly unlikely that it will become acceptable, even as a last resort after all else has failed. Switching to a new paradigm away from fear of nuclear is incredibly difficult when the whole institutional setup of the nuclear industry supports the fear. But a start has to be made somewhere: accepting that current nuclear advocacy is not going to work, is the first step.

\~ Improved connectivity is a key pillar of Morocco's economic development strategy. Internally, better road and rail links can improve the business environment by reducing transport costs and spreading economic development nationwide. Upgrades will prove particularly effective in bringing investment to more isolated regions. Externally, the marked increase in air and maritime connectivity since the turn of the century has helped Morocco integrate itself in regional and global supply chains, with ongoing investment in its ports and airports set to further advance industrialisation over the medium to long term. The strategic decision to locate special economic zones close to the main intercontinental ports has boosted activity, and there are calls to develop additional zones beside the country's airports. With the kingdom's beneficial location on the crossroads between Africa and Europe, Morocco is emerging as a continental transport and logistics hub. TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE: Given Morocco's exposure to climate change and the kingdom's hosting of the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change in November 2016, there has been a growing realisation in recent years that transport investment can also help achieve environmental goals by reducing carbon emissions. To that end, a number of measures have been introduced specifically to support these efforts. Some initiatives that coincided with COP22 included the launch of a national green logistics charter, the introduction of the Medina Bike programme in Marrakech (see analysis), and the Airport Carbon Accreditation at the mapping level for Marrakech Menara Airport and Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca. ROAD TO SUCCESS: The road network is the backbone of the country's transport system, and has been experiencing significant traffic growth over the past two decades. When measuring the millions of vehicle kilometres travelled per year, there was a 74% increase - from 52.7m to 91.6m - in the 10 years to 2013. According to the National Highway Office (Autoroutes du Maroc, ADM), that number had increased to 1.6bn as of the end of 2017. Sustained investment in Morocco's highway system is proving to be a boon to the economy. In the near term, construction works are supporting domestic demand and creating jobs, while in the longer term, increased connectivity should reduce shipping costs for businesses, helping to attract inward investment, improve regional connections and reduce carbon emissions by promoting fuel efficiency. These benefits could eventually extend throughout broader West Africa, with both Morocco and Nigeria signalling in late 2016 their intent to pursue a continental-scale highway that would link Tangiers and Lagos. "The only challenge that remains is security," Anouar Benazzouz, CEO of the ADM, told OBG. "We have seen an increase in traffic: 560,000 vehicles now use Morocco's motorways every day, which has led to an increase in delinquency with cars. Also, a campaign needs to be run to prevent pedestrians from crossing motorways, which results in 160 deaths per year." The 142-km El Jadida-Safi motorway segment opened in August 2016, with toll operations beginning the following month. Originally slated to open in March 2015, the project experienced multiple delays - one resulting from the appearance of holes in the surface of the motorway in the months leading up to the opening. Construction work had been under way since 2012 and cost at least Dh4.8bn ((EURO)444.5m). With the motorway now open, travel times between El Jadida and Safi, Casablanca and Essaouira have been significantly reduced. The government's priority road projects for 2017 involved reducing congestion around the Greater Casablanca metropolitan area, notably with construction of the Tit Mellil-Berrechid motorway and the widening of the Casablanca-Berrechid highway from one to three lanes. With 10 companies preselected for work on the expansion, construction is expected to take two to three years once a final offer has been selected. The ADM is also continuing with the digitalisation of motorway tolling, a task that has been under way since 2014 in collaboration with Vinci, a French civil engineering and construction company. "The ADM introduced Jawaz, an electronic toll," Benazzouz told OBG. "This came in line with its transformation from a construction company into a customer service company in terms of operations". Looking to the future, plans are being prepared for the development of up to seven new motorway projects, which would extend the country's network by some 1500 km. Among the routes under consideration are Fez-Oujda, Tangiers-T\'e9touan, Fez/Mekn\'e8s-Tangiers/T\'e9touan, Rabat-Casablanca, Marrakech-Kela\'e2t Sraghna, Fez-Taounat and a ring road around Agadir. It is envisaged that these projects, if given the green light, would be delivered through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and aim for a 2030 completion date. HIGH-SPEED RAIL: Early 2017 saw testing begin on Morocco's long awaited high-speed intercity rail network (train \'e0 grande vitesse, TGV). Section one of the TGV is due to open in June 2018, and will link the cities of Tangiers and Kenitra in one and a half hours along a 183-km route. By end-2016 construction works were reportedly 85% complete. The TGV mega-project will ultimately extend from Tangiers to the commercial capital of Casablanca along a 350-km route, passing through the capital Rabat along the way. The double-decker trains will reach speeds of up to 320 km per hour, reducing travel time between Tangiers and Casablanca from the current five hours by train or three and a half hours by car to two hours and 10 minutes. The journey from Rabat to Tangiers, meanwhile, is only expected to take one hour and 20 minutes. Speaking to local media in late 2016, Mohamed Rabie Khlie, director-general of the National Railways Office (Office National des Chemins de Fer, ONCF), said, "To achieve the target of 6m passengers a year, there will be a departure every hour from Casablanca and Tangiers, with the aim to achieve an average occupancy rate of 70%." He citied the need to set ticket prices at an appropriate level to reach those targets, adding, "We will run trains intended for Moroccans and thus adapted to their purchasing power." A one-way ticket on the Tangiers-Kenitra route is likely to cost about $20. In total, the TGV project is expected to cost some $1.9bn, funded by the governments of Morocco, France, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE. The Islamic Development Bank also granted a Dh1.23bn ((EURO)113.9m) loan for the project in March 2017. The second phase of the TGV, extending the route to Casablanca, should also involve an upgrade to the Casablanca-Marrakech line, which would ultimately see a reduction in the journey time along the length of the line from Tangiers to Marrakech from its current 10 hours to about three. URBAN TRANSPORT: Amid increased urbanisation and economic development, traffic congestion has become an unfortunate fact of life in Morocco's main cities. Efforts are being made to build additional roads and realign pivotal junctions in and around Casablanca and Rabat, with investment being ramped up in traffic management technology. Municipal authorities in large cities have also promoted the introduction and extension of modern tramway systems and bus networks (see analysis). Sustained investment in such infrastructure will be needed to stay ahead of the curve, as car traffic grew 3.5% in 2016 in Casablanca alone. TAKING TO THE AIR: Perhaps the biggest game-changer in Moroccan air travel since the turn of the century was the signing of the Open Skies Agreement with the EU in 2006, which liberalised the rules and regulations governing international aviation between the kingdom and the bloc. A surge of new and low-cost operators in the market followed, first among them being Jet4U (now trading as TUI fly), and others such as Ryanair and EasyJet. This set the scene for a decade of double-digit growth in passenger traffic, which reached a new record of 20.4m in 2017. Not only did this agreement facilitate increased tourist traffic to Morocco, but it reduced prices and allowed Moroccans living abroad to return to the country more regularly. Indeed, passenger numbers at the kingdom's airports grew by 11.63% in 2017. "The Open Skies Agreement, signed in 2006, allows any European low-cost airline to fly to and from Morocco, which has led to fierce competition," Abdelhamid Addou, CEO of national carrier Royal Air Maroc (RAM), told OBG. "With 40 low-cost carriers bringing more competition for the aviation segment, our airline had to transform itself into a much more efficient operator. Thus, we had to protect our market share, which led to huge investments and promotions." Revenues have also continued to increase as sector players bring new income streams on-line and work to maximising profits from existing passenger throughput - one example being the introduction of paid parking at Marrakech Menara Airport. Underpinning this growth, and laying the foundations for increased air traffic in the future, has been a national push to develop the aviation sector and ensure that related infrastructure in the country matches the strong demand. Notable recent improvements in aviation infrastructure - through a (EURO)400m investment programme over the 2014-16 period - include a new Dh1.22bn ((EURO)113m) terminal at Marrakech Menara Airport, which saw passenger capacity triple to 9m in 2016, and the inauguration in May 2017 of a new terminal at Fez's airport, which raised the facility's annual capacity from 500,000 to 2.5m. Furthermore, a new terminal is under construction at Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca, which will see annual passenger capacity nearly double from 7.5m to 14m. It is set to open in the first half of 2018. Over the long term, a new $520m airport is envisaged for Marrakech with an annual capacity of 10m passengers to meet projected air traffic to the city of 14.37m by 2030. RECOGNITION: Another significant recent development was a comprehensive agreement between Morocco and Eurocontrol that came into force in May 2016, fully integrating the kingdom into the organisation's working structures. Eurocontrol, with its 41 member countries and two comprehensive agreement signatories, aims to deliver a "single European sky" that will provide air traffic management. Also in 2016, Morocco received Airport Carbon Accreditation at the mapping level for Marrakech Menara Airport and Mohammed V International Airport. This certification, which signifies the kingdom's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint in air travel, is expected to be granted to other airports in 2018. BLUE SKIES AHEAD: The medium- to long-term outlook for the aviation sector is bright. Passenger traffic is picking up after a slowdown in 2016; a 3.6% growth in traveller numbers was recorded that year, which was roughly half the average of the 2004-15 period. Meanwhile, income from associated commercial operations should continue to improve the bottom line by boosting profit per passenger and generating new avenues for growth. Connections to other African countries are likely to drive growth in the future, but continued infrastructure investment will be needed to keep pace with the increasing number of passengers, particularly in airports like Casablanca and Rabat, where landing slot allocations come at a premium. According to market regulators, other areas of focus include further improvements to service quality, integration of new smart technologies, and boosting operational and financial performance. "Major challenges for carriers still include the hub experience, the softening of connection times and delays caused by cabin luggage," added Addou. "However, overall punctuality has improved from 71% to 86% over the past 18 months." Jawad Ouaziz, country manager for Morocco, Tunisia and Mauritania at DHL, told OBG there is also scope to increase air freight connectivity to match that seen for passengers. Addou went on to say that RAM already accounts revenues of $100m from air freight, adding that capacities are expected to increase more than 10-fold. A new Boeing 767, for instance, is set to begin operations in February 2018, further boosting capacity. HIGH SEAS: In the maritime sector, more remains to be done to increase linkages between facilities in Casablanca and Tangiers, and other leading ports around the world. According to the National Ports Agency (Agence Nationale des Ports, ANP), commercial maritime traffic continues to record solid growth, increasing by 8.6% to reach 121.1m tonnes in 2016. At the Tanger-Med port alone, commercial volumes rose 8.7% to hit 44.6m tonnes. Vehicle traffic also surged by 24.7% in 2016, with 508,815 units passing through the country's ports, of which three-fourths went to Tanger-Med. This increase is being driven by particularly dynamic international shipping volumes. Despite accounting for 73% of total commercial traffic, domestic shipping has stayed relatively flat of late - registering a 0.9% year-on-year (y-o-y) rise in January 2017. Some 34% of commercial maritime traffic - excluding trans-shipment - goes through the Port of Casablanca, followed by the Port of Jorf Lasfar with 27% and Tanger-Med accounting for 16%. The surge in international commercial shipping traffic is unsurprising given the extent of investment in Moroccan ports in recent years, which has greatly increased capacity and, in many cases, significantly improved efficiency. In operation since mid-2007, Tanger-Med port has been a game-changer in Moroccan maritime activity. Located 4 km east of Tangiers, it is one of the biggest and most modern ports in the Mediterranean and on the African continent. According to the Tanger-Med Port Authority, the complex consists of Tanger-Med 1, with two container terminals, a railway terminal, a hydrocarbons terminal, a goods terminal and a vehicle terminal; Tanger-Med 2, with two container terminals; Tanger-Med Passengers Port; the Tanger-Med Port Centre; and MEDHUB, a 50-ha logistics free trade zone. The Moroccan authorities are planning additional significant investments in port infrastructure. In late 2016 the ANP published its Dh6bn ((EURO)555.6m) development programme covering the 2017-21 period. More than half of this sum, Dh3.2bn ((EURO)296.3m), was frontloaded for investment in 2017. The programme includes projects at Wessal-Casa Port, where a naval construction yard is being built, and the Port of Mohammedia, where a liquefied petroleum gas plant is under construction. "We have seen big investments in Morocco's ports in recent years, and the ANP has signalled that more is on the way. One of the most significant is the construction of the Dh480m ((EURO)44m) polyvalent terminal in the port of Agadir," Antoine De Mirbeck, associate general manager at Ipsen Logistics, told OBG. He added, however, that much more needed to be done, and some key projects face significant delays. "There is a strategic development project under way to make the Fez-Mekn\'e8s region a national model for inward investment by 2022, but one of its flagship components - the relaunched dry port - has been put on hold." PASSENGER SEA TRAVEL: Improvements have extended to maritime passenger services. In December 2016 Italian firm Grandi Navi Veloci reopened its passenger line between Nador in Morocco and S\'e8te in France. The company had upgraded its ships to meet the needs of passengers, including prayer rooms and common areas dedicated to children and families. The company serviced Nador to S\'e8te, Tangiers to S\'e8te and Tangiers to Genoa, Italy during the summer of 2017. While traffic fell by 1.1% y-o-y to 284,173 passengers across all Moroccan ports in January 2017, initiatives such as those by Grandi Navi Veloci are looking to maintain or increase already strong maritime passenger figures. In the same month, for example, Nador Port bucked the trend by recording a 4.5% increase in passenger traffic to reach 19,959 travellers. Growth of 7.7% was recorded in maritime passenger travel for the whole of 2016 - totalling 4.9m passengers - including 337,971 cruise passengers. The vast majority travelled through the two ports in Tangiers: Tanger-Med (2.72m) and Port of Tanger Ville (1.46m). MULTI-MODAL: Work connecting the transport modes needed to move goods across the country is making progress, with multi-modal facilities transferring rail freight to port freight most developed at Tanger-Med. While such facilities are not yet equally developed at the Port of Casablanca, efforts are under way to improve capacity there, as well as access to the port itself. "The missing link in Morocco's infrastructure is in rail freight. When it comes on-line, the new TGV will be a boon for passengers travelling between the big cities, but development of rail freight infrastructure lags behind," Ouaziz told OBG. "Linking the country's ports to big cities and industrial zones could reduce both logistics costs and carbon emissions arising from the trade of manufactured goods." LOGISTICS: Concerted government action in implementing the National Strategy for the Development of Logistics Competitiveness, launched in 2010, has seen significant improvements in the logistics segment. This strategy is centred around five pillars: namely competitiveness; laws, policies and regulations; training and development; special economic zones; and optimising supply chains. The strategy was supported by the 2011 creation of the Moroccan Agency for Logistics Development (Agence Marocaine de D\'e9veloppement Logistique, AMDL). Nonetheless, progress seems to have slowed in recent years. The World Bank's logistics performance index recorded a significant improvement in Morocco's overall score from 2.38 out of 5 in 2007 to 3.03 in 2012, but it dropped back to 2.67 in 2016. Officials have set their sights on turning the segment into a global player. "If improvements continue to be made, the kingdom could become the next Dubai - a logistics hub for an entire continent." Omar El Kadiri, CEO at FedEx Express, told OBG. "The proposed Mohamed VI Tangiers Tech City, being developed with Chinese investors, could be a game-changer. With the right logistics in place, it could become a high-tech manufacturing hub for the entire continent," he added. Active global firms the international logistics segment include DHL, FedEx and UPS. The domestic logistics segment is mainly composed of local players competing with Poste Maroc. This fierce landscape means margins are narrower in the domestic segment than in international logistics. "The Moroccan logistics sector is still dominated by Spanish and, on a larger scale, European companies," Mohamed Didouch, CEO of logistics company SJL Maghreb, told OBG. "At the moment, 20,000 transport and logistics companies exist in Morocco - 95% of which are small and medium-sized enterprises or smaller." Important advances have been evidenced fairly recently with respect to Customs procedures. Years of effort and investment led to the 2015 launch of PortNet, Morocco's national single window for foreign trade, which allows for the dematerialisation of all Customs clearance procedures for trade through the country's ports. According to commentary at the Fifth International Single Window Conference held in Marrakech in September 2016, PortNet will be extended to include air and road trade as well. "The right steps are being taken to help establish Morocco as a logistics platform for the whole of Africa," Ouaziz told OBG. The sector is not without its challenges, however. Some prominent issues include the increasing cost of land, which is needed for warehouse and storage facilities, and the grey market of unlicensed providers operating in the domestic segment. GREEN CHARTER: With the hosting of COP22, Morocco launched a green logistics charter on November 11, 2016. It has now been signed by more than 50 transport and logistics firms, as well as a dozen sectoral professional associations and federations. The charter, developed in partnership with the Moroccan General Business Confederation, aims to mobilise key actors in the logistics and transport sector to promote environmentally friendly business practices. This will be achieved by establishing green regulations and policies, and promoting the use of renewable energies by investing in new wind farms and the continued enlargement of the Noor solar power plant (see Energy chapter). PARTNERSHIPS: Private sector involvement is also on the rise across the broader transport sector. In aviation, private players have long held concessions for retail and lounge management. For the first time, however, there are two PPPs under active consideration, with feasibility studies ongoing in relation to hotel services and the refurbishment of business service facilities at Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca. These studies are expected to come before the relevant Inter-Ministerial Committee for a decision, which would open up the possibility of launching a tender process should the projects get a green light, with a view to investment commencing in 2018. Private participation is similarly becoming more prevalent in urban transport. Future operation of the Casablanca tram network was designated to a private sector concessioner in June 2017, while a tender process was launched at the end of 2017 for the operation of the city's bus network from 2019 onward. Likewise, authorities at the ADM are likely to consider PPP agreements for the delivery of much of the ongoing motorway extension programmes. REGULATORY REGIME: Steps are also being taken to improve the regulatory environment "The fact that Morocco still doesn't have a dedicated legal framework regulating the logistics sector continues to have a negative impact on the sector," Ipsen Logistics' De Mirbeck told OBG. "Fortunately, the AMDL is working with experts at the World Bank to develop legislation that will have a more global reach, regulating all the key actors in the sector. This is crucially important." The ANP, in particular, has signalled that 2017 was an important year in terms of strengthening governance, redesigning operations and improving port fees, launching a study for the revision of the ANP's current tariff system and acting on other findings from the Port Competitiveness Observatory. "Moroccan Customs have enhanced their administrative procedures and sped up operations. Nonetheless, this remains a critical area for further improvement to position the country as a hub for business in the region," Ouaziz told OBG. With respect to the grey market, he added, "The authorities need to tackle informality in the logistics sector so that firms of all sizes can compete on a level playing field. This would also improve safety and reliability in the sector." OUTLOOK: While the delivery of flagship mega-projects attract many of the headlines, it is the continued investment in the kingdom's port facilities, road network and airports that is likely to prove most beneficial for long-term development, particularly as they improve connectivity for freight movement. The location of free trade zones close to deepwater ports is a prime example of joint-policy thinking, and there have been calls for the establishment of similar zones near airports that have sufficient freight capacity. Once projects already under construction or at the planning stage have been delivered, Morocco should be well on its way to making its mark as a regional and continental transport and logistics centre. Investment in hard infrastructure, however, will need to match the equally important efforts of improving efficiency in soft infrastructure, including the legal and regulatory frameworks and the country's Customs procedures. \</doc>

\~ Contributing 8.1% to GDP and accounting for 7.1% of total employment in 2016, tourism evidently holds an important place in Morocco's economy, even though the sector has faced some challenging times. This has largely been due to difficult external environments dampening travel from traditional source markets, though there is evidence that the sector's outlook is improving. It is hoped that the diversification of source markets, alongside targeted tourism promotion initiatives under the long-term national development plan Vision 2020, will ease existing pressures on the sector. PERFORMANCE: According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), travel and tourism contributed Dh81.3bn ((EURO)7.6bn) to GDP in 2016. Looking ahead, the WTTC forecast the sector's direct contribution to rise at an average rate of 4% per annum from 2017 to 2027, to reach a contribution of Dh123.6bn ((EURO)11.4bn), or 8.6% of GDP, in 2027. The sector directly generated 819,000 jobs in 2016, constituting 7.1% of total employment that year, however direct contribution to employment was expected to fall by 0.1% in 2017. Despite this minimal decline in the short term, the rate of growth is forecast to increase over the long term, with the WTTC predicting an average yearly rise of 2.6% over the 2017-27 period, reaching 1.1m jobs in 2027, or 7.8% of total employment. Looking further back to 2015, data collected by the High Commission for Planning indicates that tourism contributed Dh63.7bn ((EURO)5.9bn) to GDP, making up 6.5% of the total. This was an increase of 2.8% from 2014, when it contributed Dh61.9bn ((EURO)5.7bn). While the WTTC forecasts encouraging growth prospects overall, there are areas that require development, as illustrated by the country's profile in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report. In the latest edition, released in April 2017, Morocco ranked 65th out of 136 countries, compared to 62nd out of 141 countries in the previous edition, which was published in 2015. In Africa Morocco dropped from first to third position, falling behind South Africa and Mauritius. According to the World Economic Forum, Morocco's falling ranks were due to a dip in performance in the business environment, health and hygiene, human resources and ICT readiness categories. Additionally, the environmental sustainability, service infrastructure for tourists, cultural resources and business travel categories were below average. Overall, however, Morocco maintained its score of 3.81 out of 7 points in both 2015 and 2017. ARRIVALS: As with many countries in the MENA region, Morocco has suffered from a growing perception of insecurity in the region, as a result of the increased number of terrorist attacks carried out in recent years, even though Morocco itself has not suffered any terrorist incidents since 2011. While the government has strengthened security in the country, and at tourist sites in particular, other factors have affected tourism inflows, such as the economic crises experienced in several European countries, wherein lie many of Morocco's traditional tourism source markets. However, according to the latest available figures collected by the General Directorate of National Security, as divulged by the Moroccan Tourism Observatory (Observatoire du Tourisme, OT), there seems to be a turning of the tide, with tourism experiencing increasingly strong growth in 2017. In 2016 the country registered a total of 10.3m tourists, comprising 5.2m non-resident Moroccans and 5.1m foreigners. Total arrivals grew by 1.5% in 2016, with a significant increase in non-resident Moroccan arrivals (4%), which compensated for the negative growth of foreign arrivals (-0.9%). By contrast, the first quarter of 2017 saw a year-on-year (y-o-y) growth rate of 7.9% in the number of arrivals. During this period, which is usually a quieter time, travel-wise, Morocco had already welcomed 2.1m tourists, comprising 850,202 non-resident Moroccans and 1.2m foreigners, with foreign arrivals growing faster than non-resident Moroccan inflows, at 11.7% and 2.7%, respectively. By November 2017 the number of tourists reached 10.5m, up 10% compared to the same period in the previous year. The first signs of sector recovery surfaced in November 2016, coinciding with the COP22 UN Conference on Climate Change . Held in Marrakech, the COP22 conference boosted tourism inflows and contributed to the improvement of the country's international image. In fact, tourism receipts reportedly reached a record level of Dh59.4 ((EURO)5.9bn) by the end of November 2016, representing the top contributor to foreign exchange reserves in Morocco at the time. ACCOMMODATION: The substantial growth in overnight stays at classified accommodation establishments highlights the recovery that is taking place in the sector. According to the OT, the total number of overnight stays rose by 15% to reach 20.5m from January to November 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. Breaking this figure down, overnight stays made by residents grew by 8% y-o-y, whereas those by non-residents increased by 18% y-o-y. This is compared to growth of 11% in overnight stays made by residents and 1.4% by non-residents the previous year. In spite of challenges, the volume of classified accommodation establishments has steadily increased. According to figures from the OT, Morocco had 3509 classified accommodation establishments as of 2015, up almost 10% from 3198 in 2014. Hotel clubs, and three-, four- and five-star hotels represented 58% of classified accommodation establishments in 2016. Between January and November 2017 occupancy rates increased by four percentage points y-o-y to reach 45%. Bed capacity climbed to 242,624 in 2016, up 11,290 on the previous year; however, further work needs to be done in order to reach Vision 2020's goal of doubling capacity. "There is potential to exceed the government's target of an additional 200,000 beds, but more infrastructure is needed in beach zones to attract tourists, in addition to museums and other attractions that can supplement the pre-existing cuisine and nightlife offerings of Casablanca," Ricardo Rubio, director-general at Hotel Barcelo, told OBG. In terms of what type of accommodation is most popular, riads (traditional guest houses) appear to dominate the tourism market, accounting for 51% of classified accommodation establishments in 2015. Notwithstanding this, guest houses only represented 12% of total bed capacity in 2015, and accounted for 25% of bed capacity growth. This discrepancy, according to the OT, is due to the fact that the average guest house ratio of 15 beds per unit is relatively low. PROMOTING TRAVEL: Looking to boost sector growth in a challenging external environment, the government adopted an intense, short-term campaign in late 2016 to make the most of its role as host of COP22. This approach focused on opening up new flight routes, launching promotional initiatives and diversifying source markets. Early results of such efforts were markedly positive, at least over the short term. The key objectives outlined for tourism in the national strategy Vision 2020 are to double the size of the industry, establish Morocco as one of the top-20 tourist destinations in the world and set the foundations for sustainable sector development. To this end, the government's overarching plan comprises six programmes to target the development of specific segments: seaside; culture and heritage; green and sustainable development tourism; domestic tourism; entertainment, sports and leisure; and high added-value niches, such as business, welfare and health tourism. These segments offer a lot of potential, though domestic tourism is still relatively unexplored. "We are seeing more and more domestic tourism with a growing middle class travelling within the country," Kamil Sellami, director-general at Hotel Le Doge, told OBG. Though the number of travel within the country is rising, Souleymane Khol, vice-president of sales, marketing distribution and revenue management at AccorHotels, pointed out that there is a gap in the market. "Expensive hotel fees prevent a large percentage of the Moroccan middle class from enjoying the complete tourist experience," he told OBG. The tourism component of Vision 2020 has encountered difficulties since the start of its rollout in 2010, caused by both domestic obstacles and external factors. As a result, the targets initially outlined are still some way off, raising questions as to whether the strategy should be adjusted. While the former government commissioned a review of the plan to assess its implementation and identify areas of potential change, the results were never published, and a change of government has since taken place. Stakeholders are awaiting action from the new government, which was formed in April 2017, to push forward necessary reforms, as multiple initiatives are seemingly already on the table. REGULATORY REFORM: Prior to the change of leadership, the government had been pushing forward a series of reforms for better regulation of tourist accommodation, travel agencies, tour guides and companies operating transportation services for tourists. Notably, the authorities had created a new rating and classification system for classified accommodation establishments, building upon the legislation adopted in 2014, to enforce a stronger quality-control mechanism, partially achieved through the implementation of surprise inspections to ensure the quality of service provided at all times. However, according to Abdelaziz Samim, managing director of the National Hotel Industry Federation, government decrees and regulatory texts are still required for these changes to be fully operational. "The purpose of this initiative is to shift examination methods towards a more direct evaluation approach, in order to better monitor the quality of services dispensed to clients," Samim told OBG. The former government also moved to tighten regulations for travel agencies through Law No. 11-16, which was adopted in September 2016, with assurances that the new legislative framework would be beneficial to the industry. The reform enforced higher standards by establishing an updated ranking system for licence attribution, integrating online distribution and sales, facilitating the conditions of access to trade and management activities, and harmonising the activities carried out by travel agencies with the relevant legislation, such as consumer protection and e-commerce. While important in bringing the industry in line with global best practices, the introduction of the new legislation was controversial: it generated resistance from sector stakeholders, who criticised their lack of involvement in the drafting process and the government's disregard for shared recommendations. Lastly, according to local media reports, the government had been contemplating new operational guidelines - relating to vehicle maintenance, insurance and social service benefits - in addition to increased accountability requirements for those operating transport services or guided activities for tourists. Furthering the 2012 legislation on the creation of two specific tourist guide categories, the process of renewing operating licences requires enrolment in annual training courses run by the Ministry of Tourism, in order to keep the skills and knowledge of tour guides up to standard across the board. Two of these courses, "Guides of Cities and Tourist Circuits" and "Guides of Natural Spaces", were inaugurated in October 2016. DESTINATIONS: In the past key industry players have invested heavily in seaside tourism, but the city of Marrakech has recently emerged as the leading cultural and historical centre of Morocco, proving to be the main driving force of the industry. By the end of 2017, the city had attracted a record number of 2.5m tourists, a 20% increase on 2016. This figure is forecast to climb to 2.7m in 2018. However, other destinations are gaining popularity as well. "Aside from Marrakech, Fez is another historic and cultural heritage centre, and it has grown significantly in the last couple of years," Samim told OBG. "Tangiers-T\'e9touan has also displayed interesting growth in seaside tourism, as evidenced by its expanding hotel capacity." According to local media reports, the cities of Fez and Mekn\'e8s are to benefit from the implementation of a regional tourism strategy that was announced in February 2017. Spanning from 2017 to 2021, this strategy will utilise contract programmes, which are essentially government-backed, outsourced plans, in order to further develop the historic and cultural assets of these formerly imperial cities. For instance, Fez will enjoy the support of a Dh8bn ((EURO)741m) contract programme, aimed at boosting bed capacity by an extra 13,000 by 2020. With this, the city is expected to welcome 1.1m tourists, generating some Dh11.7bn ((EURO)1.1bn). SEASIDE: Agadir-Ida Ou Tanane, a coastal province in the south-west, recorded the highest number of overnight stays in classified accommodation establishments in 2017 after Marrakech, increasing by 12% on the previous year to reach 5.1m stays. The momentum in air arrivals was even more striking, as the number grew by 18% y-o-y to reach 395,141 between January and November 2017. Sector stakeholders argue that this growth spurt was generated by the opening of new air connections, combined with targeted promotion initiatives that take advantage of online platforms. According to local reports, the Moroccan National Tourism Office and the Agadir Regional Tourism Centre concluded a series of partnerships to support the opening of 13 new air connections to Agadir, amounting to an additional 100,000 seats on flights per annum. Another potential driver of growth came in April 2017, when Air Arabia Maroc, a Moroccan low-cost airline, announced it was opening its sixth operational base in the seaside town. Authorities are considering innovative developments to entice visitors year round to counteract the seasonal nature of seaside tourism. For example, work on a Dh1.4bn ((EURO)129.6m) convention centre in Agadir is under way, which will include conference and office spaces, a small mall, and a cinema. Seaside segment progress is not limited to Agadir either. Tangiers-T\'e9touan-Al Hoceima, another major seaside area, also displayed high growth rates in the first 11 months of 2017, both in terms of arrivals, up by 25%, and overnight stays, which rose by 26% (see Tangiers chapter). Even with these achievements, however, the development of seaside tourism fell short of the goals outlined in the government's segment strategy, Plan Azur. This sub-division of Vision 2020 was conceived with the goal of creating six seaside resorts: Saidia, in Berkane; Mazagan Beach Resort, in El Jadida; Mogador, in Essaouira; Port Lixus, in Larache; Taghazout Bay, in Agadir; and Plage Blanche, in Guelim. According to the Court of Auditors report on Plan Azur published in January 2017, relatively little progress has been made since the plan was first implemented some 15 years ago. For instance, as of early 2017 there were only 1570 new beds out of the total 58,540 expected by 2020, which translated to 2.8% of the intended number. This stunted progress has largely been due to financing difficulties, but strategies are now being set up to restart development. For example, in January 2016 the Moroccan Agency for Tourism Development announced the establishment of a Dh400m ((EURO)37m) guarantee fund, with 75% financed by the state and 25% by the Hassan II Fund. The fund aims to cover 60% of Plan Azur projects and 50% of non-seaside resort tourism initiatives. Additionally, following a re-evaluation of priorities, the government announced that its resources would be dedicated to four of the six identified seaside resorts, specifically Saidia, Taghazout, Port Lixus and Mogador. BUSINESS: Business tourism, specifically the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) segment, is displaying promising growth. With three major conference centres, 25 five-star hotels and the successful hosting of COP22 under its belt, Marrakech remains the city with the strongest service capacity. However, Casablanca and other major cities have arguably demonstrated higher demand for MICE segment services. In fact, according to local news, 80% of arrivals to Casablanca in 2016 were business-related. In response to such high demand, Casablanca has witnessed a sustained flow of construction projects, which has so far produced several five-star hotels. According to the OT, Casablanca had nine five-star hotels in 2015, posting the second-highest occupation rate for this tier accommodation at 68%, after Rabat at 71%, though ahead of Marrakech at 46%. Since then, more five-star hotels have opened up in Casablanca, including the Four Seasons in 2015 and the Grand Mogador in 2016. Long-term prospects also look strong, as more developments are on the way, with international companies Sana Hotels and Oberoi announcing plans to open establishments in Casablanca in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Marriott opened a hotel in Fez in 2017 and renovation to the Rivoli Hotel in Casablanca carried out by the Barcelo Hotel Group and Tikida Group is expected to finish up in 2018. For the city to fully benefit from this demand, however, even more needs to be done to improve Casablanca's offering. "The absence of a proper space for MICE events has meant that five-star hotels have stepped in to provide services for segment events, in addition to accommodation," Marie-Pierre Brancaleoni, marketing director at the Four Seasons Casablanca, told OBG. "Even so, total supply capacity in the city for the MICE segment stands at around 1000 rooms, which continues to fall short of existing demand, leaving margin for growth in the future." SUSTAINABLE TOURISM: The government is working to turn Morocco into a model of successful, sustainable tourism in the Mediterranean basin. The rise of ecotourism in the country is reflected in the growing prominence of the Green Key, an internationally recognised environmental label that is awarded to accommodation establishments that comply with a set of eco-friendly criteria. Established in Denmark in 1994, and then adopted and launched worldwide by the Foundation for Environmental Education in 2002, the Green Key was first introduced in Morocco in 2007. As of 2017, 84 companies received the Green Key label. This environmentally geared initiative has gained traction in recent times, with Marrakech doubling its recipient figures in 2016, standing at a total of 34 in 2017. To further ensure the advancement of sustainable tourism, the government has multiplied its efforts in support of initiatives at home and abroad. For instance, Morocco partnered with the UN World Tourism Organisation as an official sponsor of the 2017 International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. Through this, the government plans to promote the African Charter of Sustainable Tourism, signed in Morocco on the margins of COP22. Before this commitment, the government had also already promoted and endorsed the Casablanca Declaration, which was officially adopted at the fourth conference of the Western Mediterranean Forum, held in Morocco in July 2016. The declaration enshrines a series of commitments on tourism and climate change, which include limiting the impact of tourism activities on the environment, improving the energy efficiency of buildings, promoting the rational use of water resources and encouraging soft modes of transport, among others. At the national level, the second edition of the Moroccan Day for Sustainable Tourism, which took place on March 20, 2017, provided a platform for the government's announcement of a public-private partnership with key industry players. A central goal of the partnership is to raise awareness about the Moroccan Charter of Sustainable Tourism that was adopted on January 25, 2016, and revolves around environment protection, the sustainability of culture and heritage, the prioritisation of local development, and social responsibility. These targets will be partially achieved through education and training programmes. One of the key sustainability challenges lies in ensuring that major tourism projects, such as those envisioned in Plan Azur, comply with environmental standards. Under the Moroccan Day for Sustainable Tourism, trophies were awarded to notable eco-friendly establishments, in order to recognise and reward those progressing ecotourism. However, as of 2017 Morocco seemingly lacks a monitoring system to ensure that companies comply with the sector charter. MEDICAL TOURISM: In March 2017 Marrakech hosted the second edition of the Africa Medical Tourism Expo, an annual event that brought together sector stakeholders and strengthened the status of Morocco in the medical tourism market, with event organisers recognising the country as one of Africa's flagship medical destinations. However, the Medical Tourism Index of 2016, compiled by the International Healthcare Research Centre, did not recommend the country as highly. In the index, Morocco was ranked 31st out of the 41 countries evaluated, receiving an overall score of 59.77, which positioned it ahead of Tunisia (56.78) but behind South Africa (62.20), the only two other African countries included in the index. There is significant action taking place in the segment though, and Marrakech in particular has emerged as a medical tourism hub. Indeed, according to local reports, Marrakech Healthcare City, the first such project to be developed in the country, was set to open its doors in December 2016, but this had not been achieved as of January 2018. The $40m facility, promoted by UAE-based Tasweek Real Estate Development and Marketing, will aim to accommodate more than 5000 patients per year, covering specialties such as neurosurgery, orthopaedics, genetics, odontology, oral and maxillofacial surgery. It will include not only a 140-bed private hospital, but also a five-star hotel with 40 rooms and a 56-room apartment complex with swimming pools and private gardens. According to local media, Marrakech has been a popular medical tourism destination with French tourists in particular, as fees are as little as one-third of those in France. In order to attract foreign patients from other markets, Marrakech Healthcare City is considering expanding its services to facilitate an easier arrival for medical tourists. OUTLOOK: Although there are persisting challenges for the sector, the outlook for tourism in Morocco is generally positive, with 2017 garnering strong results. The country has a number of favourable factors to build upon, such as its political stability, and new infrastructure developments and air connections. While the sector is still far from achieving its 2020 target of 20m arrivals, the latest figures signal an uptick in activity, demonstrated by growing inflows, an increasing number of overnight stays in classified accommodation establishments and the construction of new infrastructure. Even with these successes, however, sector leaders have identified weaker areas to focus on, such as the relatively low average occupancy rates. Meanwhile, Morocco's niche tourism segments - notably, seaside, business and MICE - are seeing considerable progress, coming as a result of source market diversification and targeted travel promotion initiatives. Nonetheless, there is still much room for improvement, specifically in the untapped prospect of domestic tourism. Non-resident Moroccans were central in supporting the sector when traditional source markets faltered in recent years, yet this market remains relatively unexplored. As the new government has had time to settle in, pending legislative reforms are expected to move forward, a process which will greatly enhance a sector that has yet to realise its full potential. \</doc>

\~ Importing the vast majority of its energy, Morocco continues to rely heavily on fossil fuel-based imports. In recent years, the kingdom has made concerted efforts to reduce its energy dependence, implementing renewable energy projects, and introducing an oil and gas exploration programme. It has devised a new and ambitious energy strategy, which promotes the development of renewable energy and emphasises using natural gas for electricity generation. Since the 1990s several reforms have also been enacted to liberalise the sector and increase the involvement of the private sector. The government is keen to attract investment in a variety of areas, from energy infrastructure development to the provision of goods and services in related industries. ENERGY NEEDS: In recent years the energy market has grown considerably. According to the International Energy Agency, total primary supply reached 18.8m tonnes of oil equivalent in 2012, the latest year for which data was available. In relative terms, this translates into an increase of 58% between 2002 and 2012. According to the High Commission for Planning (Haut Commissariat au Plan, HCP), in 2015 primary energy consumption grew by 4.1%, reaching 19.48m tonnes of oil equivalent. Fossil fuels continue to dominate the energy mix: in 2015 petroleum products represented 54.2% of total primary energy consumption, followed by coal (27.4%), hydropower (2.5%), natural gas (5.8%), imported electricity (6.6%) and wind (3.4%). Around 94% of the kingdom's primary energy needs are imported, the bulk of which are fossil fuel-based. According to the Office des Changes, in 2016 energy imports consisted of gas oils and fuel oils (48%); petroleum gas and other (20%); hydrocarbons, petroleum oil and lubricants (10%); coal, cokes and similar solid fuels (10%); petroleum spirit (6%); electric energy (4%); and paraffin and other petroleum-derived products (2%). LONG-TERM STRATEGY: The government adopted an ambitious energy strategy in 2008 to address the situation. It comprises seven key pillars: the development of an optimal and diverse energy mix in the electricity sector, growth in the contribution of renewables, the establishment of energy efficiency as a national priority, exploration of national resources, better regional integration for electricity transport, a greater balance in energy trade and the establishment of a national pact for sustainable development. The strategy is bolstered by international commitments to battle climate change. Prior to attending the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris in 2015, Morocco submitted its intended national contributions, setting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets at 32% by 2030 below a business-as-usual scenario and achieving 42% of installed generation capacity from renewable sources by 2020. In 2016 Morocco hosted COP22 in Marrakech, confirming more ambitious targets: a 42% reduction in GHG emissions and 52% of power from renewables by 2030. HYDROCARBONS: Unlike other countries in the region, Morocco has very limited hydrocarbons resources. However, this has not stopped the kingdom from supporting exploration and production activities as part of efforts to reduce its reliance on energy imports. Since 2000 the country has introduced fiscal incentives in the Hydrocarbons Code to attract foreign investment, including a 10-year corporate tax exemption as of the date of first commercial production for each exploitation concession, no surtax, and an exemption from Customs duties and value-added tax on all equipment, materials, products and services required for reconnaissance, exploration and exploitation operations. According to the Office of Hydrocarbons and Mining (Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines, ONHYM), in the first eight months of 2017 the private sector invested some Dh467m ((EURO)43.2m) in the country's hydrocarbons industry, while ONHYM invested Dh18.8m ((EURO)1.74m). With its partners, the office spent nearly Dh16bn ((EURO)1.48bn) on hydrocarbons exploration in 2010-16, 98% of which came from private investors. Hydrocarbons production is concentrated in Essaouira and Gharb, which are located in the west and north-west of the country, respectively. HCP and ONHYM data shows that the kingdom produced 86m cu metres of natural gas and 4998 tonnes of condensate in 2015, down from 94m cu metres of natural gas and 5184 tonnes of condensate in 2014. According to ONHYM figures, 80.24m cu metres of natural gas and 4841 tonnes of condensate were produced in 2016. As of 2015 ONHYM's exploration of conventional hydrocarbons covered 338,848 sq km in partnership with 28 firms under reconnaissance contracts and petroleum agreements, and it held two exploitation concessions of its own. Non-conventional activities, especially oil shale, extended over 304 sq km, with four private partner companies in these ventures. EXPLORATION PERMITS: The authorities awarded a new offshore exploration permit to the UK-based Chariot Oil & Gas in February 2017. The permit allows the company to explore a 1400-sq-km area off the coast of Kenitra in Gharb. Chariot Oil & Gas holds a 75% share of the permit, with the remaining 25% held by ONHYM. The site is estimated to hold around 464m barrels. Only a few days before, another UK-based firm, Gulfsands Petroleum, announced it had signed an extension on its exploration permit at Moulay Bouchta in Taounat province, a site estimated to contain 149m barrels. Gulfsands Petroleum has a 75% interest in this permit and ONHYM holds 25%, but in February 2017 local media reported that the UK company was looking for additional partners in this endeavour. The London-listed firm SDX Energy has also seen its exploration permits extended for Lalla Mimouna Nord and Sud, and Sebou, located in Gharb. Lalla Mimouna Nord and Sud, covering 2211 sq km, will be extended until March 2018, whereas Sebou, a 135-sq-km concession, will run through to 2025. The Sebou concession renewal includes a commitment to drill two exploration wells within the first four-year period. NEW DISCOVERY: In May 2017 the UK-based Sound Energy announced the conclusion of its third exploration well, TE-8, located in the Tendrara permit, in which the company holds another two wells, TE-6 and TE-7. The exploration results confirmed the commercial potential of this area, doubling the previous estimates of potential hydrocarbons reserves. The well is set to produce approximately 249,000 cu metres per day, with James Parsons, CEO of Sound Energy, comparing the site to ENI's 849.5bn-cu-metre Zohr gas field in Egypt, the largest in the Mediterranean. Sound Energy has also commenced exploration activities at its onshore exploration permit in Sidi Mokhtar, in which it has held a 75% interest since December 2016. The company purchased the stake from PetroMaroc (50%) and Maghreb Petroleum Exploration (25%), and is set to re-evaluate the potential of the two existing wells at Sidi Mokhtar, Koba-1 and Kamar-1. If successful, the company planned to deliver gas to the domestic market by the end of 2017, but this had not been reported by early 2018. Upon its licensing, the firm should benefit from the gas storage and transport infrastructure located nearby, as well as its geographical proximity to Jorf Lasfar and various industrial installations. The company estimates that the Sidi Mokhtar permit holds 252bn cu metres of gas. If this is confirmed, Sound Energy's finds would likely provide a welcome push to the development of Morocco's gas potential. In the meantime, the kingdom's energy strategy and climate change commitments rely partly on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to compensate for the reduction of energy sources that generate more pollution. LNG DEVELOPMENT PLAN: The Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment (Minist\'e8re de l'Energie, des Mines, de l'Eau et de l'Environnement, MEMEE) launched a national development plan for LNG in cooperation with the National Office for Electricity and Potable Water (Office National de l'Electricit\'e9 et de l'Eau Potable, ONEE) in December 2014. The plan aims to boost the contribution of LNG to the energy mix from around 16% in 2014 to 32% by 2025. According to the MEMEE, the country's gas demand is set to reach 5bn cu metres by 2025. Of this, 3.5bn cu metres will be allocated for electricity generation through combined-cycle power plants, 1bn cu metres for refineries, and 500m-1bn cu metres for industries around Jorf Lasfar-Mohammedia-Kenitra and the phosphate industry. The LNG development plan has two stages. The first stage, called "gas to power", running from 2015 to 2025, seeks to meet additional demand for power. In partnership with national and foreign operators, ONEE is in charge of developing this stage. The second stage, "gas to industry", is set to bolster the use of natural gas. This stage is entrusted exclusively to national operators and consists of the creation of distribution facilities connecting the national grid. In June 2016 a draft gas code - the regulatory framework set to support the second stage of the LNG development plan - was ready to be evaluated by the government and submitted be considered by Parliament for approval. According to local media, the government also wrapped up calls for expressions of interest in stage-one gas and electrical infrastructure projects. However, as of early 2018 the code had yet to be approved by the authorities. GAS INFRASTRUCTURE: Morocco has several gas facilities: the 385-MW Tahaddart combined-cycle power plant, commissioned in 2005 with an annual production of 3100 GWh; the 470-MW Ain Beni Mathar thermo-solar combined-cycle plant, generating 3538 GWh per year; two gas turbines, each with 300-MW capacity, in Mohammedia and Kenitra; and the Maghreb Europe Gas (MEG) pipeline, which connects the Hassi R'Mel field in Algeria to C\'f3rdoba in Spain via Morocco. The annual capacity of the 1620-km-long MEG has been extended to 12bn cu metres of gas. Additional infrastructure investment under the LNG development plan totals $4.6bn, a part of which will be mobilised through private investors, as well as national and international institutional investors under power purchase agreements. RENEWABLES: The development of renewable energy is at the heart of Morocco's power strategy and its international commitments to battle climate change. The kingdom aims to generate 42% of all electricity from renewables by 2020 and 52% by 2030. To do this, it is seeking to exploit its significant potential in solar, wind and hydropower (see analysis). Morocco enjoys an estimated 3000 hours of sunlight per year, holding an average annual solar potential of 5 KWh per sq metre, according to the "National Energy Strategy 2030" report published by the MEMEE. This potential had been little exploited until the launch of the Moroccan Solar Energy Programme in November 2009, with the exception of the Global Rural Electrification Programme, which employed photovoltaic technology to supply energy to remote areas. Morocco also holds significant wind power potential. Thanks to its 3500-km-long coast, the country's technical onshore wind-energy potential is estimated at just under 5000 TWh per year, and there is potential to install 25,000 MW of capacity, according to the National Agency for the Development of Renewables and Energy Efficiency (Agence Nationale de D\'e9veloppement des Energies Renouvelables et de l'Efficacit\'e9 Energ\'e9tique, ADEREE). Wind speeds vary depending on the geographic area. Essaouira, Tangiers and T\'e9touan offer 9.5-11 metres per second at the height of 40 metres, whereas Tarfaya, Dakhla, Taza and La\'e2youne record speed of 7.5-9.5 metres per second. To take advantage of this potential, in June 2010 Morocco launched the Integrated Wind Energy Programme, which aims to supply the country with an additional 2000 MW by 2020, the equivalent of 6600 GWh of electricity per year, for an investment of Dh3.5bn ((EURO)324.1m). Hydropower is a more traditional component of the power mix. Investment in hydroelectricity capacity commenced in the 1960s under King Hassan II, and as a result, this segment is already well developed. INSTITUTIONAL REFORM: Various regulatory reforms aiming to facilitate the development of renewables have been introduced over the past few years. These include the establishment of key sector institutions and a sound governance structure. In September 2016 the Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy, created in 2010, saw its responsibilities expanded to include the development of all renewable energy initiatives, thus gaining its new title, the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN). Previously, ONEE had held some responsibilities for the development of renewable energy, although it is expected that during the five-year transition period, most will be moved to MASEN. ADEREE is another main body whose responsibilities changed as a result of institutional reforms; it is now the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (Agence Marocaine pour l'Efficacit\'e9 Energ\'e9tique, AMEE). The creation of the National Authority for Electricity Regulation is also expected in the short term, pursuant to the adoption of Law No. 48-15, strengthening the sector's regulatory framework for private investors. PROMOTING INNOVATION: Morocco's commitment to the expansion of renewable energy has led to increasing investment in research and development (R&D). Created in 2011 under the MEMEE, the Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies (Institut de Recherche du Solaire et des Nouvelles Energies, IRESEN) plays a key role in this field. IRESEN supports 540 researchers and has launched 10 calls for proposals since its creation, while 37 projects are in progress. "Our main challenge is supporting the practical application of innovative projects," Badr Ikken, director-general of IRESEN, told OBG. To this end, IRESEN is launching a call for proposals to fund collaborative applied research, renewable energy and energy-efficiency development projects targeting innovative goods, services and processes, as well as those seeking to support project holders in the practical application of research results. "Initially, we plan to allocate between (EURO)500,000 and (EURO)1m to innovation-related projects during the 2017-20 period," Ikken added. In addition to being responsible for R&D and innovation initiatives, IRESEN supports the development of related infrastructure. In January 2017 King Mohammed VI inaugurated the Green Energy Park, an international platform for solar energy testing, research and training developed by the institute. Located in Ben Guerir, the park cost Dh210m ((EURO)19.4m) and covers an area of 8 ha. According to Ikken, IRESEN is building a Green and Smart Building Park, with construction commencing in 2017 and expected to finish in 2018. A Water Energy Park and a Bioenergy Park are also scheduled to be built between 2018 and 2020. During its first five years of operation, IRESEN's budget totalled Dh500m ($46.3m), with half of the funds coming from the state and the other half in raised capital. In the following 10 years the institute is expected to receive Dh500m ($46.3m) in state funds and a similar amount from capital raised. ENERGY EFFICIENCY: Energy efficiency is a key goal of the government's energy strategy. In 2017 the 2030 National Strategy for Energy Efficiency and the sector-specific contract to support the implementation of the first stage of the strategy are due to be launched. Prior to finishing its draft strategy on energy efficiency, AMEE undertook an extensive study identifying a series of objectives, in particular reducing national energy consumption by 20% by 2030. The study also looked at certain key economic sectors, especially the industries that are the highest consumers of energy, such as construction, transport, industry, and agriculture and fishing. For the construction sector, a reduction of 20% in energy consumption is targeted, while transport is set to see a 35% decrease. Industry is expected to reduce its energy consumption at an annual rate of 2.5% leading up to 2030, while agriculture and fishing should do so at the rate of 0.2%. "The newly installed government has already signalled its commitment to the sector-specific contract that will support the launch and implementation of the energy efficiency strategy," Said Mouline, director-general of AMEE, told OBG. "In the meantime, a number of projects have been identified in each key sector, and progress has already been made with initiatives, such as the Moroccan Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MorSEFF) in the industrial sector, or awareness-raising activities and training concerning the future use of solar-powered pumping systems in agriculture." AMEE's efforts to promote the adoption of solar-powered pumping systems in agriculture is leading up to the launch of National Programme for the Promotion of Solar Pumping. With a (EURO)110m credit line provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in cooperation with European Investment Bank, the French Development Agency and the German Development Bank, MorSEFF enables local companies to access loans or leases to acquire equipment or pursue renewable energy or energy-efficiency projects, providing a 10% credit on investment subsidies, granting technical assistance and ensuring local distribution of financing via its local partners, BMCE Bank and Banque Centrale Populaire. Local cement producers, which were set to meet nearly 80% of their energy needs from renewable sources, have benefitted from this scheme. ELECTRICITY: Morocco enjoys one of the highest electrification rates in Africa, alongside Algeria, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, according to the World Economic Forum's "Global Energy Architecture Performance Index Report 2017". The report ranks the kingdom 57th of 127 countries, making it the top performer in the MENA region and second in Africa. Launched in 1996, the government's Rural Electrification Programme was hugely successful, boosting electrification rates in the countryside from 18% in 1995 to 99.43% by the end of 2016. MEMEE data shows that in 2016 electricity production increased by 2.9%, totalling 35,414.5 GWh, and in the first half of 2017 it continued growing, by 2.1%. Of the 2016 total, 14% was imported through regional linkages. The kingdom imports electricity from Algeria and Spain, and is connected to the latter via two 1400-MW underwater cables; studies are under way to create a cable to Portugal (1000 MW) and a third to Spain (700 MW). There are also plans to connect to sub-Saharan African countries via Mauritania and Senegal. The bulk of electricity is derived from non-renewable resources. In 2016 coal remained the largest source of power, accounting for 48% of the total, followed by natural gas with 17% and renewable energy with 14%. Taqa Morocco, a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA), operates Morocco's largest coal-fired power plant at Jorf Lasfar, with a capacity of 2056 MW, while ONEE manages three smaller coal-based power plants, including two in Mohammedia with a total capacity of 300 MW and one in Jerada, with 320 MW. Another coal-fired plant is anticipated to come on-line in July 2018 in the city of Safi in southwest Morocco. The 1386-MW facility is being built by a consortium of GDF Suez, Nareva Holding and Mitsui at a cost of Dh23bn ((EURO)2.1bn). While the contribution of fossil fuels remains significant, renewable energy's share of the power mix has grown in recent years, with new wind and solar projects coming on-line. Wind power generation increased by 19% in 2016, reaching 3000 GWh, while solar power jumped from 5.7 GWh to 401.5 GWh. However, hydroelectricity declined by 27.1% to 1662.2 GWh. Production increases have mirrored rising investment in the segment. An additional 10 GW of installed capacity is planned in order to reach the target of renewables comprising 52% of the energy mix by 2030. The private sector is set to play a key role in this thanks to the gradual opening of the electricity market (see analysis). WASTE MANAGEMENT: According to MEMEE data, waste generated in urban areas of the country is estimated to total 5.56m tonnes per annum, which is approximately equivalent to 0.76 kg per inhabitant per day. To better manage waste, the kingdom has adopted various measures, including a national solid waste programme launched in 2007. This government initiative aims to modernise waste management in Morocco, encouraging the development of both the collection and processing of waste, as well as recycling, composting and energy generation (see analysis). NUCLEAR: Under the national energy strategy, the development of nuclear power is considered a long-term alternative in the efforts to diversify the energy mix. The kingdom has identified a site for the construction of a nuclear power plant, following a technical and economic feasibility study conducted in the 1980s. Morocco is also party to a series of conventions and treaties on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and has been developing national legislation to this effect. It has benefitted from the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, including a 2015 mission to review the kingdom's integrated nuclear infrastructure. Morocco has also actively participated in the organisation's technical cooperation programme and its coordinated research project. GLOBAL PERFORMANCE: Morocco's efforts to stimulate its energy sector are reflected in its position in global energy rankings, including the aforementioned "Global Energy Architecture Performance Index Report 2017". In 2017 the kingdom was ahead of its MENA peers in the index, which covered 127 countries. The kingdom ranked 57th, up 14 positions compared to 2009. The ranking is based on three criteria: economic growth and development (43rd), energy access and security (54th), and environmental sustainability (86th). With virtually universal rural coverage, Morocco is well placed in terms of the electrification rate (1st) and methane emissions from the energy sector (10th). However, it lags behind on CO emissions from electricity production (106th) and energy imports (120th). OUTLOOK: The sector is likely to continue on a positive trajectory in the near and longer term. While the kingdom faces undeniable challenges, such as reducing its dependence on energy imports, particularly fossil fuels, and curbing its CO emissions, it has presented a solid sector strategy and multiple segment-specific initiatives, ranging from solar to wind and LNG. The nation's hydrocarbons resources are limited, but if recent discoveries are confirmed, Morocco could become a natural gas producer instead of a net importer. In the meantime, energy efficiency and renewable energy will remain at the heart of the country's energy strategy. The government has established a set of institutions and is in the process of creating a regulatory authority for the electricity segment. This will contribute to the further consolidation of the regulatory framework for the development of renewable energy. The approval of the energy strategy and sector-specific contract on energy efficiency is also likely to help move the policy forward. The promotion of R&D and innovation also stands to play a key role in the development of both renewable energy and energy efficiency, contributing to the strengthening of local expertise and development of applied research initiatives in connection with energy-related industries. However, a number of milestones on the path towards the greater development of renewable energy - including the liberalisation of the electricity market and the creation of appropriate incentives to facilitate the development of modern waste-management practices - are still to be reached. \</doc>

\~ After a challenging 2016, the Colombian oil industry entered 2017 with renewed optimism. In line with other crude-exporting countries, the fall in global oil prices starting in mid-2014 affected investment in the sector as well as government coffers. Country-specific problems during this time included a continued security threat from armed rebel groups in remote regions, and a lack of major new oil and gas discoveries. In 2017, however, the peace deal with FARC may open up exploration opportunities in former guerilla-held territories, and the prospect of a deal with the National Liberation Army (Ej\'e9rcito de Liberaci\'f3n Nacional, ELN) could bring respite to embattled projects in the north-east. Offshore exploration is set to accelerate in 2017 following major gas finds in the Caribbean and the prospect of further large-scale discoveries. Meanwhile, production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) provide some level of assurance about future prices. "Colombia's oil and gas sector is experiencing a transformation as it seeks ways to add value and differentiate from cost," Leandro Forero, director of the Andean region for oil field services company Baker Hughes, told OBG. "The critical projects that will see this are offshore, unconventional and recovery projects - part of Colombia's government-led strategies." Structure There are three important government entities operating in the energy industry. The Ministry of Mines and Energy (Ministerio de Minas y Energ\'eda, MinMinas) is responsible for setting policy for both the hydrocarbons and power generation industries in the country. A separate entity, the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (Unidad de Planeaci\'f3n Minero Energ\'e9tica, UPME) is in charge of planning long-term energy policy. A further key organisation in the oil and gas sector is the National Hydrocarbons Agency (Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos, ANH), established in 2003 to award and regulate exploration and production blocks, while promoting the wider liberalisation of oil. As part of a structural overhaul of the sector, private exploration and production (E&P) firms are allowed 100% ownership of concession contracts auctioned regularly by the ANH. The new conditions proved attractive, with dozens of foreign firms, principally from Canada, the US and the UK, buying up acreage in the country. Hydrocarbons came to represent an important source of funds to the Colombian government, growing from 10% of total income in 2002 to 23% in 2012. Production Following a decade of strong output, with production increasing from 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2007 to 1m bpd in 2013, 2016 saw a sizeable decline. Over the course of the year average production fell from 986,000 bpd in January to 807,000 bpd in December. In annual terms, average production fell 12% from 1.01m bpd in 2015 to 885,000 bpd. It is unlikely that the situation will significantly improve in the coming years, and the Colombian government has established an 865, 000-bpd production goal for 2017. A significant contributor to this slide was an uptick in ELN attacks on the Ca\'f1o Lim\'f3n-Cove\'f1as pipeline. The 780-km pipeline, which transports 25,000 bpd of oil from the Equion fields to the port at Cove\'f1as on Colombia's Caribbean coastline, has been a regular target for over 30 years. Nicknamed "the flute" due to the number of holes in the pipeline, in 2016 it was out of operation for a total of 45 days. The damage to infrastructure continued in 2017, with a total of 28 attacks in the first three months of the year stopping the pumps for 37 days and costing a total of 893,000 barrels of production. The 2000-member rebel unit has a sturdy presence in the north-east of the country near the Venezuelan border where the pipeline passes. With FARC in the process of demobilising, the ELN's increased sabotage operations seem to be an attempt to strengthen its negotiating position at formal peace talks that began in Quito in February 2017. "If we are in peace talks in Quito, the first thing that [the ELN] would have to do is to suspend the terrorist attacks on Colombian infrastructure," Mauricio C\'e1rdenas, minister of finance and public credit, told local press. "There is a negotiation table for them to voice their views and ideas, but do not attempt to do it through attacks against the energy infrastructure of all Colombians." Although the government's peace talks with FARC have lasted four years, there are hopes that the framework from this agreement can be applied to ELN negotiations. Such a result would be a major boon for the country's most targeted hydrocarbons infrastructure. Declining Reserves The steady decline in reserves poses a much more pressing challenge, however. The rapid increase in production over the last decade was achieved principally by the arrival of E&P firms to the country's long-established basins in the los llanos (plains) and the Magdalena Valley. The firms brought marginal fields online, introduced enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques to old wells, and found small and medium-sized satellite deposits that were commercially viable given the increasing global oil prices at the time. However, from 2009 to the present, no major onshore oil discoveries have been made. Colombia's growing reserves were due mainly to the application of EOR technology, which made previously unviable ground oil profitable to produce under high global oil prices. Much of this production will be halted with oil in the range of $50-60 per barrel. Indeed, having reached an oil reserve peak of 2.31trn barrels in 2014, by mid-2016, with the oil price under $40 per barrel, Colombia's oil reserves had fallen to 1.7trn barrels, not enough to last five years. Opportunities for E&P firms remain in the established basins, but increasingly require innovative technology or new approaches to geological plays. A relative late entrant to the Colombian market, Chilean firm GeoPark acquired two small independent E&P companies with properties in the eastern Llanos in 2012. The firm then pioneered a new play type focusing on structural and stratigraphic traps at the Llanos-34 block, eventually boosting production to 43,000 bpd from nine new fields. GeoPark plans to drill between 15 and 20 development wells at the property over the course of 2017. Drilling At the national level, however, development drilling was limited in 2016. The Colombian Petroleum Association (Asociaci\'f3n Colombiana del Petr\'f3leo, ACP) estimates that the country will need to drill between 900 and 1000 development wells to maintain current production levels. In 2016 the ANH targeted 450 wells, but only 150 had been drilled over the course of the year. The drilling statistics for exploration activity are similarly modest. From 2010 to 2014 Colombian E&P firms regularly drilled over 100 exploratory wells a year, but in 2015 and 2016 these numbers fell to 25 and 16, respectively, with success rates ranging from 15% to 20%. According to the Colombian Chamber of Oilfield Services - locally known as Campetrol - only 305 of the country's rig fleet was under contract in 2016. Investment Drilling is one of the major expenses incurred by E&P firms, so it is unsurprising that total foreign direct investment (FDI) in the sector has dipped in recent years. From a high of $5.47bn in 2012, FDI fell to an estimated $3.06bn in 2015 and $1.53bn in 2016, of which only $620m was earmarked for exploration activities. As a proportion of total FDI in the Colombian economy, investments in the oil and gas sector have drastically fallen from nearly 50% in 2010 to under 15% in 2016. The ACP forecasts that the country will receive a major boost in hydrocarbons FDI in 2017, measuring between $4.7bn and $5bn; however, it also estimates that the sector needs annual investments of $7bn over the next decade to ease the continuing decline. Without it, national production could fall to 400,000 bpd by 2022, at which point the country would no longer be self-sufficient and national refineries would have to begin importing crude. "The level of investment in the oil and gas sector this year is expected to double compared to last year, but it will not be enough to maintain reserve levels and production," Forero told OBG. "Even if investment doubles, it is still far from the pace that the sector was experiencing five years ago." Ecopetrol Despite this challenging backdrop, there have been some positive indications that the Colombian oil industry may be bouncing back. The first was the successful restructuring of Ecopetrol. Under previous president Javier Guti\'e9rrez, the national oil company underwent a rapid expansion, reaching 750,000 bpd of production in 2015 with a target of hitting 1.3m bpd by 2020. At the height of the Colombian oil boom in mid-2012, Ecopetrol's market capitalisation reached $129bn - surpassing that of Brazilian national oil firm Petrobras, widely regarded as a rolemodel for the Colombian firm. However, as oil prices plummeted, the firm's market cap fell 90% to $13.5bn in December 2015. A shifting macroeconomic outlook led to a change at the top, with the former minister of finance and public credit, Juan Carlos Echeverry, replacing Guti\'e9rrez in May 2015 and initiating a set of reforms. Capital expenditure, or capex, for 2016 was cut by 40% to $4.8bn, the 2020 production target was redrawn to 870,000 bpd and for the first-time dividends were not paid to shareholders in 2015. The company's average production in 2016 fell by 43,000 bpd to 718,000 bpd, a figure 3000 barrels more than the previously estimated rate. Despite this decline, the firm registered an earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization of COP18bn ($5.4m) for 2016 and paid a dividend of COP23 ($0.20) per share, corresponding to 40% of net profits for the year. In 2016 the government received COP837bn ($251.1m). In the past Ecopetrol paid dividends equivalent to 70% of profits and the state - which holds 90% of equity - was the biggest benefactor. For 2017 Ecopetrol pledged to invest a total of $3.5bn, with $650m dedicated to exploration activities. These funds provided an almost immediate return; Ecopetrol announcing in March 2017 that its exploration programme in partnership with independent E&P firm Parex Resources brought a discovery of medium API gravity crude at the Boranda-1 oil well in the department of Santander. New Basins A second reason for optimism in 2017 is the prospect that a peace deal with FARC will open up new areas of the country to exploration and increase the chances of a major onshore discovery. The southern states of Caquet\'e1 and Putumayo - lying north of major oilfields in Ecuador - are believed to have particular potential. UK-based E&P firm Amerisur Resources has been one of the most active firms in Putumayo over the last decade, exploring the Platanillo field and constructing a pipeline to connect with the Victor Hugo Ruales pipeline in Ecuador, which takes crude to Pacific export ports. In March 2017 the firm was exporting 4113 bpd via the pipeline, and in the same month it announced it would acquire stakes in three further blocks in the Putumayo hydrocarbons basin at a cost of $4.5bn. "The working interests we have acquired are strategically located close to our OBA transfer system, thus potentially securing rapid and basin-leading margin monetisation of new reserves in these blocks, and exposing the company to the full suite of exploration opportunity in the basin," John Wardle, Amerisur Resources CEO, told media. Communities Despite the formal signing of the peace treaty, the development of new hydrocarbons basis may take longer than expected. Communities in the region have had little exposure to oil projects and may be more resistant to exploration than in other areas such as the llanos, where the industry has a longer legacy. In February 2017, following complaints from indigenous groups, Colombia's Constitutional Court ordered the suspension of activities at a project operated by independent firm Vetra Energy in Putumayo. The 27-well project produced 14,000 bpd and was the largest contributor of royalties to the department. The court ordered that operations could not resume until the firm had conducted a full consulta previa (prior consultation) with the Aw\'e1 indigenous group that inhabit the region. The case highlights one of the challenges facing E&P companies in Colombia: a lack of clarity over the consulta previa process. Under Colombian law, firms are required to consult with communities when projects affect the territory, culture or economy of ethnic groups, and most oil companies accept their obligation to earn the social licence to operate. However, the limits of the process can be somewhat arbitrary. The case brought forward by the Aw\'e1, for example, was first rejected by the Superior Tribunal of Mocoa - the state capital - and then by the Supreme Court of Justice on the grounds that the project did not encroach into the tribe's territory. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court ruled that potential contamination from the project could affect the ecosystem and the plants and animals the Aw\'e1 rely on for their way of life. This broadening of the scope of the consulta previa is creating delays and extra costs for oil firms as the compensation requests from groups increase. "The fact that operators do not know how much a consultation process costs makes it more difficult for companies to optimise their resources and manage their assets," Gabino Lalinde, president of Spanish E&P firm Repsol Colombia, told OBG. "There should be a standardised model that states how much time the process will take, and the rules should be clearly stated," he added. Offshore Given the challenges of operating onshore, the ANH has increasingly focused on the exploration of Colombia's Caribbean waters since 2014. "Currently, in Colombia one can find exploratory blocks of good quality," Lalinde told OBG. "However, given the time required to carry out the exploratory activities and the development of possible discoveries, the reality is that production phases won't take place for 10 to 15 years. The sector is betting heavily on Colombia's offshore and hopes that these efforts will be rewarded in the future with several production projects." With the exception of a single dry deepwater well drilled in 2007 by a consortium led by Petrobras, the Colombian offshore sector saw little exploration until an ANH bidding round in 2014 gave renewed emphasis to the segment, awarding a further five offshore blocks and introducing more favourable fiscal schemes. Royalties for offshore projects were cut by 40%, and the windfall tax on profits was reduced. In September 2016 MinMinas announced that offshore projects would be considered free trade zones, allowing operators to bring in the supplies and services necessary for the development of project without passing Customs. "MinMinas and the ANH are trying to boost offshore activity in the country. The offshore free trade zone is a proof that gives positive signals to the sector and the international community," Lalinde told OBG. So far, results have been promising. In December 2014 a group led by Petrobras discovered gas at the Orca-1 well, drilled 40 km off the Guajira Peninsula at a depth of over 674 metres. In July 2015 deepwater exploration specialists Anadarko Petroleum completed its Kronos-1 well in the Fuerte Sur Block-53 at water depths of over 1500 metres, also hitting natural gas deposits. In February 2017 the US firm drilled the Gorgon-1 well in its Purple Angel block, 4.7 km from Kronos-1, in depths of 1835 metres of water. The well revealed a gas column that represents the largest gas discovery in Colombian history, greater in size than the Chuchupa gas fields, which have been in production for 40 years. The three discoveries confirm geologists' predictions that the deep Caribbean shelf could represent the best chance of recovering the country's declining hydrocarbons reserves. The ANH estimates the potential reserves of the Caribbean waters at 9bn barrels, in addition to 3bn barrels in the unexplored Pacific Basin. Ecopetrol has a stake in each offshore block - although it operates only one - and plans to funnel $295m of its total $625m exploration budget for 2017 into offshore activities, drilling five wells over the course of the year. However, deepwater offshore exploration is very expensive and the fields, especially gas-prone deposits, take many years to develop. No projects are expected to begin commercial production before 2022. As such, the acquisition of foreign technology and expertise will be key to the successful development of the deposits. "Offshore exploration continues to be an important element in the energy strategy, although still at an early exploration stage," Forero told OBG. "We should learn from the experience of Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico given their vast knowledge and the technology they utilise. The technological component is very important in these types of production areas, and we will begin to see more nanotechnology entering the market." Power Generation As the Colombian oil industry moves towards new sources of hydrocarbons, the country's power generation segment is also undergoing a period of transition. In late 2015 and early 2016 a particularly strong El Ni\'f1o led to droughts across the country. Production from major hydroelectric dams plummeted, and a number of thermal plants meant to provide backup in such circumstances declared they could not profitably produce power. The government was forced to consider the introduction of electricity rationing in the most affected areas, but in the end such measures were not required. The close call brought up memories of the 1992 energy crisis, when shortages led to rationing and the decision to temporarily change the country's time zone to make better use of daylight hours cost the country an estimated 2.5% of GDP. Hydroelectric Not only did the 2015-16 El Ni\'f1o drought last longer than ever before, leading reservoirs to fall to their lowest levels in decades, but gas prices spiked, thermal generators experienced financial challenges relating to contractual issues, and the 560-MW Guatap\'e9 hydroelectric plant was damaged and out of operation until May 2016. Together, the Guatap\'e9 plant, the Playas Dam and the San Carlos Dam account for 8% of Colombian consumption. Under normal climactic conditions, Colombia's sizeable hydroelectric capacity is sufficient to meet the majority of the country's energy demand. As of December 2016 Colombia had installed capacity of 16,597 MW, of which 11,606 MW - around 70% - was provided by hydroelectricity. In December 2016 the country generated 5547 GWh of electricity from hydroelectric plants, supplying 85% or 4709 GWh; while thermal energy contributed 13%, or 731 GWh. UPME forecasts that by 2020 peak demand will reach 11,952 MW, well below current installed capacity. When the country's reservoirs are full and the hydroelectric plants are operating at near capacity, Colombia exports energy to neighbouring countries. In March 2015 Colombia sent 128,000 MWh of power to Ecuador and 134 MWh to Venezuela. However, in March 2016, in the midst of El Ni\'f1o, the current to Ecuador was reversed and Colombia imported 142,000 MWh. The energy crisis highlighted the threat posed to the system by droughts. The government's response has been to improve energy security through the construction of a liquefied natural gas import terminal and by diversifying the energy matrix to include more renewable energy (see analysis). Oversight With power generation back to normal in early 2017, the country's Superintendent of Public Services (Superintendencia de Servicios P\'fablicos, Superservicios) was busy dealing with the fallout from the previous year. With each energy bill, Colombian citizens pay a reliability charge - a fee that goes to the country's thermal power generators to keep them up and running and ready to enter into production at times of high demand. However, during the crisis the Termocandelaria power plant in Cartagena was offline for 27 days during a critical period, despite having received $29m in reliability charge funds in 2014 and 2015. In March 2017 Superservicios handed the firm a record $12m fine. In November 2016 Superservicios took over Electrocaribe, a power company 85% owned by Spain's Gas Natural Fenosa, with 2.5m customers in the Caribbean coast, after a series of blackouts and a rising debt amounting to $800m. In March 2017 it was confirmed that the company would be liquidated to pay off creditors, opening up the possibility of legal action from Gas Natural Fenosa. Outlook The Colombian energy sector can look forward to increased investment in 2017 and 2018. With a crisis in the electricity sector narrowly avoided, the government is reassessing its strategy to improve energy security. In the hydrocarbons segment, 2017 will see major investments in offshore exploration, which represents the best possibility for the country to maintain energy self-sufficiency, especially with an additional 1500 km of barely explored Pacific coastline. A restructured Ecopetrol operating on a more cost-conscious basis will also provide revenues for the Colombian state as it looks to implement its post-conflict energy policies. \</doc>

\~ In common with other major energy companies, lower hydrocarbons prices have prompted authorities to carry out streamlining and efficiencies in Abu Dhabi's energy sector. Against a backdrop of reorganisation and reform, production from the emirate's oil and gas fields reached record levels in 2016. Currently, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) produces some 3m barrels of oil and 9.8bn standard cu feet per day (scfd) of raw gas. Looking ahead, ADNOC's strategy is to improve profitability and sustainability upstream while increasing value downstream. It also plans to triple the emirate's output of petrochemicals by 2025. In the broader energy sphere, Abu Dhabi remains committed to making long-term investments in innovation and development of renewable energy and carbon capture technologies. Oil & Gas Wealth Oil and gas have played a dominant role in the economy of Abu Dhabi for almost 60 years, with the initial discovery made in 1958, the first well completed in 1960 and the first exports of crude in July 1962. The UAE was formed nine years later on December 2, 1971, with Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Umm Al Quwain, Fujairah and Ajman creating a union that was joined by Ras Al Khaimah the following year. ADNOC was established in 1971. Of the 97.8bn barrels of proved oil reserves in the UAE, 95% are located in Abu Dhabi, with Dubai's 4bn barrels constituting the second most significant reserves base in the country. According to the "BP Statistical Review of World Energy June 2016", the UAE's reserves of crude oil constitute 5.8% of the world's total, while its reserves of natural gas, at 6.1trn cu metres, represents around 3.3% of the world's proven reserves. The UAE has the seventh-highest reserves of natural gas and the eighth-largest proven reserves of crude oil in the world. ADNOC manages 95% of the UAE's proven oil reserves and 92% of the country's gas reserves. Supreme Petroleum Council In 1988 the Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) was created to oversee petroleum policy and activities in Abu Dhabi. The SPC functions as ADNOC's Board of Directors and is chaired by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi. The deputy chairman is Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, crown prince of Abu Dhabi and deputy supreme commander of the UAE armed forces. ADNOC's CEO is also a member of the SPC alongside other prominent figures, including Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei, the UAE's minister of energy. Al Mazrouei, a graduate in petroleum engineering, was employed by ADNOC for 10 years and spent two years on secondment to Royal Dutch Shell, where he worked on projects in Nigeria, the North Sea, Brunei and the Netherlands. Reform & Reorganise In 2016 UAE officials took steps to advance the country's economic diversification strategy through the development of a roadmap for growth beyond oil. Called the UAE Post-Oil Strategy, its central aims - to advance human capital, knowledge and innovation - are consistent with the goals of the UAE Vision 2021 and the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. The advancement of the UAE's diversification plans took on added significance in 2016 in light of the sustained slowdown in global oil prices, which saw the price of Brent Crude reach a low of $28 in January of that year. In February large-scale reforms rolled out at ADNOC following the announcement by Abu Dhabi's Executive Council of the appointment of a new CEO of the company - Sultan Al Jaber, UAE minister of state and chairman of Masdar, Abu Dhabi's renewable energy and clean technology firm. The ADNOC reforms, which were geared towards improving performance, increasing profitability and optimising efficiency, involved the reorganisation of its operations, which at the time included 20 group companies, three academic and training institutes and four research and innovation centres. New chiefs were appointed to six out of the 18 operating companies and investments were made in the company's workforce. According to ADNOC's "Sustainability Report 2015", as of that year it had 65,000 employees and 165,000 contractors. In 2014, when the company reported that it employed 60,000 people and 97,500 contractors, its annual bill for wages and benefits came to Dh17bn ($4.6bn). Restructuring Among the separate companies under the ADNOC umbrella, there are three businesses running production on its major onshore and offshore fields. The Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Petroleum Operations (ADCO) operates 11 onshore fields and two export terminals at Jebel Al Dhanna and Fujairah. Its oil production capacity is some 1.6m barrels per day (bpd), and the company plans to increase this to 1.8m bpd by 2018, according to ADNOC's "Sustainability Report 2015". International oil companies (IOCs) had concessions collectively worth 40% of ADCO until they expired at the end of 2013 and were subsequently put up for renewal. Total was the first to rejoin the company, when it signed an agreement for a 10% stake in ADCO and its concessions in January 2015, and the company was appointed asset leader of the Bu Hasa and South East fields. Total was followed by Japan's Inpex and GS Energy in April and May of the same year, respectively, with the companies acquiring respective shares of 5% and 3%. Over a year later BP was also granted a 10% share in the company following a period of prolonged negotiations, which resulted in the firm becoming manager of the Bab field. Finally, in February 2017 the remaining 12% of the 40% of foreign shareholding options available to investors was awarded to two companies from China, namely, China National Petroleum Corporation (8%) and CEFC China Energy (4%). Historically, Abu Dhabi's offshore fields were operated by two companies that are currently in the process of merging - Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Company (ADMA-OPCO) and Zakum Development Company (ZADCO). The companies operate as joint ventures (JVs) with IOCs. ADMA-OPCO operates two offshore fields with a total production capacity totalling 650,000 bpd in 2015: Umm Shaif, which encompasses 500 sq km, and Lower Zakum, which at 1270 sq km is the second-largest offshore field in the Gulf and the fourth largest in the world. Apart from these fields, ADMA-OPCO started producing from the newly developed Umm Lulu and Nasr fields from 2014 and 2015, respectively. ADMA-OPCO is also developing Satah Al Razboot (SARB) Field on behalf of ADNOC, which is expected to produce first oil in early 2018. With development of these fields, ADMA-OPCO has embarked on a major growth agenda which targets oil production of 1m bpd by 2020. ADMA-OPCO also processes about 3bn scf/d which is used for injection into its reservoirs and export to ADGAS and GASCO. ADMA-OPCO operates around 200 wellhead towers, 700 wells, 1200-km pipelines, four manned complexes offshore and Das Island processing and export facilities, encompassing oil and gas operations which will be further expanded in line with production growth. ZADCO, the other offshore company, operates three fields with a total production of 635,714 bpd in 2015: the 1269-sq-km Upper Zakum (UZ), the 150-sq-km Umm Al Dalkh and the 35-sq-km Satah field. The UZ field is expanding, with the construction of four man-made islands. Production Aims These islands will allow long horizontal wells to be drilled, with the aim of boosting the field's production to 750,000 bpd by 2018. In October 2016 ADNOC announced its intention to integrate the operations of ADMA-OPCO and ZADCO into one offshore company - ADMA - by 2018, with Yasser AlMazrouei, the current CEO of ADMA-OPCO, appointed CEO of the new company. ADNOC has a 60% share in ADMA-OPCO, with the remaining shares held by BP, Total and the Japan Oil Development Company (JODCO). JODCO and ExxonMobil share 40% of ZADCO, with ADNOC holding the remaining 60%. Concessions are up for renewal for the joint entity in 2018, with the exception of the Upper Zakum concession agreement, which will expire on December 31, 2041. Marketing & Distribution Consolidation Undefined Shortly after unveiling the consolidation of its offshore exploration activities, ADNOC announced the consolidation of three of the companies in its marketing and distribution division: the Abu Dhabi National Tanker Company (ADNATCO), Petroleum Services Company (ESNAAD) and Abu Dhabi Petroleum Ports Operating Company (IRSHAD). Commenting on the move, Sultan Al Jaber said: "By leveraging the experience and assets across the three companies we aim to deliver an improved and cost-effective service to meet the needs of the ADNOC Group. The consolidation will capture synergies, generate savings and ensure value creation." A steering committee was appointed by ADNOC to oversee the consolidation, which was due to be completed by the end of 2017. The consolidated marine and services company, which had not yet been named as of April 2017, will be one of the biggest shipping companies in the region, with a fleet of over 165 ships. The fleet will include liquefied natural gas (LNG) vessels, bulk carriers, chemical and products tankers, container and container-feeder vessels, and support ships. ADNOC also announced that the National Gas and Shipping Company (NGSCO), in which it owns a 70% stake, would remain separate, although its share would be transferred to the new merged company. NGSCO and ADNATCO merged in 2009 and share support services. ADNATCO was formed in 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of ADNOC to transport the UAE's petroleum products to energy markets around the world, while NGSCO was formed in 1993 to ship LNG for the Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (ADGAS), and in 2015 it had eight LNG vessels serving the ADGAS liquefaction plant at Das Island. NGSCO's international shareholders are Mitsui & Co of Japan (15%), BP (10%) and Total (5%). Adnoc 2030 Strategy Targets In November 2016 the SPC agreed to ADNOC's five-year business plan and budget, as part of the company's 2030 Strategy, which is designed to further strengthen ADNOC's role as a key contributor to the diversification of the UAE's economy by generating sustained growth in its upstream, midstream and downstream operations. The 2030 strategy will see ADNOC evolve into a more commercially minded and performance-driven company. To achieve this ADNOC will focus on optimising both performance and profitability, while strengthening human resources and efficiency. It has committed to raising oil production by a total of 400,000 bpd over time, and has set a production target of 3.5m bpd by 2018. At the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC), ADNOC announced it was working on new projects to increase its refining capability and expand its petrochemicals business. The company said gasoline production would increase to 10.2m tonnes per year by 2022 while petrochemical production would grow from 4.5m tonnes per year in 2016 to 11.4m tonnes by 2025. Investment Funds Merged While ADNOC focuses on consolidating the management of Abu Dhabi's domestic oil and gas sector, consolidation is also taking place in the two entities managing many of the emirate's key investments in energy and other sectors in Abu Dhabi and overseas. On June 29, 2016 Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed announced the merger of the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) and Mubadala Development Company. The move will create one of the world's largest state-owned investment funds, controlling combined assets totalling Dh460bn ($125.2bn) and maintaining partnerships with companies in some 30 countries. IPIC, which was established in 1984 to invest in energy and related sectors around the world, has interests in a total of 18 companies. Mubadala, which is named after the Arabic word for exchange, was created in the year 2002 with a mission to generate profits for Abu Dhabi but also to help in the diversification of the emirate's economy. It has a diverse portfolio of investments, with the largest revenues in 2015 generated by its semiconductor business at 54%, aerospace and engineering at 17%, and oil and gas at 13.2%, according to the company's most recent annual review. The new company is called Mubadala Investment Company. Collaborate & Integrate There are considerable potential synergies between the hydrocarbons interests in Mubadla's portfolio and those owned by IPIC. In an interview with local media in November 2016 Suhail Mohamed Faraj Al Mazrouei, minister of energy and then-managing director of IPIC, suggested that post-merger investment decisions could be devolved to the operator companies rather than being taken by the joint holding company. According to local press reports, the merged companies will have combined oil and gas production outside of Abu Dhabi of more than 850,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with refining capacity totalling approximately 1.5m bpd. In early 2017 the newly formed Mubadala Investment Company completed internal restructuring to create four main investment platforms. The first, the Petroleum and Petrochemicals division, which incorporates IPIC's assets, is now the company's largest business, accounting for 31.1% of total assets. This division is further separated into three distinct business units: exploration and production, midstream and refining, and petrochemicals. The Alternative Investments and Infrastructure division, with an overall total of 31% of assets, is the second-largest area of operation and encompasses the company's investments in a number of emerging sectors. This is followed by the Technology, Manufacturing and Mining division (21.6%), and Aerospace, ICT and Renewables (10.6%). The remaining 5.7% is listed as other corporate assets. Oil Revenues Although there is a delay in the publishing of detailed figures on oil revenues in Abu Dhabi, the latest data released from Statistics Centre - Abu Dhabi (SCAD) in its "Statistical Yearbook of Abu Dhabi 2016" did include figures from 2014. In that year Abu Dhabi's GDP at current prices stood at a total of Dh960.1bn ($261.4bn), with oil accounting for Dh489bn ($133.1bn) of this total. The slowdown in the price of oil in the second half of 2014 and its subsequent impact on revenues meant that this figure was 4.3% down on 2013, when oil GDP stood at Dh511.1bn ($139.2bn). Oil's share of overall GDP fell from 57% in 2012 to 54.85% in 2013 and 50.9% in 2014. SCAD does publish trade data from 2015, although the figures for oil, gas and oil products exported in that year do not include exports of LNG. The figures from 2012 to 2015 show that the value of oil, gas and oil product exports increased from approximately Dh451.5bn ($122.9bn) in 2012 to Dh490.5bn ($133.5bn) in 2013, but then declined to Dh328.5bn ($89.4bn) and Dh185.3bn ($50.5bn) in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Those exports as a percentage of total trade in goods expanded from 75.2% to 78.7% in 2012 and 2013 before falling to 68.3% in 2014 and 52.3% in 2015. Trading Partners According to SCAD, Abu Dhabi exported 661m barrels of crude oil in 2015, with Japan receiving 34.1% of the total, at 225m barrels, making it the number one importer of UAE crude, although its volume of imports decreased from 231m barrels in 2014. Overall, the volume of crude oil exports declined by approximately 9% in 2015, from 729m barrels in 2014 to a total of 661m. The most significant falls in exports by volume were to South Korea, down 28.5m barrels; India, 23.6m barrels; Singapore, 17m barrels; and Japan, 6.3m barrels. However, Thailand bucked this trend, its imports from Abu Dhabi rising from 79m barrels to a total of 91m, which meant that - at around 13.8% of the total - it had the second-highest share of Abu Dhabi's crude oil exports in 2015, up from 10.9% the year before. In early 2017 ADNOC signed an agreement with Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves (ISPR), a government-owned entity, to store crude oil at an underground facility in Mangalore. Up to 5.86m barrels of crude from Abu Dhabi will be stored at the facility under the agreement, with the objective of enhancing India's energy security. Exports of refined petroleum products fell by 40% in 2015, from 30.8m tonnes in 2014 to 18.3m. The biggest slowdown was in exports to the Netherlands, which fell from 9.21m tonnes in 2014 - 29.9% of total exports - to 2.23m in 2015 or 12.2% of total exports. Exports to France, meanwhile, dropped by 3.7m tonnes, and India took 1.7m tonnes less in 2015 than it had done the previous year. Conversely, exports of refined petroleum products to Japan, Singapore, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Malaysia all increased in that year, with Japan constituting the biggest single market - at 18.8% of the total - followed by Singapore at 12.3%. SCAD noted that overall LNG exports declined by Dh3.1bn ($844m) in 2014 to reach Dh16.9bn. Japan was the biggest recipient in 2014, importing 97.8% of the total, and importing 7.7bn cu metres of LNG from the UAE in 2014. At this time, the average price of Japanese imports, including cost, insurance and freight, stood at $16.33 per million British thermal units (Btu), a price that had only ever been beaten by the $16.75 paid in 2012. In 2015 Japan's LNG imports dropped slightly to 7.4bn cu metres, when the average price had fallen to $10.31 per million Btu, the lowest price since 2009. In 2016 the average price of Japan's LNG imports was $6.85 per million Btu, cheaper than at any time since 2005. In 2015 SCAD reported that Abu Dhabi imported 21.76bn cu metres of natural gas, which comes through the Dolphin Energy pipeline from Qatar's North Field. Estimates & Projections Although ADNOC does not publish financial statements, the IMF, at the end of its Article IV visit to the UAE in July 2016, gave estimates of the country's earnings and projected earnings from hydrocarbons based on its economists' examination of profit transfers from ADNOC to the country's sovereign wealth funds, including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and the returns of sovereign wealth funds. The IMF estimates that the country's hydrocarbons exports declined from a total of $129.4bn to $101.9bn in 2013-14 and $61.5bn in 2015. The fund predicted a further drop in 2016 to reach $54.5bn, before improving to $64.8bn in 2017. These projections were based on an average crude oil price of $52.40 in 2015, $45.30 in 2016 and $52.60 in 2017, with crude oil production increasing from around 3m bpd in 2016 to 3.1m bpd in 2017. Based on these figures, the IMF assumed real hydrocarbons GDP growth of 0.8% in 2014, 4.6% in 2015, and 2% in 2016 and 2017. The fund also estimated that with fiscal consolidation in Abu Dhabi the break-even oil price declined from $79 in 2014 to $60 in 2015. Looking further ahead, the IMF predicts oil will stay below $60 a barrel until 2021. Oil Production In contrast to fluctuations in the global price of crude oil, production at ADNOC's oil fields has been growing steadily over recent years, with the exception of the two years that followed the decision by OPEC in 2008 to cut production in the wake of the global financial crisis. According to BP's "Statistical Review of World Energy 2016", production in the UAE reached 3.9m bpd in 2015. This was a 5.3% increase on the total for 2014 at 3.69m bpd. Average production in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was 3.3m, 3.4m and 3.64m bpd, respectively. The UAE's average daily crude oil production was the eighth highest in the world in 2015, according to BP, after the US (12.7m bpd), Saudi Arabia (12m bpd), Russia (11m bpd), Canada (4.4m bpd), China (4.3m bpd), Iraq (4m bpd) and Iran (3.9m bpd). Of those eight leading producers, the UAE's production increase, in percentage terms, was the third-highest after Iraq, which boosted production by 22.9%, and the US, where output surged by 8.5%. There are a number of differences in the way oil production is recorded and reported by BP, the International Energy Agency, the US Energy Information Agency (EIA) and the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI). For instance, some include crude oil and lease condensate (C+C), while others do not, and Canadian tar sands are not included in the JODI C+C data. JODI is given monthly data by national governments, although there are occasional omissions. A Record Year The latest available data published by JODI, which for the UAE covers the first nine months of 2016, shows crude oil production increased by 2% compared to the same period in 2015, with average production up from 3.218m bpd to 3.283m bpd. The pace of production accelerated in the third quarter, with average output from July to September 4% higher than in the same period the year before, and average daily output rising from 3.276m to a total of 3.410m bpd. In December 2016 ADNOC reported that its own production in Abu Dhabi was at the 3.15m bpd mark. According to JODI, of the eight leading crude oil producers the US and China were the only two to reduce average daily production in 2016, by 5.67% and 6.9%, respectively, over the full 12 months. Russia's output increased by 2.9%, from 10.1m bpd to 10.4m bpd, while Saudi Arabia's production rose by 2.9% from 10.2m bpd to 10.5m bpd. Canada boosted production by 8.1%, according to JODI, but the two most significant increases were in Iran, where the removal of sanctions saw oil output increase by 14.1%, from 3.1m bpd to 3.5m bpd during the first nine months of the year compared to the same period in 2015, and in Iraq, where crude production surged by 32.8%, from 3.5m bpd to 4.6m bpd for the full year. Production Cuts However, it was to be the level of production achieved in October 2016 that would be used as the benchmark for the historic production cuts agreed by the meeting of OPEC countries in Vienna at the end of November 2016. As part of this agreement, the UAE agreed to a reduction in output of 139,000 bpd based on its average October output of 3.013m bpd, leaving it with a production target from January 2017 of 2.874m bpd. Saudi Arabia, which accounts for some 31% of OPEC production, offered to make 41% of the 1.2m bpd in cuts agreed by 11 OPEC member states. The OPEC cut was the first in eight years, and the deal saw Brent Crude immediately climb above $50. On December 10, 11 non-OPEC countries, including Russia, agreed to trim output by an additional 558,000 bpd collectively in what was described as the first global oil cut since 2001. The same month, Reuters reported that ADNOC had announced it would cut crude supplies by between 3% and 5% from January 2017. The 5% reduction would be applied to Murban from ADCO's onshore fields and the Upper Zakum grade produced offshore while the 3% reduction would apply to Das, the high quality blend from the offshore fields of Umm Shaif and Lower Zakum, which has an American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity of 38.79 degrees and a sulphur content of 1.14%. ADNOC's production capacity of Murban, a light sour crude with an API of 40.31 degrees and sulphur content of 0.778%, is 1.6m bpd. Upper Zakum is a medium grade crude with an API of 33.9 degrees and a sulphur content of 1.84%. As of March 2017 Murban, Das and Upper Zakum were valued at around $56.10, $55.45 and $54.00 respectively, according to ADNOC. Pumping Up Prices The purpose of the agreed production cut is to control inventories in the hope that the price of oil will start to rise. The last time OPEC agreed to production cuts was in December 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis. On July 3, 2008 a barrel of Brent Crude was fetching $143.95, but by December 19 that same year, just after OPEC met in Oran, the price had dropped to $39.52. During that meeting, OPEC countries led by the swing producer Saudi Arabia agreed to cut production by 4m bpd. A year after the cut had been agreed Brent crude was selling for as much as $77. However, many industry experts believe there are significant differences between 2008 and 2016. On the demand side, China may not have the appetite for oil it had in 2009-10. Between those two years China's oil consumption grew by 14%, according to BP figures, while the UAE's production was held back to 2.7m bpd in 2009 and 2.9m bpd 2010, years in which Saudi Arabia curbed supply to 9.7m bpd and 10m bpd. However, in 2016 BP noted that China's energy consumption had grown at its slowest rate for 20 years in 2015, at just 1.5%. Another contrast with 2008 relates to the size of the production cut. In 2008 the scale of the supply reduction was more than twice that of the cut agreed in 2016. However, the most profound change since 2008 has been on the supply side, due to the shale revolution in the US. In 2008 it could take three to six years for a new oil field to be developed and brought into production, but in 2016 and 2017 hydraulic fracture companies have the ability to increase production in a matter of months. In December 2016 the investment bank Goldman Sachs revised its outlook for oil prices for the second quarter of 2017, assuming all the countries that had offered to reduce production complied with the agreement. Its revised forecast was that by the second quarter West Texas Intermediate would be selling for $57.50, up from its previous estimate of $55, while it expected a price of $59 a barrel for Brent crude, up from $56.50. Although a price of $59 would be very close to the $60 a year fiscal break-even calculated by the IMF for the UAE, it does not suggest a huge surplus, nor for that matter a return to the peak prices seen in 2008 and 2014. Goldman Sachs estimated the impact of the production cuts would not be felt from the start of January. Oil prices were averaging $51 as of May 2017. Climate Change & Innovation When the UAE's leaders debate the future, they also acknowledge the impact international efforts to reduce global warming and environmental sentiment may have on future demand for fossil fuels, and crude oil in particular. The UAE was one of the first Arab countries to sign onto the agreement made at the COP21 UN Conference on Climate Change in Paris in 2015, and in November 2016 Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, deputy prime minister of the UAE, led the country's delegation to the COP22 conference in Morocco. The UAE's national statement to the international climate change conference focused on its instrumental role in working on innovative solutions in sustainability, while striving with other world leaders to advance action on global warming. There were also signs of a global change in consumer sentiment in 2016. In February Bloomberg suggested sales of electric vehicles were showing signs of reaching a tipping point that could result in a 2m bpd fall in demand for crude oil by 2023. Two months later the US entrepreneur Elon Musk began taking $1000 deposits for his new Tesla Model 3 electric car. Within a week Musk announced $325m paid in pre-orders, representing eventual sales of $14bn for a car that was due to launch in late 2017. Comparisons with the impact Henry Ford's Model T made on gasoline demand in the early 20th century were soon made. But there was more to come. In October 2016 Musk announced Tesla's $2.2bn acquisition of SolarCity, the largest rooftop installation company in the US. Musk predicted that the company's revolutionary new solar roof tiles would create a paradigm shift in home energy use. Long-Term Forecasts While these kinds of innovations may suggest there will be a reduction in demand for fossil fuels for some uses, global energy consumption continues to rise, albeit it modestly in 2014-16, and industry forecasters see crude oil playing a leading role for decades to come. The "International Energy Outlook 2016" report published by the EIA predicts the share of petroleum and liquid fuels used in the global energy mix should fall from 33% in 2010 to 30% by 2040, but this will still represent the largest share. It sees the share of natural gas growing from 23% of the total to 26% over the same period, and it anticipates gas will surpass coal by 2030, with coal's share sliding from 28% to 22%. Renewables, meanwhile, are expected to increase from 12% to 16%. The EIA sees rising incomes in China, India and other parts of Asia as the main driver of growth in global energy consumption, which it expects to increase from 549,000trn Btu in 2010 to 815,000trn Btu in 2040. BP's 2016 Energy Outlook sees the Middle East's energy consumption rising by 60% by 2035, with fossil fuels accounting for 96% of the total, and it predicts the region's share of global oil production will rise from 32% in 2016 to 33% in 2035. It also predicts the region will remain the world's biggest oil exporter. Volumes are expected to increase from 20m bpd in 2014 to 23m bpd in 2035, with industry remaining the biggest user of energy globally. However, the report also sees gas growing faster than oil in the Middle East, with production up 49% and consumption up 67%. 2050 Strategy In response to these long-term projections, in early 2017 the UAE launched its Energy Plan for 2050, which aims to achieve a balance between energy production and consumption by 2050, significantly expanding the role of clean energy and nuclear in the energy mix, and improving energy efficiency by 40%. Under this plan, the UAE envisages clean energy supplying 44% of the country's overall energy needs, followed by gas (38%), clean coal (12%) and nuclear energy (6%). The plan earmarks Dh600bn ($163.4bn) in investment to meet energy demand and expects the strategy will result in savings of Dh700bn ($190.6bn). Initiatives carried out under the strategy will focus on three main themes. The first involves the quick transition of power consumption efficiency, diversifying energy sources and ensuring the security of its supply. The second seeks to find new solutions that complement power and transport systems, and the third targets research, development and innovation to ensure the sustainability of energy. Renewables The launch of the new 2050 energy strategy coupled with the rapidly falling costs of renewable energy has seen renewables significantly expand their role in Abu Dhabi's energy mix. This has opened the door for new projects, with Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority receiving a world record-breaking lowest bid for a solar power generation project in 2016 (see analysis). Also during that year, Masdar signed a power purchase agreement with Dubai Electricity and Water Authority to construct the 800-MW third phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The consortium was awarded the project in June 2016, after submitting a bid with the lowest cost of electricity at that time, at 2.99 cents per KWh. To date, Masdar has invested in renewables projects with a combined total value of $8.5bn. Gas Production Natural gas is an integral and growing part of the ADNOC conglomerate, with production divided between three companies. In 1973 the Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (ADGAS) became the first LNG company in the MENA region. ADNOC owns 70% of the company, with the remaining shares divided between Matsui & Co, BP and Total, with the three international firms owning 15%, 10% and 5%, respectively. The company's LNG plant on Das Island, which is located some 180 km north-west of Abu Dhabi, processes both associated gas - the by-product of offshore oil production - and non-associated gas, produced from natural gas reservoirs. ADGAS signed its first 20-year agreement with Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) in 1972, and is still supplying TEPCO with LNG under an agreement that runs until 2019. It has an average annual production of 8m tonnes of LNG, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, paraffinic naphtha and liquid sulphur. ADGAS's two strategic projects - Integrated Gas Development (IGD) and Offshore Associated Gas - sees Das Island process 1bn scfd. Going forwards, the plan is to increase this by 400m scfd, which will be transferred to another of ADNOC's gas companies, Abu Dhabi Gas Industries (GASCO). The IGD-E project comprises the construction of a new offshore and onshore pipeline, as well as additional facilities within the Habshan-5 Complex and the modification of existing facilities. The project is being monitored by ADGAS and GASCO to ensure its completion by second quarter 2018. Established in 1978 GASCO is engaged in the extraction of natural gas liquids (NGL) from associated and non-associated gas taken from both offshore and onshore fields. It operates a total of five gas processing plants and one fractionation plant. Gas Facilities The Habshan-Bab Gas Complex produces network gas that is supplied directly to end users, as well as NGL, condensate and liquid sulphur. The NGL is sent to the nearby Ruwais plant for fractionation, while the condensate is piped to Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company (Takreer), which is an ADNOC subsidiary responsible for refined petroleum products. The sulphur is granulated and exported. Saif Al Nasseri, CEO of GASCO, told OBG, "In the last couple of years, we have increased the natural gas processing capacity and have successfully achieved the historical milestone of unloading the first train of granulated sulphur with the inauguration of our Ruwais Sulphur Handling Terminal, which also handles the Al Hosn Gas sulphur granules." The Ruwais NGL fractionation plant creates four products: ethane, propane, butane and paraffinic naphtha. Another of GASCO's facilities, Habshan 5, receives offshore gas from ADMA-OPCO via ADGAS for the production of sales gas, NGL and liquid sulphur. The Asab 1 plant processes condensate-rich gas with the condensate subsequently transferred to Takreer and the remaining gas transferred to Asab 2, where the sulphur and NGL are removed. The third Asab facility - Asab 0 - is an NGL extraction plant serviced by associated gas from ADCO's oil fields, with its product being sent for fractionation in Ruwais. Buhasa NGL plant also receives associated gas from ADCO. Of these facilities, Asab 1 and 2, the Habshan complex the Ruwais operation and the pipeline network are solely owned by ADNOC. However, the Asab 0, Bab and Buhasa facilities are JV assets, with ADNOC holding a total of 68%, Shell and Total 15% each and Partex 2%. "Cost optimisation is a major priority for GASCO," Al Nasseri told OBG. "Over the next five years we are looking to optimise the total expenditure at both our ADNOC sole risk and JV assets, without compromising on either safety or asset integrity." Floating Regasification In 2016 GASCO marked a new technological milestone when it took delivery of a floating storage and regasification unit that will help the company boost its input into the grid. The ship, which is supplied by Excelerate Energy, is capable of vaporising LNG, and it will have the capacity to add 500m scfd to the emirate's supply, enough to power a city the size of Fujairah for a day. Sour Gas Developments ADNOC's third and newest gas business is Abu Dhabi Gas Development Company, known widely as Al Hosn Gas, which has been operated as a JV with Houston-based Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) since 2011. Oxy holds a 40% stake in the company, which operates what it describes as the world's largest sour gas development project - the Shah gas field. The project is being developed in three phases and by 2014 all 32 wells in phase one had been drilled, so that by 2015 the plant, which represents an investment of $10bn, was receiving 1bn scfd of raw gas and producing 500m scfd of sales gas for distribution to the network, as well as 4400 tonnes of NGL per day, 33,000 bpd of petroleum condensates and 9000 tonnes of granulated sulphur per day from four sulphur recovery units. The gas in the Shah field is in a 60-km-by-11-km reservoir, which lies 8500 feet below the surface of the Empty Quarter near Liwa Oasis. It was first discovered in 1966, but the gas - which has a 23% hydrogen sulphide content - is highly toxic and was considered too dangerous to extract at that time. However, with advances in technology the project was deemed feasible in 2010. In November 2016 ADNOC announced it would press ahead with an expansion of the facility that would increase capacity by 50%. This would make the company one of the world's largest producers of sulphur. The statement gave a boost to ADNOC's gas strategy following Shell's announcement, in January 2016, that it planned to exit Abu Dhabi's Bab sour gas reservoir project, citing the prevailing economic conditions in the energy industry. Shell had taken a 40% stake in the $10bn project for a 30-year period in 2013. According to BP's "Statistical Review of World Energy 2016", the UAE produced a total of 55.8bn cu metres of gas per day in 2015, a 2.8% increase on the previous year. Al Hosn Gas only reached full capacity in July 2015. Based on estimates by BP, this equalled 50.2 tonnes of oil equivalent per day, compared to UAE production of 175.5 tonnes of crude oil per day, giving the country a daily production of 225.7 tonnes of oil and gas. Refining Boost A key focus of ADNOC's overall strategy is to improve the efficiency and profitability of its downstream activities and take advantage of the 2015 expansion of the Ruwais refinery's capacity from 400,000 bpd to 817,000 bpd. Ruwais, located in the Al Dhafra Region, and a smaller 85,000 bpd refinery at Sas Al Nakhl, are run by Takreer, which accounts for 80% of the refining capacity of the UAE. The expansion boosted the country's capacity by 61% from 2014 to 2015. Over the same period, the UAE increased its output of petroleum products by 34.6%, from 625,600 bpd in 2014 to 842,100 bpd in 2015, according to OPEC data. Although it took some time for the Ruwais expansion to take effect, with Reuters reporting in July 2015 that it was operating at 80% of capacity, as of March 2017 it was running at full capacity. "Ruwais West was designed for adaptability," Jasem Al Sayegh, CEO of Takreer, told OBG. "The residual fluid catalytic cracking unit converts residue into lighter fractions like propylene, naphtha, LPG, and diesel, with an ability to make significant adjustment depending on the market." OPEC figures show that in 2015 the UAE produced 102,500 bpd of gasoline, 256,900 bpd of kerosene, 176,900 bpd of distillates and 26,100 bpd of residuals, with significant increases in production of petrol, kerosene and distillates of 17.6%, 42.3% and 43.5%, respectively, compared to 2014. Takreer's eventual commissioning of its heavy oil conversion carbon black and delayed coker project will also help it respond to environmental pressures globally, including the compliance with IMO regulation for low sulphur bunker oil, which is targeted for implementation in the year 2020. There are three other downstream businesses in the ADNOC portfolio: Borouge, which operates three ethane crackers, five polyethylene and four polypropylene plants and one low-density polyethylene plant; FERTIL, which operates two ammonia plants and two urea plants in the Ruwais complex; Elixier, which operates the Ruwais air separation unit providing gaseous and liquefied nitrogen to Borouge and liquefied nitrogen to ADNOC subsidiaries by tanker and the Mirfa nitrogen plant. Speaking at ADIPEC in late 2016, Abdulaziz Abdulla Alhajri, director of refining and petrochemicals at ADNOC, said: "ADNOC's ultimate goal is unlocking the full potential of all our assets. So, we are pursuing profitable and integrated growth in refining and petrochemicals. We are also diversifying our product portfolio to make us more resilient to economic cycles and crude oil price fluctuations." Outlook In 2017 those oil price fluctuations would appear to be following an upward trajectory after a year in which historic deals were struck by OPEC and other producers to reduce output. However, industry forecasters are cautious about how high prices will increase, and some believe the shale revolution in the US may have helped create a new ceiling that could prevent the industry from returning to the boom prices of 2008 and 2014 that proved so profitable for Abu Dhabi. Outlined in its 2030 Strategy, ADNOC envisages greater integration of its business units and a shift in emphasis to suit changing global markets for its products. After a year of consolidation and streamlining across the energy sector, the emphasis is not so much on considering the future post-oil, but on ensuring the emirate makes the most of its oil. \</doc>

DUOPOLISTS DUEL WITH THIRD PARTIES Airbus and Boeing have enjoyed a duopoly in the mainline airliners market for long enough \- a couple of decades \- that it has become standard analysis to regard their position as essentially unassailable. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the absorption by Boeing of its last US rival, McDonnell Douglas, the competition has been exactly zero. Given that their market dominance has been so dramatically firmed up by an unprecedented long run of record-breaking sales, it has been hard to see where there is any space in the market for a serious rival, even if a pretender to their throne had the technical nous to realise some alternative metal. But, this year has seen some movement. On the narrowbody front, Russia is test-flying the Irkut MC-21, and China the Comac C919. On paper at least, both have the performance potential to give airlines pause for thought before signing up to yet more Airbus A320s or Boeing 737s, but neither are considered a serious competitive threat. Aviation images/REX/Shutterstock Canada\' s Bombardier, however, seems to have actually rattled cages in Seattle and Toulouse. As a clean-sheet design launched as recently as 2008, its CSeries \- with its next-generation engines, composite wings and general all-newness \- has won plaudits for efficiency, technological advances and relatively smooth entry into service. By comparison, the market-dominating A320 and 737 families \- tweaked and re-engined as they are \- look positively elderly. Size-wise, the CSeries sits between sub-100-seat regional jets and the 150-seat-plus Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies, and its market presence has been muted by development and production issues. But, all the same, it has come under competitive fire. First, the USA has launched a trade dispute against Canada alleging that government subsidy of the programme harms Boeing \- which could end with a swingeing, punitive, 300% tariff on sales to, for example, signed-up customer Delta Airlines. Airbus, too, appears to regard the CSeries as a worthy competitor but has taken an arguably less confrontational approach. It has effectively bought the programme. If the deal clears regulatory hurdles, next year will see the formation of the CSeries Aircraft Limited Partnership \- majority owned by Airbus, with Bombardier and the Canadian government relegated to minority interests. WIDEBODY BATTLE? A different competitive threat emerged on the other side of the globe, though, when Russia and China firmed up talk about a joint effort to take on the widebody sector. United Aircraft and Comac now call their programme the CR 929 \- CR as in China-Russia \- and it will come in three flavours, handling 250 to 320 passengers over ranges from 5,400nm (10,000km) to 14,000km. Overseeing development is a new joint-venture company called China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation (CRAIC), based in Shanghai, and a design centre in Moscow. We are told to expect early configuration and preliminary design in 2018, first flight in 2023 and entry into service in 2025. Does the duopoly have a limited lifespan? Russia certainly has technical expertise and China has money \- and a huge domestic market \- but neither have been much of a threat on the programme management front. In this case, however, they have shown themselves to be realistic about their limitations, and are asking Western suppliers to come on board. Having said that, the history of Sino-Russian collaboration is not particularly encouraging. Watch this space. AIRLINES BATTLE IT OUT For airlines, 2017 was a year to note for improved profitability off the back of continued strong air travel demand, but the positive mood was punctuated by a series of high-profile challenges and service interruptions that dominated headlines. US carriers found themselves battling to lure price-conscious travellers. United Airlines led the way with a no-frills basic economy fare, but was forced to take a step back amid a fierce competitive response from rivals. Indeed, by September the largest US carriers were lowering their third-quarter unit revenue expectations as, nearly universally, they reported a spike in competitive pricing activity. While US carriers continue to lead industry profitability, the price war and a ferocious hurricane season took the gloss off profit performance. In Europe the difference between an "IT meltdown" and a "power failure" had to be explained by British Airways. The incident grounded a host of BA flights and served as an illustration of the almost impossible customer service challenges that disruption can cause. That was to become more apparent when Ryanair's pilot-rostering difficulties prompted a wave of flight cancellations. Tolga Akmen/LNP/REX/Shutterstock Yet the underlying strong business environment \- and IAG and Ryanair have been among the most robust groups in Europe in recent years \- means both are still on course to make record high profits for the 2017 financial year. Indeed, European airlines as a whole are likely to improve margins. Monarch Airlines ceased flying in October, soon followed by Air Berlin. Alitalia, meanwhile, is no stranger to the last chance saloon, seeking fresh investment after entering extraordinary administration. For an industry that has prided itself over the past couple years on breaking with tradition to resist the urge to pile on capacity, it is worth noting that all three suffered, in part, from the competitive impact of increased capacity \- especially into popular Mediterranean markets. Traffic between the Middle East and the USA was hit by tightened security. US president Donald Trump may have ultimately failed to ban travel by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries, but restrictions on bringing large personal electronic devices onto flights to the USA from a number of airports in the Middle East and North Africa followed. The UK took a similar line, albeit with a different list of origin airports. The UK and USA began lifting those restrictions in the summer, but a row over alleged government subsidies to big Gulf carriers saw their US rivals call for a review of the open-skies deal with the UAE and Qatar \- a row that rumbles on. American Airlines then hardly welcomed a planned \- but ultimately aborted \- move by Qatar Airways to buy up to 10% of the carrier. AA dropped its codeshare with Qatar and Etihad, prompting the latter to drop its Dallas/Fort Worth service. Middle East carriers were also hit by diplomatic tensions closer to home when the severing of ties by a number of states in the region with Qatar resulted in the closing of airspace in several markets. Several months since the row erupted in early June, the restrictions remain in place. But for many, the memorable moment of the year came on 9 April, when police at Chicago O\' Hare International airport boarded United flight 3411 and violently dragged a passenger off the overbooked aircraft, leaving him with a bloodied face and, reportedly, broken teeth. A video of the incident went viral online and the ensuing publicity nightmare ended with David Dao settling privately for what may have been rather a lot of money. The incident led United, American and Delta to amend their overbooking policies, in some cases giving local managers discretion to offer more cash to displaced passengers. But US lawmakers grilled airline bosses all the same and new consumer rules were proposed. United boss Oscar Munoz said: "That is not who our family at United is. This can never, will never happen again on a United Airlines flight." RYANAIR HITS TURBULENCE While it may sometimes seem \- at least from the perspective of envious rivals \- that Ryanair can do no wrong, the budget airline with a gift for turning in ever-higher profits from ever-growing passenger numbers while \- if one believes its critics \- putting the misery back into flying finally this year flew into some turbulence. Over about six weeks in September and October, Ryanair was forced to cancel some 2,100 flights, leaving more than 300,000 passengers in the lurch because there was nobody to sit in the cockpits. The episode, blamed on a rostering foul-up, would be memorable if only for schadenfreude. But while Ryanair was careful to dismiss the fiasco as a temporary blip in its otherwise unblemished record of perfection, famously-irascible chief Michael O\' Leary revealed, perhaps unintentionally, that management was actually a bit rattled. A man whose idea of in-flight entertainment is listening to K-Mart-style public address announcements ("lottery tickets on sale now!", "another Ryanair flight arrives on time!") and queuing for pay toilets left himself wide open to accusations of actually harbouring the capacity for empathy by sounding a note of contrition, uttering the words "I apologise" as the situation unfolded. "This is a mess of our own making," he said. "I apologise sincerely to all our customers for any worry or concern this has caused them over the past weekend." The explanation \- "We have messed up the allocation of annual leave to pilots in September and October because we are trying to allocate a full year's leave into a nine-month period from April to December" \- seemed fair enough, though it may not have inspired much confidence in the ability of O'Leary's management team to, say, count. But the incident did not hit full-year profit expectations and, he stressed, would not be repeated, as 2018's holiday calendar and pilot roster would be aligned. Pilot relations, however, have long been tetchy and were not improved by the affair. Ryanair tabled an offer of improved terms and conditions and promised to hire more pilots directly rather than through agencies, but the BALPA pilots' union remained defiant. Said general secretary Brian Sutton: "It fits Ryanair's narrative to paint unions as 'outsiders', threatening the company's future. This is nonsense, and any of the problems Ryanair is having with pilots are, in our opinion, entirely as a result of management failures." MILESTONES Airbus A330neo Airbus's October first flight of the re-engined and updated A330-900 also marked the initial flight of the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 powerplant, which had only undertaken ground tests before the aircraft's maiden sortie from Toulouse. Airbus The engine \- the exclusive powerplant for the A330neo family \- is a successor to the Trent 700 on the baseline A330. It has been derived from the Trent 1000-TEN, manufactured for the Boeing 787, and incorporates technology from the Trent XWB, which R-R designed for the Airbus A350. The engine maker says the Trent 7000 is capable of delivering 68,000-72,000lb (302-320kN) of thrust and cutting specific fuel consumption by 10%. Development has taken longer than originally scheduled, contributing to a shift of several months in the A330neo production timeline. The manufacturer has had a high workload over the past year with production of the Trent 1000-TEN, as well as the Trent XWB-97 for the A350-1000. TAP Portugal will be the first carrier to take delivery of the A330neo. Airbus A350-1000 US and European regulators certificated the biggest Airbus twinjet variant. The first example of the R-R Trent XWB-97-powered aircraft is expected to be delivered to Qatar Airways before the curtain closes on 2017. Boeing 737 Max 8 Boeing's fourth re-engining of its 737 narrowbody in the programme's 50-year history entered commercial service in May, when Malindo Air carried customers in the Max 8 variant. Norwegian Air International was close behind, inaugurating transatlantic service for the type about a month later. In November, Boeing started final assembly of the third and smallest variant in the series, the Max 7, in anticipation of flight testing at the company's single-aisle production centre in Renton, Washington. Final assembly for that 737-7 \- with 138-153 seats in a two-class layout \- follows three years behind the 162-189-seat Max 8. The -7 milestone came a little less than a year after the same point was reached in the 178-193-seat Max 9 programme, which made its first flight in April; it continues in flight testing and is on track to enter service next year. A 188-204-seat Max 10 is in design. Boeing 787-10 First flight for the newest and longest member of the Dreamliner family came in March; the first example for launch customer Singapore Airlines rolled out of Boeing's paint shop in October \- delivery is expected in May 2018. Mitsubishi MRJ The programme has been delayed five times and first delivery pushed back two years to 2020, but Mitsubishi decided it was time to show its mettle \- indeed, its metal \- by taking time out of a trying flight-test campaign to fly one of its MRJ test aircraft to the Paris air show. Things have not gone smoothly since then, though \- flight testing was suspended in August, for about a month, following an uncommanded shutdown of a Pratt & Whitney PW1200G engine, but while the cause remains under investigation, the event was deemed a one-off, so a grounding order was lifted in September. But in October, Mitsubishi confirmed that one of its metal suppliers had been caught fabricating inspection data on its product \- but said the issue was not expected to impact the development programme, as investigations showed parts made from metal supplied by Kobe Steel found that it "remains within our design standards we originally set for aircraft safety", and thus the safety of the jet is not in question. Mitsubishi aims to deliver the first 90-seat MRJ90 to launch customer All Nippon Airways in mid-2020. Chengdu J-20 The Chengdu J-20 fighter entered service with the Chinese air force in the autumn. A brief, three-line statement from the Chinese ministry of defence said the developmental type had entered service, but added little else. Chinese defence chatrooms suggest the number of in-service examples could be six. Just to wrap a little intrigue around the mystery, there also emerged reports of progress with indigenous engines. Early examples were powered by Russian Saturn AL-31Fs, or a Chinese engine, the Shenyang WS-10. Now, media reports suggest the type will receive the more powerful WS-15 engine, which allegedly will allow the J-20 to "super-cruise" \- or fly at supersonic speeds without afterburners. The J-20 first emerged on Chinese defence sites in late 2010 and made its public debut at last year's Airshow China in Zhuhai, with two examples overflying the crowd. Calidus B-250 In the United Arab Emirates, local aerospace company Calidus took the occasion of the Dubai air show in November to reveal to the world its B-250 light strike aircraft. The all-new, multirole strike and surveillance aircraft, built from carbonfibre and powered by a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-68 turboprop engine, was developed in only two years in conjunction with Brazilian aerospace company Novaer. Bearing some similarities to the Embraer A-29 Super Tucano, the B-250 has been designed from the ground up as a strike aircraft, rather than a platform adapted to the role, which Calidus says is a major advantage over competing products. In the strike, counter-insurgency, close air support and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance roles, the aircraft can be equipped with seven munitions and an electro-optical sensor pod. Sources close to the company say the aircraft has already generated significant interest from potential customers. But the aircraft is noteworthy also as an illustration of the levelling power of software \- in this case Dassault Syst\'e8mes 3D Experience computer-aided design and collaboration platform. Says Calidus chief software engineer Hamdan Al Shkeili: "This platform enabled our teams in Abu Dhabi and Brazil to work together throughout the design process to get the aircraft's components right from the start. We successfully demonstrated that, with the right technologies, we could deliver in an industry having the highest technological standards." Production of the new aircraft is in its early stages at Calidus's facility in Al Ain. F-35: LIGHTNING STRIKES? The Pentagon\' s most expensive procurement programme to date experienced yet another year of taking two steps forward and one step back. Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter made a series of momentous transatlantic flights, with delivery to the Royal Norwegian Air Force in November and the F-35A's Paris air show debut in June. But the embattled-though-barely-battle-ready fighter is still plagued by protracted repairs, corrosion issues and development delays. During the annual Air, Space and Cyber conference in September, the F-35's new programme executive, US Navy Vice Adm Mat Winter, announced the Joint Program Office was considering keeping scores of F-35s equipped with a non-combat rated software operating system. BillyPix Lockheed has already delivered more than 108 with Block 2B software and each fighter would require more than 150 modifications to reach the combat-ready Block 3 standard. The modifications could threaten coffers reserved for the coming production ramp up, which will see more than 900 aircraft delivered over the next five years. The F-35A made its Paris debut this summer, flying a square loop over the fields of Le Bourget and standing out on the static display. Even its grounded presence marked a notable event for US stealth aircraft at the show, after controversy over possible French industrial espionage broke out after the last static display in 1991, when the F-117 Nighthawk visited. But behind the Joint Strike Fighter's pomp and circumstance, reporters at the show pressed US Air Force officials to address ongoing oxygen issues with F-35As stationed at Luke AFB in Arizona. Luke AFB grounded its F-35A fleet on 9 June, after five pilots experienced "hypoxia-like symptoms" over the previous month. The base did not lift altitude restrictions on the aircraft until early August, though the USAF had not identified the root cause of physiological events that prompted the base's decision to restrict its F-35 squadrons' flying operations. Despite its development difficulties, Lockheed and the F-35 weathered its first year in the Trump administration. After decrying the programme a year ago on his Twitter account, the president appeared to have a change of heart with the stealth aircraft. Procurement for the F-35 remained steady in the White House's fiscal year 2018 defence budget request and Congress outlined additional F-35 orders in its defence spending bills. Lockheed may be heading into a more optimistic 2018 with its tempestuous customer to the north, though. Canada is reopening its next-generation fighter contract for bids and expects to award by 2021. Initially rebuffed by prime minister Justin Trudeau\' s Liberal party, Lockheed's F-35 could fare better in a future fighter competition after Boeing's commercial arm sparked a international trade dispute over allegedly unfair subsidies to Canadian aerospace champion Bombardier's CSeries jetliner project. PRIVATE FLYING Business aviation has been a delicate affair since the financial crisis, and while 2017 has been another relatively quiet year for the industry \- no new programme launches \- there has, at least, been modest growth in new aircraft sales. In its latest industry shipment report, released in November, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association recorded 434 business jet deliveries in the nine months ended 30 September \- six more than in the same period a year earlier. While this output is a far cry from the heady days of 2007-2008, the Washington DC-headquartered trade body points to an "upward trend" in the market; a palpable sense of optimism has returned to the industry in 2017 \- in sharp contrast to the gloom just a year ago. And the imminent arrival of a host of clean-sheet business jets has contributed significantly to this mood change \- new technology being an effective stimulant for potential buyers. Indeed, five major airframers have been working over the past 12 months to bring new products to market \- and two of these programmes \- Pilatus Aircraft's superlight PC-24 and Textron Aviation's super-midsize Longitude \- are on track for certification and service entry in December 2017 and January 2018 respectively. Gulfstream had hoped for a 2017 certification and service entry for its G500, but a delay in the supply chain pushed that to early 2018. The airframer also declared that the large-cabin, long-range business jet will be introduced with greater range than expected, allowing it to fly up to 5,200nm \- an extra 200nm \- at Mach 0.85. Its larger-cabin and longer-range stablemate, the G600, was also given a 300nm range boost and can now reach 6,500nm at the same speed. This high-end business jet made good progress this year. Four test aircraft joined the certification campaign, which kicked off in December 2016, and remains on course for certification and service entry in 2018. Bombardier is also confident it can bring its top-of-the-range Global 7000 to market within the same timeframe. Three test aircraft joined its certification campaign in 2017 \- and the Canadian airframer announced that the GE-Passport-powered ultra-long-range business jet is sold out to 2021. Confidence, however, is in short supply at Dassault. The French airframer was notified by Safran in early October that it had encountered new problems with its Silvercrest turbofan during ground and flight tests, further delaying Falcon 5X certification. Engine development issues have already forced Dassault to delay entry-into-service of the ultra-wide business jet from its target date of 2017 to 2020. The exasperated company says it is still too early to know how long the latest problems will further affect the revised schedule, and has not ruled out switching to an alternative engine supplier. A decision will be made in 2018. Despite the Silvercrest issue, Dassault has continued to develop and test the 5X, powered by an interim standard of the turbofan. Since first flight on 5 July, the 5X test aircraft has built up more than 50h in flight, with testing focused on basic handling and systems performance. Small blessings There was more positive news at the bottom end of the market in 2016. Cirrus Aircraft began ramping up production of its Vision Jet. The pioneering single-engined personal jet entered service in December 2016 after a 10-year development effort, and the US airframer has secured around 600 orders. A further ramp-up is planned next year to help clear the hefty backlog. Hoping to capitalise on Cirrus\' s success, US start-up Stratos Aircraft completed preliminary flight testing of its personal jet \- called the 714 \- in July, but is now confronted with the formidable task of securing around $200 million to bring its seven-seat offering to market. IN A SPIN, STILL For the rotorcraft industry, 2017 has proceeded in much the same fashion as the year before. Commercial sales, while occasionally offering a tantalising glimpse of a rebound, have continued to bump along the bottom. While light helicopters have shown a degree of resilience \- China, in particular, appears finally to be showing significant demand. At the heavier end, there has been little change, with the offshore oil and gas sector still mired in a downturn and all the major operators continuing to experience a significant squeeze on costs. If there is a cause for optimism, it is that Brent crude prices have been climbing towards the $65/barrel mark over the past 12 months. It is also impossible to address the offshore market without referring to the Airbus Helicopters H225. Once part of a heavy helicopter duopoly, the Super Puma remains largely persona non grata on the back of a 2016 fatal crash. Grounding orders have been lifted, but the industry remains reluctant to press it back into service. And without wishing to sound flippant or complacent, at least there were no significant accidents in 2017: the previous two years had seen the Norwegian H225 crash, plus losses of Bell Helicopter 525 and Leonardo Helicopters AW609 prototypes. NOW, LET\' S SAVE THE WORLD Flying around the world on solar power alone was a good trick that squeezed every ounce of performance out of materials, propulsion and battery technology to quite rightly make headlines in 2016 \- but it was never the endgame for the Solar Impulse project. During the COP-23 As project leader Bertrand Piccard puts it: "We need to embrace clean technologies and efficient solutions, because they are much more than 'ecological', they are 'logical'. They create jobs and generate profit, while also reducing CO2 emissions and preserving natural resources. Even if climate change didn't exist, they would make sense. Clean growth is much better than the dirty status quo we have today." CORPORATE ACTIVITY There was much to note in mergers and acquisitions in 2017. In September, Northrop Grumman lined up a $9.2 billion takeover of space and missile specialist Orbital ATK \- itself a 2015 conjunction of space and rockets company Orbital Sciences with ATK, the maker of solid fuel propulsion systems, aerostructures and ammunition (the latter was spun off on completion). The deal, expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, would deepen Northrop's portfolio of large space systems with Orbital ATK's focus on small launchers and satellites, as well as the latter's terrestrial rocket and missile technology, including the AGM-88 advanced anti-radiation guided missile. As part of Northrop, Orbital ATK would function initially as a fourth business sector, alongside Aerospace Systems, Mission Systems and Technical Services. Also noteworthy was Boeing\' s deal, announced in October, to buy Aurora Flight Sciences, founded in 1989 by John Langford, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist behind the Daedalus human-powered aircraft project, which still holds the world HPA distance record. Since then, Aurora has been a notable innovator in lightweight structures and, more recently, autonomous systems. As Boeing chief technology officer Greg Hyslop puts it: "The aerospace industry is going to be changing as we move into the future. There is a lot of attention around drones, unmanned and autonomous vehicles. Aurora has been an industry leader in these technology areas, so this positions us well for whatever that future might be in the aerospace industry." Perhaps less exotic, but certainly earth-shaking in aerospace supply chain terms, are two deals focused on aircraft interiors. In April, Rockwell Collins completed its buyout of B/E Aerospace. In a Franco-French tie-up, Safran has spent much of the year running rules over cabin supplier Zodiac. Prospects for that deal closing hit a rocky patch when Zodiac's first-half results kicked off a spate of bad news, with the company struggling to maintain quality, cost and schedules for contracted deliveries to Airbus A350 and Bombardier CSeries assembly lines. Terms have yet to be finalised, but Safran, which values the deal at 9.7 billion ($11.5 billion), still sees the sense of expanding into cabins, to bolster the aircraft equipment side of a group that sees nearly two-thirds of its revenue from engines. But the big buyout story of the year is United Technologies moving to consume Rockwell Collins. Unveiled in September, the $30 billion cash and shares deal would, if approved, cement UTC's place as one of the world\' s largest aerospace suppliers. UTC boss Greg Hayes likes the sound of that: "Together, Rockwell Collins and UTC Aerospace Systems will enhance customer value in a rapidly evolving aerospace industry by making aircraft more intelligent and more connected." Pratt & Whitney parent UTC is no stranger to corporate activity; this move comes a couple years on from its $9 billion sale of Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin, and follows its 2012 purchase of Goodrich, a deal worth nearly $19 billion that was the biggest ever in aerospace at the time; Goodrich was combined with UTC\' s Hamilton Sundstrand unit to create United Technologies Aerospace Systems. And, added Hayes, Collins is probably not the end; once "leverage" is back to "historic levels, we will have an opportunity to explore a full range of strategic options". CUMMINGS AND GOINGS But GKN abruptly changed its mind in mid-November, following a profit warning and revelations that as much as \£3130 million ($173 million) would have to be written off owing to "issues" in Alabama. So, Cummings left the Board and GKN with immediate effect. Former Fokker chief executive Hans Buthker stepped up to drive aerospace and non-executive director Anne Stevens was lined up as an interim replacement for Stein, who retires on 31 December. ENDERS THE ROAD? At Airbus, meanwhile, a cloud has formed over chief executive Tom Enders. With the company facing ongoing investigation by the UK Serious Fraud Office and France's Parquet National Financier over allegations of improper use of third-party consultants in commercial aircraft deals, October saw it alert US authorities about "certain inaccuracies" made in filings with the US State Department that cover commissions and political contributions in international arms exports. Enders himself, formerly head of the Airbus (then EADS) defence business, is a target of an Austrian inquiry into the country\' s purchase of Eurofighters. Under Enders' stewardship, Airbus has been transformed, and he can rightly be regarded as a titan of European industry. As a political creation formed by combining French and German aerospace champions in a successful bid to build a European rival to Boeing, governance made Airbus perhaps by necessity a cumbersome beast \- but now it is a reasonably normal corporation. Gone are the days when management was tugged to and fro by controlling shareholders Paris and Berlin, when work was divvied up by politicians and when key positions \- chief executive among them \- were held simultaneously by French and German appointees. Airbus shares are, mostly, freely traded on exchanges. And Enders is the sole boss with his desk in a single headquarters, in Toulouse. But the weight of allegations bearing on Airbus has some close to the company now doubting that he will be reappointed when his remit ends in 2019. Some even doubt he will remain in office that long. A400M IN A FIX It is just as well the Airbus Defence & Space A400M tactical transport is a military aircraft. It seems to be forever under fire. Fire, that is, from a string of technical problems that have dogged the programme both in the run-up to its much-delayed 2009 maiden flight and in subsequent years. Much of that trouble has been engine-related. The Europrop International (EPI) consortium has delivered the Western world\' s most powerful turboprop ever, in the form of the TP400-D6, but such performance has not been easily achieved. The latest problem involves the Avio Aero-supplied propeller gearbox, which has in some cases been undermined by vibration. An interim solution has been retrofitted, but approval for a permanent fix to reduce vibration and "reinforce endurance and reliability" will not come until the new year. Delays, to deliveries and full performance, have been expensive. Indeed, Airbus incurred a fresh charge of 80 million against the programme in the third quarter of this year; the company remains in discussion with its European customers over terms. But despite its ongoing challenges, the A400M has at least enjoyed some positive headlines, including delivery of a 50th production example \- to the Luftwaffe on 29 September \- and the in-service fleet having passed a combined 100,000h of engine operating time. Those first 50 A400Ms were delivered to six nations: the UK (16), Germany (13), France (11), Turkey (five), Malaysia (four) and Spain (one). A further two examples were handed over during October, including a second for Madrid. AT PROOF STAGE UPDATE HERE. The company's order backlog for the type now stands at 122 units, with additional recipients to include Belgium and Luxembourg. FAREWELL, JUMBO Delta Air Lines announced it would fly the last Boeing 747 international service, for a US carrier, at least, on 17 December, from Seoul to Detroit. After that, the aircraft mounts a tour linking Detroit, Seattle, Atlanta and Minneapolis/St Paul, all hubs of Northwest Airlines hubs, which merged with Delta in 2009. Aviation Images/REX/Shutterstock A "handful" of sports team and other charters round out the year before a final flight \- to storage in the Arizona desert in early January 2018. So, farewell 747, after 47 years of scheduled service in the USA. United Airlines, the only other US 747 operator, retired its last of the type earlier in November. \</doc>

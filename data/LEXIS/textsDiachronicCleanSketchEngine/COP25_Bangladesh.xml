Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) on climate advocacy networks on Tuesday sought an effective role of the government in the upcoming the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) scheduled to be held in Madrid of Spain in December. They made the remarks at a press conference at the Jatiya Press Club. The speakers suggested that the government lead a separate mechanism for Displacement and Migration at United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). They also recommended raising voice to ensure easier financial access to Green Climate Fund (GCF) as the most vulnerable country (MVC). In the keynote presentation, Syed Aminul Hoque from EquityBD insisted that developed countries increase their mitigation action target based on latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on reducing global warming. He also suggested developing the framework on implementing market based mechanism on 'Mitigation Outcome International Transfer' (Article 6 of PA) under UNFCCC process and followed by accountability, Transparency principle. Md Ziaul Hoque Mukta of Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihood (CSRL), Md Mostafa Kamal Akand of COAST Trust, Md Shamsuddoha from Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD), Kawser Rahman of Bangladesh Climate Journalist Forum (BCJF) and Md Badrul Alam of Krishak Federation and Atiqur Rahaman Tipu of Coastal Development Partnership also spoke at the briefing. \</doc>

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will leave Dhaka for Madrid today on a three-day official visit to Spain to join the "Heads of State and Government Summit" of the 25th Annual Conference of Parties ( COP25 ). COP25 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be held on December 2-13 in Madrid under the Presidency of Chile and with logistical support from Spain. A Biman Bangladesh Airlines special flight carrying the premier and her entourage members will take off from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) for Madrid today morning. The flight is scheduled to land at Madrid Torrejon Airport at 5:40pm (local time). Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the World Tourism Organization Hassan Mahmood Khandker will receive the prime minister at the airport. After the reception at the airport, a ceremonial motorcade will escort the prime minister to Hotel Villa Magna in Madrid where she will be staying during her visit to Spain. On Monday morning, the prime minister will attend the inaugural ceremony of the COP25 at Feria de Madrid, the largest exhibition complex in Spain and one of the most important venues in Europe. Later, she will join the Working Session of the COP25 and hold a bilateral meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Sheikh Hasina will attend the official luncheon and will again join the Working Session in the afternoon. She is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Spanish President Pedro Sanchez. The prime minister will join a reception to be hosted by the King and the Queen of Spain at Royal Palace on Monday evening. Wrapping up her three-day tour, Sheikh Hasina will depart from Madrid for Dhaka by a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight at 9am on Tuesday (local time). The flight is scheduled to land at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport (HSIA) here at 12:40am on Wednesday. The 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP25 , will incorporate the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the 15th meeting of the parties for the Kyoto Protocol (CMP15), and the second meeting of the parties for the Paris Agreement (CMA2). The President-Designate for the conference is Ms. Carolina Schmidt Zaldivar, Minister of Environment of Chile. The conference is designed to take the next crucial steps in the UN climate change process. Following agreement on the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement at COP 24 in Poland last year, a key objective is to complete several matters with respect to the full operationalization of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. The conference was planned to be held in Brazil in November 2019, but a year before its planned start, newly-elected President Jair Bolsonaro withdrew the offer to host the event, citing economic reason. Then Chile stepped up and became the new host, but social unrest in the lead up to the meeting forced it late October 2019 to withdraw from hosting. Then by mutual agreement between the UN, Chile, and Spain, the latter became the new host. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 22 -- After a disappointing 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , there is a need to restore confidence that the intergovernmental process can deliver on mitigation, adaptation, and finance. The 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP25 , that recently concluded in Madrid, was expected to put in place the final piece of the rulebook for the historic Paris Agreement, which was designed to address greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. The meeting also was meant to set the stage for enhanced pledges by countries in 2020 to work toward keeping global temperature increase below 2.0 degrees centigrade, preferably 1.5 degrees. Instead, the world witnessed a prolonging of the negotiation process, and an unwillingness to compromise for the greater good. The current pledges by countries, as inscribed in their climate pledges, also called nationally determined contributions or NDCs, have set us on the path to a temperature increase of 3.2 degrees in this century. The world is already witnessing the impact of 1.1-degree centigrade temperature above pre-industrial levels. The recurring droughts and floods in some regions, as well as increased intensity and frequency of extreme events, foreshadows apocalyptic events that we may witness as a result of climate change. To meet the goal of no more than 1.5-degree centigrade temperature rise, current emissions have to be halved by 2030. The reluctance to commit to higher ambition and action is driven by economic and political considerations, as well as social upheavals. Perhaps the ambiguity in action stems from 1992, when the UN Climate Convention was labelled as a framework, a high-level umbrella document with principles and overarching objectives that signaled political will for action, with room for maneuvering at a later stage to reach a consensus on detailed actions. This gave countries the flexibility to develop national policies and action plans based on common but differentiated responsibilities. This arrangement has enabled learning and evaluations and subsequent ratchetting up of action. But it has also left space for uncertainty as circumstances change in countries amid shifting power and trade dynamics and relationships. At COP25 Consequently, proposals relating to transitioning to new carbon markets floundered with one group of countries rightfully insistent on ensuring environmental integrity. Associated with this was the direction of shares of proceeds from the cooperative approaches under the new markets that would ensure automatic funding for the Adaptation Fund. On the other hand, the group of vulnerable countries that have borne the brunt of climate impacts were seeking a mechanism to compensate them for these losses and damages. The issue of compensation has been an impasse for many years now, and the compromise yet to be negotiated. The elephant in the room is the financing of action in developing countries and the target of $100 billion in financial flows from developed to developing countries by 2020 that was agreed at COP15. The OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) estimates that climate finance provided and mobilised by developed countries for developing countries in 2017 reached a little over $71 billion. But what developing countries want at this stage is an early assurance that, as agreed in Paris, a new financing commitment will be agreed to by 2025. So far, there have been no concrete signals that this will happen. The upcoming presidency of COP26 by the United Kingdom will have to untie the proverbial Gordian Knot of the negotiations. Future commitments to financing, as expected, would hold the key to encouraging deeper and wider action. Facilitating a dialogue within the Group of 77 and People's Republic of China grouping on how to narrow the divergent interests in this bloc is needed. On one side will be the big emitters, and on the other the small island developing states, least developed countries, and other vulnerable countries. The Article 6 conundrum will need to be resolved through a more nuanced and perhaps staged approach. A lot will ride on the United Kingdom's leadership in the coming year to coalesce and converge diverse interests on the intractable issues. The most important objective will be to restore confidence that the intergovernmental process can deliver. Failure is not an option at COP26.

Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) on Tuesday expressed deep concern as the United Nation climate conference ( COP-25 ) failed to make any significant progress to resolve the global problem. The UN Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) took place under the presidency of Chilean government at Madrid in Spain from December 2 to December 13. The developed countries pledged to provide additional $ 100 billion on adaptation in 2020 which never came on the discussion table of COP25 , creating uncertainty about its long term funding, said TIB Executive Director Dr Iftekharuzzaman. No decision was made over forming separate fund for facing the loss and damage, he said, adding that the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) was also not updated to reduce the global temperature, said a press release. Overall, the draft of the Paris Agreement (Rule Book) which was approved in COP24 failed to get finalisation in this year's conference, the TIB chief added. Every stakeholder had hoped that a decision will come on separate compensation fund under Warsaw International Mechanism and its regulation, work plan, and challenges will be identified in the conference, he said. 'But that never happened.' \</doc>

Terming the outcomes of COP25 frustrating, civil society members at a press conference in the city on Saturday said it served the interests of the polluters. The civil society members came up with the observation at a press conference titled 'Madrid Climate Conference and Civil Society Observations' moderated by executive director of of COAST Trust M Rezaul Karim Chowdhury. COP25 lost the trust of MVCs (Most Vulnerable Country) and LDCs (Least Developed Countries). They opined that the government needs to set its climate change strategies (especially Adaptation Strategies) with own capacity and resources. Syed Aminul Hoque, deputy director of COAST Trust, in his key note presentation said the negotiation in COP25 in Madrid ended amid disappointment as most of the important issues remained unsettled. Major emitters failed to come up with any plan to reduce Green House gasses by 2020 and broke their pledges over financing in Loss and Damage management as expected by MVCs and LDCs, he added. Executive director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) Dr Atiq Rahaman said the politics and fossil-fuel interests are taking place above people and the planet. The United States, Japan, Australia and Brazil once again exposed their unwillingness to save the millions of vulnerable people, he added. Executive Director of Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD) Md Shamsuddoh urged the government, educationists, experts and civil society members to take effective preparations through discussion for COP26 to be held in December 2020. \</doc>

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will attend the 25th UN Climate Change Conference to be held in Madrid, Spain next month. The 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) will convene from December 2-13, officials said adding that the Prime Minister is likely to be there in Madrid on a six-day visit. Earlier, Chile, citing the impact of the ongoing anti-government protests, announced that it was withdrawing as host of the upcoming COP25 annual climate summit. On the eve of COP25 , the German Embassy in Dhaka, in collaboration with the British High Commission, British Council and GIZ launched a photo exhibition under the theme 'Climate Change -Time for Action' on Wednesday. The exhibition will remain open until December 5. COP25 has been encouraged to stand out with ambitious demands and commitment at the conference, it said. Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin inaugurated the exhibition and also handed over the first prize to the winner of the photo competition. German Ambassador to Bangladesh Peter Fahrenholtz and the Charg\'e9 d' Affaires at British High Commission in Dhaka Kanbar Hosein Bor attended the function as special guests and handed over the prizes among other winners. Representatives from the government of Bangladesh, different diplomatic missions, UN missions and bilateral agencies, civil society, academia, news media and interested individuals from diverse background attended the event. Responding to a social media call for submission of photographs on the effects of climate change in the lives of people and the environment of Bangladesh many participants submitted their photographs. From the submissions 50 photos were chosen for the exhibition of which three won the prizes. A movie capturing stories of people moved to Dhaka from rural areas due to adverse impacts of climatic change was also shown during the exhibition. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Nov. 28 -- The 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 25 ) is scheduled be held in the Spanish capital Madrid on December 2-13, 2019. The Conference of the Parties (COP) within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention (UNFCCC) is a collective response of the international community to climate change. It is an Agreement of 196 countries and the European Union (EU) that establishes the basic obligations to stabilise greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent climate change. COP is the important annual international forum for taking stock of where the world stands as regards climate change and to discuss issues related to global warming caused by human activities. The COP 25 COP 25 is targeting to resolve some of the remaining issues on the rules that the participating countries (parties) are to follow in their efforts to reduce GHG emissions. The meeting may announce new initiatives to respond to global warming to try to advance a global strategy for tackling rising global atmospheric temperatures. Also, COP 25 is expected to reach a consensus on funding for repairing damage of the climate crisis. The funding issue is especially important for the climate vulnerable, least developed and the small island nations. The landmark Paris Climate Change Agreement (signed in 2015) is scheduled to enter into force in 2020. Therefore, COP 25 becomes the prelude to the major world event and a lot of expectations have been created. In the backdrop of the increasing natural disasters and dwindling bio-diversity, the mainstream political parties in most countries have been compelled to respond on 'unequivocal' public concerns over climate change and human sufferings from global warming. The latest example is the UK election manifesto of the major political parties participating in the election where they have supported a transition to net zero GHG emission within a few decades and are competing with each other on the policies to attain the target. Despite the 'Brexit' debates hanging over the country, UK members of parliament (House of Commons) have unanimously passed (on April 30, 2019) a motion to declare an 'environmental and climate emergency'. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbin, then leader of the opposition in parliament, tabled the motion and the House of Commons passed the bill. Earlier, parliaments of Scotland and Wales declared climate emergencies. Analysts consider that the approved nonbinding climate emergency motion in UK parliament was reached unanimously because thousands of people took to the streets for a sustained period of protests by a number of environmental groups, UK Student Climate Network, Friends of Earth and others including the school strikers led by Greta Thunberg. Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament) adopted a motion on November 13, 2019 declaring climate change and its fallout as 'planetary emergency'. The planetary emergency motion ahead of the upcoming COP 25 calls for the global community to act urgently and decisively in achieving the net zero (carbon) emissions well before 2050. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to attend COP 25 which would be a good forum to present the 'planetary emergency' resolution adopted in Bangladesh Jatiya Sangsad and share views with the world community on how best the emergency can be addressed. The COP 25 forum may serve as an opportunity to discuss the issues related to 'planetary emergency' and help formulate plans and get support from the global community on implementing such plans. As Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable hotspots for global climate change, it expects the global community to act urgently, decisively and with considerably higher ambition in achieving net zero emission well before 2050, capping temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius. Despite being least responsible for these problems, Bangladesh and many other countries in the developing world became the worst victims of climate change. The planetary emergency connects with the existential crisis of climate change, devastating impact of disasters and increase in extreme weather events, irreparable loss of biodiversity, looming food insecurity, rising water level, unprecedented pressure on oceans and unsustainable use of resources. The resolution calls for planetary justice and climate equity so that the climate vulnerable countries are assisted with finance and technology to meet their development aspirations in the shortest possible time.

Dhaka, Jan. 5 -- Bangladesh needs to build self-capacity for combating climate change. Our duty is to implement the Paris Agreement in the latest COP25 conference to reach any consensus on ways, civil society members said. The alternatives can be reached through future development strategies and gaining competency to combat climate change, they said at a press conference in the Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) of the capital on Saturday. Coast Trust, in association with several other organisations, organised the press meet titled ' COP25 Climate Conference and the Observation of Civil Society'. In the COP21 in Paris in 2015, nearly 200 nations signed the climate deal in which each country provides its own goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that lead to climate change. On December 2-13 last year, the longest 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as COP25 , was held aiming to finalise the "rulebook" of the Paris Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020 - by settling on rules for carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation. Due to discontent between the developed economies and the least developed countries, however, the talks were unable to reach agreement in many areas, pushing decisions into COP26 scheduled to be held next year in Glasgow, UK. In this context, speakers at the conference stressed for planning alternative strategies to continue and strengthening ongoing climate action plan for Bangladesh, and placed some recommendations in this regard. Hence, Bangladesh has to choose alternative ways of its own to combat climate change, they added. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The COP25 , the UNFCCC managed Conference of Parties, would now be held from 2-13 December 2019 in Madrid, Spain. Originally planned to be held in Chile, but it was cancelled on 30 October 2019 as the government of Chile expressed their inability to host the conference due to political instability. Following withdrawal of major polluter USA from the KYOTO protocol, apprehensions have been triggered world over about the future and ultimate success of the endeavors of the world committee of nations for effectively combatting the climate change from emissions. The Green Development Fund (GDF) received not enough contributions from the major polluting countries. Climate vulnerable countries are struggling. Continued melting of glaciers, rising of sea level, frequent incidents of cyclones, tidal bores, tsunamis, earthquakes, draughts, excessive rainfalls, severe winter continue devastating the communities across the world. In the backdrop of above, the world community will look towards the discussions, debates and meeting of minds of major players in COP25 about the future of climate change control and management. The 15th session of COP reached the famous Kyoto Protocol (COP15) . The CMA2 served as the meeting of Paris Agreement and the 51st sessions of the Subsidiary Body of Implementation (SBI15) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 51) concluded with critical matters still to be resolved and agreed. At the concluding session of COP24, Chile has been selected as the venue for COP25 . COP25 . It also discussed about Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) and unresolved issues of COP24. There will be few more pre- COP25 meeting. On November 29-30 the second meeting of the Katowice Committee of Experts on impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures (KCI), on November 28-30 the second meeting of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP) will be held. On December 1, 2019 the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM) would review the events. The Climate Conference 2019 will be informed the outcomes of other meetings, the UN Climate Action Summit, held in New York, US in September 2019, three Regional Climate Weeks: Africa Climate Week held in March 2019, Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Climate Week held in August 2019, and Asia Pacific Climate Week held in September 2019. The highlights of events of COP25 would include the high level part of Pre2020 stocktaking and a Global Climate Action (GCA) High-Level Event on 11 December 2019. UNFCC presidency would also convene:  Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Roundtable on 7 December.  A Ministerial Dialogue on Adaptation on 10 December.  A High Level Event on Forests on 5 December The Presidency will convene, inter alia:  A Ministerial Dialogue on Adaptation on 10 December;  A Panel on Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Ambition on 6 December; and  A High Level Event on Forests on 5 December. A Platform for Science Based Ocean Solution ( PSBOS) and Platform of Latin American and Caribbean Agricultural Climate Action (PLACA) would also be launched on 3 and 5 December respectively. The Presidency will also launch the Platform for Science-Based Ocean Solutions (PSBOS) and the Platform of Latin American and Caribbean Agriculture Climate Action (PLACA) on 3 and 5 December, respectively. Other important events that would take place during COP include roundtable on agriculture - food chain, SDG 14 ( Life below water) and SDG 15 ( Life on Land) , circular economy in cities and buildings, circular economy in packaging and business models, resilience, and SDG6 ( clean water and sanitation) and SDG7 (affordable and clean energy). Action events will convene on industry, water, land use, ocean and coastal zones, energy, transport and human settlements. The SBSTA and IPCC will hold joint special events on SROCC and Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL). Every time the Conference of Parties (COP) generates huge expectations. Vulnerable community especially in the least developed and developing countries honestly desire positive development and meaningful agreements. Unfortunately, all the high sounding agenda and topics of discussion end with very few outcomes achieved. Trust COP25 will be different and unique. We have one world and we all have religious responsibility to protect and preserve by actions not words. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Jan. 5 -- Climate advocacy networks criticised the outcome of COP25 as negotiation for the vulnerable countries to fight climate change effects was frustrating at the UN climate conference in Madrid of Spain. The civil society climate advocacy networks observed that the COP25 failed to gain trust of the MVCs (Most Vulnerable Countries) and LDCs (Least Developed Countries); rather they worked to serve the polluters' interest. Their observations came at a press conference on Saturday titled "Madrid Climate Conference and Civil Society's Observations" moderated by M Rezaul Karim Chowdhury of COAST Trust and Equity BD. Besides, they made recommendations to the Bangladesh government to lead the CVF (Climate Vulnerable Forum) in the next climate conference in Glasgow in December this year, as the Bangladesh Prime Minister has been elected 'chair' of the CVF recently. They also opined that the government needs to set the climate change strategies (Especially adaptation strategies) with its own capacity and resources. In the keynote presentation, Aminul Hoque from COAST Trust said the negotiation in COP25 was the longest in history, but ended with a deadlock and disappointment over most of the important issues. The major co2 emitters broke their promises for long term financing to fight climate change impacts that was much expected by MVCs and LDCs. Furthermore, finalisation of the Paris agreement Rulebook was yet to be completed, he added. Dr Atiq Rahaman of BCAS (Bangladesh Centre for Advance Study) said politics and fossil-fuel interests are taking place above people and the planet. These, mainly played by the United States, Japan, Australia and Brazil, once again exposed their lack of goodwill to save the vulnerable. Md Ziaul Hoque Mukta from CSRL (Campaign for Sustainable Rural Livelihood) said, "Due to connivance between some rich and advance developing countries, we have loosed the CBDR (Common but Differentiated Responsibilities) principle in Paris Agreement (PA) which has weakened the negotiation capacity of the MVCs.

Leader of Bangladesh delegation, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin will speak for the country during the minister-level high level segment scheduled to kick off on Tuesday at COP25 - this year's edition of the UN's annual conference on climate change. The 2-day high level segment from December 10-11 will be attended by ministers from 200 countries, said Abdullah Al Mohsin Chowdhury, Secretary of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and coordinator of the Bangladesh delegation. Mentioning that the discussion of the negotiation teams will conclude today, the secretary said that decisions will be taken at the politically high level segment on issues that were agreed upon as well as those that failed to yield a consensus. 'Discussions were held on technical, financial subjects and loss damage for the past few days. Good progress was made during the discussion on finance and loss damage and decisions on these subjects will be taken during the high level segment of the COP25 Conference,' he explained. 'Through political dialogue, decisions will be taken based on consensus on all the subjects discussed till now at the conference at the high level segment,' the secretary added. SM Munjurul Hannan Khan, Additional Secretary of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and a member of the Bangladesh delegation told UNB that all the affected countries including Bangladesh want to formulate the implementation strategy of loss damage according to the decision taken at Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), something which has not been done yet. 'We, the affected countries are negotiating on the funds we ought to receive and discussion on this regard will take place at the high level segment,' he said. He explained that a solution has not been reached on the addition of Article 6 according to the rule book of Paris Agreement. 'The negotiation team has not reached a consensus yet. We hope it will be discussed at the high level segment and then we can say what decision has been taken.' Md Mohsin, Additional Secretary of Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief and a member of the Bangladesh delegation told UNB that Bangladesh is at the top of the most affected countries and suffers from natural disasters like hurricanes, droughts due to climate change. Mentioning the recent devastation caused by hurricane 'Bulbul', he said such natural disasters were caused by climate change. 'We are talking about receiving assistance from developed countries on facing disasters and building sustainable accommodation at the negotiations,' he stated. 'Primarily, we are seeking assistance so we can develop the capability to co-exist with natural disasters. Furthermore, the affected countries including Bangladesh want to be compensated for loss and damage according to the Paris Agreement after the extent of damage has been determined,' he added. COP25 is this year's Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, which is tasked with making sure that the Convention (and now the 2015 Paris Agreement, which strengthens the Convention), are being implemented. \</doc>

P#42#P After three days of panels, high-level discussions and exchanging best practices for climate action, PreCOP25 in San Jos\'e9 concluded recently with calls for more climate ambition. The gathering, from 8 to 10 October, saw more than 1,500 attendees, with delegates representing more than 90 countries and more than 60 parallel events with 264 panelists on topics ranging from blue carbon to electric mobility. The event put an additional emphasis on climate finance and the gender agenda as transformational focus areas of climate solutions. 'We are honored to be part of this effort. Climate action is the most important cause of our generation and is therefore worth it. If there is a time to be useful for others, it is now,' said the president of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, whose country promised to make an unconventional PreCOP. The gathering provided fresh impetus on the road towards the 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to be held in Santiago, Chile this December. There, more countries, cities, companies and local governments are expected to increase ambition and present new goals. Current national climate action plans under the Paris Agreement put the world on a path towards global warming of 3\'b0 Celsius, so ambition needs to be urgently raised. Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: 'It has been hugely encouraging to hear everyone at PreCOP25 talking about the need to raise ambition on climate action. Governments and all stakeholders have heard the message of young people to protect their futures loud and clear, along with the message of science which states that time is running out and we have only a very narrow window of opportunity to act.' 'At COP25 in December, we are looking forward to more governments, and also more cities, regions and businesses announcing action plans that are in line with science and respond to the calls for increased action,' he added. \</doc>

Negotiations are underway between teams of different developing countries including Bangladesh demanding more funds besides the US$100 billion committed by developed countries to the Green Climate Fund every year. Developing countries, including Bangladesh, expect developed countries to raise their contribution to the Green Climate Fund, according to the team representing Bangladesh. But this comes at a time when the countries have not even fulfilled their pledge to contribute the $100 billion a year yet. The team also said that the developed countries were involved in long-term financing where they pledged to contribute US$ 100 billion to the Green Climate Fund every year from which Bangladesh used to receive its share as a developing country. Negotiation teams of different countries are discussing that the developed countries are proposing to withhold this money, but they were supposed to pay US$ 100 billion every year till 2030. The developed countries have proposed not paying the money from various discussions since the Paris Agreement does not mention the procedure of payment. Rejecting this proposal, the developing countries are claiming more money besides the US$ 100 billion for the climate fund. Ziaul Haque, a member of the Bangladesh government delegation and coordinator of LDC group told UNB that discussions are underway to include Article 6 in the rule book created under the Paris Agreement as the primary purpose of COP25 . COP25 ). 'US$ 100 billion was supposed to be mobilized and distributed as the financial target for 2020. Through discussion, it will be found out how much of it was contributed by the developed countries,' he said. 'The affected countries including Bangladesh are claiming to further increase the fund by US$ 100 billion. There are 39 developed and 140 developing countries at present,' he added. He mentioned that discussions were held on Saturday, the last day of the first week of the world climate conference on increasing the reduction rate of carbon emissions, adding that 39 developed countries in the world are emitting 45 percent of carbon. 'There is no alternative to reducing carbon emissions if we want to save the world. A decision has to be reached on reducing carbon emissions according to Article 6 of Paris Treaty. Negotiations are going on in this regard,' he explained. Abdullah Al Mohsin Chowdhury, leader of the Bangladesh delegation said 15 to 20 agendas are being discussed in this summit and there are 4/5 main agendas. 'Discussion on the main agendas like losses damage, addition of Article 6 to the rule book under the Paris Agreement, implementing the Paris Agreement, financier's target, reduction of carbon emissions and other subjects are going on,' he said. 'We all have to reach a consensus if the developed countries are to meet the demands of every developing country including Bangladesh. If there is no consensus on any issue then no decision is reached,' he explained. 'We are putting pressure on developed countries through these discussions,' he added. COP25 began in Madrid on December 2 and will conclude on December 13. \</doc>

Mentioning that the adverse impacts of climate change will continue to strongly challenge lives and livelihoods, Environment, Forests and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin on Tuesday called for drastic actions on adaptation. 'The climate crisis is an existential threat to many of us, and Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world. The adverse impacts of climate change would continue to challenge our lives and livelihoods severely unless we come up with drastic adaptation actions,' he said. The minister came up with the remarks while speaking at the ministerial high-level segment at the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) here. He said Bangladesh has prepared the Delta Plan 2100 to address the adverse impacts of climate change through adaptive delta management. 'It (Delta Plan) is a long-term strategy to implement action for sustainable delta development in Bangladesh. It'll also assist us to address the adverse impacts of climate change through adaptive delta management,' he said. Working closely with stakeholders, Bangladesh hopes to harness international best practices and finance to ensure its successful implementation, the minister said, adding that in the year of action, Dhaka will be able to contribute substantially to the global actions to deal with the climate crisis. 'We stand ready to contribute to global adaptation actions building on our experiences,' he said. In Bangladesh, resilience building and adaptation are at the heart of development efforts and the government has invested heavily for improved agriculture, coastal zone management, resilient infrastructure and water and land management, he said. Bangladesh has shown how a strong early warning system and a coordinated approach in disaster management can make a big difference and Scaled-up disaster response has included cyclone shelters , building civic awareness, and improving post-disaster recovery, he added. 'The frequency of disasters has increased but we've been able to reduce the loss of lives from hundreds of thousands a few years back to almost zero now.' The two-day high-level segment from December 10-11 will be attended by ministers from 200 countries. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Nov. 28 -- Prime Minister (PM) Sheikh Hasina will urge the international community to strongly consider the issue of climate financing in the upcoming 25th session of the Conference of Parties (COP) in Madrid. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said this on Wednesday while briefing the press on the PM's visit to Spain for attending the COP25 meeting. "The Prime Minister will focus on the 'loss and damage ' issue and urge the global leadership to provide compensation to the affected countries through climate financing in line with the mandate given by the Warsaw International Mechanism," Dr Momen said. He mentioned that the ideas of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina regarding mitigation and adaptation of climate change were appreciated globally in the past. She will also brief the world leaders about the steps taken by the Bangladesh government in addressing the challenges of the climate change. The meeting of the heads of the state and the government on climate change dubbed as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will be held in Madrid on December 2. The Prime Minister will leave Dhaka to attend the summit on December 01 and will start for home on December 03. During the visit the Prime Minister will hold bilateral meeting with the President of Spain, Mr Pedro Sanchez. Spain is a key destination of Bangladeshi exports in Europe and an important development partner. So this meeting will help strengthening the ties between the two countries, Dr Momen felt. The Prime Minister will also hold a meeting with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Foreign Direct Investment and Delta Plan 2100 will be the main issues of the meeting, the FM who will also accompany the Prime Minister, said.

Bangladesh, Nov. 26 -- Experts have suggested proper negotiation in the global platforms especially ahead of COP25 in order to avail global fund to effectively deal with the local climate change impacts. Besides, they also advocated for a joint move of the vulnerable countries' group, from the least developed category, in those global tables to make the developed countries understand the real scenarios of the climate impacts. Despite emitting less global greenhouse gas, Bangladesh is facing the worst effects of climate change, which takes a heavy toll on the coastal residents. Dr Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), told the FE the coastal region of Bangladesh is most vulnerable and the projection with climate change scenario is that 10 million people, possibility more than that, will lose their livelihood and be forced to leave their land within the next 10 to 20 years under the influence of climate change. Md Akkas, 67, who is among the 200 fishermen living in the village named 'Mathurapur Jelepolli'(fishermen village) in Shyamnagar upazila of Satkhira district close to Sundarbans, described to the FE how he became a victim of climate change. He has been living in Shyamnagar since 1972, and he is directly depended on Sundarbans for his livelihood. Now he works as a day labourer at the village and his two sons also work in brickfield as day labourers. After severe cyclonic storm Sidr hit the southwest coast of Bangladesh in November, 2007, his family moved to this place at Khas land beside the River Kholpetua from the west part of the village as the storm destroyed his homestead. Sidr caused $1.7 billion loss to the Sundarbans and clamed thousands of lives. And the latest cyclone, Bulbul, struck Bangladesh this month, damaging 4,500 trees in Sundarbans and killing at least 18 people. Deben, 47, another fisherman, narrated in a similar way as Md Akkas how he was forced to shift his dwelling house to a Khas land alongside the Kholpetua due to frequent onslaughts of cyclone and river erosion. And, the towns can absorb and attract half a million people each so that the 10 to 20 million people may leave the coastal area and not get into the Dhaka city and go to the specialised cities and get employment. Dr Haq, also a senior fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), said as a vulnerable country-for Bangladesh negotiation in the global platforms and with developed countries are most important especially in the COP25 . COP25 is scheduled to begin on December 2 in Spain this year. "Single move of Bangladesh could not bring significant outcome in global platforms. And to this effect, Bangladesh needs to move on along with its team, the least developed countries, in the global platforms to avail global climate fund," he said. On the other hand, Dr Saleelimul Haq observed there were some limitations and mismanagement in the local fund disbursement. He suggested that the government engage all stakeholders, experts and local victims in the process so that such mistakes do not occur again. Echoing Dr Haq, Uthpal Kumar, researcher at Water Systems and Global Change research group of Wageningen University, The Netherlands, emphasised conducting a necessary research to know how Bangladesh became a victim of global climate change effects. And, relevant research can help Bangladesh cope up with climate change and play important role in negotiating in global platforms for funding, he added. Regarding attainment of global funding, the deputy managing director (DMD) of Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF), Md. Mokhlesar Rahman Sarker, told the FE after failing to get substantial amount of fund from the developed countries, the government formed BCCTF to address the climate change issue with its own money in 2013. He said in last nine years the government has allocated Tk 38 billion (Tk 3800 crore) from its own revenue and a total of 650 projects have been taken during the period.

Scheduled to end on December 13, the COP25 Climate negotiations were extended by one day as representatives of 200 countries failed to reach any decision over issues related to damage, finance and Article 6. The final meeting of ministers on Saturday evening will ultimately decide the outcome of this climate summit. The President for the conference, Ms Carolina Schmidt, Minister of Environment of Chile, started the consultation meeting on Thursday evening and listened to the objections countries had on particular issues. During the meeting that lasted till Saturday morning, it was found out that almost all the countries had their objections on the three main issues of this climate conference, namely Article 6, loss damage and finance. If none of the countries raise any objections at the last minute on those decisions, the announcement might be made on the summary of results of this Madrid climate conference. After talking with the members of Bangladesh delegation, it was learnt that a decision may be reached on loss and damage, the main issue for the affected countries including Bangladesh at the climate summit. However, the decision will only be on making the Warsaw International Mechanism effective and the developed countries will not take any responsibility for damage due to climate change, members of Bangladesh delegation said. According to Md Ziaul Haque, Director, Department of Environment and a negotiator of the Bangladesh team, the three main agendas of this climate conference are loss and damage, finance and Article 6. 'Discussions on these issues are continuing till the last moment and ministers have been given the responsibility to reach a consensus. Issues that have not reached any consensus will be transferred to the next climate conference,' he explained. Md Ziaul Haque feels the biggest achievement of this climate conference will be in the context of loss and damage. 'We wanted the developed countries to pledge a specific amount of fund for long-term financing. But those countries have not agreed on a specific amount,' he added. \</doc>

P#44#P The COP25 Presidency announced additional commitments within the Climate Ambition Alliance. Chile's Minister of Environment Carolina Schmidt said 73 parties to the UNFCCC, 14 regions, 398 cities, 768 businesses and 16 investors are working to achieve netzero CO 2 emissions by 2050. The UN Secretary-General said he is 'deeply encouraged by the growth' in the Alliance, and major emitters will be a top priority between now and COP 26. The Chilean Presidency of the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) to the UNFCCC announced a renewed Climate Ambition Alliance, in which participating countries commit to accelerate action by 2020 and achieve net zero carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions by 2050. UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres asked Chile to lead the Climate Ambition Alliance in the context of government's role as the original host of COP25 . During the September 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, President of Chile Sebasti\'e1n Pi\'f1era launched the Alliance to accelerate the transformation needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and stabilize the global average temperature rise at 1.5\'b0C above preindustrial levels. In addition to 73 UNFCCC parties, 14 regions, 398 cities, 768 businesses and 16 investors are working to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Jan. 29 -- The recently held Madrid Climate Meeting marked 25 years of the Conference of the Parties (COP), a UN Framework Convention for Climate Change signed in 1992 by 165 signatory nations. Despite agreement that the planet Earth is facing a "climate emergency," the COP25 , which was billed as the Action COP, delayed any real climate action. Indeed, after the first few COPs that were constructive and hopeful, the fossil fuel producers such as the United States, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Brazil and Russia and the carbon-emitting countries captured the COP process. The apparent actions from the processes are more delays. The long-term goal of the Paris Agreement (COP2015) is to keep the increase in global average temperature well below 2 degree celsius above the pre-industrial level and to limit the increase to 1.5 degree celsius. This urgent action to combat climate change is intrinsically linked to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The spirit of the Paris Agreement is now slowly eroding from one COP to another. With no tangible action, the planned extractions of coal, oil and gas are enough to blow past the 1.5 degree celsius target or even 2.0 celsius by 2030. The harsh truth is that the world is getting increasingly warmer, and extreme weather events such as glacier meltdown, forest fires, flood, cyclones etc., are on the rise globally. The climate impacts and anxiety are felt by all, particularly the world's most vulnerable and innocent people being at the receiving end as victims. Island countries like the Maldives, Tuvalu and Kiribati are sinking due to rising sea level. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified Kiribati as one of the six Pacific Island countries most threatened by rising sea level, and thus would likely become uninhabitable as early as 2050. Rising sea level, drought and crop failure are expected to force tens of millions of people to migrate within their countries as "internal climate migrants" by 2050. A2018 World Bank study found that 143 million people across South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America are at risk of the effects of "slow-onset" of climate change. "Every day, climate change becomes a more urgent economic, social, and existential threat to countries and their people," observes World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva in her introduction to the 2018 Study. With the climate crisis worsening and the declaration of climate emergency by the climate scientists, the climate-anxiety - for instance, the fear of sea level rise, the horrific forest fires in Australia, displacement due to disasters, loss of homes and livelihoods, stress, helplessness, a sense of loss of control and the potential for a catastrophic future - has become prevalent beyond the physical world into mental health and well-being, according to a recent report issued by the American Psychological Association (APA). The report urges to address the core causes of and solutions for the changing climate, and building and supporting psychological resilience. In Bangladesh, climate-anxiety is very evident in physical, economic, social and existential terms. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in a recent statement in Parliament, said that some 40 million people from 70 upazilas and 19 districts of the country are at the risk of displacement due to climate change (recent revised estimates, however, put the figure between 15 and 20 million). The PM reiterated her commitments to fighting against climate disasters, giving vivid descriptions of the various impacts such as higher average temperature by one degree celsius in May and 0.5 degree celsius in November, increase in average rainfall and other weather events, outbreak of different insect-borne diseases, and increased salinity of river water up to 100 km from the coastline during summer threatening life and well-being of the people. The PM was also assertive in talking about various measures taken by the government, including the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, to increase the national capacity to combat the adverse impacts of climate change. She further demonstrated her fight against climate change at the Global Commission for Adaptation (GCA) held in Dhaka in July 2019 and called on world leaders for further efforts to raise awareness about climate change. The meeting was attended, among others, by GCA Chairman Ban Ki-moon and World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva. Bangladesh has earned reputation for its adaptive climate strategies. However, the government's current approach to coal-fired power generation hurts the environment as it is carbon intensive and thus undermines the Prime Minister's commendable leadership in the global fight against climate change. It is important to realise that the stakes are high for Bangladesh. The national development goals and objectives must be embedded and linked to climate forces for achieving a resilient society. Further, the government should consider investing on climate-related research -- on displacement, livelihoods, and internal climate migration to develop a long-term strategy for resettlement and rehabilitation of the climate migrants in the country. In addition, in view of increasing climate-anxiety, we all can make small, earth-friendly decisions every day. As recommended by the APA report, small steps such as cut down on use of disposable plastic, use of alternative shopping bags, flying less, visiting local farm markets for foods, choosing more vegetable-based diet, choosing more eco-friendly cleaning products, and simply buying and consuming less by the rich and privileged in the society. If these habits are adopted by everyone in the world, it would make a huge difference creating a large macro change. Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who spoke at COP25 in Madrid said it right: "There is hope. I have seen it. But it does not come from governments or corporations. It comes from the people."

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday urged the international community to initiate discussions on creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of the people who got displaced due to climate change. 'We must appreciate that migration could be an effective adaptation strategy, as we focus on enhancing adaptation capacities of affected communities. Hence, relocation and protection of displaced persons need due focus in global discourse to ensure their protection. We need to commence discussions on creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of people displaced due to climate change,' she said. The Prime Minister made the call while addressing the Action for Survival: Vulnerable Nations COP25 She said it is widely accepted that the gravest effect of climate change may be on human migration. Extreme weather events are already displacing many more people than violent conflicts. Slow-onset events like sea-level rise and desertification get even lower global focus. 'We must work towards correcting this imbalance.' Pointing at the leaders of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Sheikh Hasina said, 'We now have a situation where the most vulnerable countries, which deserve the highest level of priority, are failing to access whatever support that is being realized.' She said creation of a new CVF and V20 Trust Fund and possibility of having a new Special Rapporteur on climate change would be a great success. Noting that CVF and V-20 are great examples of South-South and Triangular cooperation, she said, 'We want to further build on the current accomplishments. The time is now to act as we're at the most important crossroad of human history confronting possibly the gravest global challenge of our time.' She said climate change has now become an existential threat for every country, especially for the climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. With more than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar causing all sorts of environmental havocs, Bangladesh already has the firsthand experience of the worst kind of environmental calamity, she said. 'We must therefore establish a set of criteria to prioritize vulnerable countries based on their risks, impacts and lack of coping capacities. We also want to keep the climate change support and the regular development finance strictly separate,' she added. Hasina said major emitters show extreme reluctance on mitigation, which may wreck the international climate regime and put the climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh at the risk of peril. 'Hence, we shouldn't hesitate to demand accountability for inaction.' 'We're also looking towards the 2020 Climate Adaptation Summit in the Netherlands to strengthen our adaptation efforts. And Bangladesh is ready to take the responsibility of the Presidency of the Forum if the Members kindly agree to honour us with this task,' she said. The Prime Minister said climate change is a stark reality for the world. It has now caused irreversible damages to human life and environment, ecology and natural resources, she said. Since the Earth Summit in 1992, it has not been able to secure much progress in the reduction of greenhouse gases and their emission is still on the rise, she said adding that this trend is now unsustainable for the Earth. 'We, the vulnerable countries, suffer the most due to our limited coping capacities and specific geographical features. We're bearing the brunt of the damage though we made negligible or no contribution to the menace. This constitutes a serious injustice and must be acknowledged by the global community,' said the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, she said, the progress under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process is very slow and largely inadequate. There's still hardly any move to support nationally determined adaption initiatives undertaken especially by our vulnerable countries, the PM added. Different funds created for different purposes lack availability of the required capital, she pointed out. 'Often direct and easy access to funds and technology along with conditions and criteria seem to favour mostly the countries that already have acquired greater capacities,' Hasina told her audience. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine, Executive Secretary of UNFCCC Patricia Espinosa and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet Jeria, among others, spoke at the event. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 16 -- From the Editorial desk: Our columnist Muhammad Zamir's write-up on COP25 covers developments in climate negotiations up to Friday, December 13. BBC reports from Madrid on Sunday: "The longest United Nations climate talks on record have finally ended in Madrid with a compromise deal. Exhausted delegates reached agreement on the key question of increasing the global response to curbing carbon. All countries will need to put new climate pledges on the table by the time of the next major conference in Glasgow next year. Divisions over other questions - including carbon markets - were delayed until the next gathering. After two extra days and nights of negotiations, delegates finally agreed a deal that will see new, improved carbon cutting plans on the table by the time of the Glasgow conference next year." At the United Nations climate negotiations in Madrid have re-emerged old splits between rich polluters and developing nations over who should slash greenhouse gas emissions by how much, and how to pay the trillions needed to live in a climate-addled world. The specific aim of the Madrid negotiations was to finalise, if possible, the rulebook for the 2015 Paris climate accord, which enjoins nations to limit global temperature rises to "well below" two degrees Celsius. However this effort does not appear to have clearly succeeded. This failure in moving forward was denotated through a comment made by Spain's Minister for Energy and Climate change Teresa Ribera: "There are those that want to move quicker and those that want to hide behind things which aren't working, so as not to advance." The talks however received a shot in the arm on December 13 after the European Union (EU) pledged to make the bloc carbon-neutral by 2050. Nevertheless, this much-heralded decision was immediately undermined by the refusal of Poland-a major emitter-to sign on. This meeting in Madrid has however signalled the need to find least common denominators that would have to be agreed upon through frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November 2020. The seriousness of the existing situation pertaining to climate change, adaptation and mitigation measures was outlined through a comment made by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres - "the point of no return is no longer over the horizon". Speaking ahead of the meeting the Guterres also underlined that in view of the growing climate crisis the political leaders had to respond urgently. This was reiterated through the comment: "...in the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions". The world has watched with concern the deleterious effects of climate change over the last two years. We have seen floods, landslides, drought and cyclones affecting countries in Africa, the Carribean, Latin America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Hundreds have been killed and nearly 50 million people in different countries have been affected. This has resulted in destruction of infrastructure, communication network, habitation and also created severe food insecurity. In this perspective, world attention was drawn to several important reports published about the effects of climate change before and during COP25 . It was revealed in the Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) 2020, which analysed data from 1999 to 2018, that Bangladesh is seventh among the 10 countries worst hit by extreme weather. The Report apparently looked at four indicators - death toll, number of events, loss of property and loss of gross domestic product (GDP). According to this survey the total loss suffered between 1999 and 2018 amounted to around US$ 3.54 trillion. The Report also stated that Japan, the Philippines and Germany were the most affected countries last year followed by Madagascar, India and Sri Lanka. In its own way the Report indicated that there is no longer any room for complacency because the intensity and frequency of climate events are becoming unpredictable. It was also clear that all nations need to concentrate on capacity building for the future. Discussion during the Madrid Conference led to one least common denominator - impacts from extreme weather events will hit the poorest countries hardest as they are particularly vulnerable from different dimensions and also because they not only have a lower coping capacity but also they need more time to rebuild and recover. The risk index was prepared by using the database of the NatCatSERVICE with the cooperation of the reinsurance company Munich Re and socioeconomic data available with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). There was another interesting revelation from another source. The Global Carbon Project indicated that CO2 emissions were on course to rise 0.6 per cent this year - relatively slower than expected. However, global carbon emissions have been boosted by soaring natural gas use and this has hit record levels in 2019. This has happened despite a decline in coal consumption. BANGLADESH CASE: It was a Conference with significant denotations and connotations. Consequently, it was very important that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina could attend the meeting in Madrid and reiterate her concern and anxiety over the possible after-effects of the evolving climate variability dynamics. She was able to effectively convey to the participants the different dimensions of this issue and how Bangladesh, seriously affected by climate change due to extraneous elements, was trying to overcome the growing challenges. She asked the global community to take the responsibility for climate migrants as they would be forced to leave their homes and seek new places of habitation for no fault of their own. In this context she correctly mentioned -"as our people will be displaced for no fault of ours...we expect the international community to shoulder the responsibility of accommodating them and providing them with livelihood". She also underlined that all funds to fight climate change must be replenished as per agreement, including the $100 billion annual contribution. The Prime Minister mentioned that the Paris Agreement recognises the special circumstances and needs of the least developed countries (LDCs) and "Particularly Vulnerable Countries" based on the principle of the "common but differentiated responsibility", and this recognition must be adhered to in every delivery mechanism of the climate finance. She noted that Bangladesh, a firm believer of collective efforts and understanding to fight climate change believed that the UN is the most appropriate platform for this purpose. She drew the attention of the participants not only to the principle of "Loss and Damage" within this equation but also urged all to agree to this principle featuring prominently in all negotiations. She also mentioned that the Warsaw International Mechanism must be given a much stronger mandate to explore financing losses and damages through its review. Within this paradigm, she warned that there was a limit to resilience and adaptation and every country needed to stop the increase of global temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius more than the pre-industrial level. The Prime Minister said that climate change had now become an existential threat for climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh which was fighting the battle on two fronts - firstly, mitigation measures to reduce and eventually reach zero emission in future and secondly, undertaking implementation of adaptation measures in areas where irreparable damage has taken place. Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina pointed out, was the largest delta in the world, and also the worst-affected country because of adverse impacts of climate change. She added "up to 2050 from now, our annual GDP loss will be 2.0 per cent and at this rate by 2100, the loss will be a staggering 9.0 per cent." Bangladesh is the first LDC to establish a Climate Change Trust Fund by itself and has so far spent more than US$ 415 million from its own resources for mitigation and adaptation purposes. The Prime Minister said, "...we are set to spend as much as US$ 10 billion to make the country less vulnerable to natural disasters." This measure has been undertaken so that vulnerable people are not left with any choice to survive other than resorting to actions that could endanger state, regional and global security and make them easy prey for threats like radicalisation. In this connection, the Prime Minister drew the attention of the participants to the continuing presence of 1.1 million Rohingyas in Bangladesh and urged the international community to initiate discussions on creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of the people who became displaced due to climate change. She commented, "...relocation and protection of displaced persons need due focus in global discourse to ensure their protection. We need to commence discussions on creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of people displaced due to climate change". Through this she drew world attention towards climate migrants. Other participants also urged all nations to join their hands to combat climate change to secure the future of children. There was also general consensus that the vulnerable countries suffer the most due to their limited financial capacity to cope with the problem and also because of their specific geographical features. As a result they have to bear the brunt of the damage though they made negligible or no contribution to the menace.

Dhaka, Dec. 20 -- In the 1990s Japan was seen as a pioneer country in the world on protecting the environment. Strict environment related laws were put into practice after a series of disastrous incidents due to random industrialization of 1960s caused widespread health problems; and the country played a crucial role in the conclusion of Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement aimed at salvaging the mother earth from the salvo of random development initiatives without considering what impact that might have on the atmosphere and our surroundings. The Protocol was seen as a first major step in realizing the danger that our endless pursuit for economic growth poses to our own survival and outlined measures that we need to take for reversing that destructive trend. Although not a total success due to the objection of a few powerful nations; the Kyoto Protocol nevertheless started the ongoing process of checking the pulse of the earth and suggesting remedies. In the past Japan was also praised for her own initiatives in reducing carbon emission and introducing technologies that are environment friendly. However, as we approach the second decade of twenty-first century, much of that has by now become history and from the position of an environmentally sensitive country, Japan has become sort of a pariah state looking for ways to hide her wrong environment policies behind the facade of long-term goals. This had become clear at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) that had just been concluded in the Spanish capital Madrid after prolonged and heated discussions over what measures we need to take for saving the earth from unchecked development initiatives. At COP25 Japan's dilemma with coal is a relatively recent matter that started with the shutdown of nuclear power generators following the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Currently, coal-fired power generation accounts for around 33 percent of Japan's total energy output. Approximately 100 thermal power plants are in operation in the country with 20 more now under construction. Once the newly constructed power plants become operational, country's share of coal-fired power generation are due to increase significantly, and with that blaming the country for polluting the environment is also due to intensified. Only a decade ago Japan was seen as moving towards an environment friendly power generating country with significant efforts put on the development and fostering of new energy sources. The Fukushima disaster has changed all that and brought Japan back to square one where country's policy makers and industry leaders find coal as an option they no more can ignore. The disaster forced Japan to suspend the operation of all existing nuclear power generators and the country is finding it hard to restart those amid strong public opposition. As a result, with most of the nuclear power plants still remaining out of operation, country's share of nuclear power plummeted to around 3 percent from almost 30 percent of pre-disaster figure. The vacancy has been quickly filled-up by coal. Coal has for long been pointed out by scientist and researchers as a prime source of carbon emission polluting our environment. Although some advanced countries including Japan claim that new technology they are applying in power generation downgrade the pollution risk from coal significantly, many find the argument not scientifically convincing. Hence, Japan is coming under increasing criticism from environment activists and citizens' groups for failing to keep up to the promises of expanding the use of sustainable energy sources like solar, wind or geo-thermal. In addition, critics are also pointing out to Japan's policy of exporting coal-fired power generation to developing countries as another disturbing aspect. Japan is one of the leading countries in the world involved in such trade of pollution in the name of development assistance. Our country is also one prime destination of Japan's such energy generation export, with Matarbari and few other projects that are due to become operational soon. This policy of Japan's dependence on coal and also exporting coal-fired energy technology to countries around the world came under strong criticism in Madrid and Japan was duly rewarded with the first of two Fossil of the Day award on December 3 when industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama at a press conference declared that Japan would stick to using coal-fired power generation plants. It eventually put heavy pressure on environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi for finding a way out that would help the country avoid being criticized further at the international gathering. The young minister delivered his speech on December 11 amid widespread expectation that he might respond to earlier criticisms and hint about the shift from earlier standing. He started his speech with the announcement that he was expecting his first child next year, the reality that puts a heavy burden on him to secure the future of himself, his unborn child and all children beyond 2050. He also mentioned that he took UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres' call for halting dependence on coal was a message directed to his country. However, at the end he failed to offer any specific measure that would indicate Japan's willingness to stop coal-fired power generation for the sake of future generations. For this the environment group CAN derided him with its Fossil of the Day award, a second one for Japan in a single conference. Analysts in Japan, however, is saying that Koizumi himself was willing to go ahead with making some commitments towards phasing out of harmful energy practices, but was helpless amid strong opposition from the industry ministry and also from country's powerful business lobby. The end result had been Japan identified as a country that failed again to respond to climate emergency. Koizumi himself acknowledged the failure as an expected outcome as he failed in his attempts to review Japan's position on promoting exports of coal-fired power plants to developing countries. Japan's Madrid debacle shows clearly that when business interest become predominant, other pressing matters get less priority even at the cost of country's image. This is where Japan stands now, not the same Japan of 1990s, which was aggressively moving forward keeping environmental issues high on the agenda.

P#38#P A major new energy innovation project to demonstrate how smart hydropower technologies can deliver a low-carbon, reliable and resilient power system was launched at the United Nations climate change conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid, Spain. The pound 18 million initiative was announced by the European Commission and a consortium of 19 partners, including the International Hydropower Association. The XFLEX HYDRO (Hydropower Extending Power System Flexibility) project is a four-year initiative by utilities, equipment manufacturers, universities, research centers and consultancies. It will demonstrate how modern hydropower plants can provide the vital power grid services required by variable renewables such as wind and solar power. The launch comes after a UN Emissions Gap Report looking at ways to reduce global carbon emissions said that greater power system flexibility was 'key' to integrating larger shares of variable renewable energy into the power supply. The project will conclude in 2023 by delivering a roadmap to increase adoption of the technologies across the hydropower fleet, with policy and market recommendations for governments, regulators and industry. \</doc>

The implementation of Paris Agreement is expected to start in 2020. For that to happen, all unresolved matters need to be resolved at COP25 . I believe we can achieve those in Madrid, Spain. The world community with enabling political will can achieve this through negotiation. I think America has committed a mistake through walking out of the Paris Agreement. Rest of the world remains sincerely committed to the agreement. I believe America would also return to the negotiation. Dr. S.M. Munjurul Hannan Khan, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said this in an exclusive interview with Energy and amp;amp; Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain. The Rules Book could be finalized during the extended time of COP24 at Katowice. What is Bangladesh \' s expectation from COP25 ? Please note that the Rules Book could not be finalized as yet in entirety. It is expected to be completed at the COP25 . Here through negotiation, decisions would be taken about the modality of the NDC implementation, the limit of carbon emission of each party, whether or not carbon emission limit would be mandatory. The decision for getting the grant, not loan, for the countries impacted by climate change would be firmed up. The discussion about loss and damage started from the Warsaw Conference. This will be finalized in Madrid. It is worth mentioning that all unresolved issues need to be agreed at COP25 if implementation of Paris Agreement is to start from 2020. I am well and truly optimistic about the outcome of COP25 . Bangladesh will continue its endeavor in different forum for achieving the success. The COP25 COP25 ? Do you think present stand of America has put COP25 into challenge? Withdrawal of America means they cannot participate in any negotiation of COP25 . But I think it is a wrong decision of America. We must bear in mind America is not the entire world. There is no other option for restricting global warming below I.5 Degree Celcius. Rest of the world is unanimous about this. I believe America would have to return. There is no other option but to implement Paris Agreement. Around US$100 billion was supposed to have been accumulated in Green Climate Fund (GCF). But till last year not much has been achieved. But in the UN climate summit, many countries have given fresh pledge for donating money. What kind of success you are expecting about this at COP25 ? Implementation of Paris Agreement cannot start till GCF becomes fully operational. GDF must come to light in full at COP25 . I am optimistic that GDF would get US$100 billion by 2020. In subsequent years, US$100 billion would continue pouring in. On the other hand, rules and guidelines under which climate vulnerable countries would access this fund would also be finalized. How do you evaluate the commitments of other countries for the implementation of Paris Agreement? Where does Bangladesh stand? Please note that no country excepting America has withdrawn from Paris Agreement. Rather political commitments of all countries have grown stronger. The entire world now wants the implementation of Paris Agreement starting on time. I am optimistic about its start from 2020. But two years may be required for setting up frameworks for implementation of the agreement. All these would become transparent in negotiations. Bangladesh has advanced more than many countries about implementation of Paris Agreement. Honorable Prime Minister has played a strong role at home and abroad in global forums advocating implementation of Paris Agreement. Our achievement is far greater than 5% emission reduction with own resources as per NDC commitment. Subject to availability of global financial support, we are ready for achieving another 10% emission reduction. As per Warsaw decision, the Loss and Damage mechanism needs to be agreed by 2019. Where does Bangladesh stand about this? Works have been done over the past few years about Loss and Damage mechanism. The COP25 COP25 ? CDM mechanism is developed under KYOTO protocol. The term of KYOTO would expire before Paris Agreement coming into effect. Hence the decision for setting up one or few boards to keep the objective of CDM going needs to be taken at the COP25 . It will decide how CDM would work in future. Bangladesh has finalized its NDC. Under this you are working to finalize climate strategy and action plan to implement it by 2030. Where do you stand now? Final review of Climate Strategy and Action Plan (BCSAP) is being done now. We expect to finalize this within three months. This has identified what needs to be done for addressing climate change. The action plans have also been worked out. NDC will be reviewed in 2025. Works are in progress for reducing emissions by 5% utilizing own fund. Works would start for reducing emission by another 10% upon availability of global financing. As per the NDC, Bangladesh is supposed to reduce emission by 5% using own fund and another 10% accessing global financing by 2025. At what stage you are now? We are at advanced stage compared to other countries in achieving NDC targets. But works on achieving 10% emission reduction could not be advanced much for not getting global financing. We hope to get fianc\'e9 from donor agencies and development partners soon. But these must come as grants. Specially, these would come from bilateral donors, UNFCCC and UNO. In recent discussions it appears that industries, energy and power sectors have made remarkable achievement in achieving NDC targets, but transport sector is languishing at the bottom. How do you look at it? You are possibly right. The energy and power sector is far advanced in achieving 5% emission reduction target set in the NDC. There is no doubt that transport sector is lagging way behind. But you know Metro Rail, Elevated Express Highway and other mega projects are being implemented under Mass Transit initiative. Moreover, technological innovations are also being introduced. As a result, transport sector would also achieve the target within the deadline. Which areas you have stressed upon in the country paper of COP25 and why? The main focus of Bangladesh Country Paper of COP25 is completing all out standing matters for launching Paris Agreement in 2020. Completing Rules Book, finalizing Loss and Damage Mechanism, Technology Transfer, finalizing GCF and CDM are main elements of the Bangladesh country paper. There have been some dislocations for change of venue but in Madrid COP25 all that requires to bring into effect the Paris Agreement and all rules and guidelines for launching it from 2020 would be completed. The reason for my expectation is that it has been possible to bring all matters to final stage already through intensive negotiations. Hence, Madrid COP would bring the fruits. Civil society and NGOs are making allegations about the works of the Ministry of Environment and Forest. Public and private sectors are working together to achieve the target of limiting global warming below 1.5 degree C. Where we are now? Please note that organizations like TIB is bringing allegations without going into details and purely relying on media reports. We have invited them to come and talk with us. After knowing the actual position, they can make their observations. Media reports are coming because of free flow of information about environment sector. There are no negative reflections in the media about our works. Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina herself would lead Bangladesh team to COP25 . What impact it would create you think? You are right that Honorable Prime Minister would lead Bangladesh delegation to COP25 . She has already attracted world attention for her works on environment. She has already been decorated as Climate Change Hero. She will participate in the inaugural program of COP25 . She will talk in a special session of adaptation program along side of Prime Minister of Netherlands and UN Secretary General. She will inform world community about the experience of Bangladesh in adaptation. I believe active participation of the Bangladesh Prime Minister in COP25 shall contribute a lot in fashioning global opinion about environment protection. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 25 -- The Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB) expressed concern about uncertainty of climate financing in UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) in Madrid of Spain. There was no certain development in the long-run climate financing, addressing loss and damage caused by climate change effects, and initiatives to cut global warming, it added. It also added that there was no sign of meeting the commitments of 'Intended Nationally Determined Contributions - INDC' to reduce global temperature and the rulebook was not finalised to meet the draft Paris agreement that had been made in COP24. The anti-corruption watchdog mentioned those at a media statement on Tuesday. Besides, it also expressed concerns over the plan of expanding insurance and other profit oriented private enterprises to support the vulnerable countries affected by climate change effects. TIB Executive Director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said in the statement that the issue of meeting the commitments made by developed countries of releasing US$ 100 billion as 'new' and £dditional' supports to address global warming was not discussed in COP25 which is making the long-term climate financing uncertain. Dr Iftekharuzzaman expressed his dissatisfaction over the move in the COP25 .

Dhaka, Dec. 12 -- Also, there are uncertainties over thresholds for climate change impacts and the pace and form of technological innovation that can take shape in the future. Furthermore, the effects of climate change are not uniform across countries. Different parts of the world are likely to be affected differently: countries closer to North and South poles will experience warmer temperatures and once inhospitable land will experience melting of ice. Small island nations are at risk of extinction due to rising sea levels. Low-lying islands and countries are at a greater risk of flooding both from rising sea levels and increased precipitation. Countries near the equator are likely to experience unbearable heat. Some of the countries are already experiencing more frequent events of severe weather. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) released its annual report on "emissions gap" referring to "commitment gap" on November 26 this year. The UNEP also warns that the world will fail to get on track towards 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, unless the emissions of global greenhouse gas fall by 7.6 percent in each year between 2020 and 2030. The report shows that despite the pledges by several countries, the amount of greenhouse gases is increasing at an alarming rate, where it urges for deeper and faster cuts of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. It should be noted that the global temperature is already 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer and has been warned to rise by 3.4 to 3.9 degrees Celsius in this century if current trends persist, and that may result in wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts, including extreme weather, droughts and storms across the globe. By 2050, low-lying areas in some South and Southeast Asian cities not far from the coast are likely to face inundation during high tide as part of the flood zone. Bangladeshi climate experts have denoted that 100km away from the coastal zones, the districts of Pirojpur and Shariatpur might be badly affected as there are no embankments there. These debacles that are staring us in the face have raised several questions as to how the concerned countries are expected to respond to the evolving disastrous situation, and how basic human rights of the affected people need to be safeguarded while tackling and managing this growing emergency. Efforts to promote environmental sustainability can only be effective if they occur in the context of conductive legal frameworks, and by the exercise of certain human rights, such as the rights to information, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice. Bangladesh's ranking in the index was decided based on these data, the think-tank said. The data showed that the losses were equivalent to 0.41 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. There is no denying that Bangladesh is one of the most affected countries in the world on account of climate change in the past two decades, says the German think-tank report. In 2016, Bangladesh stood 13th among other countries in the world -- counting a total of 222 fatalities for climate change and incurred losses over US$1,100 billion. Honduras bottomed the list of most affected countries of the past 20 years, followed by Haiti, Myanmar, Nicaragua and the Philippines. The Global Climate Risk Index has placed Bangladesh at the seventh position among countries most vulnerable to climate change in its annual report for 2020. According to the German think tank, Bangladesh lost 577 lives during the last 21 years since 1999, suffered economic losses to the tune of US$1.7 billion in purchasing power parity and witnessed 151 extreme weather events during the period from 1999 to 2018. The symptoms of climate change are visible in Bangladesh. Delicate specialties of six seasons are lost and the routine of natural events changed. A typical flower of one season is blooming in another. Cold waves and hot waves have now been regular features. Death toll by lightning strikes is on the increase. The salinity from sea is creeping into the mainland. The country had to bear the harsh blow of cyclone Sidr in 2007, haor flooding in 2017 and frequent inland tornadoes. Thus people bear the brunt of climate change for no fault of theirs. Bangladesh is aware of the danger of climate change. The Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund has been created to implement climate-related projects with its own funds. As a vulnerable country, Bangladesh has the right to receive funds from the Global Climate Fund of the United Nations for adaptation measures and for the protection of infrastructure. But the availability of such funds is uncertain and irregular. As society's total disposable time - social wealth - expands, so too does the ability of all members of society to increasingly participate in running, planning and solving its problems, including finding solutions to the more intractable environmental or technological problems. Lifelong theoretical and practical education, made possible by this expanding disposable time, Marx states, will "convert science from an instrument of class rule into a popular force." Only public ownership, popular democracy and planning, and a new definition of wealth based not on individual personal enrichment and consumption can possibly meet the dispute. It would not be too extreme to declare that humanity in the next 50 years faces a stark choice: capitalism or socialism and human survival. Bangladesh has been well aware of this problem for over a decade and has developed the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) which has been implemented for nearly a decade and is now being revised to take it to 2030. Once the revised version is adopted it should become integrated into the 8th Five Year Plan as soon as possible. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

British High Commissioner Robert Chatterton Dickson on Monday said Bangladesh and the United Kingdom (UK) can form a great partnership to lead global efforts to tackle climate change noting that climate change is the defining issue of their time. "Our combined expertise and leadership mean we can work together to raise the world's ambition before and during COP26, seeking global commitment on adapting to climate impacts and building resilience for the future," he said. The High Commissioner was addressing a discussion at his residence in the evening. The British High Commission in Bangladesh invited government, academic and civil society representation to the High Commissioner's residence to convey the UK's ambition for this year's UN climate change conference (COP 26) and its growing collaboration with Bangladesh for advancing the climate agenda towards COP 26 and beyond. High Commissioner Dickson opened the discussion by reflecting on the global outcomes of COP25 and setting out the UK ambition for COP26. Ziaul Hasan, Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Focal Point for Bangladesh, delivered the keynote speech. Ziaul Hasan was joined by four distinguished participants of COP25 : Sultana Afroz, Additional Secretary, Economic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance, Dr Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCAD) and Adviser to the Least Developed Countries Group in UNFCCC; Mohammed Malik, Infrastructure Development Company Ltd.; Sharaban Tahura Zaman, Lecturer, Department of Law, North South University, and LDCs group negotiator at COP25 . COP25 , the journey to COP26, and opportunities for the UK and Bangladesh to raise global ambition to reduce the emissions gap. DFID Country Representative Judith Herbertson, delivered the closing remarks on UK-Bangladesh cooperation beyond COP26. She said that DFID is planning a new programme to support adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change as well as environmental management in Bangladesh. 'Our vision is that through our partnership and our programming, we can show what can be done to clean up growth and build resilience across the country; and share this expertise with other countries.' The United Kingdom, in partnership with Italy, will host COP 26 this year in November in Glasgow. More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the conference, including heads of state and government; experts; and campaigners. Delegates will be discussing ambitious ways in which the world can lower emissions to keep global temperatures below 1.5 degrees of warming. While the UK is gearing up for the presidency of COP26, Bangladesh is advancing its preparation to lead the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Locally-Led Adaptation Action Track of the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA). And leading up to COP26, the UK intends to build a stronger partnership with countries like Bangladesh; a vulnerable country but increasingly resilient to climate impacts. As the leading voice against climate impacts, Bangladesh can play a more significant role in the global climate change discourse through COP 26. The UK is already a key partner to Bangladesh on disaster management and resilience building. Since 2008, UK and Bangladesh jointly helped over 27 million people gain access to early warning systems for floods and cyclones, and provided emergency assistance and recovery support after disasters to more than 900,000 people. Environmental experts, diplomats and government officials at the discussion roundtable discussion called for stronger cooperation between the UK and Bangladesh for a successful climate conference. They also said Bangladesh has already demonstrated its strong willingness need to improve in how it implements the climate action plans. \</doc>

P#9#P T he UN climate talks concluded in disappointment on December 15, with governments showing no signs of addressing the climate crisis. This years annual UN climate conference, COP25 in Madrid, became the longest on record after it concluded on December 15, following more than two weeks of negotiations. It had been scheduled to wrap up on December 13. Nearly 27,000 delegates arrived in the Spanish capital in early December aiming to finalize the rulebook of the Paris Agreement the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020 by settling on rules for carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation under Article 6 of the deal. Countries failed to reach consensus on many of the expected outcomes, including rules to set up a global carbon trading mechanism and a system to channel new finance to countries facing the impacts of climate change. Negotiations put politics and fossil-fuel interests above people and the planet. Many countries, led by the United States, Australia and Brazil, once again exposed their apathy to the suffering of millions and a wilful rejection of the science. Major emitters failed to show clear signals about increasing ambition by 2020 and rich countries reneged on the promise to provide finance for loss and damage. The key polluting countries responsible for 80 percent of the worlds climate wrecking emissions, stood mute, while smaller countries announced they'll work to drive down harmful emissions in the coming year. The big polluting countries like the USA, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia continued down a path of inaction and were undermining international efforts to prevent the increasingly eminent climate breakdown. Countries such as China and India made it clear they will not support strong language on raising ambition without a similar call for rich countries to provide the finance and support promised to developing countries. UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said he was disappointed with the results of COP25 and that the international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. Guterres emphasized in his opening address to the conference, telling parties to step up next year. He added: The worlds biggest emitters need to do much more. Instead of committing to more ambitious cuts in emissions, countries have been arguing over technicalities. Poorer nations spoke with one voice to demand funds for the loss and damage. Wealthy nations have used every trick to stall progress and avoid paying their fair share. The bushfires in Australia raging for three months six people have died, 720 homes have been destroyed, beautiful national parks and their wildlife burnt. Yet still the Australian government has sought to weaken its climate ambition, and drag the ambition of the whole Paris Agreement down to its level. The US has once again gotten its way through bullying and tricks. Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change Patricia Espinosa in a statement on the outcome of COP25 expressed her frustration that the conference did not result in agreement on the guidelines for a much-needed carbon market an essential part of the toolkit to raise ambition that can harness the potential of the private sector and generate finance for adaptation. She said developed countries have yet to fully address the calls from developing countries for enhanced support in finance, technology and capacity building, without which they cannot green their economies and build adequate resilience to climate change. High-emitting countries did not send a clear enough signal that they are ready to improve their climate strategies and ramp up ambition through the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) they will submit next year. At the same time, in the final decision texts, governments did express the need for more ambition by Parties and non-state actors alike, and they agreed to improve the ability of the most vulnerable to adapt to climate change. Many decisions that emerged from the conference in Madrid at least acknowledged the role of climate finance, essential for concrete action. And decisions were taken in areas including technology, oceans and agriculture, gender and capacity building. A large group of countries, regions, cities, businesses and investors signalled their intention to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, as part of the Climate Ambition Alliance led by Chile. Also rallying under the Climate Ambition Alliance, 114 nations have meanwhile signalled their intention to submit an enhanced climate action plan next year. The caveat here is that not enough major economies have signalled that they are ready to shift the needle on climate ambition through improved plans, said Patricia. According to the World Resources Institute NDC tracker, just 80 countries primarily, small and developing nations have stated their intention to enhance their NDCs by 2020, representing just 10.5% of world emissions. All the biggest emitters are absent from this list. The lack of commitment to scale up climate action by big emitting countries was too much to overcome. Their position is in stark contrast to science, rising demands from the streets and the harsh impacts already felt in vulnerable countries. Nearly 70 countries most of them climate vulnerable, developing nations have risen to the challenge by committing to enhance the ambition of their Paris pledges. But most of the worlds biggest emitting countries were missing in action and resisting calls to raise their ambition. The COP25 got off to a difficult start, when Chiles president Sebastian Pinera announced at the end of October that his country could no longer host the event due to violent anti-government protests in the capital of Santiago. With barely a month to go, Spain stepped in and agreed to take on the event in Madrid. However, Chile retained the presidency, with the event rebranded as COP25 Chile Madrid. At the start of the meeting, COP25 president and Chilean environment secretary Carolina Schmidt said the conference must change the course of climate action and ambition. The UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, in the first of several interventions, asked attendees: Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand? At the opening of the high-level political segment of the COP in week two, Teresa Ribera, Spain's acting minister for the ecological transition, told delegates: Countries will have to announce more ambitious contributions in 2020 and let me remind you that 2020 begins in exactly 20 days. This is also the year in which we have committed ourselves to announcing long-term cohesive strategies to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Addressing a general roundtable discussion at the COP25 , Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said all funds to fight climate change must be replenished as per agreement, including the $100 billion annual contribution. She said the Paris Agreement recognizes the special circumstances and needs of LDCs and Particularly Vulnerable Countries based on the principle of the common but differentiated responsibility, and this recognition must be adhered to in every delivery mechanism of the climate finance. Bangladesh is a firm believer of collective efforts and understanding to fight climate change, and UN is the most appropriate platform. She said from now on the principle of Loss and Damage must feature prominently in all negotiations and the Warsaw International Mechanism must be given a much stronger mandate to explore financing losses and damages through its review. She said climate change has now become an existential threat for climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. During the couple of weeks, hundreds of climate activists staged peaceful but loud protest close to the plenary halls while ministers were holding negotiations inside. The observer groups faced severe retaliation for demanding climate justice, echoing the voices from the streets, even as lobbyists and polluters roam the UN halls freely. The COP25 was a success for the fossil fuel industry - their interests have won, effectively blocking the process and undermining the end result. When Greta Thunberg arrived in the venue, fresh from a transatlantic voyage by sail, she found herself at the center of the COPs media circus. At the end of the first week, the young Swedish activist joined a march through central Madrid that organizers said drew half a million people. In her final speech at the conference, Thunberg captured the mood when she told those assembled in the main plenary hall that the COP seems to have turned into some kind of opportunity for countries to negotiate loopholes. Later that day, around 200 climate campaigners and indigenous rights activists expressing frustration at the lack of progress were ejected from the venue, following a protest outside the same plenary room where Thunberg had spoken just hours before. There were moves to raise ambition by some non-state actors at the COP with, for example, 177 companies pledging to cut emissions in line with the 1.5C target as part of the Climate Ambition Alliance. This came after a group of 477 investors, controlling $34tn in assets, called on world leaders to update their NDCs and step up ambition. The gap between what people are demanding for a climate-safe future and what leaders are willing to do is widening as emissions rise, fossil fuel production expands and impacts escalate. This is unacceptable, Climate Action Network said in a statement as the world leaders left UN climate talks with no plan for climate emergency. Christoph Bals, Policy Director, Germanwatch, said: " COP25 shows the strength and weakness of the Paris Agreement: All countries see that the withdrawal from coal, oil and gas is now entering the serious phase. This is why some states such as the USA, Brazil and Australia, which are closely linked to the fossil lobby, are organizing a final defensive battle.' By the end of the second week there was a sense among some observers and parties that many richer nations were not taking the time for action motto seriously. Delegates from small island states and African countries were among those expressing their disappointment with the entire process. On the final Thursday (December 12), the Association of Small Island States (AOSIS) convened a press conference in which the groups chief negotiator Carlos Fuller said he feared having to concede on issues that would undermine the very integrity of the Paris Agreement: COP25 is demonstrating very little ambition. COP25 is a defining moment for us: it must trigger a decade of ambition. We are appalled at the state of negotiations Whats before us is a level of compromise so profound, that it underscores a lack of ambition, seriousness about the climate emergency and the urgency of securing the fate of our islands. The group even called out Brazil, India and China as parties actively blocking ambitious outcomes in Article 6 discussions. Article 6 Ahead of COP25 , many expected a key focus to be agreeing rules for Article 6 carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation. This is the last remaining piece of the Paris regime to be resolved, after the rest of its rulebook was agreed in late 2018. By the end of the talks, Article 6 had become one of the highest profile casualties of the negotiations. With parties falling just short of reaching a deal, it will be taken up again at an intercessional meeting in June and at COP26 in November 2020. The conversation around Article 6 is technical and full of jargon, yet the way the rules are designed could make or break the entire Paris Agreement. This high-stakes situation was a key reason for failure in Madrid. Article 6 itself contains three separate mechanisms for voluntary cooperation towards climate goals, with the overarching aim of raising ambition. Two of the mechanisms are based on markets and a third is based on non-market approaches. The Paris Agreements text outlined requirements for those taking part, but left the details the Article 6 rulebook undecided. Were seeing what we see at the regional level: prioritization of profits and a myopic scope on maintaining harmful institutions and power dynamics, Janene Yazzie from the International Indian Treaty Council told Carbon Brief. Critics say the Kyoto Protocols Clean Development Mechanism for international carbon trading has been linked with human-rights violations, as projects under it, such as large hydropower dams, can, for example, lead to people being displaced or having their livelihoods destroyed. Accounting Rules to Avoid Double-Counting Accounting rules for Article 6 were a running sore throughout the talks, as well as posing technical challenges due to the diverse nature of countries NDCs, which cover different timescales and may or may not cover all of the sectors and greenhouse gases in each economy. The technical question was how to account for trade between countries with different types of NDC, given some target an emissions budget across multiple years and others aim for a particular level in a single target year. If accounted for inappropriately, then trading under Article 6.2 could have allowed countries to meet their single-year targets without actually cutting emissions. The political fight on double-counting centered on the application of corresponding adjustments to international carbon trading under Article 6.4. Although ostensibly also a matter of good bookkeeping, Brazil, in particular, was insistent that countries hosting emissions-cutting projects under Article 6.4 ought not to be required to make a corresponding adjustment when any CO 2 savings were sold overseas. Brazils position was a source of confusion at and before the talks. In more than a dozen interviews focusing on Article 6, Carbon Brief received almost as many different explanations. Brazils firm position on the question of double-counting was reportedly a key factor in the failure to agree the Article 6 rulebook at COP24. As talks in Madrid moved into overtime, the matter was one of several outstanding issues still holding up progress. Andrei Marcu, a former negotiator and now executive director at the European Roundtable on Climate Change and Sustainable Transition, told a briefing at the COP: The only real red line that is unsolvable unless someone bends is that of corresponding adjustment for 6.4, everything else is a matter of negotiation. This one is literally a defining question, I mean, there are very different interpretations of the [Paris] Agreement. Carryover of Kyoto Carbon Units and Projects Almost equally contentious was the question of how to deal with billions of Kyoto-era carbon offset units, potentially amounting to more than five billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. These units were mostly generated under the Clean Development Mechanism, where projects in developing countries created certified emissions reductions (CERs) in the developing world. The lions share of these CERs were created in a handful of countries, notably China, India and Brazil. At COP25 , these countries pushed for CERs to be eligible under Article 6.4, arguing that private companies had invested in good faith and should not have their assets rendered worthless. The EU and vulnerable countries were firmly against the transition of Kyoto units. They argued the CERs would undermine already insufficient ambition by allowing targets to be met with emissions reductions that have already happened, in place of additional cuts being made in the future. Some also noted that CERs are already viewed as practically worthless on the open market, valued at around $0.2 per tonne of CO 2 . In addition, a supply in the billions of tonnes would far exceed demand, meaning prices under Article 6 would also be low. Along with the Brazilian position on double counting, Australia's stance on the carryover of Kyoto units faced harsh criticism at COP25 . Yamide Dagnet, senior associate at US NGO the World Resources Institute (WRI), told a briefing at COP25 that Australia's position was outrageous and amounted to cheating. She added: That makes me angry. Share of Proceeds to Fund Adaptation One of the more politically fraught issues was around what share of proceeds from selling carbon offsets should be set aside to fund adaptation efforts in the most vulnerable countries. A further question was whether to set aside a share of proceeds under Article 6.2, as well as under 6.4, despite the Paris Agreement only explicitly mentioning the idea in the latter context. Securing support for adaptation via all Article 6 trading was marked down as a key priority by negotiating blocs including the African Group, as well as the G77 + China. Many developed countries were resistant to the idea, seeing it as a transaction tax that would limit trade. The EU also opposed a share of proceeds being applied to bilateral links under Article 6.2, which it hopes to use to link its emissions trading system to others. The near-final draft (pdf) on Article 6.2 only contains the weaker, voluntary language where parties using the mechanism are strongly encouraged to support adaptation. OMGE for Net Climate Benefits The final major area of Article 6 disagreement was around the idea of securing overall mitigation in global emissions (OMGE), a concept introduced in the Paris text for Article 6.4. OMGE is supposed to ensure a net-benefit for the atmosphere, rather than a zero-sum outcome where emissions in one place are offset by reductions elsewhere. Key questions for the rulebook included how to implement a system that would guarantee OMGE and whether or not to apply a similar scheme to trading under Article 6.2. Groups such as AOSIS argued that the only way to achieve OMGE was to automatically cancel a portion of any offsets created under Article 6. They argued that applying this cancellation to trade under Article 6.4, but not under Article 6.2, would create an imbalance that could skew the market. Others opposed automatic cancellation under both mechanisms, arguing it amounted to a transaction tax that would limit the level of trade and impede any benefits that Article 6 could bring. Loss and Damage The question of how to support countries affected by the irreversible and non-adaptable impacts of climate change has been a long-running debate at COPs over recent years. Climate finance is in itself a contentious topic, with richer countries often falling short of the figures developing countries say they need. At COP25 , negotiators were charged with reviewing the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM), which was established in 2013 to deal with this kind of loss and damage. The WIM so far has been used to further scientific understanding of this issue, but developing countries in particular want it to reach out to those affected and do more towards one of its other goals, namely enhancing action and support. At a COP25 press conference called by the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), Belizian environment minister Omar Figueroa laid out their position: Loss and damage is an existential issue for us. We need clear and predictable finance that we can access to really compensate for the loss and damage that so many of our sister nations are feeling. As negotiations were meant to be drawing to a close on Friday, Dr Saleemul Huq, who supports vulnerable countries in negotiations, told Carbon Brief that the need for new money was non-negotiable: Developing countries are adamant they are not going to bow to the US on this one. They are willing to have no decision in COP25 and take this discussion to COP26 in Glasgow, where the US is not at the table any more. Next year they will be out [of the Paris Agreement], under Trump. Huq, who is also director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), alluded to another sticking point with the US that had been discussed around the halls that week the so-called liability waiver. With no more texts emerging on Saturday and tensions running high, NGOs singled out loss and damage as a key area in which the talks were failing. After the morning plenary, Singh told gathered journalists: Because of the bullying and blocking by the US, joined by the EU, Australia and Canada, it seems we are going to leave this COP with no support. We can't just keep calling for ambition from developing countries without putting money on the table. The final decision on loss and damage that emerged was not as strong as developing nations had pushed for, with LDC chair Sonam P Wangdi commenting on the vast disconnect between the urgency at home and the pace of negotiations. The final texts essentially note that the GCF already supports activities that can be defined as relating to loss and damage, with a suggestion that it and other funds could do more in this area in the future. Finance While the main financial matter being discussed at this years COP was how to support countries affected by extreme climate impacts, the usual standing items were also being considered. Both the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) guidance documents were caught up in the debate around whether to instruct them to start working more specifically on loss and damage. There was also some discussion about the creation of a new climate finance goal, now that the deadline for $100bn by 2020 (agreed in 2009 at the Copenhagen COP) is almost up. Another issue being considered was long-term climate finance (LTF), a work stream that examines progress and scaling up of climate finance, but which is due to end in 2020. There is a debate about whether to continue it at all, or whether to bring it under the CMA (i.e. The Paris Agreement). A statement issued by BASIC ministers criticized the lack of funding from rich nations, calling out a lack of progress on the pre-2020 agenda, partly in the form of climate finance. Ambition Countries agreed in Paris in 2015 to revisit their climate pledges by 2020. But many countries were pushing this year for a clear call for all countries to submit more ambitious climate pledges next year. This is seen as a key means of ensuring countries put a focus on improving their current pledges, as well as empowering civil society to hold them to account. But countries such as China and Brazil opposed placing any obligation on countries to submit enhanced pledges next year, arguing it should be each country's own decision. They instead argued the focus should be on pre2020 action by developing countries to meet their previous pledges. As talks reached their final days, tensions grew after a draft decision removed any call for countries to update or enhance their climate plans by 2020. Instead, it only invited them to communicate them in 2020 far weaker language which put no obligation on enhanced ambition. In the end, the final text added some more ambitious wording back in, pointing directly to the emissions gap between what country pledges currently add up to and what is needed to keep global temperature rise well below 2\'b0C. It also recalls that new climate pledges should represent a progression beyond previous pledges and represent the highest possible ambition. This text was an improvement on previous drafts but still weak, according to Naoyuki Yamagishi of WWF Japan. Pre-2020 Developing countries have for years expressed their frustration that rich countries haven't lived up to the climate action they promised up to 2020. Even though 2020 is nearly upon us, these concerns over meeting previous promises remain and again became a source of political tension at the talks. They called for the creation of a work program to close the gap of commitments made by rich countries before 2020. But the EU opposed this, saying the focus needs to be on future ambition under the Paris Agreement, which applies to all countries. Other poorer developing countries made it clear that, while they support pre-2020 action, higher ambition for the future from all countries should not be conditional on it. In the final text, countries agreed to hold pre-2020 roundtables. The outcomes of these pre-2020 roundtables will also be rounded up in a report in 2021, which will in turn feed into a review on progress towards meeting the Paris Agreements well below 2\'b0C goal. The talks were unable to reach consensus in many areas, pushing decisions into next year under Rule 16 of the UN climate process. Matters including Article 6, reporting requirements for transparency and common timeframes for climate pledges were all punted into 2020, when countries are also due to raise the ambition of their efforts. Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change Patricia Espinosa said commitments from many sectors of society showed an overwhelming agreement on the only way forward: that we need to follow what science is telling us, with the sense of urgency and seriousness that this requires. What we need now is to focus our undivided attention on the next steps to further strengthen the trust in the multilateral process. As we head towards the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, we must be united and work in a true spirit of inclusive multilateralism in order to realize the promises of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. She expected to working with the governments of Chile, the UK and Italy to achieve the best possible results at COP26 in Glasgow. Former UK clean energy minister Claire Perry ONeill, who will lead the talks, was quick to reassure that she will push for progress next year. No deal is definitely better than the bad deal proposed, she wrote on Twitter shortly after the talks ended. We will pull no punches next year in getting clarity and certainty for natural carbon markets and will work with everyone including the private sector for clear rules and transparent measurement. \</doc>

Madrid is all set to host the COP25 (the 25th session of the conference of parties) as the governments, members of civil society and NGOs, and environment activists have already started gathering. The main negotiation on implementation of Paris Agreement to protect the world from climate change impact starts on December 2 and is scheduled to continue until December 13. The organizer, Chile, regretted holding the global event only one month before amid citizen\' s protest. Then Spain showed interest in hosting it and it was accepted by the board of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, people concerned with the issue are optimistic about the availability of fund, required for implementation of the Paris Agreement, would agree upon at the COP25 . Rules and procedures, action plan and implementation strategy would also be decided. It is being thought that if these are not agreed upon at the COP25 , the commencement of implementation of Paris Agreement from 2020 will be delayed. The conference is being held at a time when different countries of the world are encountering different types of climate disasters. Bangladesh capital Dhaka has become one of the most polluted cities of the world. Air pollution of different cities and towns including the port city has become unbearable. Threats of frequent cyclones and other natural calamities are growing. Countries including America, Brazil and Australia are huffing and puffing in managing bush fire menace. Some European countries are struck by flash flooding. Another important matter worth mentioning here that one of the major polluting countries, United States of America, has walked out of the Paris Agreement. A report of the World Resources Institute evidences that though USA as a state has walked out, yet different states, cities and businesses in USA still remain committed to the Paris Agreement. They represent two-thirds of the US population and business control 70% of the GDP. It will be great news for protecting the mother earth if this continues. Three recent reports published by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have sounded wake up alarm for the world leaders. The entire civilization, our land and our sea are in great danger from the adverse impacts of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions if we fail to act quickly now. The IPCC reports also stated that melting of polar glacier would not stop unless we can limit global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius by 2100. The sea level would continue rising and the danger of natural calamities would become more menacing than the previous decades. The Emission Gap Report by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) stated that even if the NDCs declared by different nations are fully implemented, the global warming would rise 3.2 degree Celsius. That will make mother earth exposed to different disasters. The report also states that for restricting the global warming within 1.5-2.0 degree Celsius, the annual GHG emissions reduction rate between 2020 and 2030 must be 7.6%. An initiative was launched at the climate negotiation in Katowice, Poland in 2018 for framing the Rules Book for implementation of the Paris Agreement. But it could not be finalized. In Madrid COP25 , the participating countries must work to finalize the Rules Book. The world leaders expressed optimism that the COP25 would achieve the objectives. Dr Manjurul Hannan Khan, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and a member of Bangladesh delegation to the COP25 , said that the crunch time for reaching final agreements in climate conference has arrived. He sounded optimistic that the meeting of minds of all parties would be there in Madrid. Different analyses and observations indicate that the COP25 would create the necessary momentum for commencing implementation of the Paris Agreement from 2020. During the COP21 in Paris in 2015 all the countries have been requested for submitting the updated NDCs. Most of the countries have already submitted the updated NDCs to the UNFCCC. Many countries including Bangladesh have started finalizing Climate Strategy and Action Plan. Bangladesh would complete it within three months. In September 2019 at the Climate Action Summit in New York, many small and medium countries committed to intensify actions for reducing the GHG emissions for achieving greater NDC targets. Some 68 countries have pledged for this. But it needs to observe what major polluting countries are doing. The COP25 COP25 , some head of the states or governments would attend the COP25 . Among them, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would lead the country delegation. Apart from participating in the inaugural program, she will address in a special session on adaptation. In addition to highlighting the Bangladesh experience of adaptation, she will press for global funding on behalf of the climate vulnerable countries for confronting adverse climatic changes. The COP25 The UNFCCC would prepare a synthesis on the basis of NDCs of countries. It will act as a policy paper for reducing GHG emissions. Governments, civil society, business and NGOs are expecting that the outstanding elements of the Rules Book would be finalized and agreed through negotiation in Madrid. These are carbon market post-Kyoto Protocol, common timeframe for implementation of NDCs, review of loss and damage and determination of action plan, advance financing and capacity building. A 300-page Rules Book was formulated at the COP24 for implementation of the Paris Agreement. But the issues could not be finalized. The main priority of COP25 is finalization of the rules for carbon market. More or less 51% of the NDCs state about attaching NDCs with the emission control is a major objective. The money received from carbon market will drive the world towards renewable energy and will play a major role in climate resilience financing. Experts observed that all must remain concerned about these during the finalization of the rules and regulations. The correct accounting of GHG emission would not be possible if the scope of carbon credit accounting is there for both buyers and sellers. Prior to 2020, the carbon market would follow Kyoto Protocol. But the modality of the carbon market operation from 2020 needs to be determined following the article 6 meticulously. We must bear in mind that the emission control mechanism is not affected through tangles of accounting. It needs ensuring that the money received from carbon market directs to adaptation fund and climate vulnerable countries gets higher benefits. Climate activists and civil society have advised remaining vigilant so that the rules are not finalized carelessly. These must be done in environment-friendly manner. Otherwise the carbon market rules would rather have negative impacts than positive one. The second priority is agreeing on a common timeframe for implementation of the NDCs of the countries. The COP24 reached initial agreements but could be ultimately finalized. The NDCs submitted in 2015 had set implementation timeframe by 2020 and 2025. But the implementation time of NDCs submitted last year set the starting time of implementation as 2031. Analysts suggested that in Madrid negotiation agreement should be reached for implementing the NDCs within the 2031-2035 timeframe. The third priority is assessment of loss and damage. It is a very sensitive matter. The Madrid negotiation must review and finalize the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage 2015 (WIM). WIM was created for ensuring financial assistance of the developing and climate vulnerable through accurately accounting their damage and losses. WIM reviewed and assessed the damage and losses over the past 6 years. It is expected that the Madrid negotiation would ensure the rules and modalities are finalized for financing for the affected countries through final review of the assessment done. The fourth and final priority is advance financing and capacity development. It is clear that advance financing is a must to enable the climate vulnerable countries achieving double reduction of GHG emission. This financing has to come from Green Climate Fund (GCF). But till now, contribution to the GCF is not encouraging at all. Till now, 28 countries together have pledged for US$ 28 billion to the GCF. But the actual receipt is only $ 5.6 billion. In subsequent 2020, $ 100 billion would be required and every year more $100 billion. Analysts believe that Madrid conference must ensure the above contribution by rich major polluting countries if Paris Agreement implementation is to start from 2020. Otherwise countries relying on contribution from GCF for achieving NDCs cannot achieve the targets. The main focus of Madrid conference must be confirming the contribution to the GCF. Inger Andersen of UNEP has told media that the climate investment cost in 2050 would grow US$ 7.9 trillion. The world\' s major fossil fuel producers are set to bust global environmental goals with excessive coal, oil and gas extraction in the next decade, the United Nations and research groups said. The 10 nations in focus, including China and the United States, plan to produce fuels by 2030 at levels between 50-120% over Paris Agreement targets, the study showed. Under that 2015 global pact, nations committed to a long-term goal of limiting the average temperature increase to within 1.5-2.0 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. But by 2030, the 10 countries\' planned production would lead to 39 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide emissions, 53% higher than what is needed to reduce temperature rises to 2C and 21 Gt, or 120%, more than is needed for 1.5C, the report said. Other countries analysed included Russia, India, Australia, Indonesia, Canada, Germany, Norway and Britain.  The world\' s energy supply remains dominated by coal, oil and gas, driving emission levels that are inconsistent with climate goals,  said United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) executive director Inger Andersen. According to an AFP report, large investment funds are not directed towards achieving climate change mitigation targets. British Organization Influence Map analysing 50, 000 investment accounts of 150 financial giants has mentioned that the investment in Oil and Gas Exploration, Coal Mining and Automobile Industry is US$ 8.2 trillion. They are interested for investment in brown technology although the Paris Agreement stressed upon giving priority to green projects by private sector investors. For this, the Paris Agreement perceived target of limiting the fossil fuel use especially of coal by 2030 would not be achieved. The use of coal would still remain above 30%. On the other hand, World Energy Outlook 2019 published recently by the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that stable policy is absent for restricting increased global carbon emission. It stated that people of many countries of the world are still deprived of quality energy supply. Around 850 million population of the world do not have access to electricity. The rate of growth of energy sector would be 1.4% till 2040. Emissions growth would also match this rate. New policy scenario of expanding use of renewable energy and achieving energy efficiency can limit this growth to 1%. It is being told that Oil use would remain stable till 2030 and gas would remain third in preference. Use of coal would be reduced but can not be eliminated all together. During this period, renewable energy contributing about 50% would take the lead and solar would be the leader. IEA observed that emission would be reduced but mentionable success may not be visible by 2040. The growth of energy efficiency now is 1.4%. For achieving the target set in Paris Agreement, it has to reach 3% by 2040. Energy efficiency has huge potential to help reduce carbon emissions, the IEA said. But governments need to take stronger policy action to reverse the worrying slowdown in global energy efficiency improvements, according to a public survey conducted by the International Energy Agency. The survey was carried out to inform the first meeting of the Global Commission for Urgent Action on Energy Efficiency. A catastrophic scenario has appeared about global warming and NDCs in a UNEP Emission Gap Report. On the eve of a year in which nations are due to strengthen their Paris climate pledges, a new UNEP report warns that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the 1.5\'b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. It says that even if all current unconditional commitments under the Paris Agreement are implemented, temperatures are expected to rise by 3.2\'b0C, bringing even wider-ranging and more destructive climate impacts. Collective ambition must increase more than fivefold over current levels to deliver the cuts needed over the next decade for the 1.5\'b0C goal. 2020 is a critical year for climate action, with the UN climate change conference in Glasgow aiming to determine the future course of efforts to avert crisis, and countries expected to significantly step up their climate commitments.  Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions - over 7 per cent each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade,  said Inger Andersen, UNEP\' s Executive Director.  This shows that countries simply cannot wait until the end of 2020, when new climate commitments are due, to step up action. They - and every city, region, business and individual - need to act now.  We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020, then stronger Nationally Determined Contributions to kick-start the major transformations of economies and societies. We need to catch up on the years in which we procrastinated,  she added.  If we don\' t do this, the 1.5\'b0C goal will be out of reach before 2030. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that going beyond 1.5\'b0C will increase the frequency and intensity of climate impacts, such as the heatwaves and storms witnessed across the globe in the last few years. G20 nations collectively account for 78 per cent of all emissions, but only five G20 members have committed to a long-term zero emissions target. In the short-term, developed countries will have to reduce their emissions quicker than developing countries, for reasons of fairness and equity. However, all countries will need to contribute more to collective effects. Developing countries can learn from successful efforts in developed countries; they can even leapfrog them and adopt cleaner technologies at a faster rate. Crucially, the report says all nations must substantially increase ambition in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as the Paris commitments are known, in 2020 and follow up with policies and strategies to implement them. Solutions are available to make meeting the Paris goals possible, but they are not being deployed fast enough or at a sufficiently large scale. Each year, the Emissions Gap Report assesses the gap between anticipated emissions in 2030 and levels consistent with the 1.5\'b0C and 2\'b0C targets of the Paris Agreement. The report finds that GHG emissions have risen 1.5 per cent per year over the last decade. Emissions in 2018, including from land-use changes such as deforestation, hit a new high of 55.3 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. To limit temperatures, annual emissions in 2030 need to be 15 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent lower than current unconditional NDCs imply for the 2\'b0C goal; they need to be 32 gigatonnes lower for the 1.5\'b0C goal. On an annual basis, this means cuts in emissions of 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 to meet the 1.5\'b0C goal and 2.7 per cent per year for the 2\'b0C goal. To deliver on these cuts, the levels of ambition in the NDCs must increase at least fivefold for the 1.5\'b0C goal and threefold for the 2\'b0C. Climate change can still be limited to 1.5\'b0C, the report says. There is increased understanding of the additional benefits of climate action - such as clean air and a boost to the Sustainable Development Goals. There are many ambitious efforts from governments, cities, businesses and investors. Solutions, and the pressure and will to implement them, are abundant. As it does each year, the report focuses on the potential of selected sectors to deliver emissions cuts. This year it looks at the energy transition and the potential of efficiency in the use of materials, which can go a long way to closing the emissions gap. There has not been even marginal achievement in challenges for limiting the global warming to 1.5-2.0 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial revolution as perceived in Paris Agreement. The developed world is not even prepared for providing the required fund for advancing towards the target. Major polluter USA has already moved out of the Paris Agreement. According to the Emissions Gap Report, the global warming can be limited to 3.2 degree Celsius even if all countries achieve the present targets of NDCs. For achieving global warming limitation target of 1.5-2 degrees Celsius, the GHG emissions must be reduced to an annual rate of 7.6% between 2020 and 2030. Climate activists and civil society all over the world in united voice are urging repeatedly that major polluting countries must contribute massively for saving the climate vulnerable countries and saving the mother earth. The climate vulnerable countries using their own resources are endeavoring for reducing GHG emissions for achieving NDC set targets although they have no obligations for this. They desperately need additional fund for reducing more GHG emission. This financing must come as grant and not as loan or insurance. The developed world is not agreeing to this argument. Required investment is the demand of time and nature. If we fail to respond positively to the call of the nature, world civilization, our earth and our light would move towards destruction. Natural calamities have become a frequent phenomenon worldwide. This frequency would assume catastrophic level if we continue to fail in our obligations. Nature would take revenge and its intensity would take the world civilization and mother earth to the brink of destruction. Hence, good senses must dawn on all now for taking consensus decisions. The COP25 is expected to walk along this way. \</doc>

Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen on Wednesday said the scheduled visit of the Army Chief to Myanmar will be good for Bangladesh and 'open another line of negotiation' between the two countries over Rohingya repatriation. 'We want to resolve it (Rohingya crisis) through discussions. I think it (the visit) will go in favour of us. It'll be good for us," he told reporters at State guesthouse Padma. Dr Momen said Myanmar is not Bangladesh's enemy but a friend and in Myanmar, their army plays a very significant role. In this situation, he said, it will be good for Bangladesh if Army Chief General Aziz Ahmed goes there. The Army Chief recently said he will go to Myanmar next month where they will discuss issues relating to improving the relationship between the two countries. Many issues will come up and they may talk about the Rohingya issue but whatever happens, it will be in the interest of Bangladesh, he said. The Foreign Minister said Myanmar created the Rohingya problem and its solution depends on Myanmar, too He said they remain engaged on all front and expect a solution to Rohingya crisis through negotiation and discussion. 'Rohingya relocation process to Bhasan Char still on' Bangladesh is hosting over 1.1 million Rohingyas and most of them entered Cox's Bazar since August 25, 2017 amid a military crackdown on the mainly-Muslim ethnic minority in the Rakhine State. Asked whether the government postponed Rohingya relocation plan to Bhasan Char, the Foreign Minister said, 'Surely, it has not stopped. Our process is still ongoing.' He said Bhasan char relocation plan is a temporary arrangement as the existing Rohingya camp is overcrowded with risk of landslides and subsequent deaths. 'We won't force anybody to go there. Any relocation will be in voluntary nature. We wanted to relocate them there for their betterment and avoid risk or reduce risk,' Dr Momen added. The government of Bangladesh has already developed Bhasan Char island to accommodate some 1,00,000 Rohingyas. 'Ready to send back Rohingyas' On November 15, Myanmar made another venture to 'unduly attribute the non-commencement of repatriation' of the Rohingya entirely to non-cooperation and non-respect of bilateral arrangements by Bangladesh. Rejecting baseless accusation, falsification and misrepresentation of the facts over the Rohingya repatriation, Bangladesh on Sunday said the government of Myanmar must stop such concocted campaign. 'We're ready to send them (Rohingyas) back. We stand ready,' said Foreign Minister Dr Momen. Earlier, Bangladesh urged Myanmar to concentrate on the fulfillment of its obligations so that the forcibly displaced Rohingyas could return home in a "safe, dignified and voluntary" manner. It said continued rally of fabricated information, misrepresentation of facts, unsubstantiated claims, and unwarranted accusations to unjustifiably shift the onus of the Rohingya crisis on Bangladesh testifies the campaign of the government of Myanmar to avoid its obligations to create an environment in Rakhine conducive for the sustained repatriation and reintegration of the forcibly displaced Rohingya in their homeland. Not a single Rohingya was repatriated over the last two years due to Myanmar's 'failure' to build confidence among Rohingyas and lack of conducive environment in Rakhine State, officials here said. Bangladesh has so far handed over names of over 1,00,000 Rohingyas to the Myanmar authorities for verification and subsequently expediting their repatriation efforts but Myanmar is yet to take back its nationals from Bangladesh, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here. Earlier, Dr Momen briefed the reporters on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's participation at the 25th UN Climate Change Conference to be held in Madrid, Spain next month. The 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 25 ) will convene from December 2-13. The Prime Minister will leave Dhaka for Madrid on December 1 and will leave Madrid for Dhaka on December 3, said the Foreign Minister. Earlier, Chile, citing the impact of the ongoing anti-government protests, announced that it was withdrawing as host of the upcoming COP25 annual climate summit. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Nov. 29 -- Transparency International, Bangladesh (TIB) has renewed its call to the government to realise compensation from the international agencies as grant not as credit to address climate change effects. TIB made the call at a press conference in the city on Thursday ahead of COP25 , the UN Climate Change Conference, to be held on December 2 to 13 in Madrid of Paris. If the countries vulnerable to climate change effects, like Bangladesh, fail to realise grant from the international agencies and developed countries instead of credit, then the local climate victims will have to bear additional burden of it. TIB senior programme manager (climate finance governance) M Zakir Hossain Khan and programme manager (Climate finance policy integrity) Md. Mahfuzul Haque jointly presented a keynote paper. Grant continues to decline in the green climate fund (GCF), they read in the presentation. It has been observed that only 45 per cent of the GCF has been provided as grant, 41 per cent as loan and 14 per cent has been allocated as equity, it added. Funding through credit helps international finance and investment institutions to register with the GCF and turns the process into a profitable business and eventually the allegedly corrupt organisations become involved in it, which is unethical and a breach of pledge to the world community. TIB executive director Dr Iftekharuzzaman at the press conference emphasised strengthening climate diplomacy and negotiation capacity with the developed countries, saying they (the countries) are mainly responsible for carbon emission and grants should come from them as climate compensation. He suggested that Bangladesh along with other vulnerable countries convince the global agencies to provide additional fund to address the climate-caused loss and damage. Dr Iftekharuzzaman also renewed the call to the global agencies to ease the disbursement process of the pledged GCF grant for the vulnerable countries. He appreciated Bangladesh for its move and diplomacy in the global platforms in this regard and for taking a number of initiatives, including forming climate trust fund to address climate change effects in the local areas. The TIB executive director suggested that Bangladesh take a joint move with the vulnerable countries in COP25 to pressurise the developed countries into ensuring more and easy funding.

The 25th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) is taking place in the Spanish capital of Madrid on 2-13 December 2019. The annual climate conference has become a major event to discuss strategies and action plans to prevent and adopt with climate change and all the consequences that have been threatening the planet earth. The conference is attracting attention of the global community for a number of reasons: In the year 2020, the landmark Paris Agreement, signed by 196 countries of the World, will come into force. The global warming and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions continue to rise in the atmosphere, accelerating climate change. The UN assessment shows that the poor countries are hit hardest due to climate change. Rising sea levels, intense storms, unpredictable weather and rainfall, flood, larger and longer heatwaves have already affecting tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and in the countries of East and West Africa. Industrially developed countries are not away from the effects of climate change. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is created in the Paris Climate Conference in 2015 to assist these climate change victim countries in adopting practices to cope with the consequences of climate change. The governments of industrially developed economies formally agreed to the Paris Agreement to mobilize US$100 billion per year by 2020 through public and also from bilateral, multilateral and private funds. The second largest GHS emitter and the largest economy of the world, the USA has formally notified the United Nations on 4 November 2019 that it was withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. The US administration understands that the country will be the only UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) member state and the largest economy of the world, which has signed the Paris Agreement and will withdraw from the global initiative. As a result, the US will stop contributing to the GCF and will end reduction of carbon to atmosphere, roll back of fuel efficiency rules set by former US President Barak Obama. The climate conference within the framework of the UNFCCC is the international response to climate change. The Paris Agreement have been signed by 196 countries, including the European Union that establishes the basic obligations to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent climate change. COP25 is expected to gather 25, 000 people including the heads of governments and states, politicians, academia, researchers, bureaucrats, activists, observers etc. Last year in Katowice of Poland, more than 20, 000 people attended the COP24. The 25th COP is targeting to resolve some of the remaining unresolved issues on the rules that the participating countries (parties) to follow in their efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Also the meeting may announce new initiatives to respond to global warming to try to advance a global strategy for tackling rising global atmospheric temperatures. Also, the COP25 is expected to reach a consensus on funding for repairing damage of the climate crisis. The funding issue is especially important for the climate vulnerable, least developed and the small island nations. The GCF support is very important to enable the paradigm shift from  Carbonism (is a belief that fossil fuel is better than other energy sources and denies the scientific evidences that carbon pollution into atmosphere accelerates climate change and acidification of oceans and water bodies) to low emission and climate resilient development by innovation and investments in mitigation and adaptation projects in the developing world for transformational impacts of climate action. But the paths to secure implementation of the Paris Agreement are not simple mainly as the rich nations in the agreement generally are reluctant to fulfill their pledges to finance the GCF; not all of the major polluting nations want any legally binding date to reduce GHG emissions at the cost of their own usual lifestyles and economic philosophy. Despite the fact that the Trump administration in the US remains firm on withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, it has to wait until 04 November 2020 (4 years from the date USA entered in the Paris Accord) to realize it\' s intention into effect in accordance with the Article 28 of the Paris Agreement. The Article 28 stipulates that the a party (member country of the Paris Agreement 2015) cannot withdraw from the Paris Agreement 2015 before four years have been passed from the date the agreement came into effect. President Trump considers that the Paris Agreement is \' unfair, horrible, costly, one sided\' . However, optimists consider the Paris Agreement will exist because the rest of the world but USA support it. Instead of fighting climate change as a source of pain, the Paris Agreement 2015 \' recognizes that the victors in a post-carbon world those who move first\' . As reported by the German DW, among the above, the US being the biggest economy pledged to contribute US$ 3.0 billion, followed by Japan ($1.5 billion), the UK ($1.1 billion), France and Germany ($1.0 billion) each. Since then, many of these countries have increased their commitments and more countries have joined the fund. China pledged to contribute to the GCF US$ 3.1 billion over a non-specific timeframe. A total of US$ 10.3 billion was promised as well as signed to be paid by 43 countries in 2018, but US$ 6.5 billion has been paid. Japan is the largest contributor so far followed by the USA, UK, Germany, France and Sweden. USA government has paid US$ 1.0 billion as first installment and US$ 500 million as second installment for the GCF under Obama administration. Soon after President Trump took charge of the US government, he criticized Barak Obama\' s decision and since then USA did not pay its installments USA pledged. As per the agreement, USA owes US$ 2.0 billion or 20% of the total sum that was supposed to be funded by all nations in the first round of funding. Australia also declined to contribute to the GCF following President Trump\' s decision. So far, the rich economies of the world comprising of 27 countries announced the contribution to the GCF. The Executive Director of the GCF Mr. Yannick Glemarec observes that the increased contributions as positive but still falls short of the amount needed to meet its global goals. He is hopeful that additional resources will be found for the GCF. The European Union and China are pouring money into renewable energy heavily and these two countries have been controlling the global supply chain of renewable energy products and technology. Critics consider that by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, President Trump has damaged American credibility abroad. The American credibility crisis has been reflected in the global forums. If USA continues its isolated policies, there might be a time of revaluation in the world arena. The US banks and mighty US dollars will further get isolated and alternative banks and currencies will make US reentry to market complicated. In the backdrop of the increasing natural disasters and dwindling bio-diversity, the mainstream political parties in the countries have been compelled to respond on \' unequivocal\' public concerns over climate change and human sufferings from global warming. The latest example is the UK election manifesto of the major political parties participating in the election where political parties have supported a transition to net zero GHG emission within a few decades and are competing with each other on the policies how to attain the target. Despite the \' Brexit\' debates hanging over the country, UK members of parliament (House of Commons) have unanimously passed (on 30 April 2019) a motion to declare an \' environmental and climate emergency\' . Earlier the parliaments of Scotland and Wales declared their won climate emergency. The analysts consider that the approved nonbinding climate emergency motion in the UK parliament was reached unanimously because thousands of people took to the streets for a sustained period of protests from Extinction Rebellion movement, a number of environmental groups, UK Student Climate Network, Friends of Earth and others including the school strikers led by Greta Thunberg. On 13 November 2019, Bangladesh National Parliament has adopted a motion on planetary emergency arising out of the global climate change, pollution and biodiversity depletion worldwide. The approved planetary emergency motion ahead of the upcoming COP25 calls for the global community to act urgently and decisively in achieving the net zero (carbon) emissions well before 2050. The COP25 could be a good forum to present the resolution adopted by the Bangladesh Parliament and share views of the world community on how the planetary emergency can be addressed. The auspicious COP25 forum may serve as an opportunity to discuss the issues related to planetary emergency and help formulate the implementation plans and get supports from the global community on planetary emergency. As Bangladesh remains the most vulnerable hotspots for global climate change and the adverse impacts, it invites \' the global community must act urgently, decisively and with considerably higher ambition in achieving net zero emissions well before 2050, capping temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius and transitioning swiftly to low carbon economies as overarching priorities.\' The resolution calls for planetary justice and climate equity so that the climate vulnerable countries are assisted with finance and technology to meet their development aspirations in the quickest and the shortest time. Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina will attend the UN Climate Change Conference in Madrid. She is expected to apprise the world leaders on the steps taken by the Bangladesh government to address the challenges of the climate change, and urge the international community for considering climate financing for providing compensation to the climate change affected countries in line with the \' Warsaw International Mechanism\' . The COP19 held in Warsaw, Poland in 2013 established the mechanism to address for \' Loss and Damage\' with climate change impacts associated with countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. \</doc>

Bangladesh should claim compensation for loss and damage caused by climate change during the next Conference of Parties (COP) meeting as its consequences to this effect are increasing, said an expert. Dr Saleemul Huq, senior fellow in the climate change group International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), said despite being a climate change adaptation country, damage and loss facing the country are quite high as no steps are taken by some countries responsible for climate change.  They do not want to take measures and even do not want to compensate, " he said while addressing a national level dialogue organized jointly by UN Women, Bangladesh Centre for Advance Study(BCAS) and EmPower Women for Climate Resilient Societies in the city prior to holding of COP 25 of UNFCCC. The dialogue with stakeholders voicing issues, concern and making recommendations for the upcoming U N F C C C COP 25 was addressed, among others, by Additional Secretary to Ministry of Women and Children Affairs Aynul Kabir, UN Women Country Director Shoko Ishikawa, Country Director of ActionAid Bangladesh Farah Kabir and Director of Department of Environment Mirza Shawkat Ali. \</doc>

The IEA hosted a high-profile discussion this month to review how the energy sector can meaningfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The speakers included Kwasi Kwarteng, the Minister for Business, Energy and Clean Growth of the United Kingdom, which holds the Presidency of the upcoming COP26 this year; Micha Kurtyka, Poland's Minister of Climate and President of COP24; and Joan Groizard Payeras, Director-General at the Ministry for the Ecological Transition of Spain, which hosted COP25 . The discussions at IEA headquarters in Paris focused on how real-world energy solutions and ambitious policies can enable the world to reach and even exceed climate goals. The audience of ambassadors, business leaders, investors, energy experts and journalists included representatives from more than 40 countries.  Without solving the challenge of the energy sector, we have no chance of solving our climate challenge," Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA\' s Executive Director, said in his opening remarks. "We want 2019 to be remembered as the year of peaking global emissions and the 2020s as the decade of the decline in emissions. And the energy sector is ready to be part of the solution." \</doc>

Dhaka, Nov. 4 -- Barely a week passes without alarming news of the most recent scientific research into the global climate crisis compounding a growing sense of urgency, particularly the impact on small island states from rising sea levels and extreme weather. Latest findings suggest that several hundred million more people than previously thought are at risk of coastal flooding due to climate change. Climate Central, a non-profit research and news organisation, found data used in past calculations overstated the elevation of many low-lying coastal communities. And for the people of the Bahamas who had just endured Hurricane Dorian, the most intense tropical cyclone on record to hit their islands, it came as little surprise when the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) soon after released its landmark special report on the planet's oceans and frozen regions, warning of "multiple climate-related hazards" for coastal regions. "The ocean is warmer, more acidic and less productive," the IPCC report stated. The "Blue Pacific" concept sees the island states establishing themselves as "large ocean states" and guardians of the region rather than "small island states" Oceans are absorbing heat twice as fast as just two decades ago, with hundreds of billions of tonnes of melting ice raising sea levels at an average rate of 3.6 millimetres a year, more than twice as fast as during the last century. If greenhouse gas emissions "continue to increase strongly", the IPCC report said, then levels could rise more than a metre by 2100. Some island states in the Pacific face becoming uninhabitable. As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres noted while visiting Tuvalu, the sea level rise in some Pacific countries is four times greater than the world average, posing "an existential threat" to several island states. Against this background the UN COP25 climate change summit scheduled to be held in Santiago in December had been dubbed the Blue COP, with expectations of a focus on the oceans and commitments of aid to poorer nations most at risk. So it comes as a serious blow that President Sebastian Pinera has just announced that Chile is calling off its hosting of COP25 because of mass anti-government protests rocking the country. While the UN anxiously looks for an alternative venue (and Santiago had been the second choice after Brazil's newly elected president, Jair Bolsonaro, pulled out of hosting it), the small island states of the Pacific will be making their voices heard as they seek to confirm themselves in the role of custodians of the world's largest region. It is an existential struggle but it is not a blame game however. As Micronesia's President David Panuelo declared last week in The Diplomat: "Rather than point fingers, we must all point the way toward solutions." "No single country created this problem, and certainly a small country like ours is bearing far greater responsibility for the solution than we ever contributed to the crisis in the first place. But we sit shoulder to shoulder in a coalition which has set a goal of growing economies while achieving 30 percent marine protection globally," he wrote in a plea for action to save the oceans. "Everyone must do more when garbage patches larger than entire countries float in the Pacific, and rising carbon dioxide levels increase ocean acidity and devastate coral reefs and marine life." The Pacific Community, the principal scientific and technical organisation in the region and founded as the SPC in 1947, counts 22 Pacific island countries and territories among its members who see themselves as the "tip of the spear" in terms of the impacts of climate change and their efforts to adapt. SPC has recently established the Pacific Community Centre for Ocean Science (PCCOS) to provide the framework to "focus its scientific and technical assistance on providing solutions that will build, sustain, and drive blue economies in Pacific Island countries and territories" and support SDG 14 of conserving and sustainably using oceans and marine resources. The SPC's new and growing Pacific Data Hub is a public resource of data and publications on the Pacific across key sectors, from education and human rights to oceans and geoscience. Such initiatives reflect how Pacific Island states have grown more assertive in their diplomacy, becoming more active in global multilateral forums and using their voices and votes for increased leverage rather than the old reliance on support from Australia and New Zealand. The "Blue Pacific" concept sees the island states establishing themselves as "large ocean states" and guardians of the region rather than "small island states". As stewards of the Pacific with their cultural identity shaped by the ocean, the Blue Pacific framework seeks to establish leadership on issues, with smart policies backed by scientific expertise and data. As Micronesia's president has reminded us, the climate crisis is neither abstract nor "tomorrow's faraway challenge". It is happening now and as the IPCC's special report on the oceans and cryosphere warned in September the crisis is gathering speed, as seen in the recent acceleration of sea level rise. In Antarctica the rate of ice loss tripled in the decade 2007-2016. May and August in 2019 were the warmest on record for the Arctic while this year saw the summer minimum extent of sea ice reaching a joint-second lowest in 40 years of satellite records. As summarised by Carbon Brief, the IPCC warns that this accelerating ice loss, and the more rapid sea level rises it causes, will continue to gather pace over this century regardless of whether greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. The "likely" maximum rise of 1.1 metres by 2100 is some 10cm above the top-end estimate from its previous estimate, while a rise of 2 metres cannot be ruled out. Such warnings were intended to provide input at COP25 for world leaders who face mounting calls to adopt more ambitious goals for carbon emission cuts. Those negotiations will not be happening in December in Santiago after all. An alternative must be found urgently. HYPERLINK contentservices@htlive.com \</doc>

P#42#P World leaders have come together in Madrid, Spain, for the UN Climate Change Conference, COP25 , where they will deliberate on the environmental crisis facing humanity. The issue of climate change, a key global conversation, has been brought to the fore by youth activists, mainly students such as Greta Thunberg, whose call for urgent climate action culminated in thousands gathering in New York City for a climate strike during the UN General Assembly in September. At the gathering, in which more than 200,000 people marched across Manhattan, one teenager highlighted stories of a community that remains some of the most vulnerable to climate change and yet remains under-reported: The women, children, and Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Sixteen-year-old Rebeca Sabnam stood in front of a crowd of thousands, recalling the times her uncle had to carry her to school on his back during floods in her hometown Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. 'I am from Bangladesh, a country that exemplifies how interconnected the climate emergency is to racial justice and poverty,' she said, referencing the discourse on how people of colour are often disproportionately affected by climate change. Sabnam later told Al Jazeera she thought that when she mentioned Bangladesh, she would hear nothing but silence. Instead, she was overwhelmed by the crowd's roaring response. 'The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue, it's an urgent human rights issue,' said Sabnam to the cheers of the crowd in New York. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 10 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's presence at the COP25 in Madrid last week finally proved to be quite vital and timely. This year she, like in the previous years, has laid renewed emphasis on the impact of climate change --- by focusing on the issue of climate migrants. She has made quite a bleak observation while speaking at a roundtable meeting of the conference. Upon drawing a post-climate change picture of the country, the premier homed in on a normally less discussed issue: people displaced by sea-level rise, also called climate migrants. She termed the brewing climate change disaster an existential threat to Bangladesh and a great number of vulnerable countries. And quite rightfully she wanted to know about the fate of these displaced people. Her worries stemmed from the fact that Bangladesh alone cannot cope with the massive crisis. That she would place an appeal to the industrialised nations to stand by the country in accommodating the climate refugees was quite expected. The issue of permanent shelters for the migrants is directly linked to livelihoods and the other prerequisites for survival. The Prime Minister has called for sincere cooperation of the global community in this regard. Meanwhile, climate change watchers have warned that even a small rise in the sea level will leave devastating impacts on the country's coastal region. As they predict, as a consequence of the sea-level rise Bangladesh may lose 17.5 per cent of its land mass by 2050. It will lead to displacement of around 20-30 million people. Bangladesh has been considered for decades one of the lands most vulnerable to climate change-induced sea-level rise. Of late, the German Watch Global Climate Index Report has put Bangladesh among the 10 most vulnerable nations feared to be affected by climate change. It's a dreadful picture. Given the dour message lurking in the report, days may not be far when Bangladesh would be bracketed with the vulnerable countries in Africa, Latin America and small island territories. Meanwhile, four groups comprising the highly vulnerable countries numbering 100 out of 195 and belonging to a special segment have taken a collective stand to fight climate change impacts. The segment is called Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) under UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). Perhaps it was the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who could unsparingly delve into the approaching climate apocalypse at the plenary of the COP25 (the 25th annual Conference of the Parties). The UN climate change conference is being held from 2-13 December, 2019. Without mincing words, the UN chief told the opening plenary that the mankind was confronted with a climate crisis threatening civilisation itself. Elaborating, Guterres said, "(At present) One is the path of surrender, where we have sleepwalked past the point of no return, jeopardising the health and safety of everyone on this planet." The UN chief was quite blunt and incisive in his observations. He posed a most critical question to the nations, "Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned?" The writing on the wall is far from being reassuring. The maximum global temperature has unanimously been set at 1.5 degrees Celsius, lowering from 2 degrees Celsius threshold, above the pre-Industrial average between 1850 and1900. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) says the global temperatures so far this year were 1.1 degrees Celsius. It has put 2019 on course to be in the top three warmest years ever recorded, and possibly the hottest non-El Nino year yet. The WMO's portrayal of the global warming scenario for the outgoing year is quite appalling. As it has noted, man-made emissions from burning fossil fuels, building infrastructures, (methods of) growing crops and transporting goods mean 2019 is set to break the record for atmospheric carbon concentrations, locking in further warming. The WMO disclosed this in its report released at COP25 . The global warming-vulnerable countries nowadays use the phrase 'polluters pay' targeting the large industrialised countries, especially the US and some other greenhouse gas-emitting nations. There are strong reasons for it. Most of the least developed countries (LDCs) with weak economies contribute little to the fast-rising global warming. Ironically, it is them who will, finally, have to bear the brunt of the global climate change catastrophe in the making. Many countries have already been made to begin feeling the heat. Bangladesh can boast of its multi-pronged initiatives taken to preempt the onslaught of the climate change. Apart from the all-out attempts to avail its share of the climate impact funds, the country has put in place strategies like making a national adaptation plan. Besides, it has adopted impact mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emission drastically. The greatest challenge, however, remains in the form of rehabilitating the internally displaced people. The task calls for massive infrastructure building and fund mobilisation. Bangladesh cannot be expected to achieve full success in coping with the climate impact challenge with its limited resources. For this, it has to rely on cooperation of international organisations like the UN, and large donor countries.

Environment, Forests and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin on Wednesday underscored the need for extending help with financial and technological resources to the countries that are already suffering from vulnerability due to climate change. 'Those countries which are already suffering from vulnerability due to climate change must be helped with financial and technological resources to adapt adequately as well as in developing on a low carbon path,' he said. The minister came up with the remarks while speaking at the ministerial high-level segment at the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) here. 'Nobody, no nation will be spared, sooner or later all will perish. Against this perspective, Bangladesh, on its own, has tried so far to limit the adverse consequences of climate change in a planned manner,' he added. Shahab Uddin warned against making any mistake at this critical moment of collective action. 'We have only one earth to live. And when it becomes inhabitable, it becomes so for every one of us on earth,' he said. The two-day high-level segment from December 10-11 was attended by ministers from 200 countries. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 14 -- Bangladesh has demanded simplification of the climate financing conditions of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for the affected countries. It placed the demand on the closing day of the Conference of the Parties or COP25 in the Spanish capital of Madrid on Thursday. The country also sought long-term financing by the emitting and developed countries and not from any market mechanism. "The developed countries are trying to shift the responsibility of financing from market mechanism which may involve profit-making," information minister Hasan Mahmud told the 'high-level segment' of the event. Mr Mahmud said Bangladesh could avail only $90 million from GCF, although there is a $9.50-billion fund. The minister, however, said Bangladesh is certainly advanced in its capacity than any other country in getting GCF funds. He said the developed countries have been spending billions of dollars in defence sector but they do not contribute to GCF. "The USA has contributed only $1.0 out of the total $3.0 billion it committed. But it backtracked from giving the rest $2.0 billion which is frustrating." When asked, Transparency International Bangladesh executive director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said the minister has rightly demanded simplification of the harsh conditions of GCF funds. The affected countries do not get funds for the reason, he told the FE. Bangladesh has to continue climate diplomacy and place its demands for compensation for the loss and damage as new and additional funds and not as insurance. It also needs to enhance its capacity and skills to access GCF fund and upgrade its transparency and accountability mechanism, Mr Zaman concluded.

UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has praised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's leadership in addressing the issue of climate change in the international arena. He also mentioned Bangladesh's remarkable contribution to peace operations as well as the reputation and professionalism of Bangladeshi peacekeepers. The UN chief made the remarks when Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the United Nations Rabab Fatima presented her credentials to the UN Secretary General (SG) at the UN Headquarters on Friday. Guterres recalled his meeting with Prime Minister Hasina during the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) held in Madrid last week. Rabab Fatima becomes the 15th Permanent Representative (PR) of Bangladesh to the UN since 1974 when Bangladesh became the member of the apex body under the leadership of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, said the Bangladesh Mission on Saturday. She was Bangladesh Ambassador to Japan prior to this appointment. After presenting her credentials, the PR conveyed greetings from the President and Prime Minister of Bangladesh to the Secretary General. Guterres termed Bangladesh as a friend of the UN, and lauded Bangladesh's socio-economic developments under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. He said Bangladesh is a valued member of the UN and is making an important contribution to the work of the global body. The PR reiterated Bangladesh's continued commitment and support to the UN and to the Secretary General's initiatives and efforts. Fatima and Guterres also discussed the Rohingya crisis, and the SG reassured that he will continue his efforts towards finding an early and durable solution. The PR conveyed the invitation to the SG to attend the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman starting March 2020, and shared that the occasion will be celebrated globally in a befitting manner. Recalling the recent decision of UNESCO to celebrate the birth centenary, she said that Bangladesh plans to organise events and programmes with the United Nations in New York, and in this regard, she requested the SG's support. Ambassador Rabab Fatima, a career diplomat, joined the Bangladesh Foreign Service in 1989 and held important position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Dhaka, and also served in Bangladesh Permanent Missions in New York and Geneva; and the Missions in Kolkata and Beijing in various capacities. Ambassador Fatima has extensive experience and specialisation in human rights and humanitarian issues. She has also worked with the Commonwealth Secretariat, London, as Head of Human Rights; and with the International Organization for Migration as Regional Representative for South and Southwest Asia. In the credential presentation ceremony, among others, Deputy PR Tareq Md Ariful Islam, Minister Monwar Hossain, UN Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary A DiCarlo and Chef de Cabinet of the UNSG Maria Luiza Ribeirio Viotti were present. \</doc>

Mentioning that Bangladesh is not getting the compensation it needs to meet the climate risks under the Paris Agreement, Transparency International of Bangladesh (TIB) on Thursday demanded adequate and transparent financing by industrialised countries responsible for climate change. 'As the Paris Agreement doesn't have a legal agreement on the issue, the international financial institutions (WB, ADB and IMF), along with the United States, are creating a vicious cycle and withholding the withdrawal of funds,' said TIB Executive Director Dr Iftekharuzzaman. He came up with the remarks at a press conference arranged by TIB at the city's Dhanmondi on the forthcoming 25th Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) slated to be held in Madrid, Spain from December 3 to December 12. According to TIB studies, Bangladesh has been financed with 85 million dollars so far over the last three years from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) although the country needs more than 2.5 billion dollars to tackle climate risks. 'Considering the compensation policy of the polluting countries, donations should be guaranteed instead of loan. Underdeveloped countries will have to collectively raise the demand for the smoother supply of necessary funds from the GCF and other international funds Bangladesh will have to play a significant role [in this regard],' said Dr Iftekhar. TIB denounced the proposed bond and insurance-based funding scheme terming it 'inconsistent' with the fundamentals of grant-based adaptation funding for the affected countries. They warned that such plans will only help boost the profits of corporate houses. 'Collecting insurance premiums from the affected people and families will put greater strain on them and increase the financial burden on those at risk,' said M Zakir Hossain Khan, Senior Programme Manager, Climate Finance and Governance, TIB. However, the TIB Executive Director called for approaching the proposed climate insurance scheme with caution. 'The government must accept the scheme only after assessing and determining the positive factors.' He further mentioned that the government must step up efforts to reduce the number of coal-based energy plants. 'But, Bangladesh plans to increase coal-based power plants to 30 that will emit about 11.5 croremetric tons of extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As a result, carbon emission will endanger the population of the country.' 'More importantly,' Dr Iftekhar added, 'The country will lose 11 percent of its surface area due to sea level rise.' TIB also demanded a separate fund to tackle the losses and damages due to climate change which will have financed by the developed countries responsible most for the climate change. \</doc>

2020 is the most crucial year yet for humanity\' s plan to dodge the bullet of catastrophic global warming, experts said recently, warning that the narrow path to safety was riddled with pitfalls, from the US election to Brexit. When nations struck the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to limit temperature rises under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), they agreed on five-year periods in which climate action could be implemented, assessed and boosted. 2020 is the year the landmark deal goes into effect, yet almost three decades of diplomatic wrangling has fallen far short of what science says is needed to avert disastrous climate change. A crucial UN summit at which leaders will finalize their action plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is set to open in Glasgow on November 9 -- just six days after a US general election that could see President Donald Trump win a second term. Trump shocked the world in 2017 when he said the United States -- history\' s largest emitter -- was withdrawing from the Paris agreement. It is due to leave the deal on November 4. After a year of climate-related disasters, from cyclones and flooding in Africa and southeast Asia to devastating wildfires in Australia and California, nations in December failed to make progress during the annual UN Climate Change Conference COP 25 . \</doc>

I n response to country needs to mobilize low-carbon, climate-resilient investments, a new global public good announced recently will aim to increase the flow of capital in developing countries to meet climate ambitions. The Climate Investment Platform (CIP) is an inclusive partnership welcoming all stakeholders from governments and international organizations to the private sector to scale-up climate action and translate ambitious national climate targets into concrete investments on the ground. With energy accounting for two thirds of total greenhouse gas emissions, the platform\' s first service line is dedicated to the global transition to clean energy. Other service lines, such as adaptation, land use, cities and infrastructure will be launched in the first quarter of 2020. By decluttering and streamlining support to developing countries, the platform aims to accelerate action and advance climate investment in developing countries. Progress will be presented at UNFCCC COP 25 in December 2019. The service offered by the CIP covers four key building blocks along the climate finance value-chain: supporting governments to specify ambitious energy targets and scale up their nationally determined contributions (NDCs), establishing well-designed, implemented and enforced clean energy policies and regulations, financial de-risking of energy projects, and a marketplace to connect clean energy investors and project sponsors. \</doc>

Dhaka, Dec. 2 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called for action to stave off climate threats to create a world liveable for the future generation. Hasina spoke on "action for survival" as the leader of one of the most vulnerable nations at the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP25 , in Madrid on Monday. The Climate Vulnerable Forum, or CVF, and the Vulnerable 20 Group are great examples of South-South and Triangular cooperation and should build further on the current accomplishments, said Hasina. "Our children will not forgive us if we fail to ensure their future. Every moment, the cost of our inaction is devastating every living person on earth. The time to act is now," she said. Climate change is a stark reality for the world which has now caused irreversible damage to the human life and environment, ecology and natural resources, said Hasina. "Since the Earth Summit in 1992, we have not been able to secure much progress in the reduction of greenhouse gases, their emission is still on the rise. This trend is now unsustainable for the Earth," the prime minister said. The vulnerable countries suffer the most due to their limited capacities to cope with climate threats and specific geographical features, she said. "We are bearing the brunt of the damage though we made negligible or no contribution to the menace. This constitutes a serious injustice and must be acknowledged by the global community," said Hasina. The global climate landscape has changed considerably since the Forum first met in November 2009 in Male. Unfortunately, the progress under the UNFCCC process is "very slow and largely inadequate", said Hasina. Now there is a situation where the most vulnerable countries, which deserve the highest level of priority, are failing to access whatever support that is being realised, the prime minister said. "The creation of a new CVF and V20 Trust Fund and possibility of having a new special rapporteur on climate change would be a great success." More than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar have taken refuge in Bangladesh wreaking a havoc on the environment, said Hasina. "We already have the firsthand experience of the worst kind of environmental calamity." On mitigation, the world sees extreme reluctance on part of major emitters, said Hasina. "This may wreck the international climate regime and put our countries at the risk of peril. Hence, we should not hesitate to demand accountability for inaction," she said. It is widely accepted that the gravest effect of climate change may be on human migration, according to Hasina. "Extreme weather events are already displacing many more people than violent conflicts. Slow-onset events like sea-level rise and desertification get even lower global focus. We must work towards correcting this imbalance," she said. "We must appreciate that migration could be an effective adaptation strategy, as we focus on enhancing adaptation capacities of affected communities. Hence, relocation and protection of displaced persons need due focus in global discourse to ensure their protection. We need to commence discussion on the creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of people displaced due to climate change."

Demanding simplifying climate financing process, Information Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud has said the long-term funding should come from the states not from any market mechanism. 'The developed nations are trying to impose the long-term financing on market mechanism and with this the matter of profit would come. Without profit, funding would not come from market mechanism," he said. Dr Mahmud came up with the observations while addressing "High-Level Segment" of the conference on behalf of Bangladesh at COP 25 in Madrid, Spain on Thursday, according to a press release received in Dhaka on Friday. Mentioning the fact that Bangladesh has only received USD nine crore from around USD 950 crore Green Climate Fund till now, the minister said the developed nations are spending billions in the military sector, but not giving money in the Green Climate Fund that they had pledged. 'The US had pledged to provide USD 300 crore to the fund, but after giving USD 100 crore, they have withdrawn the rest of the money. It is very disappointing," Dr Hasan Mahmud said. Urging to make the funding process much easier, the information minister said as the process of providing fund is difficult the climate affected nations like Bangladesh are not getting money that they desired. 'Bangladesh has so far received USD nine crore from Green Climate Fund due to its capability. Bangladesh is not only capable, but also is much ahead of many other countries in this regard. Bangladesh is the first country to formulate Climate Change Action Plan to tackle blow of climate change. We have formed the trust fund from our own resources and implemented 720 projects from this fund," he added. The minister is scheduled to return home on December 14. \</doc>

Mentioning that Bangladesh is facing multi-dimensional threats due to the adverse impact of climate change as the country has become the innocent victim of global warming, Information Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud said the international community should initiate integrated approach to cope with the adverse impact of climate change. 'Bangladesh is still one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change . . . The carbon emission rate of Bangladesh is only 0.5 tonnes per person," he said, addressing a sideline event titled 'Climate Change Initiative of Bangladesh' at COP 25 in Madrid, Spain, according to a press release received in Dhaka on Thursday. Bangladesh, Korea and Japan jointly organised the sideline event. The impact of climate change is now visible in Bangladesh, Hasan said, adding "Though Bangladesh is not responsible for climate change, the country has taken initiatives to tackle climate change and installed over five million solar systems to deal the adverse impact of global warming." Depicting the present scenario of Bangladesh caused by climate change, he said "Sea levels are rising and salinity is increasing in coastal areas. Desertification has affected some areas of northern Bangladesh. The ice of the Himalayas, the main source of water in Bangladesh, is melting fast. As a result, Bangladesh is now facing a multi-dimensional danger due to climate change." The minister urged the global community to take united initiative to combat the devastating effects of climate change. Hasan, also former environment minister, said Bangladesh is a small country with a large population. 'Our priority sectors are education and health. But we cannot focus on them due to climate change," he added. The minister said Bangladesh has prepared an action plan for tackling the climate change and undertaken 720 domestically funded projects to deal with the catastrophic situation, the release added. \</doc>

Climate negotiations opening next week in Madrid must prioritise funding for nations already dealing with the cost of drought, floods and superstorms made worse by rising temperatures, more than 150 environmental groups said Friday. In an open letter to the president of the COP 25 talks, Chile's environment minister Carolina Schmidt, the organisations urged agreement on "the creation of a comprehensive financing facility, including debt relief, for developing countries experiencing such disasters." They said money should come from wealthy nations - historically most responsible for planet-warming carbon emissions - in the form of tax on financial transactions, international air travel and fossil fuels. The Madrid conference is set to be dominated by discussions on so-called "loss and damage" funding, with a sharp divide between developing nations and richer polluters over how finance should be structured. Green groups this week said the increased pace and intensity of climate disasters, such as the twin cyclones that devastated parts of Mozambique this year, means that funding needs boosting to keep track. They said the amount needed for loss and damage would top $300 billion annually by 2030. 'Without finance to help countries cope with climate-induced loss and damage, the most vulnerable parts of the world will sink deeper into debt and poverty every time they are hit by climate disasters they did not cause," the letter said. Storms in Mozambique this year displaced millions, destroyed homes and crops, inflicting an estimated $3 billion in damages - roughly 20 percent of the country's GDP. But without a global, unified process for climate damage funding, countries are not yet obliged to get their chequebooks out. After Cyclone Idai, the International Monetary Fund provided Mozambique with an emergency load of $118 million - woefully short of what was needed. 'Wealthy countries have been ignoring developing nations' demands for financial support to repair the loss and damage caused by climate disasters," said Harjeet Singh, global climate change lead at ActionAid. \</doc>

The Jatiya Sangsad on Wednesday unanimously adopted a historic motion declaring a planetary emergency on account of the existential crisis of climate change and calling on the global community to act urgently and decisively in achieving the net zero (carbon) emissions well before 2050. The Bangladesh Parliament is the first legislature to adopt such a resolution, as revealed during the long discussion on the motion. The House passed the motion ahead of the upcoming COP 25 - the UN's annual climate conference scheduled to take place this year from December 2-13 in Madrid. The Conference of Parties (COP) is the supreme decision-making body of the Convention. Ruling Awami League lawmaker Saber Hossain Chowdhury piloted the motion in the House. The MPs across the benches passed the motion unanimously by voice vote when Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, who was in the chair, placed it for voting following the discussion. Taking the resolution, the House declared a planetary emergency on account of existential crisis of climate changes, devastating impact of disasters and increase in extreme weather events, irreparable loss of bio-diversity, looming food insecurity, rising water stress, unprecedented pressure on oceans and unsustainable use of resources. 'The global community must act urgently, decisively and with considerably higher ambition in achieving net zero emissions well before 2050, capping temperature rise to 1.5 degree Celsius and transitioning swiftly to low carbon economies as overarching priorities,' said the Bangladesh Parliament. 'Despite being least responsible to these problems, Bangladesh and many other countries in developing world, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are the most impacted and vulnerable,' said the Parliament adding that actions at global levels have not matched commitments and rhetoric. It said planetary justice and climate equity demands that these vulnerable countries are assisted with finance and technology to meet their development aspirations in the quickest and the shortest time. The House, therefore called on parliaments, governments, the United Nations and all stakeholders to work on a war footing, as custodians and as one team, to protect and fortify our planet- the only Home we have. Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam, State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid, Awami League MPs Tofail Ahmed, Begum Matia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Rafiqul Islam (Bir Uttam), Kazi Nabil Ahmed, Nazrul Islam Babu and Waseqa Ayesha Khan, BNP MPs Harunur Rashid and Rumeen Farhana, Jatiya Party MPs Mujibul Haque (Chunnu) and Rustum Ali Faraji, and Jasod MP Shirin Akhter supported the motion joining the discussion. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 11 -- As they extend their power grids, build more roads and bigger cities, and cultivate forestland, developing countries in Asia and the Pacific are increasingly contributing to the global climate change problem. Two of the top three emitters of greenhouse gases are developing countries in Asia - the People's Republic of China and India. At the same time, five Asian developing countries are among the top 10 most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. Across the region, livelihoods and economic growth are increasingly exposed to climate change impacts and disaster risk. Clearly, Asia and the Pacific must play a strong role in efforts to address climate change. As the region's development bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to remaining the partner of choice for climate action by our developing member countries. In 2015, as world leaders gathered in New York to launch the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs), ADB made a bold announcement - a pledge to double our climate investment to $6.0 billion annually by the end of 2020. Coinciding with the call for action at COP25 , the United Nations' Conference on Climate Change, ADB has proudly reached this achievement one year ahead of time. ADB's climate-related financing for 2019 comprises $1.4 billion for financing adaptation and $4.8 billion for mitigating climate change. The feat is the result of a singular focus to integrate climate actions into our entire operations. ADB has introduced climate risk screening of our project portfolio, undertaken diagnostics on the critical infrastructure at risk in the region, and introduced new financing instruments such as contingent disaster risk financing for financial resilience. ADB is strengthening its investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, sustainable transport and urban development, and climate smart agriculture. This has been accompanied by actions to enhance transparency of our climate operations by publicly disclosing project-level information of our climate portfolio and enhancing capacity and technical assistance for delivery. The spirit of One ADB has underpinned this achievement, with the collaboration of our sovereign and non-sovereign operations and knowledge departments steering us toward this target. One example of the many that illustrates this is the Pacific Renewable Energy Programme, which is providing an innovative blend of loans, guarantees, and letters of credit to encourage private sector investments in renewable energy. ADB's treasury department also contributed to the endeavour by issuing green bonds amounting to $5.0 billion as an added financing mechanism. In addition to scaling up its own climate financing, ADB has been working on new and innovative co-financing opportunities with public and private partners. For example, ADB has mobilised concessional financing from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for nine projects worth a total of $473 million in grants and concessional financing. Building on the momentum of our climate finance milestone, ADB is pursuing new and ambitious targets on climate change for the coming decade in our Strategy 2030 - cumulative climate financing of $80 billion from 2019-2030 and a commitment to make 75 per cent of our projects climate-relevant by 2030. Furthermore, by steadily increasing shadow carbon price, which factors climate costs into our project economic analysis, ADB is reflecting the urgency of shifting to low carbon alternatives. However, given the narrowing window for avoiding catastrophic climate change, mobilising finance at the necessary speed and scale remains a huge challenge. The Nationally Determined Contributions of many countries have outlined the financing needed to achieve their climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement. According to one estimate, it is $4.4 trillion or $349 billion annually [L. Weischer et al. 2016. Investing in Ambition: Analysis of the Financial Aspects in (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions. Briefing Paper. Germanwatch e.V. and Perspectives Climate Group: Bonn. HYPERLINK https://germanwatch.org/en https://germanwatch.org/en While there are no robust and comprehensive estimates available for the Asia and Pacific region, an assessment by ADB on Asia's infrastructure needs found that $200 billion will be needed annually to address climate actions in energy, water, and transport [ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia's Infrastructure Needs]. Though national governments and development financing institutions should devote more of their financial resources, the bulk of climate financing will necessarily have to come from private investors. This highlights the need to deploy climate financing in a way that enables and mobilises private sector finance. But the good news is there is a robust, and growing, body of evidence that the benefits of climate action already far outweigh the costs - representing a significant opportunity for the private sector. For example, the New Climate Economy Initiative, to which I have contributed as a Commissioner, has found that investment in low-carbon growth is associated with a cumulative economic gain of $26 trillion until 2030. Meanwhile, a recent report by the Global Commission on Adaptation found that investing $1.8 trillion globally from 2020 to 2030 in five key areas - early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dryland agriculture, mangrove protection, and more resilient water resources - could yield $7.1 trillion in net benefits. The provision of finance is just one part of the climate change puzzle - high technology, policy support, and capacity development to build better institution are also critical. But by further scaling up collective actions on addressing climate change by national governments, development partners, and the private sector, we can greatly respond to the voices of younger generations and vulnerable populations across the world for bolder action that ensures our common future on a healthy planet.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday asked the global community to take the responsibility for climate migrants as they are getting displaced for no fault of their own. 'As our people will be displaced for no fault of ours we expect the international community to shoulder the responsibility of accommodating them and providing them with livelihood,' she said. The Prime Minister was addressing a general roundtable discussion at the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP25 ). Sheikh Hasina said, 'All 'Funds' to fight climate change must be replenished as per our agreement, including the $100 billion annual contribution.' She said the Convention and the Paris Agreement recognise the special circumstances and needs of LDCs and 'Particularly Vulnerable Countries' based on the principle of the 'common but differentiated responsibility', and this recognition must be adhered to in every delivery mechanism of the climate finance. Hasina warned that there is a limit to resilience and adaptation. 'We simply have to stop the increase of global temperature at 1.5 degree centigrade more than the pre-industrial level.' Despite lack of interest among many to adopt adequate measures, he said, Bangladesh is a firm believer of collective efforts and understanding to fight climate change and UN is the most appropriate platform. 'We think to stop further degradation of environment, we have some useful international mechanisms like Paris Agreement and other relevant global instruments and mechanisms, and we must strictly implement our agreed provisions,' Hasina said. From now on, she said, the principle of 'Loss and Damage' must feature prominently in all negotiations and the 'Warsaw International Mechanism' must be given a much stronger mandate to explore financing losses and damages through its review. 'The global landscape of climate finance is highly fragmented -- complex and grossly inadequate,' the PM said. She said the concept of equity or fairness is a fundamental issue that underlies the framing and operationalisation of the Paris Agreement under the Convention through which greater levels of international cooperation under the Convention and its Paris Agreement may be achieved. 'We hope that finalisation of robust rules under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement must continue environmental integrity, avoid double counting and other accounting loopholes, deliver a share of proceeds from the market mechanism for the Adaptation Fund to assist overall mitigation in global emission,' she said. 'Any consequence of failure to deliver a climate action plan must fall equally on every country, especially the countries which are more responsible for contributing to climate change, and the cost of our inaction is devastating for every living person,' she added. The Prime Minister said it is the responsibility of the leaders and politicians to make the public aware of the critical situation and the actions required to stop it from developing. 'We cannot decide to be undecided.' The Prime Minister said climate change now has become an existential threat for climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. 'We're fighting the battle on two fronts. First, mitigation measures to reduce and eventually reach to zero emission in future. Second, adaptation measures in areas where irreparable damage has been done.' She said lives and livelihoods of millions of people would continue to be at risk unless all concerned deliver on both these two fronts. Hasina said the time is ticking fast to the point of no return. 'It urgently needs to limit temperature increase to 1.5oC and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, by cutting 45 percent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.' She said Bangladesh, the largest delta in the world, is the worst-affected country by adverse impacts of climate change. 'Up to 2050 from now, our annual GDP loss will be 2 percent and at this rate by 2100, the loss will be a staggering 9 percent.' According to the World Bank, more than three-quarters or 134 million of around 165 million population of Bangladesh are at the risk of declining living standard as a result of rising temperature and erratic rainfall due to climate change, the Prime Minister said. By 2080, some 40 million people will be homeless due to sea-level rise, she said adding that Unicef, in April last, published that in spite of excellent progress on resilience and adaptation, Bangladesh has 6 million climate migrants already and the number could be more than double by 2050 and 19 million children in Bangladesh are already under threat. 'We'll never achieve the SDGs and eradicate poverty if the adverse impacts of climate change are not stopped.' Hasina said when people are vulnerable and left with no choice to survive, they will resort to any action endangering state, regional and global security. 'Their weakness and vulnerability make them easy prey for threats like radicalization and we are already experiencing its devastating effects all over the world.' In spite of being a non-emitter and being severely constrained in terms of resources and choices, Bangladesh is doing its best to enhance our resilience, she said. Noting that Bangladesh is the first LDC to establish a Climate Change Trust Fund, she said Bangladesh has so far spent more than $415 million from own resources for mitigation and adaptation purposes. 'We're set to spend as much as $10 billion to make the country less vulnerable to natural disasters.' The PM said the Bangladesh Parliament has recently adopted a motion declaring the current state of climate vulnerability as a planetary emergency calling all other Parliaments to act to adopt necessary measures to reduce global warming. She said the presence of 1.1 million Rohingyas, who fled persecution in Myanmar, has caused an environmental and social havoc in an environmentally critical area, Cox's Bazar, with the loss of forest, hills, biodiversity and local livelihood. 'So, we already have the dreadful experience of how the situation after a climatic calamity may turn out.' \</doc>

P#23#P I n the wake of catastrophic climate disasters in different countries of the world arguably originating from global warming, many blame fossil fuel (coal, oil and gas) as one of the prime contributors to this. Developed world cared very little for carbon emissions while using coal, oil for power generation, industrial development or using these as automotive fuel. The consequent global warming has made many developed, developing and least developed nations extremely climate vulnerable for reasons which they are not responsible at all. Some scientific studies suggested limiting the global warming below 1.5 -2 degrees Celsius by end 2100 for the survival from potential catastrophic climate disasters. Hundreds and thousands are feared to become climate refuges if climate issues fail to achieve due global attention soon and addressed. Many believe that global warming is causing ice melting in the arctic and the sea level is rising. If the present situation continues, many island states and coastal countries may cease to exist in not too distant future. Alarming symptoms are already visible, summer is getting hotter, winter is getting colder, earthquake, cyclones, tidal s u r g e s , t s u n a m i s , d r a u g h t , bushfires are frequenting. Against the backdrop, the world community gathered in Madrid, Spain in COP25 to discuss, agree and reaching meeting of minds on issues enabling for launching Paris Agreement from 2020. The bottom line is nations implementing the NDCs to limit global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius. One of the prime actions would be dealing with fossil fuel use. This write up will attempt to look into the future of fossil fuel. The question is whether world can come out of fossil fuel use when these are still available in plenty and are much cheaper. Can modern technology, more efficient use of fuel really reduce and restrict emissions below acceptable limits? If not, what are other feasible and affordable alternatives? The success or achievements of COP25 will be discussed separately. Assumptions of Energy Policies There have been many assumptions in the current energy policies and climate policies that fossil fuel use would be drastically reduced. But fact remains that fossil fuel remains steady at new present level. Current events and developments suggest that Iran and Iraq have potential to increase their fossil fuel output considerably over the medium term. The new shale technologies may gradually globalize. However, over longer terms, modern technologies of electricity generation, storage and smart demand side technologies, together with expansion of electric cars and shift towards digitization and new electricity based technologies may gradually reduce fossil fuel use. These new and emerging technologies, rather than international agreements, and the promotion of current generation renewables, will probably bring fossil fuel dominance to a gradual close. The energy policies should rather be directed towards enhancing R and D and next generation renewables rather than worrying much about drastically reducing fossil fuel use for achieving decarbonisation. The demise of fossil fuel has been long predicted but they remained astonishingly resilient. In the nineteenth century when Britain was running out of coal a serious energy crisis was anticipated. Yet after one and a half century no one worries that world would run out of coal. Since entering the modern oil era in every decade there are predictions that world has reached peak oil and the end will be in view soon. But still oil is in plenty. Natural gas was considered as premium fuel when its use started getting popular. At the early stage in 1990s, USA and UK banned its use for power generation for preserving it. But now its reserve appears plenty. Natural gas is now believed to be the most ideal transition fuel. World now realises that the prediction of peak oil did not come true. The advent of shale oil and gas developments has completely transformed U.S oil and gas industry. A possibility has been emerged for entire North America becoming completely energy independent in 2020s. By end 2015, oil price had fallen more than 60% since 2014, followed by sharp fall in coal prices, and now gas price has also fallen. Fossil fuel is still abundant and is considerably cheaper. But these do not mean that world should depend exclusively on fossil fuel for another century. We all know fossil fuel is the main source of carbon emissions. Decarbonisation is not in anyway compatible with the continued fossil fuel growth. Governments may adopt policies for gradual shift to renewables through reducing contribution of fossil fuels in energy mix. This can be done through adopting carbon tax, imposing command-and- control rules like emission standards, and mandating Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Existing policies, however, would require major changes. Abundance of Cheap Fossil Fuel For sustainable energy security sustainable supply of primary fuel at affordable cost is the prime requisite. Present reserve of coal, oil and gas and potential for future discovery in different parts of the world would make fossil fuel as the most abundant and affordable fuel options for a long time. The most widespread prediction of the end of oil is advanced by the peak oil theoreticians. Some US researchers in 1950s predicted that oil production would peak by 1970s and would decline thereafter. True that U.S oil consumption peaked in 1970s but oil reserve did not decline as Shale revolution turned the table. Following the research prediction, oil producers got a little perplexed anticipating demand supply potential imbalance. Oil price rose from as low as US$10 to over US$110 between 2000 and 2010. Then it declined again and remained steady for a while between US$ 100 and US$110 till end of 2014. This happened primarily because of phenomenal growth of Chinese economy over this period. China used to be a net exporter of coal till 1995. By 2014 it accounted for almost 50% of world's coal trade. Now China has grown to become one of the leading importers of oil and developing to become a leading importer of gas (LNG and pipeline gas). Despite of its huge investment in nuclear and hydro, it is fossil fuel that contributed mostly to economic surge of China. It is now evident that almost all that could be wrong about the peak oil narrative is wrong. There exists abundant of fossil fuel and available cheaper. The US shale discovery has added new dimensions to the large-scale untapped conventional resources. Modern technology is creating avenues for accessing shale in U.S and other places, Canadian tar sands, huge potential of the Arctic and other offshore opportunities. Truly speaking there is no serious physical resource constraint. There are however political and economic constraints. The costs for oil production vary a great deal - from perhaps as low as $5 a barrel in Iraq and Saudi Arabia, to over $90 in the offshore Arctic. In a rational market, the cheapest reserves would be depleted first, and the more expensive marginal supplies would be brought on later - after the core Middle Eastern oil fields had been exhausted. The impact of the shale may have changed the global game and changed fundamental assumptions. As the costs fall sharply around the world, the new technologies for horizontal drilling, fracking and seismic information could open up a cornucopia of deposits around the world, from Argentina to Algeria and China as well as in all the existing conventional locations. Need New Technologies Existing decarbonisation policies will not spell the end for fossil fuels. This will need alternative technologies. The dominance oil, gas and coal will not come to an end because we run out of these fuels. There is more than enough to fry the planet many times over. Only better and affordable alternatives can lead to a path of the end of fossil fuel. The sun comes up everyday: there is more energy transferred to the earth from the sun every hour than the entire world's electricity demand for a year. In capturing solar energy and other forms of non-fossil fuel sources like hydro, nuclear and geo thermal, the main segment is electricity. Technological innovations are happening at all segments of the electricity vertical chain - from generation to storage and batteries, through to the way energy is consumed, and the new materials and production processes which lie behind the industrial demand for electricity. Coal, as the cheapest and most abundantly available fuel, contributes over 40% of the world's electricity generation. (Oil has been marginal and located where there are abundant oil resources, like the Middle East). In a decarbonising world, the only plausible way of continuing with fossil fuel based power generation is with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Beyond CCS, the main electricity options are nuclear and solar. Japan and France have relied on nuclear power as their primary source of electricity for decades, and most developed countries have used nuclear as well. China and India will add more to the energy mix. Nuclear has cost problems, but compared with many of the current renewable technologies, its scale gives it some advantages. Solar Power, Energy Storage, Electric Car Can Be Game Changers Solar can be the most potential alternative to all fossil and non-fossil fuel primary energy sources of electricity. Electric cars can greatly reduce use of petroleum products in automobiles. Storage of energy and releasing on demand can also revolutionise energy use. Solar energy is abundant and free at source. The sun will go on providing it forever, regardless of how much we use. Second, most of the light spectrum is yet to be tapped into. The current solar panels have great scope for improvement and new materials like graphene and nano-technologies make the possibility of game-changing applications possible. Solar technology is pregnant with the possibility of scientific breakthroughs in the ways that other ways of generating electricity may not be - short perhaps of nuclear fission. Solar is decentralised, and if storage can be cracked, its inherent disadvantages of being confined to the day, and better when the sun shines, might be reduced. The development of large-scale transmission networks, and breakthroughs in cable technologies, might make the sunny areas of the world exporters to the northern and southern regions of the planets. Energy storage, and in particular batteries, is the next potential game-changer for the electricity industry. It can create significant impacts on energy use and emission control if it can be attached to every solar device, every wind turbine, and in every house. If there can be a battery which stores surplus energy and release it on demand, the entire energy game would change. A breakthrough in the conventional Lithium-Ion technology or towards alternatives would take the economic structures into a new framework. Electric cars may play an important role in storage for electricity systems. Transport is one of the main demands for oil (the other is petrochemicals). Expansion of electric cars would be a major step towards the fossil fuel exit. If electricity is generated increasingly by gas in the transition into a future which might be largely solar, gas would indirectly substitute for oil in this transitory period via gas power stations. Energy efficiency through adoption of modern technology will also be a game changer. Smart technologies and broadband hubs would reduce energy consumption. The Internet-of-Things, the ability to link smart white goods and appliances, heating systems and the charging of batteries and cars will turn this aspect of electricity demand from passive to active, and create great scope to improve energy efficiency. Buildings will also become smarter - a source of electricity generation through solar panels and solar film, as well as managed demand. What Needs to Be Done Policy change is essential for saving the planet from potential catastrophic climate disaster. Gradual transition to non-fossil fuel, achievement of energy efficiency through adoption of smart technologies would paradigm shift in policies. There are few challenges. The first challenge is how major primary energy producers redesign their depletion policy. In the event that new zero marginal cost technologies are coming along, electricity is growing in market share, and transport is going electric, then the medium to long run might witness falling oil and gas prices. Oil and gas would worth more today than tomorrow. In such scenario it would be wise to maximise production now. Higher production would lower the prices. The second policy challenge relates to R and D. Existing solar and wind generation technologies would not incapable make much impact, and existing large-scale nuclear would take time, new technologies are therefore essential to decarbonisation. The third policy challenge over the shorter-term is the need to address the rising emissions. The obvious path to follow is to get out of coal as soon as possible. The current renewables cannot fill the void. Hence a coal-to-gas switch is the only practical alternative. Given the abundance of gas, its price and the fact that new gas power stations can be built quickly at a relatively low cost, policy makers should focus on a combination of a carbon price and emissions performance standards to move out of coal. The fourth policy challenge is to energy systems, system development and the energy infrastructure. Smart data, interconnection and the development of new infrastructures to support electric cars and decentralised and stored electricity must be provided for in new pol icy. Interconnection would also maximise competition and security, and hence are one of the few measures that help all three policy objectives - security of supply and competitiveness as well as decarbonisation. Conclusion The end of fossil fuels is not about to happen soon and will not be caused by any or all of the fossil fuel running out soon. There is more than enough fossil fuel to fry the planet several times over. Modern technological interventions in the extraction of fossil fuels are developing as fast as for renewables. There exists abundant easily available fossil fuel at affordable cost. Smarter technology at all segments of fossil fuel extraction and changes of depletion policy of the producing nations may keep prices at affordable level for a considerably longer time. Oil price may never regain the peak of 1979 and 2008. For transition to low carbon alternatives, many of the existing technologies would require permanent subsidies once the full system costs are incorporated, current generation wind (especially offshore) and current generation solar may be out of the market except in special locations for the foreseeable future. Getting out of fossil fuel completely in foreseeable future would not be practically possible. But at the same time, the world must concentrate on research and development on technological innovations of more environment friendly exploration and exploitation of fossil fuel and efficient use of energy. Fossil fuel and renewable energy can coexist side by side for a considerable time yet complementing and supplementing each other. Some day will definitely arrive when necessity would create situation for the world becoming carbon neutral through technological innovations. \</doc>

Dhaka, Dec. 6 -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday urged the international community to initiate discussions on creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of the people who got displaced due to extreme weather events caused by climate change. "We must appreciate that migration could be an effective adaptation strategy, as we focus on enhancing adaptation capacities of affected communities. Hence, relocation and protection of displaced persons need due focus in global discourse to ensure their protection. We need to commence discussions on creation of an appropriate framework to address the needs of people displaced due to climate change," she said. The Prime Minister made the call while addressing the Action for Survival: Vulnerable Nations COP25 She said it is widely accepted that the gravest effect of climate change may be on human migration. Extreme weather events are already displacing many more people than violent conflicts. Slow-onset events like sea-level rise and desertification get even lower global focus. "We must work towards correcting this imbalance." Pointing at the leaders of Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), Sheikh Hasina said, "We now have a situation where the most vulnerable countries, which deserve the highest level of priority, are failing to access whatever support that is being realized." She said creation of a new CVF and V20 Trust Fund and possibility of having a new Special Rapporteur on climate change would be a great success. Noting that CVF and V-20 are great examples of South-South and Triangular cooperation, she said, "We want to further build on the current accomplishments. The time is now to act as we're at the most important crossroad of human history confronting possibly the gravest global challenge of our time." She said climate change has now become an existential threat for every country, especially for the climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. With more than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar causing all sorts of environmental havoc, Bangladesh already has the firsthand experience of the worst kind of environmental calamity, she said. "We must therefore establish a set of criteria to prioritize vulnerable countries based on their risks, impacts and lack of coping capacities. We also want to keep the climate change support and the regular development finance strictly separate," she added. Hasina said major emitters show extreme reluctance on mitigation, which may wreck the international climate regime and put the climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh at the risk of peril. "Hence, we shouldn't hesitate to demand accountability for inaction." "We're also looking towards the 2020 Climate Adaptation Summit in the Netherlands to strengthen our adaptation efforts. And Bangladesh is ready to take the responsibility of the Presidency of the Forum if the Members kindly agree to honour us with this task," she said. The Prime Minister said climate change is a stark reality for the world. It has now caused irreversible damage to human life and environment, ecology and natural resources, she said. Since the Earth Summit in 1992, it has not been able to secure much progress in the reduction of greenhouse gases and their emissions are still on the rise, she said. This trend is now unsustainable for the Earth. "We, the vulnerable countries, suffer the most due to our limited coping capacities and specific geographical features. We're bearing the brunt of the damage though we made negligible or no contribution to the menace. This constitutes a serious injustice and must be acknowledged by the global community," said the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, she said, the progress under the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) process is very slow and largely inadequate. There's still hardly any move to support nationally determined adaptation initiatives undertaken especially by our vulnerable countries, the PM added. Different funds created for different purposes lack availability of the required capital, she pointed out. "Often direct and easy access to funds and technology along with conditions and criteria seem to favour mostly the countries that already have acquired greater capacities," Hasina told her audience. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Costa Rica President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine, Executive Secretary of UNFCCC Patricia Espinosa and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet Jeria, among others, spoke at the event. Keep the pressure on Myanmar: PM Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday renewed her call to the world community, including the European countries, for keeping up pressure on Myanmar so that they take their more than one million forcibly-displaced Rohingya people back. Sheikh Hasina made the appeal during her separate meetings with Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte and President of the European Council Charles Michel at Feria de Madrid on the sidelines of the Climate Change Summit. "Myanmar is our neighbouring friendly country, they always say they'll take Rohingyas back.they've created the problem and the solution lies with them.they never said they won't take their nationals back, but they've lack of sincerity. please help us in this regard," Hasina was quoted as saying while holding a meeting with her Dutch counterpart. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen briefed reporters after both the meetings. The hilly areas of Cox's Bazar are seriously being affected environmentally for giving shelter to more than one million Rohingyas, she said. The Prime Minister said Rohingyas are cutting down trees in the hilly areas for making their shelters. In those areas elephants used to move around, she added. Sheikh Hasina said the government is trying to relocate the Rohingyas to Bhashan Char temporarily after preparing good facilities for them to give them a risk-free shelter. To attend the hearing of the ICJ next week, Hasina said, Suu Kyi will be in The Hague. "You should put some pressure on Myanmar and continue it," she added. The Prime Minister said Bangladesh is thankful to the Netherlands for raising their voice, extending political support and providing emergency aid for more than 1.2 million Rohingyas in Bangladesh. Holding meeting with President of the European Council Charles Michel, the Prime Minister said Bangladesh is in continuous dialogue with Myanmar. "But the problem is the Rohingyas won't go back unless they got the assurance of having Myanmar citizenship," she said. When the European Council president questioned about the role of China in this regard, she said China, India and Japan all agree with Bangladesh that the Rohingyas should be repatriated. "Neighbouring countries including Thailand want Rohingyas to go back to their homeland and they're cooperating with us," she said. Sheikh Hasina said Myanmar should cooperate with Bangladesh as Bangladesh wants a peaceful solution to the crisis, and mentioned Bangladesh's continued cooperation with and connection at every level for a solution to the Rohingya crisis. "Our general (army chief) will meet them (Myanmar army chief)." The Prime Minister also said the Rohingyas have cleared all the trees surrounding their living places. "You can help us solve the Rohingya problem," she told the European Commission President. The Foreign Minister said the Prime Minister agreed to take over the charge of the next Presidency of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) as President of Marshall Islands Hilda Heine proposed her name during the climate conference for taking the responsibility. In response to the proposal, Sheikh Hasina said she agreed to take over the charge if other leaders of the member countries agree on the proposal, he said. During the meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister, the Prime Minister elaborated steps of her government to construct embankments and its campaigns on tree plantation involving cross section of people, including party leaders and workers. She said Bangladesh is not a high carbon-emitting country and it is working on the issue of climate adaptation. Sheikh Hasina also invited the Dutch Prime Minister to attend the celebrations of the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman next year which he accepted. Mark Rutte also invited the Prime Minister to visit the Netherlands to join the Climate Adaptation Summit to be held on October 22 next year. Dr Momen said Mark Rutte extended thanks to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as she agreed on the proposal for assuming the Presidency of the CVF next year.

Bangladesh and other countries affected by climate change are not getting adequate funds due to complexities in the approval process, Information Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud said Thursday. The minister came up with the remarks at a high-level segment at the Conference of Parties ( COP25 ). He said: 'The inspiration that initiated the Green Climate Fund is not fulfilled and affected countries are not getting enough funds due to its complexity in process.' The minister demanded cutting intricacies of the fund process as part of initiatives to bring back the essence of climate talks. 'Developed countries are spending millions in their defence sector but failing to provide money in the Green Climate Fund as per their promise,' Hasan Mahmud said. Bangladesh got $ 90 million from the Greed Climate Fund, he said adding that Bangladesh is the first country to form an action plan to face the challenges of climate change. \</doc>

Climate activists and civil society all over the world are urging repeatedly that major polluting countries must contribute massively for saving the climate vulnerable countries and saving the mother earth. The climate vulnerable countries using their own resources are endeavoring for reducing GHG emissions for achieving NDC set targets although they have no obligations for this. They desperately need additional fund for reducing more GHG emission. This financing must come as grant and not as loan or insurance. The developed world is not agreeing to this argument. Required investment is the demand of time and nature. If we fail to respond positively to the call of the nature, world civilization, our earth and our light would move towards destruction. Natural calamities have become a frequent phenomenon worldwide. This frequency would assume catastrophic level if we continue to fail in our obligations. Nature would take revenge and its intensity would take the world civilization and mother earth to the brink of destruction. Therefore, good senses must prevail in discussions and decisions at the COP25 . \</doc>

Despite Greta Thunberg\' s passionate, bold plea, major polluters make no new promises at the UN climate summit in New York on September 23. Her emotional and strong pleas to world leaders apparently made little impact as announcements by major economies fell far short of expectations. The Swedish teen\' s speech, in which she repeated the words  How dare you four times, was the defining moment of the meeting, called by UN chief Antonio Guterres to reinvigorate the faltering Paris climate agreement. Ahead of the conference, the United Nations issued a release saying 66 countries vowed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, along with 10 regions, 102 cities, and scores of businesses. But pre-summit predictions of new, headline-grabbing commitments, particularly by the likes of China and India, failed to match reality, angering environmental groups. However, a major report detailing the dire impact of global warming on oceans and Earth\' s frozen zones was approved by the UN\' s 195-nation climate science body after an all-night standoff with Saudi Arabia over wording. The tell-tale signs and impacts of climate change -- such as sea level rise and extreme weather -- increased during 2015-2019, which is set to be the warmest five-year period on record, according to another report of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere have also increased to record levels, locking in the warming trend for generations to come, said the WMO. The WMO report on The Global Climate in 2015-2019, released to inform the United Nations Secretary-General\' s Climate Action Summit, says the global average temperature has increased by 1.1 degree centigrade since the pre-industrial period, and by 0.2 degree centigrade compared to 2011-2015. The climate statement -- which covers until July 2019 -- was released as part of a high-level synthesis report from leading scientific institution \' United in Science\' under the umbrella of the Science Advisory Group of the UN Climate Summit 2019.  Climate change causes and impacts are increasing rather than slowing down, said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, who is co-chair of the Science Advisory Group of the UN Climate Summit. The world\' s top scientists believe long-term temperature rise must be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels to prevent runaway warming with catastrophic effects. Matters did not improve much as a succession of national leaders took to the podium saying they understood the gravity of the situation but then failing to announce concrete plans. Environmental and campaign groups reacted with almost unanimous disappointment. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said progress was being made as the climate summit wrapped up in New York.  Action by action the tide is turning, Guterres said.  But we have a long way to go. We are not yet there. However, major announcements by government and private sector leaders at the United Nations Climate Action Summit boosted climate action momentum, and demonstrated growing recognition that the pace of climate action must be rapidly accelerated. Guterres listed 77 countries that had committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, although those countries combined produce significantly less than half the world\' s carbon dioxide emissions. Seventy nations also pledged to do more to fight climate change, 100 business leaders promised to join the green economy and one-third of the global banking sector signed up to green goals, including asset-owners holding over US$2 trillion in assets and leading companies with combined value also over $2 trillion. Many smaller countries, including Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries, were among those who made the biggest pledges, despite the fact that they have contributed the least to the problem. The United Nations Secretariat has adopted a new 10-year Climate Action Plan aimed at transforming its operations to achieve a 45 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and sourcing 80 per cent of electricity from renewable energy by 2030. The Plan was adopted just ahead of the Climate Action Summit to help increase global ambition and vastly increase action to limit climate change. The global operations of the UN Secretariat represent approximately 58 per cent of the reported greenhouse gas emissions from the entire UN system, according to the latest Greening the Blue report, issued by the United Nations Environment Programme. The new Climate Action Plan has been designed to transform UN Secretariat operations to align with the goals of the 2018 IPCC report that found there were clear benefits to limiting climate change to 1.5 \'b0C. The Plan follows the IPCC recommendations on carbon emissions reduction. Speaking at the closing segment, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said  You have delivered a boost in momentum, cooperation and ambition. But we have a long way to go.  We need more concrete plans, more ambition from more countries and more businesses. We need all financial institutions, public and private, to choose, once and for all, the green economy. Youth leaders including Greta Thunberg drove home the urgency of greater action by leaders, and their determination to hold leaders to account. A day after thousands of young people marched and rallied for urgent climate action, young leaders brought their message on September 21 to the United Nations for the Youth Climate Summit, the opening salvo of the three day long United Nations Climate Action Summit. The Youth Climate Summit-the first time the UN has convened a summit for young people completely devoted to climate action - aimed to give voice to the demands of young people to take far swifter action to reduce the emissions that, without action, are on track to reverse the development gains of the recent decades that have improved the lives of millions of people. The Summit opened a dialogue between youth and decision makers, putting young people in the driving seat with voice and agency to realize their potential and the change they are persisting towards climate action. Already, his work has helped to close 297 out of 530 coal plants in the US.  Countries, including France and New Zealand, announced that they will not allow oil or gas exploration on their lands or off-shore waters.  Heads of State from Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, and Slovakia, are among those that announced that they will work to phase out coal. The Republic of Korea announced it would shut down four coal-fired power plants, and six more will be closed by 2022, as well as the doubling of its contribution to the Green Climate Fund.  The Summit also delivered critical platforms for improving energy efficiency and reducing the growing energy needs for cooling, with the  Three Percent Club coalition working to drive a three percent annual global increase in energy efficiency and the Cool Coalition setting ambitious national cooling targets for its members with the potential to deliver up to 1 degree on the pathway to a 2050 net zero carbon world. On Scaling Up Financing &amp; Unlocking Barriers to Funds  Many countries announced new contributions to the Green Climate Fund, the official financial mechanism to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices to counter climate change, with several countries, including France, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom, announcing that they would double their present contributions.  Further, the Climate Investment Platform was officially announced today. It will seek to directly mobilize US$ 1 trillion in clean energy investment by 2025 in 20 Least Developed Countries in its first year.  Summit initiatives were designed to ensure the actions undertaken would be fair for all, supporting jobs and clear air for better health, and protect the most vulnerable, as well as new initiatives on adaptation, agriculture and early warning systems will protect 500 million additional people against the impacts of climate change. New initiatives announced have been designed to be scaled-up to deliver impact at the global scale needed. The Secretary-General urged governments, businesses and people everywhere to join the initiatives announced at the Summit, and promised to  keep pushing for greater ambition and action. The Secretary-General committed the UN system to support implementation of plans presented at the Summit, with an initial report to be delivered at COP25 in Santiago, Chile. The UN Climate Action Summit opened with anger.  Nature is angry, said Antonio Guterres. Youth activist Greta Thunberg told leaders  How dare you gamble with our future and continue talking about fairytales of eternal economic growth? Although keynote speakers reaffirmed that our house is on fire with impacts becoming more intense and frequent across the world, country speeches which ensued showed that governments are still fuelling the fire. They continue to ignore the science and fail to present ambitious climate commitments. In the end, the urgency and the emergency did not transpire in leaders\' speeches. The world did not hear many announcements on enhanced targets or phase out of polluting fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. The world did not see rich countries bear their historic responsibility by committing finance to poorer countries that are struggling with impacts, loss, damage and displacement or those with the political will, but with no resources to mitigate climate change. This is deeply irresponsible. As the youth said, governments are gambling with people\' s safety and lives. Leaders are shamefully absconding their responsibility to solve climate change, leaving the problem to the youth. Failing to listen and respond to the emergency forces the youth to continue striking and sacrificing their childhood and education. A few small island states and developing countries, as well as businesses, stepped up and committed to enhancing their targets based on science. Others, like Sweden, Luxembourg and Denmark pledged to double their contribution to the Green Climate Fund. These countries demonstrated much-needed leadership and underscored the feasibility of climate action and ambition. They showed that the energy transition is ongoing and irreversible. On the other hand, rich countries and large emitters failed to build on the historic opportunity provided by the UN chief to show they stand on the right side of history. Absentees like the US, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, which snubbed the Summit, have emerged as those that should be held most accountable for sealing our fate. History will judge them harshly and so will the next generations who will soon be marching to the ballot box. The Summit drew a line in the sand between leaders who united behind the science and those ignoring it and the voice of the people on the streets - siding instead with the narrow interests of fossil fuel corporations. According to findings released by the group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit, more than two thirds (69%) of people killed in climate-related disasters in the past 50 years were living in 47 of the world's poorest nations. The LDCs - which make up 13% of the global population - revealed the toll of extreme weather events like droughts, wildfires, floods and landslides between 1970 and 2019 as they launched 2050 Vision, their blueprint for a climate resilient future. "Over one billion people in our countries live on the frontline of climate change despite doing the least to cause it," says Mr Sonam P Wangdi, Chair of the Least Developed Countries Group. "The current system is failing. The global response to climate change must rapidly transform to move the world onto a 1.5\'b0C compatible pathway." The LDCs are asking for an initial US$450m of investment over 10 years in the LDC Initiative for Effective Adaptation and Resilience (LIFE-AR), to help them deliver the adaptation and resilience work outlined in their Vision. This money will support the countries who are the first to join the drive Bhutan, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda. The LDCs are also championing two other long-term initiatives that will work to support the Vision: the LDC Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Initiative for Sustainable Development (LDC REEEI) and the LDC Universities Consortium on Climate Change (LUCCC). As more than half of the people living in the LDCs currently do not have access to electricity, LDC REEEI will focus on getting 100 percent sufficient and affordable renewable energy to all LDC citizens by 2030 and 100 percent electricity from renewable sources by 2050. In 2020, LDCs will come forward with enhanced nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement, long term plans to reach net zero emissions and climate resilience by 2050, and national adaptation plans. These ambitious strategies and plans will also need support from the international community. Addressing a side event hosted by the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) at the Conference Room 7 in the UN Headquarters, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina called upon all the nations to meet their commitments to reducing carbon emissions and financing the initiatives of the climate vulnerable countries. She said that despite being a non-emitter and severely constrained in terms of resources and choices, Bangladesh is doing its best to bring a difference in the life of our people.  Our commitment to partnership will usher in new and innovative measures addressing climate crisis, she said,  We\' re at a crossroad facing the most serious global challenges of our time  impacts of climate change are increasingly harming our civilizations. Sheikh Hasina said the 5th Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly states that adverse impacts of climate change will continue to intensify over the current century unless the world comes up with drastic actions to reduce or stop carbon emission. Addressing the Climate Action Summit at the General Assembly Hall in the UN headquarters, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said the impacts of climate change have been devastating the lives of almost two billion people globally every year.  Globally, frequency of extreme climate events is increasing. But in Bangladesh, casualties are reduced to almost nil from hundreds of thousands due to efficient early warning system, she said. She said Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change.  We have adopted adaptation and resilience building measures, including an 82-year Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, to deal with issues on climate change, natural disasters and water management. Sheikh Hasina said the government has built 4,291cyclone shelters and 523 flood shelters in the coastal areas to give refuge during disasters. Some 56 thousand volunteers are available to warn and facilitate preparation for danger, she said. She expressed her delight launching the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) - an ambitious new initiative created by the United Kingdom, Finland and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. She announced that over 50 countries and over 20 other organizations were joining this partnership at its launch. She said Bangladesh has shown how a strong early warning system and a coordinated approach in disaster management can make a big difference.  So, we have happily joined this initiative to share our experiences with other vulnerable countries, as well as to learn from others in mitigating the risks of future hazards. Meanwhile, Bangladesh joined the Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030 (P4G), which was officially announced at an event on the side-lines of the 74th UN General Assembly. Indonesia and South Africa also joined the forum. Other partner countries are Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea, and Vietnam. P4G was launched in 2018, with the ambition of becoming the world\' s leading forum for developing concrete public-private partnerships on the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. P4G brings together government, business and civil society organisations in innovative partnerships to advance solutions to help meet humanity\' s greatest needs in five key areas: food and agriculture (SDG2), clean water and sanitation (SDG6), affordable clean energy (SDG7), sustainable cities (SDG11) and circular economy (SDG12). In his speech marking Bangladesh\' s inclusion into this prestigious global forum, State Minister for Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam said P4G would provide much needed new and innovative approaches and business models for Bangladesh\' s graduation from the least developed country\' s category. Conclusion In light of general disappointment, civil society turns to the upcoming climate conference in Chile ( COP25 ) and its Presidency to push countries to deliver an emergency package that includes ambitious commitments in climate finance - including for loss and damage, strong targets, and rules on trading emissions among countries. The Chilean and subsequently the UK Presidency of COP26 must ensure that governments deliver the adequate response to the emergency and ambition that puts the world on a 1.5C degrees trajectory. COP26 is the deadline. But countries should not wait until 2020. They should start now by stopping coal and other fossil fuels, and investing in a just transition to renewable energy and climate resilience. The pressure in the streets and by civil society will continue until inaction is converted to action and ambition. \</doc>

Locals in the district gathered under banner of Sachetan Nagarik Committee (Sanac) and formed a human chain on Saturday demanding visible progress and transparency in climate finance to implement the Paris Agreement. Sanac arranged the programme with the assistance of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) at the Post Office intersection in the district town. Sanac President Principal Syedul Alam, Corruption Prevention Committee President Prof Abdul Matin, Sujon President Aminur Rahman Tuku among other spoke at the programme. Speakers demanded financial grants but not loans for Bangladesh and other nations vulnerable to climate change impacts. Corruption Prevention Committee, Susashoner Jonno Nagorik (Sujan), Surjer Hasi, Debating Society, Unnyan Dhara and many other voluntary organisations attended the programme. UN Climate Change Conference ( COP25 ) will begin on December 2 in Madrid, Spain. In the Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, all countries agreed to step up efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial temperatures and boost climate action financing. \</doc>

P#38#P The Green Climate Fund (GCF) Pledging Conference concluded recently with pledges now totalling US$ 9.7 billion. By doubling on their initial contribution to the GCF, a handful of developed countries signaled they are ready to take responsibility in tackling the climate emergency but the vast majority of contributor countries should have come to the table with much more. In particular, Canada, the Netherlands, Portugal, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Austria and Belgium failed to deliver their fair share and must bridge this shortfall as a matter of urgency. They must use the UN climate meeting COP25 in Santiago in Chile this December as an opportunity to do so. With their decision to withhold funding to the GCF, the governments of the United States and Australia have turned their backs on the world's poorest and have once again isolated themselves in global efforts to respond to the climate emergency. This US$9.7 billion for the next four years will allow the GCF to continue pursuing its mandate by funding adaptation and mitigation projects in developing countries and supporting the most vulnerable communities. \</doc>

Civil society leaders of most vulnerable countries (MVC) have demanded urgent actions by developed countries to reduce the greenhouse gases to keep global warming rise below 1.5 degree Celsius. They raised the demand at a press conference titled 'LDC and MVC Peoples' expectations and COP 25 CSO leaders also opposed any attempt of false solution and demanded developing the implementation guidelines of Article-6 (Market Mechanism for reducing greenhouse gases) of the Paris Agreement under UNFCCC Process instead of bilateral one which being offered by developed countries. Syed Aminul Hoque of EquityBD, Bangladesh placed the key demand at the programme. Mentioning that the COP-25 is being held at a crucial, historical and transitional stage, Aminul Hoque urged the developed countries to revise and enhance their actions in reducing greenhouse gases based on the IPPC 1.5 degree strategy. Other speakers also hoped that the developed countries will significantly address the climate threats. \</doc>

P#43#P Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) recently said developed countries must pay climate money as a grant not as a loan. TIB made the demand ahead of the COP 25 climate conference under Paris Agreement to be held on December 2 in Madrid. TIB placed 11-point demand at a press conference organized by TIB at its office recently. One of the demands wants easy access to compensation money within a specific timeframe from the Green Climate Funds (GCF) and other international funds. The victim countries of climate change impact including Bangladesh should collectively raise their voice and put their demands during negotiation with the policymakers at the conference, the press conference was told. Finding out the challenges to implement the Warsaw International Mechanism to deal the loss and damage issue due to impact of climate change is another demand of the TIB. Speakers noted that only 45% of the GCF has been provided as grants but out of the remaining 55%, 41% is loan and the rest 14% is allocated as equity. \</doc>

P#43#P Bangladesh is seventh among the 10 countries worst hit by extreme weather events, says a global climate report. Puerto Rico, Myanmar and Haiti top the list, which has three South Asian countries and seven Asian nations, said the Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) 2020 that analysed data from 1999 to 2018. Germanwatch, a Berlin based non-profit environmental research organization, released the report recently on the sidelines of The Conference of the Parties ( COP-25 ) meet in Madrid, Spain. In the previous report that examined data between 1998 and 2017, Bangladesh was at the ninth position. The study looked at four indicators -- death toll, number of events, loss of property of each person and loss of gross domestic product. The CRI 2020 is based on the loss figures of 181 countries, it said. The report also said Japan, the Philippines and Germany were the most affected countries last year followed by Madagascar, India and Sri Lanka. Japan was hit by three exceptionally extreme weather events last year while Typhoon Mangkhut ploughed through the northern part of the Philippines in September. Germany experienced the second hottest year since records began due to a severe heatwave. \</doc>

Dhaka, Jan. 24 -- Some are fascinated with her: they see her as a hero, as a Joan of Arc of modern times or as a Mafalda, with a political agenda to preserve planet Earth and as such, represents the younger generations as more intelligent than that of their parents. Others are angry: they see her as a naive puppet of opaque adult interests and they make fun of her. Young ecologist, Greta Thunberg became a new global figure and depending on the political point of view of observers, she is either defended or hated. On September 20, 2019 the #FridaysforFuture movement, inspired and encouraged by the Swedish teenager, celebrated its largest mass mobilisation. In almost every country in the world, young people and adults took to the streets. It is estimated that about 4 million people mobilised around the world. Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old student, has been known in Europe for around a year, but in the United States she has risen to fame over the past month. Many Americans first saw her when she appeared on the Trevor Noah Daily Show. There, she explained with her well know seriousness that the world has very little time left, precisely eight and a half years, because as of January 1, 2018, only 420 gigatons of carbon dioxide remained. Now there are only 360 gigatons left, and in eight and a half years this will run out if the current levels of emissions are maintained. Despite her youth, Great Thunberg has become popular because of her knowledge of climate and environmental problems, for the firmness of her convictions and for the actions that she carries out. Commentators are sure that that is why she has become an icon. The climate activist does not relate well to the irony of American television programs. When asked for her impression of New York when she arrived on the Malizia yacht, she replied that it smelled bad. Her lack of understanding of irony and her seriousness are probably related to her Asperger's syndrome (a condition she speaks openly about) and dose of Nordic frankness. All of these qualities have influenced the new environmental movement. It is a group that speaks very seriously and uses scientific research to support their arguments. It is, in fact, the antithesis of the ironic language used by generation X or millennials. Greta Thunberg is the global face of this movement and her presence is extremely influential. In August 2019, when embarking on a trip from Europe to New York on a ship that doesn't produce carbon dioxide, she caused rage in the media and in the political world. Furthermore, her interventions at the World Climate Conference in Katowice (Poland) in December 2018 and at the World Economic Forum in Davos put the world's powerful in a very awkward position. This young girl, with her hair in braids threw slogans at them ("act" or "panic") and was able to attract the world's attention. Especially the European media. But her presence at the New York and Washington demonstrations, the meeting with Barack Obama, the appearance on the Daily Show and the speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 23rd also made her a popular figure in the US. The mass movement led by Great Thunberg dates back to the "school strike" that began on 20th August 2018. That day, instead of attending school, she sat in front of the Swedish Parliament in an attempt to draw attention to the dangers climate change represents for future generations. Her intervention produced an avalanche effect. In a few months a mass movement known as #FridaysforFuture emerged, reaching its first peak in March 2019 when 1.5 million teenagers and youngsters took to the streets to protest and demand a change in attitude to climate change. The movement is global, but its centre is in the Global North. And although in many countries the movement is led by teenage women, in no other country in the world is the symbiosis between the movement and a person is as clear as in the case of Greta Thunberg. The activist triggered not only a political movement, but also fury from powerful media outlets. The media and commentators have become obsessed with her. According to some observers, the adoration towards Greta Thunberg is similar to a religious awakening. But this is not her problem. It is, on the contrary, a problem of the people and the media that react to her actions and her words. Within the political spectrum, environmentalism is found mostly on the left and in the academic world. The right and many liberals deny Greta Thunberg and her colleagues the right to formulate their own political ideas and goals, instead treating them as immature and spoilt. The Argentine journalist Sandra Russo calls this the first case of "global bullying", an idea which she discussed long before September 23rd when Donald Trump, the president of the United States, sent out a tweet which made fun of the 16 year old. The criticism that Greta Thunberg's ideas about the climate would be potentially "undemocratic" since they do not allow for political compromise are based on the idea that politics works "only step by step, always through compromise". However, this can be seen as a form of soft paternalism. Greta Thunberg's sharp accusations do not take place in a vacuum, they are stark, political interventions aimed at polarizing public opinion. Her statement that "the poverty of the many pays for the luxury of the few", is according to some commentators on the extreme right, is "the product of socialisation in the Swedish education system" and is a stupid left wing criticism of capitalism. Other critics argue that fanatical ecologists (or green capitalists) are hiding behind the young Swedish girl. More specifically, We Don't Have Time AB, a Swedish company that works on environmental projects founded in 2017, by public relations specialist Ingmar Rentzhog, who gave wide coverage to the school strikes led by Great Thunberg in 2018. On November 27 of that year, We Don't Have Time AB announced they were issuing securities on the stock exchange and mentioned her name 11 times in their advertising brochure. Earlier this year, she alongside her family said that they are no longer are in contact with the firm. Others point to the ever-present George Soros, the ghost of the global alternative right. Everything seems to suggest that the more popular and disruptive the climate movement become, the more virulent the rejection from those who consider climate change as a conspiracy and the protection of the climate as pure nonsense becomes. The severity of reactions to a 16 year old teenager should make us reflect. Some psychologists try to explain it by saying the 'old' white men won't change their attitudes towards the environment, so instead attack Greta for her illness, for her age or because of the apparent manipulation of her activism. But behind these criticisms there is much more than the intransigence of a whole male generation. The attacks may be a sign that she, alongside the youth involved in the movement, have managed to hit a sensitive nerve. Is Greta Thunberg questioning the system? At the climate conference held in Katowice in December 2018, the young Swedish woman stressed that political elites had not yet understood the severity of the climate crisis. Since the political class acts irresponsibly, it is up to the younger generations to take charge of their future and do what adult politics should have done a long time ago. Young people must understand what previous generations have done with climate change and respond to the chaos that have inherited. They need to ensure that their voices are heard. In all of her speeches, Greta Thunberg makes it clear that if real and concrete measures are not taken to face the current situation, politicians will be acting irresponsibly. She maintains that rich nations have a greater obligation to reduce emissions quicker and that countries like Sweden should reduce their fossil fuel emissions by 15% annually and reduce their emissions to zero within six to twelve years. This would allow emerging economies such as India and Nigeria sufficient time to adapt their infrastructure. The main concern of the #FridaysforFuture movement is, therefore, that climate protection measures be adapted in the widest, fastest and most efficient way possible. In order to achieve the objective of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a limit established at the United Nations Conference on Climate Change that was held in Paris in 2015 (COP 21) and adopted by the UN. These positions do not seem to question the system itself; they are simply a call to reason and for fulfilment of objectives that have already been established. The power of persuasion of the movement doesn't come from theoretical positions (as in 1968), but from simply saying "what is happening". It comes from insisting on the fact that, as the reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) say, the climate crisis has worsened in last 20 years and, despite this, politics is doing very little to change its course. German climate movement activist Luisa Neubauer comments that "the battlefield is between those who benefit most from the status quo and those who are set to lose the most." And she adds: "We young people ask ourselves why things are the way they are when they could so simply be different? And we have to fight this as strongly as we can because we have absolutely nothing to lose, except our future". In the movement, which is symbolized by Greta, there is potential for generational conflict: voters of the future are mobilizing against the interests of those of the present. But they are not alone and many adults are willing to change their behaviour and seek a change in policy, demonstrated by the large participation of adults in the demonstrations of September 20th. Greta has managed to create mass mobilisation through her statements, actions in the public eye and intervention in the media. Its objective is not and cannot be to solve the climate crisis, but it has won a more immediate resounding political success: a generalised and global awareness of the urgency of climate change. What she says and what she does already influences political debates in different countries and first steps, although still tentative are being taken in the right direction. Without mobilisation, this would not be happening. The European Green Party is one of the main beneficiaries of advertising the strikes and protests of the climate movement. In Germany, the Greens obtained 20.5% of the votes in the 2019 European elections with 33% of the votes of those under 30. The electoral behaviour of young people is not just an expression of their sympathy for the environmental cause; it is also a reflection of the deep crisis that German social democracy is going through. Many people see the same worries in both the #FridaysforFuture movement and the Greens, highlighting how far the party is from the radicalism expressed by its founders. The fact that in the party congress of the Greens, their politicians applaud the critical position of the younger generation (which strongly rejects the decisions of the adult generation) could be seen as flattery and hopefully, will not subvert representative democracy. Greta Thunberg and the new climate movement has created a new political actor. They will need a lot of patience to continue the campaign. The fascination with the novelty and personal magnetism will diminish and interest will weaken, as will the wave of sympathy. Traditional media and social media do not stick to the same story for long. Greta Thunberg will return to school. Her generation has a lifetime ahead, though this movement should become an example of democratic commitment. Hopefully most young people will say no to fatalism and resignation. There will come a point when we become aware that environmental issues cannot be resolved if we separate them from economic and social issues. They are inextricably linked and part of the same problem. Greta has also begun to be recognised in Latin America. The urgency of social and economic crises in many countries in the region forces the environmental issues to take a back seat. The Swedish teenager announced in December 2019 she will travel from the United States to Chile for COP 25 . We still don't know how she will make the trip without producing polluting emissions. The trip is further than her trip from Europe to New York and there are no train lines that connect to two areas. This, for now, remains unclear. Regardless, it is assumed that this new challenge will bring Greta closer to the enormous social problems of Latin America. The trip to Chile will open her eyes to a different reality, very different from the ones she knows, a reality that hopefully helps her to see more clearly the extent to which environmental and economic issues are two sides of the same coin. In New York, at the headquarters of the United Nations, she has already taken steps in this direction when she exclaimed with a trembling voice to the heads of states of the world: "How dare you! [.] We are at the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!"

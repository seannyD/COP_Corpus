THE annual UN conference on climate change , COP27 , started in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, this week with world leaders at the event under pressure to make and implement the necessary decisions to halt the world\' s worsening climate crisis. Environmental groups and activists in South Africa are watching the event \- taking place over the next fortnight \- with keen interest, although most are not optimistic the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, as it is officially known, will deliver what is needed to avert a climate disaster. Katherine Robinson, head of campaigns at Natural Justice, said they were not optimistic about COP27 COP27 had to deliver meaningful and substantive progress on adaptation, loss and damage, and the means of implementing support for African and other developing countries. She said this was made necessary by the failure of developed countries, which bore a historical responsibility, to fully honour their obligation to provide support to developing countries, as well as inadequate or inappropriate multilateral and private sector financing. May Boeve, executive director of environmental organisation 350.org, said:  We are here to remind global leaders of their responsibilities towards a just transition, press them to align finance flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and particularly in the case of rich nations, challenge them to pay the debts they owe to countries in the Global South for decades of exploitation. Greenpeace Africa climate and energy campaigner Nhlanhla Sibisi said:  There is a movement of people who care about social and environmental justice, and that movement is growing. COP27 is an opportunity to drive change, and Greenpeace Africa would welcome an outcome that enables the just transition to make progress in South Africa. Sibisi said Africa was a key stakeholder in resolving the climate crisis, and the voices and perspectives of people from the continent \- activists and front-line communities \- needed to be represented as the conference progresses. Yesterday, President Cyril Ramaphosa co-chaired a high-level round- table session that explored approaches to addressing climate change in the context of the so-called Just Transition, inspired by the South African Just Energy Transition Partnership. \</doc>

For agrifood systems to adapt to climate change and become more sustainable, improving the quality and quantity of climate finance contributions to the sector is critical - that was the main message at the launch of the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation Initiative (Fast) held at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-El Sheikh, Egypt. Fast was developed and initiated by the Egyptian Presidency in close collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other stakeholders.Fast comes at a time when the risk of hunger and malnutrition among the most vulnerable groups is getting worse and the world s agrifood systems are increasingly impacted by climate variability and extreme weather events. Agrifood systems also contribute to the climate crisis, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss.But the funding to transform agrifood systems to make them more sustainable, resilient and productive is grossly inadequate, and that is what this initiative hopes to address.Agri food system transformationAccess to climate finance at both farm and country levels remains insufficient and Fast aims to implement concrete actions to correct this to transform agriculture and food systems by 2030 while supporting food and economic security and the environment.Speaking at the event, FAO deputy director-general Maria Helena Semedo, pointed out that while overall climate finance flows have been increasing over the past decade, the share allocated to agriculture has been steadily decreasing.The agriculture and land use sector received $122bn in financing between 2000 and 2018, representing 26% of the global climate finance flows to all sectors."That is why bold transformative actions are now needed to boost investment in agrifood transformation, support countries in accessing climate finance, and ensure that appropriate financial resources reach small and medium-scale food producers," Semedo said.Fast aims to make this possible by enhancing country capacities to identify and access climate finance and investment, giving stakeholders greater access to knowledge and developing guidelines and providing support in crafting appropriate climate action policies.Promoting food security and diversity, empowering and engaging women, youth, Indigenous Peoples and people in vulnerable situations, and using science and innovation to improve agricultural practices across the value chains - these are some of the principles that will guide Fast s work."This partnership will rely on and harness the efforts started by previous initiatives such as the Glasgow breakthrough and will be nurtured by future (COP) Presidencies. Agriculture is higher than ever on the COP agenda, and FAO is committed to supporting all actors in their efforts to transform our agrifood systems to become more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable," said Semedo. \</doc>

COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference called the implementation conference, came to a close on Friday, showing signs of regression, according to early reactions to the draft decision.\~ Hopes were pinned on reaching consensus on Friday evening even though history has shown otherwise. Despite two weeks of meetings in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, and mid-year preliminary negotiations in June, the draft decision was considered "raw" on Friday morning.\~ "It's hard to see progress from these talks. The developed world is blocking a loss and damage fund. There's no progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation. We're backsliding from the Glasgow decision on fossil fuels," said Mohamed Adow at Powershift Africa.\~ A flashback in time\~ HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/11/durban-climate-deal-struck huddle that then foreign minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane convened between three women on a Sunday morning saved the deal through a sleek compromise on wording - the fine prints that have kept climate action locked in intense negotiations for three decades. That COP was a make or break over the extent to which any global deal on climate change would be legally binding and what form a new treaty proposed by the European Union would take. Finance was a big bargaining tool in the years that followed the Durban Declaration, which gave rise to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). It was the first finance mechanism to support developing countries with climate action.\~ South Africa's lead negotiator, Alf Wills, described the ambiguity in the final text as a necessary move to ensure agreement among divergent parties. For example, India and China fiercely protected the interest of developing nations by going against signing off on a vague legally binding deal pushed by the EU.\~ COP26 in Glasgow last year and COP27 wrapping up in Egypt HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2021-11-12-as-climate-talks-hit-the-final-stretch-some-countries-seek-to-water-down-commitments/ are no different. The Glasgow Pact agreed on in Scotland was the product of another last-minute huddle in which developed nations (EU countries and the US) ensured that all fossil fuels were not included in the text. In contrast, India and China ensured that coal was not singled out for phasing out at the expense of developing nation economies.\~ Within a matter of hours, the world was left with HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Overarching_decision_1-CP-26_0.pdf a watered-down agreement COP26 president Alok Sharma closed the conference by expressing how "deeply sorry" he was for the final outcome. This time India is again pushing for the inclusion of all fossil fuels in the final outcome, a move that will include oil and gas and not only coal which largely affects countries such as India and South Africa.\~ Thando Lukuko, of Climate Action Network South Africa, said: "I think this COP [ 27 ] has had several firsts that we haven't seen in others. There was a serious threat to non-state actor participation and a very strong security presence generally in and out of the conference location. While there were no incidents against civil society groups, it certainly pushed the envelope on some infringements like the right to demonstrate. "I think the only thing that can repair trust is support or implementation. That means finance, in part, to achieve our climate commitments. These goals without financial flows to realise them are hollow."\~ A final stretch\~ COP27 president Sameh Shoukry HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/sharm-el-sheikh-climate-change-conference-november-2022/sessions-documents/cop-27/cmp-17/cma-4-ministerial-and-presidency-consultations released a public update HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/lnacpil/status/1593522800052011010 took to social media Shoukry stressed that the main objective was to "adopt consensus decisions and conclusions on Friday that will constitute the comprehensive, ambitious, and balanced outcome of the Sharm El-Sheikh conference".\~ During a HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/event/informal-stocktaking-plenary-1 noon update on Friday Bilateral consultations led by various country ministers were ongoing in bilateral, closed-door meetings to achieve positive outcomes which included:\~ A new adaptation goal to deal with the unavoidable effects of existing climate damage;   Rules for a carbon market under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; A new Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance; and Financing for Loss and Damage. Other pressing issues on the table have included Africa's request for the COP to recognise its "special needs and special circumstances" and the main goal, which is to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C.\~ Shoukry has bemoaned the slow progress in the negotiations, which was echoed by UN chief Antonio Gutteres who, on Thursday night, stressed that trust was eroding between the globe's North and South.\~ "This is no time for finger-pointing. The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction," Gutteres said.\~ Loss and damage But the G77 and China (a negotiating bloc at COP) are hoping for a fund under the United Framework Convention on Climate Change to support rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction. They hope this fund will address non-economic and economic losses and damages associated with the adverse effects of climate change which includes slow onset events like prolonged droughts, land degradation and sea level rise; as well as extreme weather events.\~ "I'm fully aware of the national circumstances and positions, but I'm also very much aware of your willingness to be flexible and your sincere commitment towards reaching agreement," Shoukry said at a noon briefing on Friday.\~ "Let me now set out how I see the next 24 hours unfolding. I will now take ownership of all outstanding work and I will look at the outcomes in their entirety. I remain concerned about the number of outstanding issues including finance for mitigation adaptation, loss and damage and their interlinkages. I call upon parties to work together to resolve these outstanding issues swiftly." He added: "The global community is looking to us to be bold and ambitious. And it is in your hands as heads of delegation and negotiators to push for ambitious outcomes on all elements of the consideration ... what we do here impacts real people impacts real lives."\~ Not enough progress COP27 .\~ "I'm sorry to let you know that the question of fossil fuel phase out there is no actual progress from last year. So we have had a decision in Glasgow that explicitly called for the phase down of all unabated coal and inefficient subsidies. What we are looking for in Sharma was a decision that calls for the phase out of all fossil fuels," he said.\~ "Rather than actually getting progress allows us to actually move beyond coal, oil and gas, we actually seem to be backsliding." He stressed that in its current form, the EU's proposal for a broad loss and damage fund would exclude a country like Pakistan, which suffered the worst effects of flooding this year.\~ The next few hours are critical for Africa and other developing nations at the forefront of the climate disaster. The outcome of COP27 is expected to have wide-reaching implications for the goals of the legally binding 2015 Paris Agreement to keep warming to levels that will leave future generations with an inhabitable planet.

As HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/egypt/ Egypt prepares to host the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop27/ COP27 ) climate conference in November, the spotlight is once again being thrown on the massive challenges Africa faces in tackling HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-change/ climate change and, also, the opportunities it may create. Home to one-sixth of the world's population, Africa accounts for less than 6% of global energy consumption and only 2% of cumulative global emissions. Yet the impacts of climate change are already more profound on the continent than in many other parts of the world, with seven of the world's 10 most vulnerable countries in Africa. As the continent looks to bridge the huge gap between demand and supply in the energy and infrastructure sectors (which is only set to widen with continued HYPERLINK population growth and accelerating HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/urbanisation/ urbanisation ), the resources and technologies that African governments choose to deploy will have a major impact on efforts to tackle global climate change. Policymakers in a number of African countries are having to strike a balance between utilising and/or monetising their abundant fossil fuel resources and responding to the mounting pressure to embrace renewable technology and HYPERLINK decarbonisation . With European governments scrambling to find alternatives to Russian oil and gas, and in some instances resorting to coal-fired electricity generation, the energy challenges that African governments have faced for decades and the resource opportunities that the continent offers may be viewed from a different perspective. Energy transition nonetheless remains a clear objective across the continent. So far, countries accounting for 70% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This includes 12 African countries that account for 40% of the continent's total CO2 emissions, while nearly all African countries are signatories to the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/paris-agreement/ 2015 Paris Climate Accord These targets are helping to set a new course for the global energy sector and, helped by a rapid decline in HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/renewable-energy/ renewable energy costs, we've been seeing a significant shift in investment towards clean energy solutions. There is enormous potential and opportunity across the whole range of renewable resources (notably hydropower, wind and solar) and increasing investor interest in hydrogen, both as a domestic energy resource and for export. Renewable technology is being deployed increasingly both on a utility-scale, feeding into national grids, and for private commercial and industrial consumption. Smaller scale renewable generation is also being developed in more remote areas, with investment in "mini-grids", avoiding the need for (and associated cost of) connecting to national transmission infrastructure. Significant challenges remain. National utilities are typically under considerable financial pressure and lack the financial resources to develop new generation capacity or to offer creditworthy offtake solutions for HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/independent-power-producers/ independent power producers In this respect, multilateral and development finance institutions continue to perform a vital role in helping to unlock the potential. They are doing that through capacity building (helping to build up regulatory, technical and commercial understanding and encouraging sector reform) and through financial support, including direct lending to governments, public utilities and private investors and through offering partial risk guarantees and other credit enhancement structures to support public utility off-takers.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has told world leaders at the United Nations climate talks that commitments made during climate change negotiations must be honoured. Delivering the country statement on Tuesday, the President said Africa needs to build adaptive capacity, foster resilience and address loss and damage, as agreed at Paris COP 21. The two-day Climate Implementation Summit attended by world leaders, kicked off the 27th United Nations climate change conference ( COP27 ). The conference is hosted by Egypt, which holds the COP27 presidency. To achieve this, he said, the African continent will need a predictable, appropriate and at-scale funding stream and technological support. This must support the continent's right to development, international equity and transitions that are just and inclusive, said Ramaphosa. 'This places a great responsibility on developed economies to honour their commitments to those countries with the greatest need and that confront the greatest environmental, social and economic effects of climate change. 'The commitments that were made must be honoured because failing to honor these commitments, breaks, trust and confidence in the process,' the President said. Multilateral development banks must be reformed President Ramaphosa called for multilateral development banks to be reformed in order to meet the needs of developing economies for sustainable development and climate resilience. He emphasised that a clear roadmap is needed to deliver on the Glasgow decision to double adaptation financing by 2025. 'At present, multilateral support is out of reach of the majority of the world's population due to lending policies that are risk averse and carry onerous costs and conditionalities. Our emphasis must be on the health, well-being and food and water security of the most vulnerable. 'At a national level, South Africa is fully committed to achieving the most ambitious end of the mitigation range in our updated Nationally Determined Contribution,' the President said. The President highlighted that South Africa is guided by a Just Transition Framework and an Investment Plan that outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve its decarbonisation goals over the next five years. 'We are already scaling up investment in renewable energy, and are on course to retire several of our ageing coal-fired power plants by the end of 2030,' the President said. Referring to the COP 26 held in Glasgow last year, the President said that France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union offered support in the form of a Just Energy Transition Partnership. 'It is our hope that this partnership will offer a ground-breaking approach to funding by developed countries for the ambitious but necessary mitigation and adaptation goals of developing countries. 'South Africa reiterates its support for the Egyptian Presidency and its confidence in the successful outcomes of COP 27 ,' President Ramaphosa said. - \</doc>

Coca-Cola produces 120 billion throwaway plastic bottles a year, 99% of which are made from fossil fuels, worsening both the plastic and climate crisis. Yet, the government of Egypt announced last week that it had signed a co-operation agreement with Coca-Cola, introducing the company as a sponsor for the UN Conference on Climate Change ( COP27 ) to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh from November 6 to 18. In response, Greenpeace USOceans Campaign Director, John Hocevar said,  it is baffling that Coca-Cola, the world\' s biggest plastic polluter in the Break Free From Plastic brand audits, will sponsor this year\' s UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Egypt.  They have yet to even acknowledge that this is a problem or explain how they will meet their climate goals without ending their plastic addiction.  This partnership undermines the very objective of the event it seeks to sponsor, Hocevar said. Hocevar implored that  cutting plastic production and ending single-use plastic is in line with the goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. If Coca-Cola really wants to solve the plastic and climate crisis, it needs to turn off its plastic tap. Ending Coca-Cola\' s addiction to single-use plastic is an important part of moving away from fossil fuels, protecting communities, and combating climate change, he said. Paul Whang, Climate Action Fellow for Fairfax and San Anselmo in California, shared his reservations about COP27 hosted in Egypt.  I was very sceptical. I still am. I still think that this is a ploy by the Egyptian government to greenwash its long record of human rights abuses, attacks on workers\' rights to organise, and overall repression, said Whang.  The conference will take place as thousands of people like academics, activists, journalists, and students are still jailed and abused for demanding basic human rights.  The response of the military regime to protests and campaigns related to environmental issues has been just as harsh, whether over plans to build coal-fired power stations, polluting industries or the destruction of green spaces, Whang said. | \</doc>

In Indonesia, the rate of primary forest loss has HYPERLINK https://research.wri.org/gfr/latest-analysis-deforestation-trends fallen for five years Moreover, nearly HYPERLINK 100 countries - representing over 75% of global emissions - have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century. And the United States just made a massive down payment on its green future with the Inflation Reduction Act, which could mobilise an estimated HYPERLINK https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/securities-research/is-the-inflation-reduction-act-a-tipping-point-in-climate-action-202210.html $800-billion or more in climate-related investments.

A planet that hot would be scarcely recognisable to us today. An important HYPERLINK https://www.wri.org/research/state-climate-action-2022 new report from the HYPERLINK https://systemschangelab.org/ Systems Change Lab - an initiative organised by the World Resources Institute, the Bezos Earth Fund and its partners - sheds light on both these realities and points toward a new way of thinking about change. On the side of pessimism, the report shows that none of the 40 sectoral transformations required for addressing the climate crisis this decade is yet on track. For example, the phase-out of coal needs to be accelerated sixfold - the equivalent of retiring 925 average-size coal plants each year. Similarly, annual deforestation rates need to be falling 2.5 times faster and recent growth in crop yields needs to accelerate by nearly sevenfold this decade to feed a growing population without encroaching into forested areas. All these transformations depend on global climate finance, which itself must increase eightfold from its current levels. But the report also explains that change is rarely linear and that exponential progress - a sudden "hockey stick" acceleration - is possible when nurtured by bold leadership and supportive policies.\~ In the space of just two years, from 2019 to 2021, solar generation grew by 47% globally, and wind power grew by 31%, dramatically outpacing analysts' predictions. And between 2013 and 2021, the global share of carbon-free bus sales increased from 2% to 44% - a 20-fold increase in under a decade. Moreover, we know some systems can be pushed toward positive tipping points - such as price parity between incumbent fossil-fuel sources and renewables - after which change becomes unstoppable. We must do everything we can to reach these tipping points as soon as possible.\~ Given how little of humanity's carbon budget remains, we no longer have the luxury of pursuing only the least-cost options. We need systems change across all domains of human activity - from how we grow our food and power our homes to how we build our cities and transport ourselves and our goods. Accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy will require a change in incentives, new regulations and laws, shifts in behaviour, innovation and unwavering leadership. We are about to begin the fourth year of the decisive decade for averting catastrophic climate change. We must move mountains, whatever the upfront costs. Global leaders gathering at COP27 should neither wring their hands in despair nor cheerfully declare that victory is around the corner. Rather, they should thoughtfully examine what needs to be transformed and what it will take to cross the essential tipping points.\~ This is the moment when we need to create the conditions that will make more positive changes both irresistible and unstoppable. That would make all those carbon-emitting flights to Sharm El Sheikh well worth it. - \£9 The views expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Mail & Guardian.

COP 27 was both better and worse than expected, say Prof. Felix Dodds and Chris Spence It's finally over. After the anticipation and build-up to COP27 , the biggest climate meeting of the year is now in our rear-view mirror. The crowds of delegates that thronged the Sharm el-Sheikh international convention center for two long weeks have all headed home to recover. Many will be fatigued from long hours and sleepless nights as negotiators tried to seal a deal that would move the world forwards. Did all this hard work pay off? In our opinion, COP 27 was both better and worse than we'd hoped. Failing to Follow the Science First, the bad news. COP 27 failed to deliver what the science tells us was needed. With the window of opportunity closing fast on our goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C or less, COP 27 did far too little on the all-important issue of mitigation--that is, cutting emissions. COP 27 failed to deliver what the science tells us was needed. With the window of opportunity closing fast on our goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C or less, COP 27 did far too little on the all-important issue of mitigation--that is, cutting emissions The case for urgent action keeps getting stronger. The latest reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make for grim reading about what to expect if we let temperatures rise too much. Nowadays, though, we just need to read the newspapers to catch a glimpse of the future. The head of the key negotiating Group of 77 - 134 developing countries - was Pakistan which has been dealing with the worst floods in its history, leaving 1717 people dead and dealing an estimated $US40 billion in damage. In 2022 in the USA, there were 15 climate-related disasters which each exceeded $1 billion in costs. Meanwhile, in Africa, according to Carbon Brief's analysis of disaster records, "extreme weather events have killed at least 4,000 people and affected a further 19 million since the start of 2022." Since this COP was billed by some as the "Africa COP", one could expect a strong response to such news. The pressure was therefore on at COP 27 to respond to such disasters. Attending COP27 were 112 world leaders and over 300 government ministers: not as many as at COP 26, but still a good number. Something like 27,000 people from governments, intergovernmental, stakeholders, and journalists also attended the COP. This was to the backdrop of the UN Secretary General warning us that we needed to "cooperate or perish," to take urgent action to take us off "a highway to climate hell". Messing up on mitigation: And yet progress on mitigation was modest, at best. While some delegations pushed hard for stronger commitments on cutting emissions, the appetite in some quarters just didn't seem to be there. After being pressured to do more in Paris and Glasgow, China, India, and some of the oil-producing countries appeared reluctant to take much more in Sharm el-Sheikh. They feel developed countries, which are historically responsible for the bulk of emissions, should be doing more themselves, rather than coercing others. The result was a negotiated outcome with little more on the table than we had in Glasgow. For instance, delegates could not agree to ramp up their language on fossil fuels, much to many people's disappointment. Finance: Likewise, there was not too much to report on the issue of climate finance. The $US100 billion annual support for developing countries initially promoted by Hilary Clinton at the 2009 Copenhagen COP and enshrined in the Paris COP in 2015 will be reviewed in 2024 with a new figure being hopefully agreed then for 2025 implementation. The Global South has been talking of this new sum numbering in the trillions to help adapt and mitigate against climate change. And yet there were few signs of movement towards anything of that magnitude. Given that the North has still not met its pledge of US$100 billion by 2020, it's clear a lot of movement is needed in the next couple of years. Yet news from outside the conference, such as the US House of Representatives now having a Republican majority, does not bode well. For a meeting billed as the "implementation COP" where climate action was taken to another level, the news on mitigation and finance was therefore disappointing. Just prior to the start of COP27 the lead negotiator for Egypt Mohamed Nasr underscored: "science reports were telling us that yes, planning is not up to expectations, but it was implementation on the ground that was really lagging behind." Exceeding Expectations--the Loss and Damage Fund Perhaps most surprising was the agreement to create a 'Loss and Damage' fund to help the most vulnerable countries. This has been a key issue for almost 30 years, particularly for small island developing countries. In Glasgow this looked very unlikely to be resolved in the Sharm COP, but with a late change of heart by the Europeans and eventually by the USA and others in the OECD, this is perhaps the most significant and surprising outcome from COP 27 . Even as recently as October, the signs were that OECD countries were not on board with calls for a new fund. However, at COP 27 the "trickle" of earlier action in this area turned into a flood. Interestingly, it was Scotland at COP 26 that started things off, with a modest, voluntary contribution. More recently, Denmark, Austria, New Zealand and Belgium had also financial commitments to loss and damage, now amounting to $US244.5 million. Mia Mottley Barbados' Prime Minister has called for a 10% windfall tax on oil companies to fund loss and damage caused by climate change, which could raise around $US31 billion if it had been introduced for 2022. Still, the signs a fund would be agreed at COP 27 had not been good. This makes the final outcome all the more welcome. The idea, the door is now open for the most vulnerable countries to receive more support. A goal has now been set to fully operationalize the fund at COP 28 in a year's time. For the most vulnerable nations, this cannot come quickly enough. Global Goal on Adaptation: Another positive development, albeit on a more modest scale, was in the area of the 'Global Goal on Adaptation'. Here, delegates agreed to "initiate the development of a framework" to be available for adoption next year. A lot of work will need to be done at the intersessional meeting of the UN Climate Convention's subsidiary bodies in Bonn in June next year to prepare for this, including how to measure progress towards this Goal. An approach similar to the development of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 might be appropriate, perhaps? Article 6: Another of the Glasgow breakthroughs was that on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on carbon markets and international cooperation. COP 27 saw some solid work undertaken on how to operationalize this both in market and non-market approaches. There are still a lot of sceptics on this will have a genuine impact and how to ensure not double counting or even that any offsets are real. An approach that is more ecosystem-based than just trees is gaining momentum. Such a change, if it happens, also offers a real chance to link the two major UN conventions on climate and biodiversity. Agriculture: The work on the Koronivia Work Programme on Agriculture went down to the wire. The outcome was a four-year open-ended working group reporting at COP31 (2026). Some controversy on the term 'food systems' may see its first workshop address this issue. It will also look at how we can better integrate the programme's work into other constituted bodies such as the financial mechanisms of the convention. The Green Climate Fund has given only $US1.1 billion for adaptation on agriculture. It says one of the major reasons for this is the: "Lack of integrated agricultural development planning and capacities that consider maladaptation risks and investment needs across the agricultural sector, climate information services and supply chains." While these outcomes on agriculture, adaptation and Article 6 may seem modest, they should be welcomed as steps in the right direction. Coalitions of the Willing: One of the outcomes from the Glasgow COP was the launch of 'Coalitions of the Willing'; groups of countries and stakeholders wanting to move quicker on an issue than they might under the official UN negotiations, which are consensus-driven and involve more than 190 countries. In Sharm el-Sheikh we saw a number of countries join the Methane Pledge, including Australia and Egypt. China joined the meeting on the Pledge and committed to its own national methane strategy. In Glasgow, 137 countries had taken a landmark step forward by committing to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. With the imminent return to leadership in Brazil of President-elect Lula da Silva, there is renewed hope that real action on the Amazon forests is possible again. Lula committed Brazil to reaching zero deforestation and was hailed as a hero by many when he turned up at COP 27 during the second week. Meanwhile, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)--the global coalition of leading financial institutions--committed to accelerating the decarbonization of the economy. GFANZ, which includes over 550 of the world's leading financial institutions, has committed to reduce their financed emissions in line with 1.5 degrees C. With $US150 trillion of combined balance sheets, the accountability mechanism announced of a new Net-Zero Data Public Utility is yet to prove if it is effective in holding the finance sector to their commitments. However, if it can deliver on its potential, this could be a game changer. There was plenty more activity at COP 27 where the results are harder to measure. Most people at these large UN climate summits are not negotiators and COP 27 was full of "side events" and government and stakeholder pavilions each with its own set of events and agendas. Ideas were shared, connections made, and partnerships for further action shared. The upshot of all of this activity is hard to measure, but probably considerable. The thematic days organized by the Egyptian Presidency also gave space to these issues and helped bring together ideas that may ultimately find their way into future UN decisions. In this respect, too, the quality of the side events and pavilions at COP 27 exceeded our expectations. On to Dubai and COP28 Was COP27 a success or failure? When it comes to keeping up with the science, the answer can hardly be positive. The call to "keep 1.5 alive" hangs in the balance and is still on "life support". In that sense, COP 27 had very little impact on our current trajectory, which is a likely warming of 2.4-2.8 C by the end of the century. On the other hand, the promise of a loss and damage fund, as well as modest successes on adaptation, Article 6, agriculture, and actions outside the official negotiations, mean COP 27 delivered some bright spots of success. Looking ahead to next year, COP 28 will be important as it marks the first "global stocktake" to judge where things now stand. We hope this will focus world leaders to increase their pledges (or "nationally determined contributions") significantly. It will be interesting to see how the United Arab Emirates, as COP 28 host, performs. As a major oil producer, it faces some serious challenges in transitioning to a net zero world.

Nokwazi Mbambo, 19, was in her bed in Lindelani, an informal settlement in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, listening to the rain thundering down on the corrugated iron roof of her family's shack. She got up from her bed and went to cuddle up next to her mother. Someone was knocking on the door, urgently. Mbambo and her mother ignored it, willing themselves to fall asleep. Then there was a knock again. This time there was shouting too. Mbambo and her mother got up to open the door, and the two found their distraught neighbour on their doorstep. "Your house is moving!" the neighbour screamed frantically. The next moment, there was a huge gust of wind and a loud bang. The corrugated iron roof that sheltered the Mbambos just moments ago had blown away. It was too late to save their belongings. As they scrambled out of their home, they grabbed what few things they could. They made their way to their neighbour's house, where they would spend the night, watching their home being washed away. "I lost everything. My school books, my ID, even my laptop," she says.\~ She is in a make-shift shelter in the Ntuzuma F district community hall, about 15km from her former home. The shelter was set up by the state for people displaced by the floods, which left HYPERLINK https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/35010/ 448 people dead and more than 8 500 homes destroyed by the government's count. The community hall was supposed to be temporary lodging, but six months later, Mbambo and her mother are still there. Outside the hall, tents have now been set up to accommodate smaller families. Not far away, on the streets of Durban's city centre is Mfundo Shezi, 32. On the night of the floods, while searching for shelter from the rain, he watched as his ID and a month's supply of HIV treatment were washed away. "I lost my ID book, even all my blankets and clothes were washed away. Even my medication. I had a container for a whole month's [antiretroviral] tablets."

Climate change is an existential threat to humans and our ability to thrive on a healthy planet. But when it comes to rising temperatures, the inability of humankind to slow emissions and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius isn't because we lack knowledge or need new technologies. Consider: Humans have been warned for more than a century about the dangers of a warming climate and its adverse impact on human health and planetary systems, including but not limited to loss of biodiversity, decreased soil and ocean health, increased sea-ice melt and corresponding sea-level rise, and amplified disasters such as hurricanes, floods, heat waves and droughts. The IPCC estimates that globally, $1.6-3.8 trillion (USD) must be invested every year through public and private climate-related finance to keep warming well below warming beyond 2 degrees Celsius. For comparison, the International Monetary Fund reports that fossil-fuel subsidies in 2020 were $5.9 trillion (USD) when summing up explicit and implicit subsidies Fifty years ago, "The Limits to Growth" warned humans of the serious need to live in balance with Earth's systems. The science is settled. Likewise, technologies that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions are available and increasingly cost-competitive-particularly in energy production and transportation, two of the most significant contributors to global emissions. What is missing? This is not a difficult physics equation. While we live in a complex world, the laggards in this area are observable: money and societal will. As countries enter the second week of the global negotiations at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, typically referred to as COP27 , success will depend on the ability of the negotiators to mobilize investments and advance policy at the conference to accelerate opportunities for progress in altering the trajectory of climate change. Even discussions on "loss and damage"-a signature issue of this conference that is historically neglected-are defined by these two needs. Underlying the issues of loss and damage are questions about processes for addressing loss (policy) and determinations of who is financially responsible (investment). The price tag to address climate change is not small, but viewed in the right frame, it is a bargain. Take climate-enhanced disasters. In 2021, the world experienced four mega weather events that each cost $20+ billion in economic loss: Hurricane Ida, flooding in Europe, flooding in China and unprecedented winter weather in Texas and parts of Mexico. These types of human-induced disasters are now increasingly frequent, occurring at more places and at higher amplitudes, and are more costly without considerable investment to curtail rising greenhouse gas emissions. The 5th High Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance takes place during the second week of COP27 , where ministers will discuss achieving the annual $100 billion support mark for lower-income countries, a total those countries already note as too little, too late. The real need is in trillions of dollars, not billions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that globally, $1.6-3.8 trillion (USD) must be invested every year through public and private climate-related finance to keep warming well below warming beyond 2 degrees Celsius. For comparison, the International Monetary Fund reports that fossil-fuel subsidies in 2020 were $5.9 trillion (USD) when summing up explicit and implicit subsidies. Combining policy with public investment can dramatically amplify results. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, the country's most dramatic attempt to reorient its infrastructure and electricity production to lower emissions, could spend as much as $800 billion (USD) in tax credits, spurring on private investment to the tune of $1.7 trillion (USD) over the next decade, according to a Credit Suisse review of the policy. The same report estimates that with the manufacturing and consumer tax credits, the cost of solar electricity could fall below one U.S. cent, possibly as soon as 2025. The investment bank declared that the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act "definitively changes the narrative from risk mitigation to opportunity capture" for corporations to take advantage of the law's positive impact on the economy. We have fallen behind the timeline set by the Paris Climate Accords and the 1.5 degrees Celsius target no longer seems to be achievable. The international negotiations must push the agenda to define aggressive mitigation policies, with incentives and disincentives, to scale known solutions on the fastest timescales possible for manufacturing and distribution throughout the world. This needs real investments, private as well as public, for a chance to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. The time is now to show the most marginalized countries the money.

The COP 27 climate summit is taking place amid a rash of political, economic and environmental upheavals, including missed funding and emission targets, increased pollution and climate devastation, rising global inflation, cuts in Western development assistance and the negative after-effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The summit--the 27th Conference of State Parties ( COP27 ), scheduled for November 6 through 18- is billed as one of the largest annual gatherings on climate action, this time in the Egyptian coastal town of Sharm el-Sheikh. The Brussels-based Centre for UN Constitutional Research (CUNCR) predicts COP27 "will likely face the same empty promises and no actions by most big countries responsible for climate change." In a message during the launch of the UN Environment Programme's (UNEP) Adaptation Gap report released on the eve of COP27 , Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warns "the world is failing to protect people from the here-and-now impacts of the climate crisis". "Those on the front lines of the climate crisis are at the back of the line for support. The world is falling far short, both in stopping the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and starting desperately needed efforts, to plan, finance and implement adaptation in light of growing risks". He also pointed out that adaptation needs in the developing world are set to skyrocket to as much as $340 billion a year by 2030. "Yet adaptation support today stands at less than one-tenth of that amount. The most vulnerable people and communities are paying the price. This is unacceptable," Guterres said. Gadir Lavadenz, Global Coordinator, Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice (DCJ), told IPS COP 27 "It is outrageous to still see big corporations manipulating and dominating this process. Big polluters have a role to play, stop polluting and not use the climate COPs to greenwash their actions. COP 27 must deliver a strong message to the world that the multilateral system can still play a role in the climate crisis". Lavadenz also pointed out that the annual $100 billion target was not only evaded systematically by developed nations, but it has demonstrated to be insufficient to deal with the magnitude of our climate crisis and there is growing evidence of this. " COP 27 Finance is not about cold numbers, but about the lives at risk in this very moment and that have no means to deal with a problem caused by the consumerist culture of a small privileged portion of this world. " COP 27 cannot be remembered as just another meeting, but as a moment to show progress and hope through real solutions", declared Lavadenz, who is the Coordinator of a global network of over 200 grassroot, regional, and global networks and organizations advocating climate justice. Flagging a new report from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters October 26 that countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward, but the report underscores that these efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The report shows that current commitments will increase emissions by 10.6 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. This is considered an improvement over last year's assessment, which found that countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, "but it is still not good news". Just 26 of 193 countries that agreed last year to intensify their climate actions have followed through, pointing Earth toward a future marked by climate catastrophes, according to the U.N. report Meena Raman, a Senior Researcher at the Third World Network, a member organization of Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice (DCJ), told IPS the $100 billion target is supposed to be $100 billion per year. "This target is not expected to be realised and is complicated by how climate finance is counted." She pointed out that the definition of what climate finance is in itself an issue being addressed at the COP. "Given that many developing countries are in debt distress, the provision of more loans which need to be paid back presents a very major problem for those countries who need the finance". What is needed, she argued, is more grants for especially tackling adaptation needs and funds to address loss and damage. Meeting the climate finance needs of developing countries through non-debt creating instruments is critical, including through the reform and re-channeling of Special Drawing Rights as outright grants for climate finance. COP 27 must not be a lost cause. It is the time for implementing in real terms the commitments made by developed countries, Raman declared. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters last week: "When we were together at COP26, (in Scotland in October-November 2021), we brought forward a declaration, a statement, for the elimination or the reduction of methane gas by 30 percent by 2030." "We are now looking at most countries committing to this. If everyone did this, this would be the equivalent of removing all vehicles and all the ships and all the planes that are currently out in the world in terms of emissions. So, we can have a real impact. We can do what is needed to maintain the 1.5 degree Celsius rise of temperature", he declared. IPS UN Bureau Report Follow @IPSNewsUNBureau \</doc>

South Africa has become the exemplar for other countries hoping to table their own Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) deals. Dr Thuli Khumalo, chief operations officer at the Presidential Climate Commission (PCC), told GIBS Dean, Professor Morris Mthombeni the distinguishing factor of South Africa's JET plan is that it ensures inclusivity in the climate change conversation. Other developing countries, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, are looking to South Africa for guidance following the successful negotiation of an $8,5bn funding arrangement that will see the country transition off fossil fuels, most notably coal.The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, or COP27 , is currently being held in Egypt. It is an opportunity to have crucial conversations around financing and support for climate change interventions, bringing together leaders from business, finance, and government to determine the need for collective action.COP26, held in Glasgow in 2021, was a watershed year for South Africa, Khumalo explained. It was there that the country was able to reach the $8.5bn agreement with France, Germany, the UK, the US, and the EU to support South Africa s transition to a low-carbon economy. The deal will see the partner countries mobilise funding over the next three to five years through a range of instruments, including grants and concessional finance.The agreement was in response to South Africa's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, We can do only so much with our own resources, but we need help, sustainability expert Khumalo, who joined the PCC in 2021, said.The PCC was tasked to oversee the just transition to a low-carbon economy and a climate-resilient society. The goal of the just energy transition is to migrate to cleaner sources of fuel while retraining and returning economic activity to the affected areas. We want to use this transition as a country to rebuild the economy and create more jobs, and more quality jobs, Khumalo said. What makes our Just Transition Framework exemplary is the fact that it has been widely consulted within communities in South Africa, Khumalo explained, Especially with those in areas where coal is being mined. It has taken the voices of almost everyone in those areas into account and is a broad vision and agreement by South Africans of what we want to see in a transition. In the interest of transparency, even the terms of the investment have been put out to the public for consultation, she added.Governance challenges and issues of corruption have been raised as concerns as the investment negotiations progressed. There is always a question around South Africa and corruption, but I think the issues of corruption are being dealt with decisiveness, which is giving hope to people who are looking in from the outside, Khumalo said. The President has set up structures to deal with the issues of climate change, ensuring that there is transparency for all stakeholders in the conversation. It gives hope that there will be accountability. Our treasury processes have been regarded internationally as very rigorous, she added.Questions around governance issues are by no means unique to South Africa. Transparency has been flagged as important, especially among developing countries, for both funders and recipients, Khumalo said. Countries have to clearly show what they will do to guarantee the funds go where they are supposed to go. <h3>Climate mitigation and adaptation strategies</h3>Current investment plans are largely focused on climate mitigation. As one of the most carbon-intensive economies in the world, South Africa has prioritised several sectors, including electricity, hydrogen, and electric vehicles, for mitigation.Overall, however, the climate conversation takes into account climate adaptation, loss and damage, as well as climate finance. South Africa needs to focus largely on adaptation, Khumalo said. Most countries face one climate change disaster. South Africa doesn t only have one need, we face drought and flood simultaneously. Current negotiations have focussed on an adaptation fund to be established for developing countries.However, the issue of loss and damage has not yet been agreed upon. Those are still the two most difficult parts of the negotiations, Khumalo said. And it is what Africa needs most because our contribution to global emissions is much lower than that of the rest of the world. Professor Mthombeni asked whether the dual demands of loss and damage, as well as that of an adaptation fund, may be a bridge too far for this round of COP negotiation and that delegates might have to prioritise one over the other, Khumalo asserted: At this stage, they are trying to push both. The negotiators have failed to find a middle ground and get the commitment that we were looking for as developing countries. But they're still pushing because it is part of the Paris agreement, she concluded. \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to address the Presidential Climate Commission on government's priority investment and financing interventions under the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, this afternoon. According to the Presidency, the engagement of the commission will serve as preparation for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference - known as COP27 'The Presidential Climate Commission is focused on creating a social partnership around a just transition; defining a vision for a just transition, and means of achieving that vision, covering the necessary sectoral shifts, technological innovation, employment opportunities, and climate finance, as well as conducting independent analysis into climate change impacts on jobs, the economy, and policy. 'The President will update the Commission in his capacity as Chair of this independent, statutory and multi-stakeholder body established to oversee and facilitate a just and equitable transition towards a low-emissions and climate-resilient economy,' the Presidency said. South Africa has entered into a partnership with Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. "Under the Just Energy Transition Partnership, South Africa, ahead of COP27 , requires a financing package that is aligned to the country's fiscal realities and demands, upholds the development and climate finance principles and obligations that are due to developing countries, and is inclusive and just," said the high office. At a media briefing on Friday morning, Presidential spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, said the President will be accompanied to COP27 by Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele; Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr Naledi Pandor and Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment, Barbara Creecy. 'The President's focus will be on securing maximum ambition in terms of climate action, the honouring of previous commitments and the provision of enabling means of implementation support for developing countries, including South Africa.

The lifetime cost per kilowatt-hour of new solar and wind capacity added in Europe in 2021 will be at least four to six times less than the marginal generating cost of using fossil fuels during 2022. This means that once all costs, such as fuel, maintenance and general operations, are included, renewable energy production is significantly cheaper than fossil fuels.\~\~ Renewable energy has been competing with fossil fuels over the last 20 years but has only recently become the obvious and economic choice for developed and developing nations alike. Global energy shocks, such as the one precipitated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, highlight the importance of diversified renewable energy generation.

Last year's climate COP 26 in Glasgow, Scotland, was billed as the most important conference in the history of humanity. But it failed to deliver. If anything, that failure added urgency for global climate action at COP 27 in Egypt last month. Now that it this year's COP is over, it is useful to reflect on a few excerpts from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's opening day remarks:   "These climate conferences remind us that the answer is in our hands and the clock is ticking." "We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing." "Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing, global temperatures keep rising... and our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible." "We are getting dangerously close to the point of no return. And to avoid that dire fate all countries must accelerate their transition now, in this decade." "Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish." "It is either a climate solidarity pact, or it is a collective suicide pact." Sadly, COP27 's outcomes make very clear that the world signed on to the one the global fossil fuel sector wanted: the suicide pact. COP 27 did not deliver. In fact, it has been labelled by many as the worst COP ever. What happened in Egypt puts a whole new spin on the term COP-out. But how could it have been otherwise? COP 27 was held in a country aligned with surrounding petrostates ruled by a ruthless dictatorship and was sponsored by one of the world's largest plastic polluters: Coca-Cola. It did not seem to register with organizers that the company's relentless bottled water production is widely held in the global water science and policy community as a triumph of marketing over common sense. Did the organizers not see that Coca-Cola's sponsorship of COP 27 was an open invitation to blatant global greenwashing? The obvious should not be missed here: Capitalism is not out of control, capitalism is in control - and COP 27 offers clear proof of that truth. As society's reliance on petroleum grew and our energy demands expanded, the global fossil fuel cartel quietly evolved into a superpower unto itself. There were more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists at COP 27 . What, one might reasonably ask, could possibly go wrong? Lots, evidently. The oil and gas lobby completely corrupted the COP process. The proceedings and outcomes of COP 27 make it clear that the fossil fuel sector now owns the COP agenda. The sole aim of their presence there was to prevent, not promote, progress on dealing with the global climate threat. And they succeeded. None of the agreements negotiated in Egypt are binding. Like the national emissions reductions target put forward by UN Member States under the Paris Climate Accord, the commitments made at COP 27 are all merely aspirational. There is no penalty for failing to achieve them. There have been 27 COPs since 1995 and still no formal binding agreement on cutting fossil fuel burning. Except for a small blip during the pandemic, fossil fuel burning globally continues to rise, not fall. As one participant pointed out, the aspirational scheme agreed upon in Sharm el Sheikh is a down payment on disaster. No one expects anyone to actually compensate developing countries that contribute little to the climate threat for the catastrophic impacts climate breakdown is now having on them. With COP 28 scheduled to be held next year in the United Arab Emirates - one of the most notorious petrostates of them all - the only thing COP 27 accomplished was to expose what the COP summit process has become - a pointless travelling circus set up once a year out of which little but platitudes emerge. The entire COP process is no longer fit for purpose. It is a bloated, corrupted process too moribund to come up with any measures effective enough, and binding enough, to bring about the changes we need to make to avoid climate catastrophe. Voices calling for change get louder and louder. The COP process must be replaced with something more efficient that does its work largely hidden from the glare of the media. It can no longer be allowed to be contaminated by corporate sponsorship. The process can no longer be allowed to be owned and corrupted by the global fossil fuel cartel and oil and gas sector lobbyists. One suggested way of doing this is to establish an IPCC-like structure of smaller bodies, each addressing key issues, notably energy transition, restorative agriculture, transportation and issues related to damage and loss. Each such body would be made up of representatives of majority-world countries empowered to negotiate legally binding agreements that are workable and achievable, whether it be halting and reversing deforestation, cutting carbon dioxide and methane emissions, drawing down coal use and addressing other threats to our future such as ocean acidification and deoxygenation. These agreements can then be signed off by world leaders without the need for the hype, grandstanding and false hope now associated with COP process pronouncements. {\rtlch\af2\afs24\ltrch\fs20\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\par We are witnessing a great bonfire of our heritage.

HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/energy accounting for roughly two-thirds of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, electricity use and access are HYPERLINK https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7jb0015q strongly correlated Many African countries are lagging behind in electricity generation and access. According to the HYPERLINK Energy Progress Report HYPERLINK https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZG-NG respectively , have access to electricity. To close these gaps, energy demand on the continent is HYPERLINK https://www.undp.org/africa/news/africas-just-energy-transition-priority-world-moves-toward-decarbonization expected to grow by 60% by 2040. Sufficient energy HYPERLINK https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Modern-Energy-Minimum-Sept30.pdf is essential for most economic activities. Coal, petroleum and natural gas made a significant amount of productive energy available during the Industrial Revolution. This led to human health and welfare improvements. Cost-effective and abundant energy is a key driver for economic growth. African countries will find it hard to grow their economies and pull their people out of poverty if they can't take advantage of their abundant energy resources. For example, Africa HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/africa-energy-outlook-2019 holds 13% of the world's remaining recoverable gas resources. So the global effort to cut the use of these resources presents a barrier to Africa's growth unless sufficient financing is available to fully transition to renewable and sustainable fuels at a scale needed to support economic growth. Africa's challenges HYPERLINK https://grist.org/politics/the-u-s-has-officially-stopped-financing-new-coal-plants-abroad/ Over the past few years HYPERLINK https://www.irena.org/publications/2022/Jan/Renewable-Energy-Market-Analysis-Africa showed minimum global renewable energy investments in Africa (only 2% out of all the renewable energy investments in the world) over the past two decades. Without the West's backing, Africa's energy decisions might solely rely on resource abundance and cost efficiency. This could lead to further dependence on fossil fuels. Global environmental problems such as climate change require cooperation at the local, national and international levels. The West's support for Africa is essential to align global decarbonisation targets with regional realities. Without support to maximise the available resources, economies of scale, cost efficiencies, capacity building, and the potential to electrify large numbers of the population, a focus on renewables alone becomes unjust and unrealistic for Africa. Just electrification in a net-zero world The https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U7pa2O0AAAAJ&hl=en need to invest in alternative, sustainable fuels to meet the projected demand is critical. One of the main challenges at COP27 - the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference - will be agreeing on who decides when and how countries ought to transition to net-zero emissions. Put simply, net zero HYPERLINK means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible. Conversations at COP27 should centre on Africa's interests to advance a just transition for all. A just transition is one in which social and economic opportunities of climate action are maximised, while problems such as inequitable distribution of benefits and costs are minimised. Africa HYPERLINK https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.14324/111.444/000180.v1 bears the brunt of climate change impacts without being responsible for them. This HYPERLINK https://www.clubofrome.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Earth4All_Deep_Dive_Ghosh.pdf undermines the opportunity to create a just energy transition for all with a fair assignment of climate responsibility. Governance Deep decarbonisation and net-zero world goals are paramount to combating the climate crisis. But the pace and methods of achieving them might come at the cost of leaving millions in the dark with little access to electricity. A HYPERLINK https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-9302.2010.00226.x new polycentric model of international climate governance is needed. The old one resembled an era of hierarchy and power concentration in fewer countries. This led to a lack of cooperation at the international level. The polycentric model could help facilitate the understanding of the need to advance access to electricity while mitigating the climate crisis. This cooperative governance model could correct the past inequitable distribution of benefits and costs by implementing the following three main principles: Let those affected by climate change decide when and how to transition to net-zero emissions.   Replace hierarchical (or "double-standard") principles with cooperative and polycentric approaches. Make autonomy and partnerships pillars of decentralised international cooperation. COP27 should embrace the notion that the decisions that shape the lives of Africans should be shaped by Africans. The people affected by climate change should decide when and how to transition to net-zero emissions. Autonomy and partnerships should characterise international cooperation. Energy solutions HYPERLINK https://cleancooking.org/the-issues/health/ die from household air pollution caused by the reliance on wood, charcoal, or coal as energy sources. Citizens are HYPERLINK https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620302140 further affected by forced displacements that occur to accommodate large fossil-based energy infrastructure such as power stations. A shift away from these practices would allow for a more people-centred clean energy future. There's an opportunity to bypass a centralised energy system based on fossil fuels. It could be based on renewable energy instead, distributed through mini-grids. If done right, this could provide full electrification without the cost of creating coal or natural gas power plants. Some of these power stations will be stranded anyway in the move away from fossil fuels. The path to just electrification Working together to balance clean energy and electrification in Africa will be a gradual process. The key enabling factor in this process is financing. Financing is needed for new technologies, resilient infrastructure and building people's capacity. COP27 is Africa's turn to map this path.

Opening remarks by the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Ms Barbara Creecy, at the PRE- COP27 negotiations in the Democratic Republic of Congo Ms Eve Bazaiba - Minister for the Environment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Mr Sameh Shoukry - COP 27 President Designate Ms Amina Mohammed - United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Excellencies At the outset, South Africa joins others in expressing our deepest condolences to the countries that have recently experienced devastating climatic events, including the United States of America, Cuba, the European Union, large parts of Africa and Pakistan. Such events are a stark and tragic reminder that we have already entered the era of Loss and Damage. Climate change remains the greatest challenge of our generation and Africa is one of the most impacted regions due to multiple factors, including heavy dependence on climate sensitive sectors, low adaptive capacity, underdevelopment, and limited access to finance and technology. Despite having contributed insignificantly to climate change, Africa has continued to make substantial investments towards climate change adaptation, using mostly its own domestic resources. This has been necessitated by the failure of developed countries that bear the historical responsibility to fully honour their obligation to provide means of implementation support to developing countries and inadequate or inappropriate multilateral and private sector financing. COP 27 is thus a critical moment for all of us in Africa. This COP, which is taking place on African soil, must deliver meaningful and substantive progress on adaptation, Loss and Damage and means of implementation support for African and other developing countries. COP27 further needs to focus on supporting a people-centred, just and equitable transition in the developing world. The urgent need is to adapt now, while we build resilience for the future. We can only avoid loss and minimize damage with the appropriate scale of public finance that does not exacerbate the indebtedness of Africa. For too long these issues of critical importance to Africa have seen only process-related outcomes in the UNFCCC negotiations, due to the mitigation-centric approach of developed countries. COP 27 must ensure that the outcome on Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) increases the actual resilience of our population to the adverse impacts of climate change by at least 50% by 2030 and by at least 90% by 2050. Focus must be placed on the most vulnerable people and communities; in order to support health and well-being; food and water security; infrastructure and the built environment; as well as ecosystems and ecosystem services. We also need an outcome on a key set of adaptation finance goals as part of the GGA, focusing on core adaptation support in a range of sectors, and also as part of the deliberations on a new collective quantified goal on finance; and present a clear roadmap to deliver on the Glasgow decision to double adaptation finance by 2025. This roadmap, as stated in the AMCEN Dakar decisions, should include projected annual contributions, the timing of such contributions, and the multilateral institutions that will channel these resources to developing countries. Excellencies, As we all know, individual countries' domestic efforts alone will not be enough to solve the climate crisis; hence we pledge our support to work with Egypt as incoming COP 27 Presidency for a successful UNFCCC COP 27 . We need everybody to show progress in the implementation of their NDCs and need new finances for our Just Transitions, including direct budget support for developing countries to build adaptation and resilience and to address losses and damages brought about by climate change. We note with disappointment the failure by developed countries to meet their commitment of mobilizing US$ 100 billion by 2020 and stress the importance of them delivering the USD 100 billion per year from now through to 2025 for building trust and faith in the multilateral process. Our call for developed countries to deliver on their commitments to meet their goal and ensure progression of efforts in the ongoing mobilization of climate finance is a fair one. COP27 needs to be a watershed moment for implementation, by securing the Means of Implementation, in the form of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building, for African and other developing countries. This is important if we are to transition from negotiations to implementation . Excellencies, We need to be ready to accelerate the decarbonization of our economies in preparation for the anticipated outcomes of the first global stock take next year. South Africa is fully committed to the multilateral process under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In this regard, we submitted an updated NDC in September 2021, which includes a significantly more ambitious mitigation target. Our government has approved wide-reaching policies to ensure that we can meet our NDC targets. I wish to highlight the following: To ensure a science-based response to the climate crisis, which is centrally important to our just transition, we are funding a wide range of research, development and innovation (RDI) programmes and interventions. These include the Global Change Research Plan (GCRP) and its associated programmes and interventions; a Marine and Antarctic Strategy; the South African Risk and Vulnerability Atlas (SARVA); Water and Waste RDI Roadmaps; the Bio-economy Strategy; Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS); Earth Observation work under the Space Sub-Programme; the hydrogen and fuel cell technology development process (Hydrogen Society Roadmap), detailed mapping of renewable energy resources, via wind and solar atlases the advanced batteries (energy storage) initiative, and multiple programmes on moving towards a circular economy, and finally a strong research focus on water resources. Our Parliament is in the process of conducting final consultations on our Climate Change Bill - a landmark framework legislation for South Africa's climate change response. The climate change bill will provide for a coordinated approach between the spheres of government as well as to regulate climate action by the economic sectors. We have approved the methodology to set Sectoral Emissions Targets. These will be revised on a rolling basis, and will provide sectors with a strategic framework for our contribution towards global decarbonisation efforts We approved the methodology to set carbon budgets for large emitters. Our National Adaptation Strategy has been approved and is being implemented in all spheres of government. Finally, a Presidential Climate Finance Task Team has been established to lead and coordinate negotiations with the International Partner Group to give effect to the Just Energy Transition Partnership or JETP.

More than 40 000 delegates, including 120 government leaders, attended the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. The slogan for this conference, "Together for Implementation", is designed to create the impression that humanity has come together to magnanimously overcome the ongoing climate emergency.\~ However, in trying to highlight the "togetherness" of governments, the slogan unwittingly reveals how little unity there actually is within COP. While there are serious disagreements about the extent of the crisis and how best to deal with it, the most significant stumbling block among nations relates to the concept of climate justice. At its core, climate justice states that those who are most responsible for the climate emergency should be the ones who should pay the most for the mitigation and adaptation plans and processes which are necessary to avert the worst of the crisis. History shows us that a handful of countries from the Global North are largely responsible for climate change and continue to be so (China's per capita emissions are still less than half those of the US, while over a fifth of China's emissions come from exports).\~ Between 1850 and 2006, the world's richest nations (the 38 nation members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) contributed more than 80% of the increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere. Currently, 50% of CO2 emissions come from 7% of the world's population, while the poorest 45% produce less than 8% of CO2 emissions.\~ No less than a sixth of the world's population, located predominantly in the Global South, cannot be held accountable for any emissions at all, because their lifestyles are essentially carbon neutral. It is not, however, enough to simply draw attention to which countries emitted the most CO2 because they did so as they rapidly developed their economies, at colossal cost to the people and ecologies of the Global South.\~ It is now beyond dispute that the history of the development of capitalism cannot be divorced from the plunder of empire and colonialism as the nations of the Global North exploited the so-called four "cheap natures" - labour, food, energy and raw materials - in "their" respective empires to feed the growth of capital.\~ Here we see slavery; forced labour; the brutal repression of indigenous peoples; the looting of raw materials on a colossal scale and the destruction of local means of subsistence and production in favour of metropole economies. All of these must be set against the backdrop of the ecocide that occurred within colonised countries during this age of empire. Thus, the question of climate justice is not only about specific responsibility for emissions but about how those emissions came about. They were generated at great social, economic, political and environmental cost to the people of the Global South. It is this massive debt that the Global North owes the people and environments of the Global South that should be the guiding principle which informs all climate negotiations and planning at COP. While the question of climate justice is now referenced in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reports, there is, sadly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, no serious commitment by the nations of the Global North to account for their overwhelming responsibility for the climate emergency.\~ To date, even when limited promises are made to address this legacy, they are not met. For example, in 2009, "developed" countries agreed to commit a minimum of $100 billion a year to address the climate needs of "developing" countries. A target that has not yet been met.\~ Even when money is allocated to address climate challenges in the Global South, it is often in the form of loans and not grants. For example, President Cyril Ramaphosa recently noted that only 2.7% of the $8.5 billion promised to help South Africa transition away from coal is in the form of grants, with the rest coming as loans.\~ Loans increase the debt burden on many counties which are already heavily indebted (often by odious debt) and are becoming more so due to the negative impacts of climate change. So, what needs to be done? As a starting point, governments in the Global North need to fully recognise the magnitude of the debt that they owe. They need to do so by actions, not words. These actions need to be centred around how the Global North will finance the lion's share of the mitigation and adaptation requirements of countries in the Global South.\~ It is clear very significant amounts of money are needed. For example, it is estimated that South Africa needs $84 billion over the next five years to undertake a just energy transition away from fossil fuels. It is estimated that Africa will need a minimum of R250 billion a year to meet the continent's UNFCCC 2030 emissions goals alone. These costs must, however, be contrasted with the costs of not doing anything. It is estimated that damage caused by climate change to infrastructure and economies worldwide could reach $200 trillion by 2050 if comprehensive adaptation and mitigation actions are not taken.\~ If current climate policies persist, the world's most vulnerable countries will suffer average GDP losses of 20% by 2050, and 65% by 2100. The cost of taking the necessary action must be contrasted with what was spent to bail out banks after the 2008 financial crisis. It is calculated that $29 trillion was spent in the US alone turning private debt into public debt.\~ Let's not forget the $10 trillion that was found to fight Covid-19, the $6 trillion paid out every year in harmful fossil fuel subsidies or the $2 trillion spent annually on arms. The question of climate justice is thus one of priorities. The real question at COP27 is, therefore, whether the countries of the Global North are prepared to accept their responsibilities and match their rhetoric with real and sustained funding.\~ As Indian writer Amitav Ghosh reminds us, "Climate change ... is primarily a matter of justice, rooted in histories of race, class and geopolitics. From this perspective, climate negotiations are not just about emissions and greenhouse gases; they hinge precisely upon issues that are not, and can never be, discussed - issues that are ultimately related to the global distribution of power."

Thousands of world leaders, corporate elites, and civil society activists provided different visions of the future at the UNs Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFFFC) held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Known as  COP27  , the climate summit follows 26 prior failures, including Durban\' s 2011 COP17 hosted by Jacob Zuma. Egypt\' s goal is to become a major natural gas exporter. Therefore one strikingly discordant note was the oppression of democrats, human rights activists and other critics of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\' s dictatorship. He arranged the COP in a way that served the interests of nearly 700 coal, oil and methane gas lobbyists. That fact alone illustrates how little chance there was to solve humanity\' s worst-ever crisis. The goal of civil society \- especially the climate justice movement \- is always to dramatically lower carbon emissions, to ensure effective adaptation to climate change, to arrange a genuine just transition, to ensure that technological advances in renewable energy come with intellectual property waivers so we can build them in Africa, to commit to leaving fossil fuels underground, to ensure and to meet the specific needs of indigenous people, black and brown, youth, women, working-class and other oppressed peoples, and to offer financing support implementation. We at the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance have always been committed to this movement. One reason is that the global South \- for example, our residents here in the basin \- have not been responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions, even while the global North \- especially the Wentworth Engen refinery and Merebank-Isipingo Sapref refinery, Mondi plant, Toyota factory and scores of petrochemical facilities mainly run for and by white elites and their shareholders \- causes ongoing climate crises. The April 11 Rain Bomb was an example of how immediately a major company could rely upon both private insurance and municipal subsidies to acquire the necessary financing to recover and climate-proof its factory, while ordinary people have found there is no money available to redress the destruction, including nearly 500 lost lives. Many African  leaders are promoting methane gas as a transition fuel, even though it is 85 times more potent than CO\'b2, over the next 20 years. We have led many protests against offshore gas and oil drilling, including on November 11 at Suncoast Casino, which is owned by Johnny Copelyn, the former South Durban textile industry organiser who has become Shell and Total\' s main local partner for seismic blasting. The South African government and others on the continent, with weak leaders who serve Big Oil instead of their citizenry, are willing to expand fossil fuel production without considering the impacts. The dash for gas will devastate the natural environment, communities and the climate and slow down our necessary transition to renewable energy. Governments should make concrete commitments to swiftly phase out all fossil fuel usage and production at the COP this year. Governments should pledge at COP27 to stop approving any new fossil fuel projects. Governments should pledge to safeguard people who are most vulnerable and secure their involvement and representation in climate change decision-making. The COP27 The success of COP27 relies on pledges for future action, which poses a risk of failure. Over the years, we have seen how these pledges do not translate into action. We have begun to call the COPs the Conferences of Polluters. And we fear that the one coming to a conclusion in Egypt now will be one in which the polluters leave laughing all the way to the banks.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation echoed African leaders' calls for countries to rapidly scale-up finance for climate adaptation and pledged to invest $1.4bn to help smallholder farmers address the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. The announcement was made by Gates Foundation chief executive officer, Mark Suzman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( Cop27 ).For many regions, climate change is a food and economic crisis without precedent.More than 2 billion people depend on smallholder farms for food and income, yet less than 2% of global climate finance is devoted to helping these farms adapt to climate change.Food and economic crises will last longer and become more severe as climate threats escalate and further threaten food security by limiting smallholder farmers yields and resilience. The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly, said Suzman. Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency. The foundation s commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over four years to help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia build resilience and food security.Climate-smart projectsFunding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalise on their untapped potential. Women in rural Africa are the backbone of their food systems, but they have never had equal access to the resources they need to reach their full potential or build resilience to looming climate threats, said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/148/702/233343.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/148/702/233343.html :EMBED--> As the climate crisis accelerates, women s vital role in their economies is too important to overlook. With the right financing and marketing support, women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month, ultimately transforming these regional food systems and unlocking a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent. To improve the livelihoods of rural women in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the foundation is deepening its ongoing partnership with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (Ifad).The goal is to scale up initiatives that empower women farmers, support innovations at the nexus of gender and climate adaptation, and increase climate finance that gives rural women better access to the climate-smart resources they need to strengthen food systems.To accelerate the development of new adaptation innovations, the foundation is continuing to work with a coalition of partners to double the budget for the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR) agriculture research system.The CGIAR excellence in agronomy initiative partners with African research institutes, local businesses, and farmer organisations.Together, they are using Big Data Analytics, and digital platforms to deliver insights that can boost incomes, food security, and ecosystem health in smallholder farming communities. The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardises entire regions of people and economies, said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/231411.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/231411.html :EMBED--> More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth. Additional investments included in the announced commitment will support: - The Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to quickly build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects across 23 countries in Africa. Funding will provide targeted support for the technical capacity, planning, and project development required to implement programmes - The development of new applications of digital technologies to ensure smallholder farmers can anticipate and respond to climate threats. This includes an innovative weather intelligence platform developed through a new partnership between the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (Kalro) and - TomorrowNow, which provides climate-smart agriculture strategies to farmers in East Africa by means of text messages., and - African-led innovations to develop climate-smart options for improving livestock health and productivity while also reducing their climate footprint. This will be done in partnership with Canada s International Development Research Center (IDRC). This funding builds on more than a decade of investments and the foundation s recent announcement during the United Nations General Assembly of $100m in funding to help alleviate the current food crisis in Africa and South Asia and address its underlying causes.It also builds on funding commitments focused on agriculture adaptation made at previous climate summits: - In 2021 at Cop26: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pledges $315m to support innovations that help smallholder farmers adapt to climate threats; and - In 2017 at the One Planet Summit, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation committed $300m ( 255m) to help farmers in Africa and Asia cope with climate change \</doc>

African countries are marginal contributors of carbon emissions yet are bearing the brunt of extreme climate change. It is estimated that, by 2030, 118 million people on the continent will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat if we do not take action now. COP27 is an opportunity to push for measures to adapt to and mitigate the worst effects of climate change in Africa.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for the African Union to be made a permanent member of the G20. The G20 is a group of 20 countries with leading economies which come together to discuss policy on health, trade and other issues. The President was speaking during the Working Session on Food and Energy Security at the G20 Leaders' Summit, held in Bali, Indonesia. President Ramaphosa said the addition of the African Union will give a more unified approach to solving challenges currently plaguing the world. 'We call for continued G20 support for the African Renewable Energy Initiative as a means of bringing clean power to the continent on African terms. 'In this regard, this can be best achieved with the African Union joining the G20 as a permanent member. It is only through a collective and united response that we can resolve the challenges of food and energy insecurity across our world,' he said. President Ramaphosa bemoaned slow progress on negotiations between developing and developed nations at the recently held 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ). 'We are...concerned at the lack of progress on key issues in the multilateral negotiations at COP27 , especially with respect to loss and damage, finance, technology, capacity building, adaptation and the just transition. 'The outcomes of both COP27 and this Leaders' Summit must reaffirm the principles of equity and 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities'. Industrialised countries in the G20 need to demonstrate more ambitious climate action and must honour their financial commitments to developing economies,' he said. Turning to food insecurity, President Ramaphosa said several factors are contributing to increasing global food insecurity with low and middle income states bearing the brunt of it. 'The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been uneven and inadequate. Climate change has increased the frequency and the severity of droughts, floods and wildfires, disrupting agricultural production and supply. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has hiked global prices of fuel, fertilisers, edible oil, sugar and wheat. 'Low and middle income economies are most affected by the resultant food shortages and therefore need substantial financial support to ensure food security and tackle the effects of climate change,' he said. President Ramaphosa said this support would go a long way to assist these countries to use new agricultural methods and technologies which help mitigate the effects of climate change on food production. 'With this support, low and middle income countries can invest in climate-smart agriculture, sustainable food production systems and climate change early warning systems. Trade restrictions are a major source of risk for global food price stability. 'We therefore support the call for multilateral trading systems that are transparent, inclusive, predictable and rules-based." - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

The Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) will hold a Special Sitting today, Friday 4 November 2022, at which President Cyril Ramaphosa will set out Government's priority investment and financing interventions under the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan. Cabinet and the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Just Energy Transition Partnership recently agreed that there may now be broader consultation on the investment plan. South Africa has entered into a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union to support South Africa's phasing-out of coal and reduce potentially negative consequences on workers, communities and the economy. The President will update the Commission in his capacity as Chair of this independent, statutory, multi-stakeholder body established to oversee and facilitate a just and equitable transition towards a low-emissions and climate-resilient economy. Today's engagement forms part of South Africa's preparation for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, or COP27 , which will take place in Sharm El Sheikh from 6 November. President Ramaphosa will travel to the Summit next week as leader of the South African Government delegation. Under the Just Energy Transition Partnership South Africa ahead of COP27 requires a financing package that is aligned to the country's fiscal realities and demands; upholds the development and climate finance principles and obligations that are due to developing countries, and is inclusive and just. The Presidential Climate Commission is focused on creating a social partnership around a just transition; defining a vision for a just transition, and means of achieving that vision, covering the necessary sectoral shifts, technological innovation, employment opportunities, and climate finance, as well as conducting independent analysis into climate change impacts on jobs, the economy, and policy. To these ends, the Commission engages with a wide range of stakeholders, including all spheres of government, business, labour, academia, communities, and civil society. Today's session will take place on a virtual platform from 16h00 to 17h30 online to receive and consider an update on the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JETIP).

Nnimmo Bassey, a Nigerian architect and award-winning environmentalist, author and poet, talks about the history of exploitation of the African continent, the failure of the international community to recognise the climate debt owed to the Global South, and the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop27 United Nations HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop27 Climate Change Conference HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop27 ( HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop27 COP27 ) that will take place in Egypt in November 2022 . Bassey has written (such as in his book HYPERLINK https://go.ind.media/e/546932/r8pecr2t/rvlgk7/1176433086?h=IjObPkEfDoViNJ7z0YMutjcojXg99F9amoSGbyXALXc To Cook a Continent Bassey has taken square aim at the military-petroleum complex in fighting gas flaring in the Niger Delta. This dangerous undertaking cost fellow activist and poet Ken Saro-Wiwa his life in 1995. Seeing deep connections that lead to what he calls "simple solutions" to complex problems like climate change, Bassey emphasises the right of nature to exist in its own right and the importance of living in balance with nature, and rejects the proposal of false climate solutions that would advance exploitation and the financialisation of nature that threatens our existence on a "planet that can well do without us." Bassey chaired HYPERLINK https://go.ind.media/e/546932/2022-10-26/rvlgkb/1176433086?h=IjObPkEfDoViNJ7z0YMutjcojXg99F9amoSGbyXALXc Friends of the Earth International HYPERLINK https://go.ind.media/e/546932/2022-10-26/rvlgkf/1176433086?h=IjObPkEfDoViNJ7z0YMutjcojXg99F9amoSGbyXALXc Environmental Rights Action Time magazine's Heroes of the Environment. Bassey is the director of HYPERLINK https://go.ind.media/e/546932/2022-10-26/rvlgkj/1176433086?h=IjObPkEfDoViNJ7z0YMutjcojXg99F9amoSGbyXALXc Health of Mother Earth Foundation Steve Taylor: Climate change is a complex problem, but maybe there's a simple solution. What might that look like? Nnimmo Bassey: Simple solutions are avoided in today's world because they don't support capital. And capital is ruling the world. Life is simpler than people think. So, the complex problems we have today - they're all man-made, human-made by our love of complexities. But the idea of capital accumulation has led to massive losses and massive destruction and has led the world to the brink.\~ The simple solution that we need, if we're talking about warming, is this: Leave the carbon in the ground, leave the oil in the soil, [and] leave the coal in the hole. Simple as that. When people leave the fossils in the ground, they are seen as anti-progress and anti-development, whereas these are the real climate champions: People like the Ogoni people in the Niger Delta, the territory where Ken Saro-Wiwa was murdered by the Nigerian state in 1995.\~ Now the Ogoni people have kept the oil in their territory in the ground since 1993. That is millions upon millions of tons of carbon locked up in the ground. That is climate action. That is real carbon sequestration. Could you talk about the climate debt that is owed to the Global South in general, and African nations in particular? NB: There's no doubt that there is climate debt, and indeed an ecological debt owed to the Global South, and Africa in particular. It has become clear that the sort of exploitation and consumption that has gone on over the years has become a big problem, not just for the regions that were exploited, but for the entire world. The argument we're hearing is that if the financial value is not placed on nature, nobody's going to respect or protect nature.\~ Now, why was no financial cost placed on the territories that were damaged? Why were they exploited and sacrificed without any consideration or thought about what the value is to those who live in the territory, and those who use those resources?\~ So, if we're to go the full way with this argument of putting price tags on nature so that nature can be respected, then you have to also look at the historical harm and damage that's been done, place a price tag on it, recognise that this is a debt that is owed, and have it paid. ST: You've discussed in our HYPERLINK interview how some policies meant to address climate change are "false solutions," particularly those intended to address the climate debt owed to the Global South and to Africa in particular. Could you talk a bit about the misnomer of the Global North's proposals of so-called " HYPERLINK https://go.ind.media/e/546932/info-service-2022-cc220301-htm/rvlgkm/1176433086?h=IjObPkEfDoViNJ7z0YMutjcojXg99F9amoSGbyXALXc nature-based solutions NB: The narrative has been so cleverly constructed that when you hear, for example, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), everybody says, "Yes, we want to do that." And now we're heading to "nature-based solutions."\~ Who doesn't want nature-based solutions? Nature provided the solution to the challenges [that indigenous people have] had for centuries, for millennia. And now, some clever people appropriate the terminology. So that by the time indigenous communities say they want nature-based solutions, the clever people will say, "Well, that's what we're talking about."\~ Whereas they're not talking about that at all. Everything's about generating value chains and revenue, completely forgetting about who we are as part of nature. So, the entire scheme has been one insult after another. The very idea of putting a price on the services of Mother Earth, and appropriating financial capital from those resources, from this process, is another horrible way by which people are being exploited. ST: How does REDD adversely impact local communities on the African continent? NB: REDD is a great idea, which should be supported by everyone merely looking at that label. But the devil is in the detail. It is made by securing or appropriating or grabbing some forest territory, and then declaring that to be a REDD forest. And now once that is done, what becomes paramount is that it is no longer a forest of trees. It is now a forest of carbon, a carbon sink.\~ So, if you look at the trees, you don't see them as ecosystems. You don't see them as living communities. You see them as carbon stock. And that immediately sets a different kind of relationship between those who are living in the forest, those who need the forest, and those who are now the owners of the forest.\~ And so, it's because of that logic that [some] communities in Africa have lost access to their forests, or lost access to the use of their forests, the way they'd been using [them] for centuries. ST: As an activist, you have done some dangerous work opposing gas flaring. Could you tell us about gas flaring and how it impacts the Niger Delta? NB: Gas flaring, simply put, is setting gas on fire in the oil fields. Because when crude oil is extracted in some locations, it could come out of the ground with natural gas and with water, and other chemicals. The gas that comes out of the well with the oil can be easily reinjected into the well. And that is almost like carbon capture and storage. It goes into the well and also helps to push out more oil from the well. So you have more carbon released into the atmosphere.\~ Secondly, the gas can be collected and utilised for industrial purposes or for cooking, or processed for liquefied natural gas. Or the gas could just be set on fire. And that's what we have, at many points - probably over 120 locations in the Niger Delta. So you have these giant furnaces. They pump a terrible cocktail of dangerous elements into the atmosphere, sometimes in the middle of where communities [reside], and sometimes horizontally, not [with] vertical stacks. So you have birth defects, [and] all kinds of diseases imaginable, caused by gas flaring. It also reduces agricultural productivity, up to one kilometre from the location of the furnace. ST: The UN climate conference COP27 is coming up in Egypt. Is there any hope for some real change here? NB: The only hope I see with the COP is the hope of what people can do outside the COP. The mobilisations that the COPs generate in meetings across the world - people talking about climate change, people taking real action, and indigenous groups organising and choosing different methods of agriculture that help cool the planet. People just doing what they can - that to me is what holds hope. The COP itself is a rigged process that works in a very colonial manner, offloading climate responsibility on the victims of climate change.

This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa approached The International Partners Group of five nations to back the country's Just Energy transition investment plan amid the climate talks taking place in Egypt. The group comprises France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU. LEADERS of the EFF Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu have vowed to oppose President Cyril Ramaphosa's plans to shut down and decommission coal mines in the country. This comes after Ramaphosa approached The International Partners Group of five nations to back the country's Just Energy transition investment plan amid the climate talks taking place in Egypt. The group comprises France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU. Ramaphosa appealed to the chairperson of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) meeting in Egypt for higher-scale funding streams and technological support for South Africa after the five nations agreed to give South Africa's Just Energy plan the green light. According to media reports, the partners plan to make an additional R10\~billion available to South Africa on top of the already agreed upon $8.5bn (about R150bn) for the first phase of the programme. However, on Tuesday, the EFF issued a damning statement opposing any plans Ramaphosa had to decommission coal-fired power stations and mines. The party condemned these "nonsensical and suicidal commitments" which would render the country's coal industries redundant. "The Economic Freedom Fighters distances itself and condemns the nonsensical and suicidal commitments made by Cyril Ramaphosa at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt ( COP27 ), where he has recommitted himself to destroy the coal industry in South Africa," the party said. The EFF has accused Ramaphosa of surrendering the country's future to environmental imperialists, saying that the plan would put paid to the economies of small towns such as Emalahleni, Secunda, Lephalale and many others whose economy is based on coal extraction. "We are going to oppose this thing. There won't be any America who will build energy security here in South Africa. We have got our own capacity. There are also a lot of options that we can explore in relation to coal. There are coal technologies that we can explore because we have 400 years of lifespan and we are just instructed by Americans," Shivambu said. DFA 1999 - 2022 Independent Newspapers (Pty) Limited.

The human cost of climate change is making headlines almost daily. Global warming is no longer a distant or theoretical threat, but an immediate material one - a phenomenon that affects each of us, our families, and our neighbours. No society has been left unscathed by more frequent and intense HYPERLINK https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3190803/china-drought/index.html droughts , HYPERLINK wildfires , HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/09/30/hurricane-ian-historical-ranking-florida/ storms , and HYPERLINK https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/devastating-floods-pakistan-2022 floods . Millions of people are already battling for survival. And that is with temperatures having risen by just HYPERLINK https://indianexpress.com/article/world/united-nations-climate-change-report-temperature-rise-warning-7445494/ 1.1\'b0C , relative to pre-industrial levels. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/ made clear , every additional tenth of a degree makes matters worse.\~ Yet the changes needed to avert catastrophe are not being made, at least not fast enough, and the developing world is increasingly frustrated with rich countries' refusal to pay their fair share for a crisis for which they bear overwhelming responsibility. But there is reason for hope. In my discussions with delegations around the world, I see their determination to make COP27 a success. Already, societies are starting to act. Climate adaptation and new forms of collaboration are gaining traction, and investment in climate tech is HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-17/climate-tech-investors-advise-the-boom-is-h booming .\~ This includes new carbon-removal technologies, electric transport solutions, and renewable energies. As a result, clean-energy prices continue to fall: almost two-thirds of renewable power added in G20 countries in 2021 HYPERLINK https://www.irena.org/newsroom/pressreleases/2022/Jul/Renewable-Power-Remains- cost less than the cheapest coal-fired options. My country, Egypt, is on track to produce HYPERLINK https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/egypt-electricity-and-renewable-energy 42% of its energy from renewable resources by 2035. At the same time, civil society is devising mechanisms for holding companies and governments to account, guarding against greenwashing and ensuring a just transition. There is a new focus on restoring nature. The question for those of us who will participate in COP27 is straightforward: how can we seize the opportunity the conference offers to create a sense of common endeavour, prevent backsliding and inspire an approach based on science, trust, justice, and equity? At its heart, climate action is a bargain. Developing countries have HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/the-big-picture/climate-finance-in-the-negotiations agreed in good faith to help tackle a crisis they did not cause, on the understanding that support - particularly financial support - would be provided to complement their own efforts, which are often limited because of scarce resources and competing development needs.\~ Developed countries must uphold their end of that bargain, by supporting both mitigation and adaptation, thus fulfilling their envisaged responsibilities in the HYPERLINK Paris agreement . On the mitigation front, we must move from rhetoric to action in cutting our greenhouse-gas emissions and removing carbon from our atmosphere. All countries must embrace more ambitious HYPERLINK https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/loss-and-damage-demands-additional-funding-commitments-by-nicola-sturgeon-2022-08 nationally determined contributions At the same time, we must craft a transformative adaptation agenda, so that people - especially in climate-vulnerable regions - can protect themselves from the effects that are already unavoidable. The bill for this agenda must be divided fairly. To date, a disproportionate share of climate finance has been directed toward mitigation, leaving developing countries largely to fend for themselves in financing adaptation investment. But even the finance provided for mitigation is far from sufficient and has not been delivered with the appropriate instruments. In 2009, developed countries pledged to provide HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3 $100-billion annually HYPERLINK according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's Standing Committee on Finance.\~ And yet this amount has not been delivered. We need an increase in the scale of finance pledges - especially for adaptation - at COP27 , compared to those made at COP26 in Glasgow. Developed countries must also honour the pledge they made last year to HYPERLINK https://www.iied.org/rich-countries-track double adaptation finance HYPERLINK https://www.greenclimate.fund/decision/b33-11 replenishment . And the time has come to address the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/introduction-to-loss-and-damage loss and damage suffered by countries that did not cause the climate crisis. This remains contentious, but I believe that we can approach it constructively, guided by the priorities of developing countries, for the benefit of all. A just transition must account for the needs of various regions. For example, African countries are committed in principle to adopting renewable energy and refraining from exploiting their fossil-fuel resources.\~ HYPERLINK https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/business/technology/africa-needs-25bn-a-year-for-full-electricity-access-iea-3854316 lack electricity , and about 900 million don't have HYPERLINK https://cleantechnica.com/2022/08/10/more-than-970-million-people-still-do-not-have-access-to-clean-cooking-600-mill clean cooking fuels All of these imperatives must be pursued together, with a carefully designed package of actions, rather than through piecemeal measures. They are the pillars of a just transition. If one is missing, the entire edifice collapses. Ahead of the 2015 COP in Paris, few believed that an agreement would be reached. Yet delegates from all over the world came together, and through skill and perseverance, reached a groundbreaking deal. In 2022, we face even higher hurdles, so we must work even harder to clear them. If we do, we will usher in a new age of clean energy, innovation exchange, food and water security, and greater climate justice. As daunting as this challenge is, we have no choice but to confront it. We must negotiate with one another, because there can be no negotiating with the climate. - \£9 Project Syndicate \~ Sameh Shoukry is COP27 president-designate and Egypt's minister of foreign affairs.

EMERGING economy leaders yesterday called for the developed world to fulfil its pledges and commitments toward financing initiatives aimed at dealing with climate change. The world leaders were delivering their national statements during the first part of the high-level segment of the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNCCC) in Egypt yesterday. COP27 is a gathering of UN member states who have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to well below 2\'baC and work hard to keep the 1.5\'baC, in a bid to limit global warming. The Paris Agreement outlines long-term goals that guide governments towards limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2\'b0C, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5\'b0C. According to a recent report by UK NGO Debt Justice, sub-Saharan African countries will go almost $1 trillion (R17.84trln) into debt over the next 10 years unless wealthy countries provide enough finance to tackle the climate crisis President Cyril Ramaphosa drummed up the message that African countries needed significant financial support to build adaptive capacity, foster resilience to keep the world on the 1.5\'b0C pathway. To achieve this, Ramaphosa said Africa would need a predictable, appropriate and at-scale funding stream and technological support, as well as international equity and transitions that are just and inclusive.  This places a great responsibility on developed economies to honour their commitments to those countries with the greatest need and that confront the greatest environmental, social and economic effects of climate change, Ramaphosa said.  The multilateral development banks need to be reformed to meet the needs of developing economies for sustainable development and climate resilience.  At present, multilateral support is out of reach of the majority of the world\' s population due to lending policies that are risk averse and carry onerous costs and conditionalities.  We need a clear roadmap to deliver on the Glasgow decision to double adaptation financing by 2025. Eric Njuguna, national co-lead for Fridays for Future, Kenya, said the youth in Africa had had enough empty promises, inaction and double standards from governments.  At the 9th International Policy Conference we came face to face with a number of African government ministers, senior UN and African Union representatives, and ambassadors from rich countries, Njuguna said.  We made it clear we expect them to act on their commitments at COP27 . If they don\' t, they will compromise not only our future rights and well-being, but those of billions of young people around the world. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe lambasted rich countries, especially in Europe, for turning to fossil fuels to mitigate against the energy crisis. Wickremesinghe said the  chequ- ered implementation of previous decisions, including those of COP26 was extremely disheartening.  Regrettably, the ground reality is that the fossil fuel-based industrialised countries of G7 and G20 who have been the main promoters of green hydrogen are now backtracking to use of fossil fuel, he said. Wickremesinghe also proposed to establish an International Climate Change University in Sri Lanka with an ancillary institute in the Maldives to counter obstacles in implementing climate action plans. More than 100 world leaders have gathered at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt to work towards implementation of existing climate agreements. \</doc>

Our common future depends on climate action now President's blogSeven months ago, parts of our country experienced a deadly natural disaster that showed how vulnerable South Africa is to the effects of climate change. The floods that lashed parts of KwaZulu-Natal, North West and the Eastern Cape in April this year were of such intensity that they laid waste to nearly everything in their path. Homes were swept away by the rising waters and landslides. Businesses and properties were waterlogged, causing millions of rands in damage. Key infrastructure like ports, rail lines and roads were damaged or destroyed, resulting in substantial losses to the economy. Worst of all, more than 400 people lost their lives. It has long been established that there is a clear connection between the frequency of extreme weather events and climate change. It is also well-established that climate change has increased the likelihood of such events recurring. According to one study, extreme weather events that were once expected every 40 years, now happen every 20 years. Extreme weather like flooding is also increasing in intensity. During the April floods, the city of Ethekwini received the equivalent of 110 days of rainfall in just one day. This week I will be attending the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt, also known as COP27 . The Conference is taking place at a time when developing economy countries are coming under increased pressure to contribute more to reducing global warming. South Africa will be chairing a high-level roundtable on just transition, where we will be making the case for developed economies to do more to support developing ones to meet their climate change commitments. Although South Africa is playing its part in the global climate change effort, we have been consistent in emphasising our right to development. We must ensure that the transition to a low-carbon, climate change resilient economy does not jeopardise our developmental goals. The move from fossil fuels to greener, cleaner energy sources cannot take place at the expense of economic growth and job creation. We go to COP27 Africa historically bears the least responsibility for climate change, but it is Africa that is feeling its effects most. Seven years since the Paris Agreement was adopted at COP21, countries with developed economies have largely failed to honour their commitments to provide substantial financial support for climate actions in developing economies. One of the issues we will be highlighting at COP27 is that multilateral financial institutions need to lower the cost for developing economies to borrow money to fund their climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. Many people may think that the discussions taking place in Egypt at COP27 are far-removed from their everyday lives. This is far from the case. We all have a clear stake and an abiding interest in the outcomes of COP27 . As a country we will be outlining our own contribution to the global climate change effort, but at the same time be making a clear call for developed economy countries to meet their obligations. It is only with this substantial support that we will be able to build the resilience that is needed to protect our country and safeguard our economy. It is only with significant additional funding that we can ensure that future generations of South Africans live in an environment that is clean, conducive to health and well-being, and that has not been destroyed because of the inaction of today's leaders. With best regards, \</doc>

The latest annual climate conference has begun in the face of a worsening climate crisis and further retreats by rich nations following the energy crisis induced by NATO sanctions after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Copping out again The 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is now meeting in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November 2022. COP27 takes place amidst worsening poverty, hunger and war, and higher prices, exacerbating many interlinked climate, environmental and socio-economic crises. The looming world economic recession is likely to be deeper than in 2008. The likely spiral into stagflation will make addressing the climate crisis even more difficult. Invoking the Ukraine war as pretext, governments and corporations are rushing to increase fossil fuel production to offset the deepening energy crisis. Resources which should be deployed for climate adaptation and mitigation have been diverted for war, fossil fuel extraction and use, including resumption of shale gas 'fracking' as well as coal mining and burning. War causes huge social and economic damage to people, society and the environment. The wars in Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere impose high costs on all, disrupting energy and food supplies, and raising prices sharply. The future is already here Crossing it, the world faces risks of far more severe climate change effects on people and ecosystems, especially in the tropics and sub-tropical zone. But the future is already upon us. Accelerating warming is already causing worse extreme weather events, ravaging economies, communities and ecosystems. Recent floods in Pakistan displaced 33 million people. Wildfires, extreme heat, ice melt, drought, and extreme weather phenomena are already evident on many continents, causing disasters worldwide. In 2021, the sea level rose to a record high, and is expected to continue rising. UN reports estimate women and children are 14 times more likely than adult men to die during climate disasters. Popular sentiment is shifting, even in the US, where 'climate scepticism' is strongest. Devastation threatened by Hurricane Ida in 2021 not only revived painful memories of Katrina in 2005, but also heightened awareness of warming-related extreme weather events. Stronger climate action needed In international negotiations, rich nations have evaded historical responsibility for 'climate debt' by only focusing on current emissions. Hence, there is no recognition of a duty to compensate those most adversely impacted in the global South. Last year's COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact was hailed for its call to 'phase-out' coal. This has now been quickly abandoned by Europe with the war. And for developing countries, Glasgow failed to deliver any significant progress on climate finance. At COP27 After failing to even meet its modest climate finance promises of 2009, the rich North is dithering, pleading for further talks until 2024 to work out financing details. Meanwhile, the G7 has muddied the waters by counter-offering its Global Shield Against Climate Risks - a disaster insurance scheme. Get priorities right What the world needs, instead, are rapidly promoted and implemented measures as part of a more rapid, just, internationally funded transition for the global South. This should: - replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, including by subsidizing renewable energy generation for energy-deficient poor populations. - promote energy-saving and efficiency measures to reduce its use and greenhouse gas emissions by at least 70% (from 1990) by 2030. - implement a massive global public works programme, creating 'green jobs' to replace employment in 'unsustainable' industries. - develop needed sustainable technologies, e.g., to replace corporate agricultural practices with £groecological' farming methods, investment and technology. Another world is possible Another world is possible. A massive social and political transformation is needed. But the relentless pursuit of private profit has always been at the expense of people and nature. Greed cannot be expected to become the basis for a just solution to climate change, let alone environmental degradation, world poverty, hunger and gross inequalities. The COP27 conference is now taking place in Sharm-al-Sheikh, an isolated, heavily policed tourist resort. Only one major road goes in and out, as if designed to keep out civil society and drown out voices from the global South. The luxury hotels there are charging rates that have put COP27 beyond the means of many, especially climate justice activists from poorer countries. The rich and powerful arrived in over 400 private jets, making a mockery of decarbonization rhetoric. Thus, the COP process is increasingly seen as exclusive. Without making real progress on the most important issues, it is increasingly seen as slow, irrelevant and ineffective. Generating inadequate agreements at best, the illusion of progress thus created is dangerously misleading at worst. By generating great expectations and false hopes, but actually delivering little, it is failing the world, even when it painstakingly achieves difficult compromises which fall short of what is needed. Multilateralism at risk Multilateral platforms, such as the UNFCCC, have long been expected to engage governments to cooperate in developing, implementing and enforcing solutions. With the erosion of multilateralism since the end of the Cold War, these are increasingly being bypassed. Instead, self-appointed private interests, with means, pretend to speak for world civil society. Strapped for resources, multilateral platforms and other organizations are under pressure to forge partnerships and other forms of collaboration with them. Thus, inadequate ostensible private solutions increasingly dominate policy discourses. Widespread fiscal deficits have generated interest in them due to the illusory prospect of private funding. Private interests have thus gained considerable influence. Thus, the new spinmeisters of Davos and others have gained influence, offering seductively attractive, but ultimately false, often misleading and typically biased solutions. Meanwhile, global warming has gone from bad to worse. UN Member States must stiffen the backs of multilateral organizations to do what is right and urgently needed, rather than simply going with the flow, typically of cash.

COP 27 's official Youth Envoy, Dr Omnia El Omrani, realised the impact of climate change in 2017, and Hurricane Irma slammed Miami. As a doctor, she witnessed the influx of emergency patients into the hospital as a result of the hurricane, which piqued her interest in environmental and climate issues. She described it as a significant milestone in her life. "As a result, I decided to become an activist in the areas of public health and climate change over the ensuing years. I did this by attending events as a representative of a global organisation of medical students and young doctors, starting with the COP24 Climate Change Summit in Poland in 2018 and continuing through the Glasgow Conference in Britain in 2021," Omnia said in an interview with IPS. El Omrani is an Egyptian plastic and reconstruction surgery resident, community leader and climate change activist. She was appointed by the President-designate of the 27th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), Sameh Shoukry. Host country Egypt has committed to empowering youth. It sees the role of the youth envoy as a way to encourage and promote youth perspectives before COP27 and throughout the negotiations and conference itself. El Omrani sees herself as central to involving the world's young people at COP27 to promote climate action and implementation with the critical interventions necessary for the conference's implementation-focused strategy. The Youth Climate Summit COY17's most significant outcome is to develop a statement that reflects the youth's perception of the problem - and to suggest solutions. The youth statement's coordination began ahead of the COY17 youth summit, and YOUNGO with working groups will review and edit a draught version in Sharm El-Sheikh from November 2-4, after which it will be sent to the COP27 president, she explained. "The unique thing that we will do this year On the Young and Future Generations Day (November 10), we will have a roundtable discussion instead of a panel discussion at COP27 . Here we will bring together high-ranking officials, negotiators, and ministers and YOUNGO to discuss the statement and (debate) how to get it implemented," El Omrani said. YOUNGO is the UNFCCC's official youth constituency. These approaches include providing solid evidence on the impact of climate change. For example, Pakistan floods this year caused massive damage to the country's economy. Small island countries share similar issues. Likewise, severe heat waves swept through Europe. El Omrani, who is 27, has represented over 1.3 million medical students, leading their global advocacy and policy work on climate change with the UNFCCC, UNEP, and WHO, while also being engaged in climate action projects across Egypt and the world. El Omrani was the International Federation of Medical Students' Association's National Public Officer, MENA Focal Point, and Liaison Officer for Public Health Issues. She has participated in climate discussions at COP24, COP25, and COP26, environmental projects, and international climate conferences, such as the WHO Civil Society Group to Advance Climate and Health. "I believe it is my responsibility to inform people about the significance of climate change in my community and at the institution where I work as a doctor. I also believe I must deliver these messages to decision-makers and urge them to act on this issue," she added. "I am now developing a curriculum to be taught at universities to increase awareness of climate change issues, not just in Egypt but also throughout Africa, in collaboration with Ain Shams University in Egypt."

South Africa congratulates the Egyptian COP27 Presidency for successful hosting of the twenty seventh session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)'s Sharm el-Sheikh Conference of Parties ( COP27 ). COP27 Climate Conference opened with the Climate Implementation Summit that was convened by His Excellency Abdel Fattah Saeed Hussein Khalil El-Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt and attended by over a hundred world leaders. The Summit provided the political momentum and guidance to the negotiators that contributed towards the success of COP27 , including the historic decision to establish a Fund to assist developing countries to respond to Loss and Damage caused by climate change. President Cyril Ramaphosa represented South Africa at the Summit, co-chairing the Summit's roundtable discussion on Just Transitions and delivering South Africa's national statement. President Ramaphosa stressed the need for a fundamental transformation and modernisation of the global financial architecture and reform of the multilateral development banks to make them fit-for-purpose in supporting Sustainable Development and Just Transitions. President Ramaphosa also met with South Africa's partners Germany, France, the European Union, the United States of America and the United Kingdom, on the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). He presented South Africa's JETP-Investment Plan whilst indicating that South Africa will need R1.5 trillion dollars in the next five years for implementation. The money required should be in the form of highly concessional loans and grants. He also indicated that the government of South Africa will now employ a project manager who will be responsible to implement the JETP-IP as soon as the Presidential Climate Commission concludes its work on stakeholder consultations on the JETP-IP. The final COP27 This agreement on a four-year work programme, consists of at least two global dialogues, and a review at the end of the four years on whether to continue the programme (after 2026). The Mitigation Work Program will cover the IPCC 2006 key emissions sectors and the IPCC WGIII report. There will be an annual decision by the Conference of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) for the four years. The agreed text in the all-important Cover Document frames the climate crisis and its solutions in terms of the sustainable development goals and Just Transitions, leaving no one left behind, and the need for broader financial sector reform to achieve these. The call for multilateral consensus on making financial flows consistent with pathways towards low emissions and climate resilient development could open new investment opportunities in Africa for clean energy investments, critical for addressing energy poverty on the continent. The key milestone agreed to at COP27 , was on financial arrangements to address loss and damage due to climate change. COP27 agreed to set up a Fund on loss and damage. It established a Transitional Committee to work on the modalities of this fund with a view of taking a decision at COP28 in 2023. COP27 also emphasized the need for increased momentum to reform the Multilateral Development Banks and International Financial Institutions and called on the shareholders of these institutions to take decisive action to scale-up climate finance in 2023 and make their institutional arrangements fit for purpose. There was also agreement amongst Parties to accelerate work on reducing vulnerability of societies due to climate change impacts. While we must acknowledge that from our national perspective, we did not see the advancement on actually operationalizing the Global Goal on Adaptation, we had been hoping for. In particular South Africa had called for a target to increase the resilience of global population by 50% in 2030. We had also called for COP27 to establish a framework for Global Goal on Adaptation that contained high level indicators and targets to galvanize collective global action and support. Instead, the outcome focused more on workshops to build understanding in critical sectors such as health, poverty and livelihoods; terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; oceans and coasts; water resource management; food; cities and settlements; cultural heritage and mountain regions and biodiversity. South Africa will engage in these discussions with a view to setting up concrete targets and indicators that can help us tract progress on reducing vulnerability of our population. The Presidency's package on finance, in the context of the failure of developed countries to meet the USD 100 billion goal by 2020, provides incremental progress on moving forward to the establishment of the new collective goal in 2025, but falls short of action to meet developed countries obligations. COP27 has provided the momentum to reform the Multilateral Development Banks and International Financial institutions and we expected the shareholders of these institutions to take decisive action to scale up climate finance in 2023 and make their institutions fit for purpose. COP27 also marked the fifth South African Pavilion (partnership between the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) and National Business Initiative), which showcased the collaboration between government and business in the fight against climate change. The South Africa Pavilion provided an excellent platform for business and government to showcase the country's efforts towards co-creating and implementing a Just Transition to net zero emissions by 2050. More than 50 events were hosted at the Pavilion during COP27 . \</doc>

After a tense impasse and many hours of negotiations, almost 200 countries struck a deal to set up a loss and damage fund to assist nations worst hit by climate change - a demand considered not-negotiable by the developing countries. COP27 was extended by a day after negotiators couldn't agree on the fund - leading to UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres saying on Friday, November 18, 2022, that the time for talking about loss and damage finance is over. He alluded to a growing breakdown of trust between developing and developed countries. Guterres, early on Sunday, November 20, 2022, welcomed the fund saying: "I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period. Clearly, this will not be enough, but it is a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust." He added that the voices of those on the frontlines of the climate crisis must be heard. Speaking in the closing plenary, COP President H.E. Sameh Shoukry said: "The work that we've managed to do here in the past two weeks, and the results we have together achieved, are a testament to our collective will, as a community of nations, to voice a clear message that rings loudly today, here in this room and around the world: that multilateral diplomacy still works... despite the difficulties and challenges of our times, the divergence of views, level of ambition or apprehension, we remain committed to the fight against climate change... we rose to the occasion, upheld our responsibilities and undertook the important decisive political decisions that millions around the world expect from us." Shoukry noted: "This was not easy. We worked around the clock. Long days and nights. Strained and sometimes tense, but united and working for one aim, one higher purpose, one common goal that we all subscribe to and aspire to achieve. In the end, we delivered." Under the previous global climate summit, which took place in Glasgow, Scotland last year, parties agreed on the roadmap where developing countries, which did little to cause the climate crisis, arrived with a determination to win a commitment from rich nations to compensate them for this damage. On several occasions during negotiations, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, also the COP27 President, stated that climate finance remains key for Africa since the continent contributes 4 percent to global emissions and is adversely affected to a much higher degree by global warming-relate events. On losses and damages, some climate finance experts believe that ongoing climate talks on finance at COP27 are one of the most painful examples of the African proverb that when the elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled. IATP is a think tank that analyses the interconnection between agriculture, trade, and climate in developing countries. Since 2015, loss and damage have served as the main catalyser under the UNFCCC process, especially for enhancing financial support for adaptation to avert, minimise and address climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Murphy pointed out that the G77 includes a very wide range of countries and interests, and the climate crisis is not suffered equally across the South. "Currently developing nations at COP27 are likely showing that everyone is responsible for the negative realities of climate change and loss and damage negotiations is the most recent iteration of this long-standing fight," she said. While many negotiators in Sharm El Sheikh believe that rich countries are lagging in measures to allocate loss and damage funding, there is a consensus that the current negotiations on climate finance did not go very well, particularly with respect to the expectations for COP27 . "Unfortunately, if the trust is broken, it may affect other issues being negotiated and ultimately affect our collective action of combatting climate change," the senior financial expert said. The bank published the 2022 African Economic Outlook report on the needs of African Countries for loss and damage in 2022-2030 at between USD 289.2 to USD 440.5 billion. The estimated adaptation finance needs are in a similar order of magnitude. For many Africans, according to Olufunso, the negotiations were not aggressive enough in finding solutions urgently needed at both scale and speed. Until the end of the summit, loss and damage fund remained a major sticking point. "Negotiations are going well in some items and not well in other items (... ) Rwanda and other vulnerable countries had much expectation in securing a decision of adopting the establishment of loss and damage fund," Faustin Munyazikwiye, the Deputy Director General of Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA) and Rwanda's Lead negotiator, told IPS in an interview. According to him, this item [on loss and damage] did not go well. African negotiators at COP27 prioritised filling gaps between present risks associated with climate change and financing for adaptation. However, most developing countries prefer to ensure that finance for loss and damages is channelled through the private sector and is not necessarily a liability for rich countries. But other experts believe that cost of repairing these damages is staggering and the countries which should pay are the ones who contributed to climate change in the first place. While some climate finance experts observe that the commitment by rich nations to pay the developing world $100 billion cannot even compensate what Africa's needs, others point out that COP27 must deliver a bold finance facility to pay for loss and damage to communities already impacted by climate change on the continent. Kelly Dent, the Global Director of External Engagement at the UK-based World Animal Protection, told IPS most vulnerable countries, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, are considering the climate emergency as a matter of life. "Without a coherent and meaningful agreement on finance, COP27 will fall short of its mission and put millions of lives at risk," she said. From Dent's perspective, a roadmap to track and deliver a doubling of adaptation finance is critical. COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, indicates that the continent requires 7 to 15 billion US dollars annually to enhance adaptation to climate change besides the nearly 3 trillion dollars investment that is needed to implement nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and cap emissions in line with the Paris climate deal.

As the world focuses urgently on energy transition and decarbonisation, there is clearly no shortage of ambition on the part of many African governments to play a key role in global efforts to tackle climate change.\~ The Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions and energy and raw material price volatility, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, have all led to some delays in planned projects. That's true even in countries like Morocco that have made giant strides in adopting renewable technologies. The impetus remains strong, however, and these are, hopefully, short-term challenges.\~\~ Nonetheless, fossil fuels are likely to remain key to Africa's economic development in the medium term, both as a source of revenue and as feedstock for power generation. Pressure Africa is under significant pressure from the international community to decarbonise at pace even though it accounts for less than 6% of global energy consumption and is responsible for only 2% of global emissions.\~ Despite that, the need to transition is readily recognised in Africa, not least because the impact of climate change is being felt much more acutely here than in many other regions.\~ But, with a population set to double in the next thirty years, wider development challenges are also immense. While hundreds of millions of people have no access to electricity and clean water, there is also an urgent need to tackle famine, upgrade infrastructure and improve education and healthcare.\~ Striking a balance Renewable technology is advancing fast and becoming more affordable. Africa also has a strong track record of embracing and developing breakthrough technologies, as its leading role in the mobile communications revolution shows, and with its abundant sources of renewable energy, there are opportunities for Africa to help lead the way in the evolution of new renewable technologies.\~ But some African governments are having to strike a balance between developing their abundant renewable resources (primarily hydro, solar, wind, and, for the future, green hydrogen) and monetising their rich fossil fuel resources, particularly gas and oil, both as a solution to their own energy needs, and to generate much-needed foreign currency revenue. These revenues are vital for the continent's economic development.\~ With developed economies in Europe reverting to coal-fired power generation as an alternative to Russian gas, African governments can understandably feel aggrieved by criticism of their own plans for hydrocarbon development. Financing challenge Financing change is also a significant challenge.\~ Many utilities lack the resources to invest in new power generation or the liquidity to pay offtake tariffs to independent power producers (IPPs) when they are allowed to enter the market. Multilaterals and development finance institutions are helping to ease some of these financing challenges, but the task is immense.\~ The much-needed market reforms being introduced in South Africa to allow IPPs to supply industrial and commercial clients direct show a way forward and are likely to be closely followed elsewhere. In South Africa, many of these projects are using renewable energy and they are helping to ease the pressure on an electricity system that is struggling to meet demand, with rolling blackouts now an uncomfortable norm.\~ But clearly much more needs to be done and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa alternatives to utility-scale renewable projects will need to be found, given the lack of grid infrastructure.\~ Realism We should acknowledge what is already being achieved in Africa and take a pragmatic and realistic view of what can feasibly be achieved in the short, medium and long term.\~ Renewable energy will play an increasingly important role on the continent. But we call it energy transition for a reason: it's not something that will happen overnight.\~ Renewables alone can't meet the continent's urgent power needs in the short term and it would be inequitable to deny African countries the right to develop their own hydrocarbon resources and benefit from the associated economic benefits when there is ongoing demand, notwithstanding global moves towards decarbonisation.\~ Africa needs to find its own energy mix, rather than one that is imposed from the outside, as the transition gathers pace.\~ With the right support and investment, Africa will, given time, achieve its own energy transition.\~ And as COP27 Tim Scales is head of the Africa group and co-head of the global projects practice at law firm Allen & Overy.

South Africa has called on all Parties to work constructively and in a spirit of compromise to achieve the draft outcomes of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)'s Sharm el-Sheikh Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), which frames the climate crisis. 'It reflects the urgency of the climate crisis and the need to keep the 1.5-degree temperature target alive during what the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls the 'Critical Decade', including by providing a clear programme to advance the mitigation agenda from now to 2030,' said the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment on Saturday. The department said the draft correctly frames the climate crisis and its solutions in terms of the sustainable development goals and Just Transitions, leaving no one left behind, and the need for broader financial sector reform to achieve these. 'The proposal to seek multilateral consensus on making financial flows consistent with pathways towards low emissions and climate resilient development will open new investment opportunities in Africa for clean energy investments that will equally address the continent's energy poverty crisis. ' COP27 The draft text further recognizes the urgency of finding a solution for developing countries for loss and damage caused by climate change and agrees to establish new financing arrangements and a mechanism to address this. 'On Africa's priority issue of adaptation, there is agreement amongst Parties to accelerate work on identifying indicators and targets to facilitate support to achieving the goal and assessing collective progress. While South Africa welcome's the incremental progress reflected in the COP27 Presidency's package on finance towards the establishment of the new collective goal in 2025, further urgent action is required to meet developed countries' obligations. 'On balance, the draft text suggests there can be good progress on implementation, and we are confident that we are well placed to call this African COP27 a success,' the department said. South Africa has congratulated the Egyptian COP27 Presidency on the release of the draft outcomes text to the UNFCCC's Sharm el-Sheikh COP27 . -SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

World leaders gathered yesterday for climate talks in Egypt facing pressure to deepen cuts in emissions and financially back developing countries already devastated by the effects of rising temperatures. In an opening address, UN secretary-General Antonio Guterres spelled out in chilling terms the reality that they had to tackle. In the midst of a barrage of international crises, Guterres said the world was in  the fight of our lives .  Humanity has a choice: co-operate or perish, he told the UN COP27 summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik.  It is either a Climate Solidarity Pact, or a Collective Suicide Pact. Guterres called for a  historic deal between rich countries and emerging economies that would aim to reduce emissions and keep the temperature rise to the more ambitions Paris Agreement target of 1.5\'baC above the pre- industrial era. He warned that on the current trajectory,  we are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator . The UN\' s COP27 climate summit comes as nations worldwide are facing increasingly intense natural disasters that have taken thousands of lives this year alone and cost billions of dollars. At the opening ceremony on Sunday, COP27 officials urged governments to keep up efforts to combat climate change despite soaring inflation, the energy crunch linked to Russia\' s war on Ukraine and the persistent Covid-19 pandemic.  The fear is other priorities take precedence, top UN climate change official Simon Stiell told a news conference. The  fear is that we lose another day, another week, another month, another year \- because we can\' t , he said. The world must slash greenhouse emissions by 45% by 2030 to cap global warming at 1.5\'baC. But current trends would see carbon pollution increase 10% by the end of the decade and Earth\' s surface heat up 2.8\'baC, according to findings unveiled in recent days. Only 29 of 194 countries have presented improved climate plans, as called for at the UN talks in Glasgow last year, Stiell noted. Nearly 100 heads of state and government began to arrive for two days of talks, with the notable absence of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, whose country is the world\' s top emitter of greenhouse gases. US President Joe Biden, whose country ranks second on the top-polluters list, will join COP27 later this week after midterm elections today that could put Republicans hostile to international action on climate change in charge of Congress. French President Emmanuel Macron urged the US, China and other non-European rich nations to  step up their efforts to cut emissions and provide financial aid to other countries.  Europeans are paying, Macron told French and African climate campaigners on the sidelines of COP27 .  We are the only ones paying. Fresh from his own election victory, Brazil\' s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is expected to attend the summit later on, with hopes high that he will protect the Amazon from deforestation after defeating climate-sceptic president Jair Bolsonaro. Another new leader, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, reversed a decision not to attend the talks and is due to urge countries to move  further and faster in transitioning away from fossil fuels. Pakistan, which chairs the powerful G77+China negotiating bloc of more than 130 developing nations, has made the issue a priority.  We definitely regard this as a success for the parties, said Egypt\' s Sameh Shoukry, who chairs the COP27 . The US and the EU have dragged their feet on the issue for years, fearing it would create an open-ended reparations framework. But the European Commission\' s Frans Timmermans welcomed the inclusion of loss and damage, tweeting the  climate crisis has impacts beyond what vulnerable countries can shoulder alone . | AFP \</doc>

The COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh has triggered a negative fallout for Egypt's authoritarian regime which stands accused of human rights abuses -- and has been widely condemned for its longstanding repressive campaign against dissidents and civil society organizations (CSOs). Writing in the current issue of Time magazine, Sahar Aziz, a professor at Rutgers University in the US, says "the Egyptian government has given summit access only to local governmental NGOs that support the regime". COP27 should be an opportunity for Egypt to lead by example. Instead, hosting the event seems like a political cover for its self-defeating repression of civil society, writes Aziz, author of 'The Racial Muslim: When Racism Quashes Religious Freedom'. In a hard-hitting statement released last week, Amnesty International (AI) said the arrest of hundreds of people in the past two weeks alone, in connection to calls for protests during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), is a reminder of the grim reality of Egypt's policy of mass arbitrary detention to crush dissent. At least 151 detainees are currently being investigated by the Supreme State Security Prosecution, while hundreds more have faced shorter arrests and questioning. "The arrest of hundreds of people merely because they were suspected of supporting the call for peaceful protests raises serious concerns over how the authorities will respond to people wishing to protest during COP27 - an essential feature of any UN climate conference". "The Egyptian authorities must allow peaceful demonstrators to gather freely and refrain from using unlawful force or arbitrary arrests to deter protests," said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director. "World leaders arriving in Sharm El-Sheikh for COP27 must not be fooled by Egypt's public relations (PR) campaign. Away from the dazzling resort hotels, thousands of individuals including human rights defenders, journalists, peaceful protesters and members of the political opposition continue to be detained unjustly," "They must urge President Abdelfattah al-Sisi to release all those arbitrarily held for exercising their human rights. As a matter of urgency, this should include imprisoned activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, who today escalated his hunger strike to stop drinking water." Mandeep S. Tiwana, Chief Programmes Officer at CIVICUS, the global civil society alliance, told IPS that hosting a global conference such as COP 27 places a special obligation on Egypt's government to respect and enable the exercise of fundamental freedoms as per international law. "The right to protest peacefully and the right against arbitrary detention are essential elements of international law. In the present instance, Egypt's government can easily order the release of arbitrarily imprisoned prisoners of conscience and allow protests to take place without impediments as a sign of good faith," he declared. In a joint op-ed piece last week, Gadir Lavadenz, Global Coordinator, Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice and Lidy Nacpil, Executive Director, Asian Peoples' Movement on Debt and Development, write: climate conferences are increasingly becoming spaces for greenwashing of not just the big polluters' crimes, but also of the regimes and presidencies hosting COP. " COP27 "This is in Egypt, but it's a UN run conference. What is the UN's view on the fact that this seems to be trolling for sensitive data and could be tracking people?" And secondly, the wi fi at COP, which is a UN conference, is apparently restricting access to human rights organizations and some news organizations. What's your reaction to those?" In her response, St\'e9phanie Tremblay, Associate Spokesperson, said: "We have seen these reports. Let me start with the app. First of all, this app does not belong to the UN, so I will not have more comments on that." "But one thing that is important to note is that the UN itself through the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] has an app, and everyone at the UN has been encouraging everyone to download and use this app". And then, as a general rule, "we advocate freedom of information, freedom of the press. That applies to everywhere around the world. For us, access is important, and we want to make sure that everyone that has to work is able to do the work they are there to do to the best", said Tremblay. Meanwhile, in its World Report 2022, Human Rights Watch said Egyptian authorities escalated the use of abusive Emergency State Security Courts to prosecute peaceful activists and critics who joined thousands of dissidents already in the country's congested prisons. And Courts issued death sentences in mass trials, adding to the sharply escalating number of executions. "The government in January issued implementing regulations for the 2019 NGO law that codified draconian restrictions on independent organizations. The authorities failed to appropriately investigate a high-profile gang-rape, and key witnesses remain under extrajudicial travel bans after being jailed for months in apparent retaliation for coming forward." HRW also said the army continues to impose severe restrictions on movement and demolished hundreds of buildings in north Sinai in the name of fighting Wilayat Sinai, a local affiliate of the Islamic State (ISIS). In the run up to the climate summit (6 November-18 November), Egyptian authorities released 766 prisoners following a decision by President al-Sisi to reactivate a Presidential Pardons Committee (PPC) in April, said Amnesty International. Yet over the same period, Amnesty International has documented the arrest of double that number; 1,540 people who were questioned over the exercising of free speech and association. In the past six months, Amnesty International has gathered data from dozens of lawyers who regularly attend interrogations and detention renewal hearings, reviewed court decisions and other official documents, and interviewed former prisoners as well as relatives of detainees. In recent weeks, security forces have arrested and detained hundreds of people in downtown Cairo and town squares across Egyptian cities over content on their phones -- a tactic often employed by police ahead of expected protests. While most were released within hours or days, some were taken to prosecutors, while others remain subject to enforced disappearance according to 11 lawyers in Cairo, Alexandria, Sharqiya and Dakahliya. In September, Abdelsalam Abdelghani, 55, was arrested at his home on the outskirts of Cairo. Prosecutors questioned him about a Facebook group called "Our right", including posts calling for protests on 11 November. The prosecutor questioned him on accusations of spreading "false news" and being "a member of a terrorist group" before ordering his detention pending an investigation, according to Amnesty International. According to the website of the Egyptian presidency for COP27 , anyone wishing to organize protests in Sharm El-Sheikh must inform the authorities 36 hours in advance and show the organizers a COP27 badge. Protests will only be allowed between 10:00-17:00 in an area far from the conference and monitored by cameras. The authorities have also limited the content of protests to climate related issues. Amnesty International finds these measures to be unnecessary and disproportionate, aimed at restricting the ability of individuals to protest safely in a way that allows them to be seen and heard.

Local climate and environmental activists joined climate protests around the world in the Global Day of Climate Action to urge decision makers at COP27 to treat the climate crisis like the global emergency it is, by developing strong policies that will fast track the just transition to a low-carbon economy. COP27 summit is being held in Egypt until Friday. South Africans joined activists in calling for the urgent transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Protests were held in Cape Town and Johannesburg on Friday. Extinction Rebellion Cape Town called on the South government, and the governments of other countries to invest in current and effective technology in the form of renewable energy. Earthlife Africa\' s Johannesburg programme officer Ulrich Steenkamp, led concerned citizens to the Constitutional Court. He said  After twenty-seven of these expensive climate conferences, globally we are still not moving nearly fast (nor decisively) enough to meaningfully address the crisis. We urge the South African government to accelerate our country\' s just transition.  The longer we hang on to fossil fuels, the more lives will be negatively affected. That is why, with this year\' s Day of Action, we especially celebrate the lives of all the environmental justice activists who have lost their lives for their opposition of these extractive industries \- because of its harmful effects on the wellbeing of their communities and the environment.  We remember people like Ken Saro-Wiwa and the other eight activists that were hanged in Nigeria for challenging oil extractions by Shell. And here in South Africa, Bazooka Rhadebe and Mam\' Fikile Ntshangase and all the others that are unknown, here and beyond. Negotiations at COP27 must prioritise the protection of those fighting against the exploitation of the environment. Earthlife Africa\' s climate energy officer Ketshepaone Modise said:  Protecting the environment is not a crime. On this Global Day for Climate Action Earthlife Africa and our partners stood in solidarity with other climate justice organisations around the world against the mass polluters who are gathering and making decisions at COP27 in Egypt. We also celebrate and remember all the fallen environmental justice heroes, and we urge all the negotiators at COP to promote the protection of the climate as well as those who passionately defend the environment. Modise said:  Each year, during COP, there is a worldwide outcry for improved and real action on climate- change that is led from the ground up.  It remains an ongoing concern that the UN convention on climate change is dominated by fossil fuel companies and other extractive industries. We believe that, since the people are most affected, there should be more government and non- government representation.  Africa is experiencing the worst impacts of climate change and can no longer afford any more delays. Northern countries must fulfil the climate finance promises they have made. This finance will be important in accelerating the just transition economy. There can be no mistaking that action to phase out fossil fuels is paramount. \</doc>

COP27 was set to be an  implementation COP of critical importance but as the climate summit concluded, the overwhelming sense among environmental groups, civil society and other stakeholders making their way home was that the summit failed to agree to more ambitious action on emissions reductions. As the tense two-week climate summit went into overtime with COP27 ending only yesterday, when it was supposed to end on November 18, a landmark agreement was reached to provide  loss and damage funding to help vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. On Friday, when the summit was supposed to end, COP president and Egypt Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said progress was achieved on many issues but it was evident that there were still a number of issues where progress remained lacking with persisting divergent views among parties.  While some of the discussions are constructive and positive, others do not reflect the expected recognition of the need to move collectively to address the gravity and urgency of the climate crisis, Shoukry said. Thuli Makama, Africa programme director and Global South adviser for environmental organisation Oil Change International (OCI), said wealthy countries did everything possible during this COP to shirk their climate debts, from delaying discussions on funding for loss and damage, offering tiny sums, to proposing convoluted, market-based schemes. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) feared that the highly anticipated loss and damage fund risked becoming a  fund for the end of the world due to COP27 failures if countries did not move faster to slash emissions and limit warming to below 1.5\'b0C. WWF global climate and energy lead and COP20 president Manuel Pulgar-Vida said:  By failing to agree to phase-out fossil fuels at COP27 , leaders have missed the chance to accelerate their elimination, keeping us on course to climate catastrophe. Without rapid and deep emissions cuts we cannot limit the scale of loss and damage. Pulgar-Vida said it was unacceptable that negotiators failed to reach a more ambitious agreement than that agreed in Glasgow last year, now governments must redouble their efforts to reduce emissions and take the necessary transformative action to keep warming to below 1.5\'b0C. In agreement OCI added that COP27 failed to acknowledge that a rapid and equitable phase-out of all fossil fuels \- oil, gas, and coal \- was the only chance at achieving climate targets and avoiding the worst of climate impacts. WWF Africa regional director Alice Ruhweza said this was meant to be an  African COP and they expected to see more finance and action to increase Africa\' s resilience as it was on the front lines of the climate crisis, but yet again finance commitments for adaptation were not met. \</doc>

There is a standing joke that when Africans attend an international conference, the keynote is dining, winning, shopping and socialising since they are averse to presenting argumentative conference papers. I hope the contention does not hold true for the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. Africa must provide motive power in the form of emotional intelligence for the developed nations to galvanise into action and pay for the damage caused by climate change, for the greater good of the planet. All eyes are on COP27 , since the effects of climate change are equally devastating whether one was born in a tropical climate or a temperate climate. Rogue weather patterns are being stepped up globally in a cataclysmic manner. We are all in the same boat, and the boat is about to hit the proverbial iceberg. Had Africa listened to Kwame Nkrumah to unite politically, we would not have allowed alien forces to fence us up with a view to dividing the continent, rule over us in perpetuity and pollute our environment. Developing countries are demanding help from the developed world to address climate change, but demands normally result in a barbed-wire re- sponse. The demand came up against a black wall because of Africa\' s disunity and fragmentation. Ghana\' s selflessness is worth emulating. When Ghana framed its constitution, the declaration of fundamental principles included specific conditions:  That the Union of Africa should be striven for by every lawful means, and, when attained, should be faithfully preserved; and that the independence of Ghana should not be surrendered or diminished on any grounds other than the furtherance of African Unity. Often, Africans do not pay attention to history. Conferences are not a panacea for all our human challenges. An All-Africa People\' s Conference was converged in Cairo in 1961. The conference warned independent states to be wary of neo- colonialism, which was linked to the UK, US, France, Western Germany, Israel, Belgium, the Netherlands and South Africa. Nkrumah said the resolutions included a call to the  anti-imperialist bloc to help in the development of African economies by granting long-term loans at low interest rates to be paid in local currencies. They demanded the expulsion of South Africa from the UN, the dismissal of UN secretary-general Dag Hammarskj\'f6ld, the release of Jomo Kenyatta, the independence of Rhodesia and the dissolution of the Central African Federation. Most of the demands could not materialise because of continental fragmentation and the venal nature of African leaders. COP27 must not repeat the mistakes of the All-Africa People\' s Conference of 1961. It must expose the real culprits of climate change \- global corporations and financial institutions. The culprits are cramping our developmental endeavours. David Korten, in When Corporations Rule the World, wrote:  Our relentless pursuit of economic growth is accelerating the breakdown of the planet\' s life-support systems, intensifying resource competition, widening the gap between rich and poor The growing concentration of power in global corporations and financial institutions is stripping governments \- democratic and otherwise \- of their ability to set economic, social, and environmental priorities in the larger common interest. If this situation goes unbridled, COP27 will be only a talk shop. Mathebula is a social commentator \</doc>

African activists have called at the UN COP27 climate summit in Egypt for an end to expansion of fossil fuels on the continent, highlighting that the industry has left a large share of people still without electricity and mired in poverty. Nigerian climate campaigner Friday Barilule Nbani \- who is attending the talks for the first time \- said his community in the Niger Delta wanted no more fossil fuel projects, which have left a litany of toxic oil spills and tainted water. Nbani\' s appeal came on the anniversary of the death of his uncle, the writer and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was one of nine men hanged in 1995 \- after a flawed trial \- for protesting against oil giant Shell\' s exploitation of the Niger Delta.  The polluters in Nigeria should get out from this COP, Nbani, of environmental group GreenFaith Nigeria, said in an interview after a protest at the conference centre that called for fossil fuel firms to be excluded from UN climate summits.  They are destroying the environment and anything that destroys the environment destroys life, and we are dying in masses.  They are the ones delaying (climate) action. They have their own agenda, he said, calling for the talks to unlock finance urgently for climate-vulnerable countries such as Nigeria, which has been hit hard by flooding in recent weeks.  What we want is action now. At the small demonstration, led by activists from Africa and Asia, about 50 protesters held up a red banner emblazoned with the words  Kick Big Polluters Out , and chanted  Polluters out; people in . Climate campaigners have pitched themselves at the talks against African governments that believe they should be allowed to use more gas \- the least-polluting fossil fuel \- to develop their economies and provide power to 600 million Africans who lack access to electricity, at least through this decade. The demonstration coincided with new research released by human rights groups showing that 636 fossil fuel lobbyists are registered to the COP27 climate talks, affiliated with some of the world\' s biggest oil and gas firms, both public and private. The analysis of the UN provisional list of named attendees by Corporate Accountability, Corporate Europe Observatory and Global Witness said the number \- out of a total of about 42 400 registered government and civil society delegates \- was an increase of more than 25% from COP26. The groups said 29 countries have fossil fuel representatives among their national delegations at the talks, with the United Arab Emirates \- the host of next year\' s COP \- bringing the most at 70, followed by Russia with 33. The African nations with fossil fuel or electricity industry executives on their government teams at COP27 include Angola, Chad, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Libya, Mauritania, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa and Uganda. Others come with industry associations and advocacy groups.  There\' s been a lot of lip service paid to this being the so-called African COP, but how are you going to address the dire climate impacts on the continent, when the fossil fuel delegation is larger than that of any African country? said Philip Jakpor of Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa. Wael Aboulmagd, Egyptian ambassador and special representative of the COP27 president, told journalists he did not have figures to show how many fossil fuel lobbyists were at COP27 . But, he added, corporate representatives of high-emitting sectors such as cement and steel will speak at  Decarbonization Day on Friday, taking place alongside the formal negotiations.  This is where we want to show best practices, he said, noting that participating companies must be able to demonstrate what they have achieved to cut emissions, and how they will meet pledges in the future.  The context isn\' t going to be to allow anyone to come and pretend they are doing something, Aboulmagd added. There is growing pressure on the organisers of the UN talks not to allow fossil fuel executives and their supporters to attend the climate summits, with more than 450 organisations having signed up to a call to bar them from the conferences. They are demanding that the UN climate secretariat and COP host nations, which change annually, protect the integrity of the negotiations by defining clear conflict of interest policies. They said the proposal has the backing of governments that collectively represent almost 70% of the world\' s population. The push comes as oil and gas companies rake in huge profits from soaring energy prices driven by disruptions to supplies as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Tzeporah Berman, chair of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty \- which is calling for a new global pact to stop further expansion of the industry \- said wealthy countries such as the US should act first to rein in their rising domestic production of climate-heating fuels. She said the UN talks could contribute to a phasing out of fossil fuels by committing to it in officials\' texts. Last year, governments in the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed for the first time to  phase down unabated coal, which is where technology is not used to capture carbon emissions. At COP27 But forging agreement could be tricky given the influence of fossil fuel producers on the talks, Berman added. The Egyptian government also has publicly backed natural gas as a key way to provide energy security and tackle poverty, a stance echoed by some other African governments such as Nigeria and Senegal.  What countries in the Global South want to know is \' where is the cash?\' and right now the only ones offering them the big cash are the fossil fuel companies, noted Berman. African activists at COP27 also highlighted the fossil fuel threat to their continent\' s forests. The area of land allocated to oil and gas production on the African continent is set to quadruple, according to a new analysis by Rainforest Foundation UK and Earth InSight. Oil and gas exploration blocks overlap 30% of dense tropical forests in Africa, of which 90% are in the Congo Basin, where 150 distinct ethnic groups live, it said.  We must not let a chaotic expansion of fossil fuels in the Congo Basin risk our precious tropical forests, biodiversity hotspots ... and the rights and livelihoods of forest communities who are already feeling the impacts of climate change, said Fran\'e7ois Biloko, head of R\'e9seau CREF, an environmental network in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He and Nigerian activists said the future for their countries and communities lay with clean energy like solar. \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa has accepted an invitation by the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, His Excellency Mr Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, to participate in the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit scheduled from 07-08 November 2022 in the Arab Republic of Egypt. The 2022 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP27 , will be held from 06 to 18 November 2022 at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Conference Centre. With COP27 taking place in Africa, it presents an opportunity to advance African priority issues, namely. Raising the ambitions on mitigation, adaptation and support to developing countries. Advance financing arrangements for loss and damage. Build on progress made in Glasgow on the importance of Just Transitions. Advance discussions on the special needs and circumstance of Africa. Climate Summits provide a platform to make announcements of new climate ambition, political direction and momentum for the UNFCCC negotiations, as well as to address broader issues related to climate change mainly to guide climate change negotiators (beyond the mandate and scope of the UNFCCC negotiations). The programme for the participation of Heads of State and Government(HOSG) will include an official opening ceremony, high-level round tables, delivery of national statements and high-level side events organised by World Leaders. During the summit, the Government of Egypt will convene 6 high-level Round Tables on Just Transition; Food Security; Innovative Finance and Climate Development; Investing in Future of Energy; Climate Change and Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities and Water Security. These roundtables will be attended by the HOSG, Heads of observer organisations and specially invited guests. President Ramaphosa will on 07 November 2022 Co-Chair the High Level Roundtable on Just Transition, which will allow discussions on innovative approaches to addressing climate change in the context of Just Transition, inspired by the South African Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). President Ramaphosa yesterday during the special sitting of the Presidential Climate Change Commission(PCC) unveiled government's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) outlining government's comprehensive priority investment and financing interventions required to achieve decarbonisation commitments and ensuring an equitable and just transition. On 08th November 2022, the President will deliver a national statement during the high-level segment of the summit. The Summit further provides a platform for discussing how climate actions can be supportive of broader Just Transitions imperatives, highlighting the need for the COP to agree on a Just Transition Financing Framework under the mitigation work programme as a potential model for supporting energy transition in middle income countries. The high-level segment for Heads of State and Government during the summit signifies the importance for World Leaders to implement and transform key climate related decisions into concrete actions and credible plans, continue raising ambition, building up from previous Conference of the Parties, including the Glasgow COP 26 outcomes. The segment also keeps the high level commitment on climate change issues, with an aim to fight back climate emergency and promoting coordinated action to tackle climate change. South Africa's UNFCCC negotiating positions on climate change, are fully aligned to the African common position, as adopted by the African Union's Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN). The President will be supported by the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Ms Naledi Pandor; Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Ms Barbara Creecy. President Ramaphosa's Programme at the Summit will be as follows: 07 November 2022 12h15-13h30 Opening Ceremony of the United Nations Climate Change Conference 07 November 2022 13h30-15h30 President Ramaphosa Co-Chairs the High-Level Roundtable on Just Transition 08 November 2022 12h00-12h30 Press Conference by President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Sharm El Sheikh International Conference Centre, Press Conference Room 1-Cairo 08 November 2022 13h00-18h00 President Ramaphosa delivers a National Statement The proceedings of the summit open to media will be live streamed on and on all PresidencyZA digital platforms. \</doc>

MIKE LOEWEThe race is on to tell ducking-and-diving world leaders at COP 27 , the upcoming UN conference on climate change , that time is running out for life on Earth. The Wildlife and Environment Society of SA (Wessa) has joined the race and with the Foundation for Environmental Education is setting up the SA leg of the 38-day non-stop relay. Schools were invited to craft a climate action message that will be carried to COP 27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The climate conference will run from November 6 to 18. The SA relay in 10km stages will be run from October 10 to 14 in Gauteng, North West, and Limpopo; from October 17 to 21 in Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Free State; and from October 24 to 28 in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape. Organisers said young people and future generations would be the hardest hit by climate change - and to effect change and make an impact on the climate crisis, it was essential that their collective voice was amplified. The relay race also demanded that schools should teach climate change as part of the curriculum. Wessa's education and training head, Cindy-Lee Cloete, said the relay aligned with its values of protecting the environment "now and for future generations. "Climate change is an urgent issue and we have a responsibility to our youth, and our planet, to take action. "We are proud of our SA eco-schools. I feel especially privileged to be able to deliver their messages in person at COP 27 .

The establishment of a loss and damage fund is one of the main historic outcomes achieved at the 27th HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/conference-of-the-parties/ Conference of the Parties HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop27/ COP27 ). This is important for the African continent as we are so vulnerable to the impact of HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-change/ climate change .\~ This year's climate conference was termed "implementation COP". There was general consensus among the parties to the https://mg.co.za/tag/paris-agreement/ Paris Agreement that the main pillars of implementation are action on mitigation and adaptation; support for developing countries through finance, and other "means of implementation". There was an expectation that previous financial pledges to accelerating implementation ahead of COP27 would finally be fulfilled. The conference was also framed as the "Africa COP", with the expectation that issues central to Africa would be prioritised and resolved. It is important then to question whether COP27 delivered on addressing issues important to African countries.\~ The main outcomes of COP27 were the establishment of the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-11-21-cop27-loss-and-damage-fund-welcomed-but-some-fear-it-is-an-empty-bucket/ loss and damage fund HYPERLINK carbon credits . However, indecision about the unresolved issue of phasing out fossil fuels was disappointing - especially considering the current backtracking to fossil fuels by developed countries in light of their own energy crises.\~ " HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/loss-damage/ Loss and damage " was one of the major issues to be tackled at COP27 . This was due to the growing global impacts of climate-related events, which disproportionately affect the most vulnerable, creating irreparable damage. Loss and damage is the crucial third pillar of helping people to rebuild after they have experienced climate-related harm.\~ Why is a loss and damage fund important for Africa? Firstly, at its core, the fund delivers justice to those communities that suffer harm from climate change but which have contributed far less to global emissions, even as the developed countries that have contributed the most to emissions still profit from fossil fuels.\~ The African continent contributes no more than 4% to global carbon dioxide emissions, much less than what other countries contribute. This fund will be able to deliver justice, in some part, for Africa and vulnerable countries. This is something that has been lacking in climate change negotiations for a long time.\~ Secondly, countries incur unsustainable debt as they secure loans needed for social protection in the wake of climate disasters. The loss and damage fund will be able to cushion countries from incurring https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-finance/ climate fin \~ HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-finance/ a \~ HYPERLINK nce debt.\~ However, it has been made clear that the loss and damage fund is not a claim for compensation or liability from developed economies. This was a compromise made to get the topic of loss and damage on to the COP27 agenda. The US reiterated that it would not support any official discussion until it was agreed that there would be no claim of liability or compensation during the agenda negotiations.\~ The loss and damage fund still needs to be quantified in terms of how it is going to be paid out and which countries must contribute to the fund. This will be discussed further at COP28. Therefore, while the establishment of the fund is a progressive step forward, there is more to be done to ensure the fund actually materialises and is channelled to the victims of climate change.\~ Nevertheless, the establishment of a loss and damage fund at COP27 signified a historic milestone and a victory of progressive action, despite other shortcomings of the conference such as those relating to the reduction of emissions. The loss and damage fund should not distract from the fact that the world is not on track to halve emissions by 2030 or to meet the global target of limiting the planet's warming to 1.5\'b0C by 2050.\~ COP27 did not make tangible progress towards reducing fossil fuel use, nor was decisive action taken on HYPERLINK mitigation . HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop26/ COP26 had questionably resorted to a "phasing down" of fossil fuels and COP27 only reiterated that as there was no clear stance on oil and gas use or any agreement on the phasing out of fossil fuels. This continuous watering down of fossil fuel use is not sending any clear message about the urgent action required to reduce emissions.\~\~\~ The loss and damage fund must not be a gateway for developed countries to avoid climate action, specifically mitigation efforts, by paying for the damage caused by climate change. This concern is greater in light of the approval for parties to be able to trade carbon credits. This only perpetuates the cycle of polluting and then throwing money at the issue without actually reducing emissions. The need grows ever more urgent for developed countries that are contributing the most to global emissions to reduce these emissions.\~ Reducing emissions by reducing fossil fuel use remains the only way to limit global climate warming to 1.5\'b0C, and to fight climate change. COP27 fell short on a commitment to reducing emissions. Despite delivering tangible outcomes for Africa and other developing countries with the loss and damage fund, COP27 still failed to safeguard a global climate-warming target. The lack of any decision on fossil fuel mitigation signifies that developed countries will continue to emit as long as they can pay for damages without admitting any liability.

COP27 president says he is optimistic a deal will be struck this week on the issue of loss and damage COP27 president says he is optimistic a deal will be struck this week on the issue of loss and damage Climate activists, scientists and political leaders attending the COP27 climate summit in Egypt have prioritised the controversial issue of "loss and damage" - requiring the biggest polluting countries to compensate the countries most vulnerable to climate-driven disasters - this week. "SA and the whole of Africa are needing to adapt to climate change, and we need money to do that. We need to make sure that the money coming to the continent and the global south is from grants, not loans. "There have been protests at COP27 around cancelling debt, and it should go beyond that: the south should not be owing (the north), it should be exactly the opposite." Marchers chanted "pay up for loss and damage" at several protests at the weekend, after the first week of the talks at Sharm-el-Sheik. Tyler saw delegates shout this message at US climate envoy John Kerry, who has expressed its position that the US will consider financing options for loss and damage but will not support a fund that implies liability. COP27 was a victory, but now wealthy nations must be accountable and pay up. "What is surprising is the people from the global north, who have actually polluted the environment, are refusing to acknowledge their responsibility and pay the people at the receiving end [of climate disasters]," he said in an interview. Prakash said that regions in Africa "which are some of the poorest on all counts" were diverting finance they needed for development to combat climate emergencies such as floods. Climate financing for the developing world was imperative to make them more resilient to climate change and lift people out of poverty, he said. The COP27 Brian O'Donnell, director of the Campaign for Nature, said his biggest concern at the summit so far was that wealthy nations were "not increasing finance for either loss and damage or to develop biodiversity at the scale required" to protect against the affects of climate change. But he said: "Some countries absolutely see conserving nature as a key component, especially things like restoring mangroves and wetlands to deal with flooding and storms." Other countries looked at money for adaptation as finance to protect the most vulnerable communities, for example those living in low areas threatened by rising sea levels. The recognition that "nature conservation has to pay a pivotal role through forests, oceans and systems like mangroves" to meet the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 & xB0;C was positive, he said. Nature played a more prominent role at previous COP meetings than this one, said O'Donnell. For example, at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, last year a pledge was made to conserve forests. "The forest pledge has got real momentum and a real action plan behind it. This was not a podium moment that the leaders soon forgot," he said. The Campaign for Nature also welcomed the increasing recognition of the role of indigenous people in both climate change and biodiversity solutions, said O'Donnell. The election of Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - whose first international trip will be attending COP27 on Wednesday - was one of the best stories in the last year for the protection of the Amazon and biodiversity, he said.

THE 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP27 and held from November 6 to 20 was yet another occasion to highlight the urgent need for action to protect our natural resources \- bearing in mind that the future prosperity and the peaceful co-existence of peoples will greatly depend on our responsible use of these resources.  The current global order , in the words of the Bah\'e1\'ed International Community,  has often approached the natural world as a reservoir of material resources to be exploited.  The grave consequences of this paradigm have become all too apparent, and more balanced relationships among the peoples of the world and the planet are clearly needed. The question today is how new patterns of action and interaction can best be established, both individually and collectively, through personal choices, social systems, and governing institutions . We can now see the impact of climate change, for example, through increasingly severe weather patterns. According to a report from UNDP, the consequences of even a 2\'baC increase in global temperature will include: coastal flooding displacing 180-230 million people; and water shortages affecting 1.8 billion people (nearly a quarter of the earth\' s inhabitants). The search for solutions to climate change has revealed the limits of traditional technological and policy approaches. It is important that the search for solutions to the world\' s environmental problems go beyond technical proposals, and addresses the underlying causes of the crises. Genuine solutions, in the Bah\'e1\' \'ed view, will require a vision for the future based on justice and unity, and on willing co-operation among the nations, races, creeds, and classes of the human family. There is need to observe the principles of economic justice, equality between the races, equal rights for women and men, and universal education. These points bear directly on attempts to protect the earth\' s environment. In its statement titled: Shared Vision, Shared Volition: Choosing Our Global Future Together, the Bah\'e1\'ed International Community highlights the importance of economic justice, asserting that:  Correlation has been found, for example, between inequality and environmental degradation, suggesting that the relationships linking human beings with one another have a direct impact on the physical resources of the planet.  The global systems that have left many facing poverty and want, have similarly impoverished the natural environment. A more balanced attitude toward the environment must therefore address human conditions as consciously as it does natural ones.  It must be embodied in social norms and patterns of action characterised by justice and equity . Looking at the issue of economic justice, for example: In many parts of the world, the danger to forests comes as the poor, seeking a fair share of the world\' s wealth, cut trees for fuel or to create fields, often without being aware that over the long term they may be damaging rather than improving their children\' s chances for a better life. Any attempt to protect nature, must, therefore, address the inequities between rich and poor.

No cop outs at COP27 , please COP27 COP27 begins in Egypt today and hopes are high that South Africa's voice will be heard. According to forestry, fisheries & environmental affairs minister Barbara Creecy, a key issue that needs addressing is developed countries maintaining commitments made thus far. At a recent briefing, she also emphasised "just transition", meaning South Africa must tackle climate justice in a way that leads to equal sharing of benefits and risks. Creecy has thrown her weight behind a loss and damage fund, whereby developed nations (the biggest polluters) would create a purse to assist less developed countries that have not caused as much damage, but suffer the consequences of the crisis more acutely than their developed counterparts. There will also be keen interest in details about the $8.5bn (about R155bn) just energy transition investment plan approved by the cabinet in South Africa, and how it will be funded. This to become less reliant on coal and transition towards clean energy. An online event organised by the Pulitzer Center this week highlighted how the catastrophe affects every aspect of life and how this needs to be considered during COP27 , as solutions are urgent. Journalists shared stories of what they had seen on the ground and the impact on people's lives. Time magazine's senior international climate and environment correspondent Aryn Baker said a major problem as temperatures rise will be outdoor workers, specifically those in agriculture. "To protect workers from heat, you need water, shade and rest. The human body is adaptable, but if you work in heat with no chance to recover, it is not possible," Baker said. Affording rest would mean "you'd have to triple your workforce, because if someone worked for 15 minutes and then recovered for 45", productivity would drop. According to Tim McDonnel, a climate crisis reporter in Cairo, Egypt, the loss and damage fund, some-thing "the Egyptian presidency is pushing for", should be high on the agenda. As diplomats and world leaders head to the annual UN climate summit, there is renewed focus on the long-running dispute about who should pay for the devastation brought by rising temperatures. Speeches and negotiations will call for wealthier polluters to take the blame for the damage suffered by low emitters. Ambassador Mohamed Nasr, Egypt's chief climate negotiator, said last month: "There's a high possibility it will be on the agenda, based on the outcomes of discussions and deliberations that happened in the past month or so." Also under the spotlight is climate migration. "How do you distinguish between insecurity and climate change, and how do you apportion migration to climate migration in a context of insecurity? People don't speak about climate. That is not what is on their minds," she said. In her work she has seen this in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria and Chad: "Experts describe how climate is influencing membership of illegal military organisations." She found rural people who are vulnerable to the climate crisis and face a bleak future as their dependence on crops is threatened are drawn to joining illegal military organisations. Steven Lawry, research director at the Center for International Forestry Research, said the idea of "stewardship" is growing and should be emphasised at COP27 . "A steward is the person in past times who would have looked after the home or the house. Today, as we think of it in terms of natural resources", it needs to be emphasised that "our wellbeing as humans depends on the wellbeing of the environment. We look after the environment and it looks after us," he said. An international study released by the University of Melbourne this week, however, demonstrated how complicated stewardship can be. The study is the first to calculate that countries collectively need 1.2-billion hectares of land to fulfil the promises laid out in their official climate plans for carbon-capture tactics such as tree planting. This would "gobble up land desperately needed for food production and nature protection", according to the authors, led by Kate Dooley, who added that this could encroach on land belonging to indigenous people, "whose land rights are found to be critical to reducing climate change due to their stewardship of forests".

THE UN\' s COP27 climate summit kicked off in Egypt yesterday with warnings against backsliding on efforts to cut emissions and calls for rich nations to compensate poor countries after a year of extreme weather disasters. Just in the past few months, climate-induced catastrophes have killed thousands, displaced millions and cost billions in damages across the world. Massive floods devastated swaths of Pakistan and Nigeria, droughts worsened in Africa and the western US, cyclones whipped the Caribbean, and unprecedented heatwaves seared three continents. The conference in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh comes in a fraught year marked by Russia\' s war on Ukraine, an energy crunch, soaring inflation and the lingering effects from the Covid pandemic. Simon Stiell, the UN\' s climate change executive secretary, said he would not be a  custodian of backsliding on the goal of slashing greenhouse emissions by 45% by 2030 to cap global warming at 1.5\'baC above late-19th-century levels.  We will be holding people to account, be they presidents, prime ministers, CEOs, Stiell warned.  The heart of implementation is everybody everywhere in the world every single day doing everything they can to address the climate crisis. Current trends would see carbon pollution increase by 10% by the end of the decade and Earth\' s surface heat up 2.8\'baC, according to findings unveiled last week. Promises made under the 2015 Paris Agreement would, if kept, only shave off a few tenths of a degree.  While I do understand that leaders around the world have faced competing priorities this year, we must be clear: as challenging as our current moment is, inaction is myopic and can only defer climate catastrophe, said Alok Sharma, British president of the previous COP26.  How many more wake-up calls does the world \- and world leaders \- actually need? he said. In a dire warning, the UN\' s World Meteorological Organization said the past eight years are on track to be the eighth warmest on record, with an acceleration in sea level rise, glacier melt and heatwaves. COP27 gets under way, our planet is sending a distress signal, UN chief Antonio Guterres said. The COP27 COP27 agenda. Inclusion of the agenda item  reflects solidarity and empathy for the suffering of victims of climate induced disasters , said COP27 President Sameh Shoukry of Egypt.  We all owe a debt of gratitude to activists and civil society organisations who have persistently demanded the space to discuss funding for loss and damage, he said to applause. Shoukry also noted that rich nations have not fulfilled a separate pledge to deliver $100 billion (R1.8 trillion) a year to help developing countries green their economies and build resilience against climate change. He also lamented that most climate financing is based on loans.  We do not have the luxury to continue this way. We have to change our approaches to this existential threat, he said, calling for solutions that  prove we are serious about not leaving anyone behind . After the first day of talks, more than 120 world leaders will join the summit today. The most conspicuous no-show will be China\' s Xi Jinping. US President Joe Biden has said he will come only after US legislative elections tomorrow. Co-operation between the US and China \- the world\' s two largest economies and carbon polluters \- has been crucial to rare breakthroughs in the 30-year saga of UN climate talks. \</doc>

Her recent announcement that she will not attend COP27 is understandable, but we still hope she'll reconsider. So, Greta Thunberg won't be coming to COP27 . She's condemned it as "greenwashing" and cast doubts on the host's human rights record and lack of access for activists. To be clear, we have nothing but admiration for what Greta Thunberg has accomplished as far as increasing the pressure on our political leaders to do more. We agree with her completely that a lot more is needed, and fast. But when it comes to COP27 , we hope she'll change her mind. We have three reasons for this: the impact of diplomacy, the urgency of the situation, and COP27 's role convening people with power and influence. Diplomacy works One reason she has given for not attending is her concern that civil society representation may be less this time around, and she doesn't want to take someone else's place. This is thoughtful. However, Greta Thunberg has access to leaders' others may not. Her presence could have a significant impact. While Greta Thunberg is right that many international events are mostly "blah, blah, blah," the United Nations negotiations on climate change have achieved a lot more than many people realize. Prior to the Paris Climate agreement in 2015, for instance, we were on a trajectory of 4-6 degrees Celsius rise in temperature by the end of the century. Now, estimates suggest we're on track for somewhere around 2.4-2.8 C, if current pledges are met. While this would be a terrible scenario to have to face, it would be less apocalyptic than those higher numbers. As we have pointed out in a previous article, international negotiations on climate change have had a profound impact already, kickstarting the shift away from two centuries of fossil fuel dependence and giving us at least a chance of achieving sustainability in the longer term. Just days ago, the International Energy Agency forecast that global emissions will peak in 2025 before beginning to fall. Furthermore, they see all types of fossil fuels "peaking or hitting a plateau" then, too. Do we wish this had happened sooner? Absolutely. But it shows progress is being made. Besides, there is no alternative to an international process when it comes to dealing with a global problem of this magnitude. No country, company, or coalition, can solve this problem alone. We all need to work together. Urgency means everyone joining the fight We agree wholeheartedly with Ms. Thunberg's exhortation for everyone to "mobilize" and be involved in solving this challenge. Many folks may choose to be activists or advocates for change, pressuring their home governments to be more ambitious, taking action locally, or changing their habits as consumers or investors. Thunberg is also quite right that time is running out; the science tells us the window of opportunity to restrict warming to 1.5C or less is closing rapidly. Yet this is exactly why COP27 is so important. With time running out, the meeting in Egypt will mark the moment where we start to see if the pledges made at COP26 in Glasgow, are being met. Is the global community sticking to its promises or falling short? COP27 will give us an opportunity to review, press for greater urgency, and draw global attention to those who are keeping their promises and those who are not. The decision at COP26 to not wait for 5 years until governments submit improved National Determined Contributions, but to ask all countries to update their NDCs by COP27 , is also important. A total of 39 Parties have communicated new or updated NDCs since COP26, including critical countries such as Australia and India. This is clearly not enough, but it is a start. The same request should be made at COP27 , pressuring countries to review their NDCs in time for COP28. Influencing the powerful Finally, UN climate summits present a once-a-year opportunity to engage with powerful politicians and urge decisions on the climate threat. With time so short, no one who can influence the process should stay away. Greta Thunberg has already had an outsized influence inspiring people to action and persuading politicians to take the issue more seriously. Her presence at COP27 would undoubtedly make a difference. One reason she has given for not attending is her concern that civil society representation may be less this time around, and she doesn't want to take someone else's place. This is thoughtful. However, Greta Thunberg has access to leaders' others may not. Her presence could have a significant impact. For these reasons, we hope Ms. Thunberg will reconsider and use her influence to its fullest at COP27 New British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, had initially also said he wouldn't attend, citing the country's financial and energy challenges and urgent budget planning as the reason for staying home. However, he has now had a change of heart. The public response to his initial decision, as well as concerns from industry and civil society, made the Prime Minister reconsiders his position. This is welcome news and, we believe, the right decision. If Rishi Sunak wishes to build on the UK's solid performance at COP26 and burnish his country's reputation for taking climate change seriously, we hope he attends with not just positive rhetoric, but new commitments and financing. It would be a positive signal if King Charles also attended. After all, the UK is still the President of the COP until the start of COP27 . Missing the next COP would not have sent the right message to the UK's partners and the global community in general. With no other realistic way to solve climate change than the multilateral system, we urge Greta Thunberg to follow Rishi Sunak's lead and join the gathering. In fact, all of those in positions of power or influence should come to Sharm ready to work for the best agreement possible. As John F. Kennedy said. "Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate". Prof. Felix Dodds and Chris Spence have participated in UN environmental negotiations since the 1990s.

When Egypt hosts the COP27 climate summit this week it will be hoping for an injection of international legitimacy as well as green financing at a time when its economy has been struggling and it has faced rising criticism over human rights. The United Nations climate talks in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh will put the global media spotlight on Egypt in a way the country last saw during its 2011 "Arab Spring" uprising.Since then, the Arab world's most populous nation has been buffeted by post-uprising political turmoil, a military-led takeover, a long crackdown on dissent and a series of economic shocks that diminished its traditional role as a diplomatic player across the Middle East and in Africa.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has gradually sought to bring Egypt back to the world stage, promising a development-focused new era for the country despite continuing economic headwinds which have seen the currency slide by about 35% against the dollar since March."Core to everything that drove their ( COP27 ) application in the first place is international legitimacy," said Hafsa Halawa, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute.Authorities want to show "that Egypt is not an irrelevant country, that Egypt has the prowess, the diplomatic clout and the power, the security presence to be a pivotal figure", she said.In other moves aimed at improving Egypt's international image, Sisi has launched a limited political dialogue that is due to start soon after the climate summit. The state has also taken several steps to improve its record on human rights, although critics have dismissed the measures as largely cosmetic.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/815/233191.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/815/233191.html :EMBED-->NegotiationsThe COP27 presidency is headed by the foreign ministry, which has a pool of experienced negotiators and which foreign diplomats say has far better capacity than other ministries working on climate.It is hoping to leverage that expertise to help achieve progress in climate negotiations, despite an unpromising backdrop for commitments from major nations or big finance."We hope that it will be a watershed moment", Wael Aboulmagd, a veteran Egyptian diplomat and special representative for COP27 , told reporters on Friday, noting that science shows the world lagging behind on every aspect of the fight against climate change."Everyone is aware of the gravity of the situation, the enormity of the challenge."Egypt is presenting itself as a champion of Africa and the Global South, building on a diplomatic campaign to win African backing in a dispute with Ethiopia over a dam on the Blue Nile that Cairo sees as a threat to its water supplies.It has been pressing for a "just" energy transition that allows poor countries space to develop economically, a boost to cheap climate finance, and addressing compensation demands by vulnerable states for damages from climate-induced extreme weather events."We aim to restore the 'grand bargain' ... whereby developing countries agreed to increase their efforts to tackle a crisis for which they are far less responsible, in return for appropriate financial support and other means of implementation," COP27 president-designate, Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry wrote in a letter to parties and observers at the summit.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/230505.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/230505.html :EMBED-->Funding shortfallSuch priorities mesh with Egypt's own, as a gas producer with big renewable energy potential that is considered highly vulnerable to climate change.In an updated submission to the United Nations this year, Egypt said it faced a $246bn funding shortfall to meet its 2030 climate targets.It is hoping to sign a flurry of deals including for green hydrogen power and solar and wind projects timed to coincide with COP27 .Some in Egypt express surprise that the government would host such a conference, given the low profile of environmentalism and restrictions on civic activism.The presidency has said it will allow protests in designated areas at the summit venue, though some activists are concerned their voices will be curbed. Security forces have made dozens of arrests linked to calls for demonstrations elsewhere in Egypt.However, hosting COP27 could open up a debate on political and environmental activity, said Rabab el-Mahdi, head of the Alternative Solutions Research project at the American University in Cairo."Hosting it forced the government and accordingly brought to society a broader discussion about climate change which has been missing from the national debate at large," she said. \</doc>

For the 2022 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) and its Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), thousands of world leaders have descended on Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. It was anticipated that many natural gas lobbyists and advocates would attend the conference given Egypt\' s ambition to become a significant natural gas exporter. This demonstrates that the likelihood of change is rather limited. The objective of COP27 is to include initiatives to reduce carbon emissions, adapt to climate change, and provide funding for their execution. According to reports, COP27 will highlight gas as a transition fuel that has been recognised by the fossil fuel sector. Due to fossil fuel projects, some of the poorest and most climate-affected nations will lose their land, water, and cultural heritage. Without taking into account the effects that result from the production, African countries are prepared to increase the production of fossil fuels. But the rush for gas will also ruin the climate, local communities, and the environment. The majority of these investments in fossil fuels are made for export rather than to provide energy to African nations. This goes against the Paris Agreement as climate change requires financial institutions to stop funding fossil fuels and to fund just transition to renewable energy. The UN\' s COP has failed in its main aim to  prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system . It also aims to strengthen countries\' ability to deal with the impacts of climate change and support them in their efforts. By reducing global warming to well below 2\'b0C and pursuing efforts to restrict it to 1.5\'b0C, the Paris Agreement lays out a worldwide framework to avoid severe climate change. Natural gas producers are taking advantage of COP27 to promote it as a transition fuel. Gas burning has the potential to raise temperatures much above the threshold restriction of 1.5\'b0C needed to avoid significant environmental impact. None of the largest providers of renewable energy has any guidelines for upholding land rights or acknowledging the rights of indigenous people.  As we push for a rapid transition, we need to think more critically about investment, regulation, and ownership, so that energy is less extractive, companies are held accountable, and communities benefit through co-ownership or community ownership, said Thea Riofrancos, associate professor of political science at Providence College and an expert on resource extraction, renewable energy, climate change, and social movement. We must move quickly from setting targets to enacting the necessary laws and policies to meet the current targets in order to help and create the momentum needed to raise them. People who are impacted by our changing world must be supported and included in decision-making processes. Wealthy nations must also take into account the losses suffered by the poorest and most vulnerable countries, which have made the smallest contributions to climate change. By swiftly reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aiding residents in coping with its repercussions, governments must confront climate change in order to uphold their legal obligation to preserve human rights. COP27 , governments ought to promise to refrain from authorising any new fossil fuel projects. Governments should make a commitment to protect those who are most at risk as well as to ensure their participation and representation in climate change decision-making. COP27 is an opportunity to show solidarity in the face of a threat to existence that can only be eliminated through well co-ordinated action and efficient implementation. The success of COP27 depends on commitments to take action in the future, which runs the risk of failing. We have observed over time how these commitments do not result in action. African political figures have also backed the quest for gas production. African leaders have demanded that natural gas be accepted as an acceptable transition fuel for African countries, including Macky Sall of Senegal. President Cyril Ramaphosa backed Africa\' s  right to further oil and gas exploitation. An African Common Position on Energy Access and Transition was put up by an African Union committee for adoption at COP27 . Despite the harm that fossil fuels pose to development, health, biodiversity, and our climate, the position paper called for the expansion of gas and other fossil fuel production and positioned these fuels as having  crucial roles in the future. In response, African civil society issued a pressing request to the AU to stop promoting fossil fuel extraction prior to COP27 and moving forward. The civil society organisations in Africa asked the continent\' s leaders to switch to sustainable energy in their open letter. The activists have cautioned that if natural gas and nuclear power are prioritised over cleaner, less expensive renewable energy sources, Africa runs the risk of becoming permanently dependent on fossil fuels. Campaigners exposed a scheme by the fossil fuel sector to expand oil and gas in Africa during Africa Energy Week. They referred to it as a declaration of war against the climate and the sustainability of Africa. If global warming persists, more catastrophic disasters and long-term weather pattern disruptions will occur, destroying lives and livelihoods and upending nations. Mass migration might come next. Additionally, failing to stabilise emissions by 2030 might result in global warming exceeding 2\'baC and dangerous tipping points where climate change becomes self-perpetuating. \</doc>

South Africa's chief negotiator on climate change, Maesela https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-06-21-soaring-cost-of-living-overshadows-climate-change-talks/ Kekana , confirmed in an interview there was tension at COP27 as reparations for loss and damage became a talking point.\~ Delegates had disagreed on who was responsible for climate reparations and how the funding would be released to developing and poorer countries. With only a few days left of the conference in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, developing countries are putting increasing pressure on wealthier nations to pay up, with $75.8 million being pledged in "loss and damage" payments so far. Kekana feared, with only two days left, it would be close to impossible for countries to agree on a funding model.\~ Developing countries had been calling for reparations as the present description of loss and damage excludes liability or compensation for past harm. Loss and damage refers to payments for current, unavoidable climate impact.

The Vodacom Group is partnering with the COP27 Vodacom recognises that climate change poses risks to businesses, government and communities alike. Through our purpose to connect for a better future and our firm belief that business success should not come at the cost of the environment, we are collectively committed to reducing our environmental impact and contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We have committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 50% by 2025 and have a roadmap in place to reduce waste and water across our operations. This year's COP27 Vodacom Group chief executive Shameel Joosub said: "As part of our commitment and participation in COP27 , we will engage with government, business and civil society to tackle the scourge of the negative impacts exacerbated by climate change across the African continent, especially food insecurity." Joosub added: "As a technology company, our digital solutions and capabilities play a critical role in helping society to mitigate and adapt against climate change impacts. The Internet of Things (IoT), for instance, is key in saving energy, creating cleaner and more efficient communities and enabling sectors such as agriculture to be more efficient and sustainable and we look forward to engaging on this at COP27 so we can accelerate the fight against climate change."\~ Towards a connected climate Of interest for countries like South Africa that have high levels of unemployment, poverty and inequality, a recent HYPERLINK report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notes how climate change and poverty are deeply intertwined because climate change disproportionately affects poor people in low-income communities. The report also mentions that flood damage (as recently experienced in Kwa-Zulu Natal) as well as drought-related acute food insecurity and malnutrition have increased on the African continent.\~ That said, case studies across Africa demonstrate the positive impact that access to even the most basic mobile technology can offer smallholder farmers. This underscores the importance of driving inclusive access to digital technology, especially mobile-based, to help the continent's farmers mitigate the impact of climate change. This assertion is championed by Vodacom, Vodafone, Safaricom and the UN Capital Development Fund in their co-authored report, HYPERLINK https://www.vodafone.com/sites/default/files/2022-03/vodafone-sustainability-africa-paper.pdf Towards a Connected Climate For further information on Vodacom's environmental activities and performance, please click HYPERLINK here .\~ The post HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/special-reports/2022-11-10-vodacom-group-joins-cop27-as-principal-partner-for-communications/ Vodacom Group joins HYPERLINK COP27 \~as principal partner for communications appeared first on HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za The Mail & Guardian \</doc>

The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), in collaboration with Ecohealth, the Department of Health and Refilwe Matlotlo non-profit organisation, hosted a beach clean-up at Durban Harbour to put in use the knowledge they acquired from the recent COP27 conference at Sharm el- Sheikh, in Egypt. They also showcased current environmental health conditions to international delegates. After the UKZN scientists attended COP27 , they realised how much Durban has been exposed to the impact of climate change over the past few months, because of the floods, E coli and sewage problems. Scientists expressed concerns about the impact of climate change on marine health. Marine biologist Refilwe Mofokeng, co-founder of the Fefilwe Matlotlo organisation, said the organisation started because of marine pollution. Mofokeng said the collaboration came about because they saw the loss was real. They decided to join hands to try to find solutions to how to reduce the problems ruining the ocean and bring about biodiversity in the ocean.  Climate change is very topical. We saw the need to come together and figure out how we can reduce our carbon footprint, sustain and also maintain the work we have done because clean-ups are always done but when we come back it is almost always dirty again, she said Professor Moses Chimbari, Ecohealth international president, said after a week of great activities they saw it best to end it with a clean-up. He said this year\' s theme was  Working together for a healthy, just and sustainable planet .  Cleaning and taking care of the planet is a social responsibility as the sea, the ocean are the biggest contributors of carbon dioxide and if we just let plastics fly around we are destroying the planet, said Chimbari. He said the corporate world needed to be held accountable as the garbage they collected could be traced back to certain organisations, and they needed to be told that they were responsible for damaging the sea. \</doc>

CLIMATE There's still hope even though COP27 was disappointing As I write this final column for 2022 and head into a much-deserved year-end break, I do so with mixed emotions about the future of human civilisation. The end result of COP27 was generally disappointing in my book. Where many have applauded the creation of a loss and damage facility that will theoretically compensate developing countries for the financial costs stemming from climate-induced natural disasters, I, perhaps cynically, see this as resigning ourselves to paying for these disasters instead of taking the action required to avoid them. On the other hand, I believe that the resurgent interest in fossil fuels off the back of spiralling energy costs in the global north will be short-lived and that current circumstances will only fuel the uptake of renewable energy. The reality of forced shutdowns of nuclear, coal and hydropower plants across the US, Europe and China during this summer's heatwave will prove compelling when it comes to policymakers looking to ensure domestic energy security. Not even President Vladimir Putin can shut off the sun or stop the wind from blowing. I am similarly conflicted when it comes to my area of professional specialisation, that of nature-based solutions. On the one hand, COP27 was abuzz with events focused on the topic, yet the "implementation plan" agreed at the summit merely repeated the language on nature used in the COP26 Glasgow pact last year, which was pretty wishy-washy to begin with. For all that sound and fury, the end result was underwhelming. On the other hand, next week Montreal in Canada will play host to COP27 's little brother, the UN Biodiversity Conference from December 7 to 19 (COP15). The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is one of the three Rio conventions set up in 1992, alongside the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. Where COP27 This is no small feat. As previously mentioned in this column, the release of the 2022 Living Planet Report by the WWF shows there has been an average population decrease of 69% in monitored mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish around the globe since 1970, not to mention the similar decimation of the floral kingdom. Halting this juggernaut of environmental destruction will be a phenomenal undertaking with profound importance not only for nature but for our ability to navigate the climate crises. Climate change is a key driver of biodiversity loss, while agriculture, forestry and other land use contribute almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. Nature-based solutions also have the potential to provide a third of the solutions required to build systemic resilience to physical climate impacts. The Chinese government, which has been presiding over the negotiations in the lead-up to Montreal, is optimistic about the outcome of the event as it feels there is basic consensus on biodiversity protection. Unlike the previous 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets agreed to by the CBD member states in Nagoya, Japan, in 2010, none of which was fully achieved, this new framework is supported by growing private sector awareness of the urgent need to shift the needle. Let us hope for all our sakes that it is not too little too late. Maguire is carbon project manager at Climate Neutral Group SA. He writes in his personal capacity. . \</doc>

Writing cheques and reality checks at COP27 Finance has been at the top of the agenda for this year's UN climate summit in Egypt. Demands for billions of dollars in financing are coming from developing countries, many of which are in Africa, that will disproportionately suffer the effects of climate change after contributing little to the current crisis. Negotiations are dragging over the demand from developing nations that COP27 needs to agree to launch a special fund to tackle loss and damage - compensation for losses from climate-related disasters - as wealthy countries resist the idea of a mechanism that could suggest liability for historic climate damage. Talks are also progressing to get high-income countries to honour their pledges to deliver $100bn a year in climate finance up to 2025, before increasing contributions even further. The risk of turning almost all the attention to financing issues is that the summit will come to an end without any new commitments to cut climate-warming emissions fast enough and deeply enough to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C, the line that should not be crossed to avoid catastrophic damage to ecosystems. It would probably be best to acknowledge that the world has already failed to respond robustly enough to achieve this, and to reset targets aimed at urgently limiting warming above 1.5?. In the run-up to COP27 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a body of experts convened by the UN, released a report which said that the world is now about 18 years away from reaching 1.5?C of warming. With that now almost certainly inevitable, it seems unlikely that countries will act fast enough to prevent temperature rises from exceeding this limit. Limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C will require the world to cut emissions 45% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. However, according to current commitments, global emissions are set to increase almost 14% up to 2030. Current emission policies and commitments put the world on course for warming of about 2.3\'b0C-2.7\'b0C. The Global Carbon Budget 2022 released at COP27 reiterated that global carbon emissions in 2022 remain at record levels, with no sign of the decrease that is urgently needed to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C. The rate of increase is slowing, but not fast enough. In 2022, emissions are set to increase 1% (compared with 2021), down from its peak of 3% during the 2000s. However, at the current rate, there is now a 50% chance that global warming of 1.5\'b0C will be exceeded in nine years, the report found. Another COP gets under way this week which offers, perhaps, more vivid examples of how rapidly biodiversity, natural resources, and species diversity are declining in the face of growing consumption by humans. At the 19th Conference of the Parties (COP) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Panama sharks and other animals threatened with extinction due to the illicit trade in wildlife and animal parts are high on the agenda. Recent evidence shows that 37% of all sharks and 70% of species traded for their fins are already at risk of extinction. Reef sharks, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, are functionally extinct on 20% of reefs, further jeopardising the health of these ecosystems that are already devastated by the effects of climate change. As balance and diversity give way to volatility and uncertainty, it is worth reflecting on the question asked by Melbourne Climate Futures, the University of Melbourne's interdisciplinary climate research initiative, which shows up the irony and hypocrisy of the global, high-level response to climate change mitigation. The study, The Land Gap Report, calculates that countries collectively need 1.2-billion hectares to fulfil the promises laid out in their official climate plans. Countries intend to use 633-million hectares of the total area for carbon capture tactics such as tree planting, "which would gobble up land desperately needed for food production and nature protection" and only 551-million hectares would be from the restoration of degraded lands and primary forests. What the researchers then ask, and we should be asking as well, is why countries should pledge to plant trees on vast tracts of land as a means of carbon capture, rather than doing the hard work of protecting the forests that are already there. \</doc>

Forestry, Fisheries and Environment Minister Barbara Creecy has called on developed countries to take action and honour the climate funding they promised to developing countries to help them with transitioning from coal to cleaner energy. Speaking at the national stakeholder consultation on South Africa's position for the climate change negotiations at COP27 on Monday, Creecy who is part of South Africa's negotiation team said she would like to see developed nations honouring their R100-billion pledge to developing countries. "We need to know when the 100-billion target will be met because this is a fundamental issue around trust and rebuilding trust between developed and developing countries and, as I have said before, we need to make sure that the finance is quantifiable and predictable and does not exacerbate existing indebtedness," she said. COP27 should be seen as an "implementation COP", including by ensuring that the gap between climate finance pledges and actual flow was closed.\~ "We need to rebuild trust between developed and developing countries by fulfilling commitments [and] we need clear commitments to supporting just transitions in developing countries," Creecy argued. She warned of a trust deficit on the back of the failure of rich countries to honour their previous $100-billion-a-year climate promise. This pledge HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/oct/06/african-countries-urge-rich-nations-to-honour-100bn-climate-finance-pledge-cop27 was made in 2009 at COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark. South Africa, which entered into a Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, with France, Germany, the US, the UK and the European Union at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021 is expected to unveil its Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, or JET-IP, at COP27 . This plan hasn't been made public yet but it's with the cabinet and will be HYPERLINK https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/just-energy-investment-plan-to-be-released-for-public-comment-after-cop27-unveiling-creecy-2022-10-18#:~:text=South%20Africa's%20Just%20Energy%20Transition,anticipated%20launched%20during%20the%20COP27 unveiled during COP27 . Just transition Creecy said South Africa would use COP27 as a platform to call for greater support for just transitions in Africa as a whole, "starting with energy transitions". South Africa would push for the establishment of a people-centred Just Energy Transition Financing Framework at the climate conference, to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in early November. "A key outcome for COP27 should be the establishment of a Just Energy Transition Financing Framework that is people-centred," Creecy told stakeholders. South Africa would also explore the reform of development banks so countries that faced climate emergencies could access necessary finance, without creating debt.\~ She added the country would use COP27 to call for "new, quantifiable and predictable" finance, based on the needs of developing countries, and backed by a collectively negotiated implementation roadmap. "The framework would further enable ambitious climate action by developing countries while making financial flows consistent with the pathway towards low-emission and climate-resilient development." The country would also be seeking a fairer balance between mitigation and adaptation financing and resolution of the thorny issue of finance for loss and damage caused by climate events. "South Africa was aiming to secure a JET-IP deal that not only mobilised finance, but which unlocked it in a way that supported the objectives of economic inclusion, job creation and environmental sustainability." She added that the country, together with other African countries, would fight for funds for loss and damage at COP27 and saw the conference as a chance to finalise agreements on the governance of loss and damage under the convention. Last year, countries signed a Glasgow Climate Pact which requested that countries revisit and strengthen their 2030 emission-reduction plans, called HYPERLINK Nationally Determined Contributions As a result of the global energy crunch, many countries have backtracked on using coal.\~ Early this month, the cabinet endorsed the JET-IP, which could help unlock $8.5-billion in climate-change financing, primarily in the form of concessional loans, as well as some grants, from the JETP partners. South Africa expected to use the finance to enable moving investments, primarily in the electricity sector, and provide grant funding to support a "just transition" for workers and communities linked to the coal sector.

There\' s a silver lining to the most ominous climate change cloud. President Cyril Ramaphosa handed over his clean energy investment plan to funders at COP27 in Egypt this week. For the leader of a troubled nation who may soon be deposed by his own party and is under threat of a criminal investigation, it was a rare moment of pleasure. Ramaphosa, whose greatest skills are drawing up plans and looking imposingly presidential, was in his element. The EU, Germany, France, the UK and the US have pledged $8.5 billion (R150bn) to his five-year plan, mostly in the form of concessional loans. The tone, although diplomatic, was that the developing world in general, and Africa specifically, was entitled to redress in the form of non-repayable grants rather than burdensome loans. It remains to be seen whether the Western nations will be much inclined to abandon funding mechanisms that Ramaphosa describes as carrying  onerous costs and conditionalities , in favour of largesse. There are also the complicating factors that South Africa has proved to be spectacularly corrupt and, aside from when it has its palm out for greasing, has proved to be a very poor friend of the countries it is seeking funds from. Eventually, the Western democracies will shed their guilt in favour of the hard-nosed quid pro quo approach of Russia and China. COP27 did, however, deliver some good public relations. The EU\' s Ursula von der Leyden gushed on Twitter, congratulating  dear Cyril for his brilliance, while there were plenty of photo opportunities for hand-clasping daisy chains with the UK\' s Rishi Sunak, France\' s Emmanuel Macron, Germany\' s Olaf Scholz, and the US\' s John Kerry. Ramaphosa will appreciate the warmth with which he was received. It is a reminder to his fractious party that he has an international stature that his universally dire challengers would struggle to match. However, at home the transition to a green utopia looks as unlikely as his improbable promise four years ago of a New Dawn. Two reports this week highlight the vast gap that exists between plans and realities. Eskom released its latest statutory assessment of the power system, which showed that even under the best-case scenario, it would not be able to meet the electricity needs of the country over the next five years. The worst-case scenario would see a 40% increase in the energy supply gap. The other reality check came from market research company Yazi, which released a survey that showed the crushing effect Eskom\' s power cuts have had on vulnerable South Africans eking a living in the informal economy. It found more than 89% of the informal traders believed continued blackouts  will lead to a national uprising, including acts of chaos, increasing strikes and looting . The danger of violence sparked by dissatisfaction over erratic power supplies is not confined to the informal sector. On Monday, residents of Witbank\' s Emalahleni Municipality \- without electricity for six weeks because of a damaged transformer, and told they wouldn\' t have power until after Christmas \- ran amok. They torched a shopping mall and looted shops, including a clothing chain store and a national supermarket outlet. The police allegedly shot one person dead and wounded two others. There is also the intractable problem of a culture of non-payment for services. South Africa\' s COP27 benefactors will, in calculating the price they\' re willing to pay to assuage their white colonial guilt, be very aware that, whether it\' s  green or coal-propelled, energy sustainability is not only a supply issue, but also a consumer one. Nationwide, more than 50% of the electricity bought by municipalities is subsequently not paid for by residents. In Soweto, fewer than one in five residents pay their utilities bills, and the township is responsible for R7bn of the R51bn currently owed to Eskom by all municipalities. A couple of years back, Ramaphosa berated the municipalities over this. He said South Africans needed to change their attitudes and get rid of the  culture of non-payment . The following year, Eskom wrote off R8bn in Soweto debt. Last week, Ramaphosa told parliamentarians that non-payment for services was  unacceptable . However, during the very same session he hinted, in response to a call by the Gauteng premier for another Eskom amnesty for Soweto, that this was feasible, subject to unspecified conditions, to spur economic development in the township. This is a politically opportunistic and monumentally stupid idea under the best of circumstances. That the president would even countenance it, hard on the heels of passing round the begging bowl at COP27 , is unfathomable. Follow WSM on Twitter @TheJaundicedEye \</doc>

IT has been trumpeted as the \' COP of Africa\' \- the occasion of the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). That it is taking place in Africa in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt, one of the top three economies and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases on the Continent, over the next 13 days from 6-18 November 2022, may give the impression that Africa finally may get a say at the top table of the global climate crisis discourse. Never mind the fact that Africa with the lowest carbon footprint is also one of the most severely affected by the disruptions caused by catastrophic climate and environmental events such as floods, droughts and pests, and geopolitical events such as conflict, and their impacts on the various socio-economic sectors \- energy and food security, infrastructure, and health systems. So, will it be a lucky 13 days for Climate Action, Mitigation, Adaptation and Finance? In contrast to the optimism and raised expectations of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, which, by the way, was misplaced and reduced Alok Sharma, the UK President of COP26, to tears for failing to get key countries to sign up to the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C, over the short term, to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels and commit more climate adaptation funds, including for climate related loss and damage, especially to the poorer nations, COP27 is already in danger of turning out to be an own goal! Hardly had the jamboree in the Red Sea resort begun, expectations of any major decisions on climate action in Sharm El Sheikh have already been dampened. Among the posturing, the rhetoric of aspiration and the little steps of progress, the mood music is changing to a creeping resignation that at best the gains made at COP27 will be largely procedural. Colleagues of mine who are already in Sharm El Sheikh are alluding to the over-bearing bureaucracy and security which has effectively separated the VIPs and speakers into \' a Blue Zone\' , away from interaction with other key stakeholders. Surely the very raison d\' etre of the COPS is for ALL stakeholders, including activists, to discuss, argue about, exchange or reject ideas and hopefully build some semblance of a consensus to deal with the defining challenge facing humanity in a safe and open environment? Many climate activists including Greta Thunberg, NGOs and community leaders won\' t even get a look in, stressing that attending Sharm El Sheikh is an exercise in futility which merely reinforces national, corporate and institutional self-interest of the key actors. Cynicism of the whole process is rife. With world leaders, dignitaries, celebrities and the cornucopia of attendees clocking up the carbon miles just getting to COP27 , the integrity of its very processes is at stake. The danger is that of greenwashing both the form, substance and integrity of COP27 . Complexities notwithstanding, Africa can do without such hubris! The wisdom of holding such a global event in a country ruled by a military-led regime, headed by General Abdel Fattah El Sisi, has already attracted the opprobrium of international human rights groups and Egyptian democracy activists, who are protesting in cities across many countries against the regime\' s violations against human rights and freedom of speech. Amidst the current geopolitical and economic volatility and uncertainties the world is faced with, one of the perversities of the Climate Action discourse is the inherent and inevitable political and economic dichotomies embedded, which makes the task of transition, mitigation, adaptation and finance that more onerous and costly. This must not detract from the brilliant work done by cohorts of scientists and UN and international agencies led by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which, in its mitigation to climate change report in June, concluded that the world is not on track to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C or even 2\'b0C. Moreover, the IPCC\' s latest report shows that there are options available now in all sectors that can at least halve emissions by 2030. John Kerry, US Special Climate Envoy, in London on his way to Egypt, was more subdued in his COP messaging. The world's wealthier countries need to "step up" to help poorer nations transition away from fossil fuels and adapt to the impact of climate change. "Those countries with greater means across the board - and that includes some developing countries that have greater means, he told BBC radio,  need to also step up and help in this transition. We are going to view it as our efforts to try to help countries to adapt, to be able to become more resilient and obviously address the challenges that they face as a result of the losses and damages. He had a stark message for the supporters of the fossil fuel industry. "There are people within the fossil fuel industry who are using the crisis in Ukraine, frankly, as leverage to be able to say 'We need to be pumping a lot more. We're moving much too fast'. It's just not true, it's not an accurate narrative." Last year in Glasgow, Kerry warned about the  insanity of subsidising the fossil fuel industry to the tune of US$2.5 trillion over the past few years. There are several insanities piling up in Sharm El Sheikh \- global uncertainties, disruptions, inaction, delays, reverting to fossil fuel norms, underfunding and unkept pledges. Will COP27 see \' a bonfire of the insanities?\' For Dr Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP27 , the task is simple:  We are at an inflection point in the global race to a climate-resilient and sustainable future: the point where the surge of commitments, ambition, initiatives, and promises made in recent years meets the real test of implementation. The climate action agenda has transformed since the 2015 Paris Agreement, with pledges to reach net zero emissions by 2050.  But greenhouse gas emissions have yet to fall, while the impacts of climate change are worsening. For many especially in developing and emerging economies, there is an urgency to adapt and build resilience to impacts such as droughts, floods, extreme heat and wildfires \- while growing sustainably.

The Bonn Climate Change Conference marked the first time negotiators had met since November 2021 at HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop26/ COP26 in Glasgow, where the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-glasgow-climate-pact-key-outcomes-from-cop26 Glasgow Climate Pact Shedding light on the outcomes of the meeting, Wamukoya summarised the African position in four key points: developed countries should raise their climate ambition, adaptation is a priority for Africa, the continent's climate vulnerability must be recognised and there is a need to focus on Africa's agricultural sector. Getting to grips with Africa's priorities If countries can cut global emissions to "net zero" by 2050, we may still have a chance to bring global warming below 1.5 C in the second half of this century and avert global disaster in the form of heat waves, flooding, wildfires, widespread crop failure, coral bleaching and rising sea levels. The HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/conference-of-the-parties/ Conference of the Parties HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/the-convention/history-of-the-convention#eq-1 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \~(UNFCCC) treaty.

HYPERLINK https://africangroupofnegotiators.org/ African Group of Negotiators Since 2015, the group has been supported by Agnes Africa, which provides scientific evidence to inform the African position by facilitating the exchange of ideas between experts and negotiators. The group has been working with Oppenheimer Generations Research and Conservation as well as researchers from their partner programme, HYPERLINK https://futureecosystemsafrica.org/ Future Ecosystems for Africa COP27 position. The Bonn Climate Change Conference brought together a multitude of stakeholders from around the world to prepare for the COP27 .\~ Shouldering responsibility for climate change Prior to the last COP, the UNFCCC secretariat's assessment of all updated nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) - each nation's promised actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions - put the trajectory of global temperature increase at HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/full-ndc-synthesis-report-some-progress-but-still-a-big-concern 2.7 C by the end of the century , far overshooting the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/paris-agreement/ Paris Agreement 's 1.5 C target.\~ Raising the "ambition" to cut emissions remains critical to success. But at SB56 a familiar question arose, "Who is that ambition for; developing countries or developed countries who have historical responsibility?" said Wamukoya. Countries can raise their ambition by committing to improved NDCs and climate finance. Although developed countries promised in 2009 to jointly contribute\~ HYPERLINK $100-billion a year\~by 2020 HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/statement-from-oecd-secretary-general-mathias-cormann-on-climate-finance-in-2019.htm that goal has not been reached In fact, vulnerable nations including least developed countries and small island developing states appear to be https://climatepromise.undp.org/state-of-climate-ambition leading in climate ambition Looking at COP27 , Africa's position is that developed countries should raise their ambition. Currently, Africa is contributing very low greenhouse gas emissions compared to other continents - just HYPERLINK https://www.cdp.net/en/research/global-reports/africa-report less than 4% of total global emissions.\~ African negotiators at COP27 will maintain that the responsibility lies with developed nations - which are responsible for HYPERLINK https://www.cgdev.org/media/who-caused-climate-change-historically 79% of historical carbon emissions Adaptation remains a priority for Africa Climate action can fall into one of two categories, "adaptation", referring to actions taken to prepare for and adjust to the effects of climate change as well as those predicted in the future; or "mitigation", which are efforts to reduce or prevent the emission of greenhouse gases. Adaptation is a priority for Africa and other developing countries, whose vulnerabilities mean they will carry the costs of climate change despite having contributed the least to cause it. For these nations, financing for HYPERLINK climate adaptation is critical. Currently, less than 20% of climate finance is going to adaptation compared to mitigation actions. "[Africa and other developing countries] are having to use national resources which would have been used for other pressing issues (job creation, sanitation and housing), to deal with climate change. I think our countries will have a big challenge in meeting normal development activities at the same time as addressing climate change - we need adequate climate adaptation financing," Wamukoya emphasises. Although it was agreed in Glasgow that the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/Adaptation-Fund Adaptation Fund would double, the source of financing, and how funds can be accessed, remain in question.\~ However, assessing climate adaption is a far more nebulous task than monitoring progress towards preventing a 1.5 C temperature rise. Determining indicators to track progress on the three goals - enhancing adaptive capacity, building resilience, and reducing vulnerability - remains a challenge due to their qualitative nature. Africa is vulnerable "All the best science available is showing that Africa is the most vulnerable continent" and therefore requires a high level of investment in adaptation to cushion itself from the adverse impacts of climate change, says Wamukoya. The continent faces high levels of adverse climate change effects but has inadequate financial capacity to respond. A key element of the African position is to gain recognition that Africa is highly vulnerable and needs financial support to deal with the effects of climate change. "We can only do this by showcasing African stories and narratives" to provide evidence to convince international negotiators of Africa's needs, says Wamukoya. These stories include case studies of natural disasters wreaking havoc across the continent. After tearing through Madagascar, HYPERLINK Cyclone Idai hit Mozambique on 14 March 2019, before moving inland across Zimbabwe. Severe flooding and high winds peaking at 280 km/h flattened homes and destroyed crops.

In the wake of extreme weather events, like those playing out in the Sahel, farmers and pastoralists are left helpless. Agriculture has been on the agenda for UNFCCC discussions since 2011. "Since then, we've been having technical discussions to understand how agriculture plays out in the climate system", says Wamukoya, who is a lead negotiator on agriculture. "That roadmap we've given ourselves came to an end last year, so this year at COP27 we must get a new position to see how we move agriculture forward".\~ African agricultural investment has largely been received from official development assistance, which has been decreasing. "The only way we can transform our agricultural systems is by attracting climate finance from public and private sectors," says Wamukoya. According to him, the aim is to develop guidance and leadership on how African agriculture should be dealt with, given the need to safeguard this vulnerable sector for food security. The world is looking to COP27 to negotiate our future against a ticking clock. With the event taking place on African soil, this is a valuable opportunity to gain climate wins for the continent.

THE COP27 climate summit has made a welcome step towards a loss and damage fund, but by failure to agree to more ambitious action on emission reductions - the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C - is slipping away, with disastrous consequences for the world, according to the WWF. WWF Global Climate and Energy Lead and COP20 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal said the loss and damage deal risks becoming a  fund for the end of the world if countries don\' t move faster to slash emissions and limit warming to below 1.5\'b0C.  By failing to agree to phase-out fossil fuels at COP27 , leaders have missed the chance to accelerate the elimination of fossil fuels, keeping us on course to climate catastrophe. Without rapid and deep emissions cuts we cannot limit the scale of loss and damage.  Now governments must redouble their efforts to reduce emissions and take the necessary transformative action to keep warming to below 1.5\'b0C. The COP28 climate summit next year must be the COP of climate credibility. And countries must deliver, Pulgar-Vidal said. WWF Regional Director for Africa Alice Ruhweza added that the event was meant to be an \' African COP\' , but it had failed to deliver on the continent\' s needs and priorities.  Africa is on the front lines of the climate crisis and is highly vulnerable to its impacts. We are already seeing terrible impacts and loss and damage across the continent.  We welcome progress in establishing a fund to help countries recover from climate-related disasters, but this is not enough without more action to prevent the climate crisis from spiralling out of control.  Furthermore, we expected to see more finance and action to increase Africa\' s resilience, but yet again finance commitments for adaptation were not met, Ruhweza said. Nature has absorbed 54% of humanity\' s carbon dioxide emissions over the past 10 years, so it is good to see countries recognise the importance of nature-based solutions in the final COP27 cover decision, WWF Global Climate and Energy Deputy Lead Dr Stephen Cornelius said. \</doc>

As it moves to increase its climate adaptation finance, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has launched the EBRD Climate Adaptation Action Plan (CAAP) at COP27 , the global climate summit taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Climate adaptation - adapting to already existing climate change and anticipating future changes in long-term planning - has been an increasing focus of attention in recent years as the current level of global warming is already causing extreme weather events to multiply and intensify. It is one of the core themes of COP27 . The EBRD Climate Adaptation Action Plan brings together a number of elements to strengthen the Bank's adaptation work: integrating adaptation into project and policy design, building partnerships, developing business and mobilising private finance. "We don't have one single answer on adaptation; our response is a combination of a number of different tools and approaches," said Harry Boyd-Carpenter, EBRD Managing Director, Climate Strategy and Delivery. "We increasingly see adaptation not as a cost but rather as an investment that protect economic development and preserve the competitiveness of our clients." At last year's climate summit, COP26, the Glasgow Climate Pact included a commitment from developed countries to at least double - from the 2019 levels of US$ 20 billion - the collective adaptation finance to developing countries by 2025. Increased adaptation finance is particularly important to address the climate vulnerability of EBRD regions Several EBRD countries - especially those in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) and Central Asia - are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Between 2008 and 2018, insured losses to extreme weather events in EBRD economies totalled US$ 25 billion. Chronic water stress has already changed the landscape, and warming in the region is expected to exceed the global average. In the face of these risks, the EBRD is building new partnerships to identify and support opportunities for investing in greater resilience. During COP27 President Odile Renaud-Basso spoke at multiple events on the need for more adaptation finance, including the COP27 World Leaders event, Accelerating Adaptation in Africa, and discussed adaptation with the African Development Bank's President Akinwumi Adesina. Over the past decade, the EBRD has financed over 350 climate resilience investments with a business volume of more than ?10 billion and adaptation finance exceeding ?2.8 billion. Since issuing the world's first dedicated climate resilience bond in 2019, the EBRD has also prepared the Guide for Issuers on Green Bonds for Climate Resilience, together with the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), to provide practical guidance to sovereigns, sub-sovereigns, financial institutions and corporates on raising capital in the green bond market to invest in climate adaptation and resilience. At the forefront of climate finance, the EBRD has committed to make more than half of its investment green by 2025 and to align all its operations with the goals of the Paris Agreement by 1 January 2023. In preparation, the Bank now screens every project for its climate resilience and systematically identify adaptation opportunities. Footnote: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was established to help build a new, post-Cold War era in Central and Eastern Europe.

MIKE LOEWESA's global climate and human rights activist Kumi Naidoo has thrown his weight behind an alternative climate crisis conference to resist what he sees as untruths and distortions being publicised at COP27 . COP27 's messaging. This reporter attended COP17 and heard then-minister of energy Dipuo Peters state at a media briefing that SA had 32-billion tonnes of coal reserves "which at current consumption rates can last us more than 100 years to come". Naidoo said the alternative festival was timed to coincide with the global day of action, civil society's response to COP27 , which climate justice activists dubbed the UN's 27th "Conference of Polluters". He said in the 27 years since the first Conference of the Parties (COP1) in Berlin, Germany, in 1995, and including the COP17 that was held in Durban a decade ago, "little has been achieved. We are hurtling ever faster towards a global ecological catastrophe". " COP27 "At this critical juncture - when more than ever, leaders are needed who are truly committed to the welfare of their people and protecting the planet for present and future generations - COP27 looks set to outdo its predecessors in greenwash, corporate capture, and false solutions that will continue to enrich those who have contributed the most to climate breakdown, while those who have contributed the least suffer the worst impacts. "Communities must unite to demand people-focused, real solutions that will ensure a just transition to a clean, green economy for the benefit of all. The festival would focus on: The impacts of oil and gas exploration along the SA coastline on marine life as well as the livelihoods of fisher folk and coastal communities that depend on the ocean; The devastating and deadly KZN floods in April. "Damage to water and sanitation infrastructure as a result of the floods has led to dangerous levels of pollution pouring into our rivers and ocean having a detrimental impact, not only on the environment, but on already hard-hit businesses that cater to beachgoers and tourists." The festival will draw attention to the 14 articles of the Climate Justice Charter (CJC). The charter was first presented to parliament on World Food Day on October 16 2020. The handover included a climate science future document prepared by leading climate scientists and a set of demands from 72 communities calling for an end to pollution, water stress, hunger and climate harm. Since then, the Climate Justice Charter Movement (CJCM) has gained momentum nationally, with more than 270 organisations formally endorsing the charter. The climate movement returned to parliament on the same day in 2021 to hand over a petition during its national day of action at a global solidarity assembly with the CJCM. Naidoo said the themes, talks, workshops and activities at the festival would include storytelling and "artivism, feeding ourselves through food sovereignty, anti-waste and alternative energy, the environment and early childhood education, and the rights of nature". There would be discussion forums, a makers hub, barter market, green film festival and a Blue-Green parade. Naidoo said: "The way forward is in harnessing the power that we as citizens have at our disposal, and creating the maximum level of unity and resistance to those in government and business dragging their feet. "We can follow the creative example of the Climate Justice Charter formulated by SA civil society." The festival is at the Blue Waters hotel in Durban over the two weekends of November 12-13 and 19-20.

Leaders from poor countries criticized wealthy governments and oil companies for driving global warming, using their speeches on Tuesday at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt to demand that they pay up for damages being inflicting on their economies. Small island nations suffering the brunt of climate change want Big Oil to pay for mounting damage from ocean storms and sea-level rise, Antigua\' s prime minister told delegates at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt yesterday. The comments by Gaston Browne kicked off the second day of speeches from heads of state and government at the two-week conference in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.  The oil and gas industry continues to earn almost $3 billion (about R53bn) daily in profits, Browne said, speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States.  It is about time that these companies are made to pay a global carbon tax on their profits as a source of funding for loss and damage.  Profligate producers of fossil fuels have benefited from extortionate profits at the expense of human civilisation. While they are profiting, the planet is burning. Multibillion-dollar oil industry profits since Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine in February \- which has roiled markets and disrupted supplies \- have also angered governments worldwide concerned about climate change and rampant consumer inflation. Senegal\' s President Macky Sall told the conference poor developing nations in Africa were also insisting on increased funding for adaptation to worsening climate change, and would resist calls for an immediate shift away from fossil fuels that could drive economic growth. The hosts of the COP27 climate talks yesterday launched a global plan to help the poorest communities withstand the impacts of global warming. The head of the World Trade Organization, meanwhile, said she aimed to revive negotiations on a global environmental trade deal as part of efforts to give the trade watchdog a bigger role in tackling climate change. | \</doc>

Leaders of the developing world on Monday demanded that wealthy nations spend vastly more to help vulnerable populations adjust to a warming planet, as a UN climate conference started with growing anger toward industrialised countries reluctant to pay for the consequences of climate change.  We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator, warned UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, as he opened two weeks of talks, COP27 , in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh. Countries have agreed to start talking for the first time about the world\' s wealthy nations paying a form of climate reparations to the most vulnerable countries. The annual UN climate gathering is the main venue for nations to come together to try to co-operate on efforts to fight global warming. This year, policymakers have agreed to start talking about the developing world\' s demands for more help with the harm they are already suffering from climate change, as farmland dries up, towns relocate to escape rising seas, and conflicts increase over access to increasingly scarce resources.  We are getting dangerously close to the point of no return, Guterres said. But there was every indication that talks about  loss and damage would end without significant breakthroughs. After hours of bargaining over the weekend about what items to include in the agenda, rich nations said even including the subject in the official talks was a major step. Vulnerable countries said it was the bare minimum. The gathering  offers us an opportunity to either make history or, if you like, be a victim of history , Senegalese President Macky Sall, chairperson of the AU, told leaders. | The Washpington Post \</doc>

Peace is precious. The past few months have offered daily reminders of this simple fact. War in Ukraine. Russian and North Korean nuclear threats. Growing tensions over Taiwan. Huge population displacements. Energy crisis. Economic turmoil. Rising global hunger and inequality. To prevent this from becoming the new normal, world leaders need to take radical, courageous action, together. The upcoming climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, COP27 , is one of the places where this needs to happen. Climate change threatens peace and security Scratch beneath the surface of the disparate set of crises that confront us in 2022, and the links to climate change, and to climate action, are plain to see. Europe's continued reliance on fossil energy has complicated its response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pushed the continent into an unprecedented energy crisis, threatening to spiral into an economic recession. It has also left Europe's political leaders struggling to mitigate the impacts on their populations. European countries' race to secure new sources of fossil energy poses new geopolitical risks and can lock countries into new supply contracts and commitments that will make net zero targets even harder to achieve. Put simply, the state of security and the state of the environment are today intimately linked. Harm one, harm the other; heal one, heal the other. This is a truth world leaders should take with them to the COP27 climate summit. Keep peace and security in focus at COP27 All of the possible paths back to peace and environmental sustainability depend on cooperation. Negotiations at Sharm El-Sheikh must therefore focus on seeking common ground, removing roadblocks and enabling progress in international climate cooperation; ramping up ambition rather than watering it down. In the words of UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, 'We have a choice. Collective action or collective suicide.' Peace and security should be in every discussion at COP27 . This should motivate faster and deeper cuts in carbon emissions. States should recognize that phasing out fossil fuels can increase both energy security and human security overall. At the same time, they must discuss how to avoid creating new security risks in the process: how to ease the transition for developing countries highly dependent on fossil fuel revenues. How to make sure that the surging demand for renewable energy as well as for metals and minerals needed for green technologies does not lead to new conflicts, or increase inequality and corruption. How to manage new critical dependencies emerging around minerals that are needed for the green energy transition. At COP27 , there will also be a focus on climate change adaptation: measures taken to adjust to new climatic conditions. Well-adapted communities and economies are more resilient to the impacts of climate change. They are less likely to be destabilized by shortages, displacement and destitution. When communities are involved in adaptation planning and resource management, it can even help to resolve long-standing conflicts and increase trust in government authorities. Boost climate finance Climate finance--the funds richer countries provide to help vulnerable countries to respond to climate change--will also be a priority topic at COP27 . This will be setting out how to ensure that rich countries' governments deliver on their 2009 commitment of US$100 billion in climate finance per year, a goal which they should have already reached by 2020. There will also be talks on a new climate finance target for post-2025. Seeing climate finance as an investment in peace and security should help persuade them to offer more, far beyond the original pledge, even during these hard economic times. In particular, finance for adaptation projects needs to rise sharply. The amounts available fall far behind what the most vulnerable countries need, creating wholly avoidable risks to peace and security. But any increase should not come at the expense of mitigation or development assistance. There is also the difficult question of loss and damage compensation--finance to help countries deal with the impacts of climate change that cannot be adapted to. States must try to resolve the strong differences that have blocked progress to date, so that funds can start flowing. The damage countries and communities are suffering is real, and every delay increases the chance that it will erode peace, security and trust. Finally, ways need to be found to get climate finance to countries that are fragile because of an active or recent armed conflict. These countries today receive only a fraction of what others do, even though these are precisely the countries where climate change has the greatest potential to undermine peace. Exceed expectations There are limits to how much of this can be achieved in Sharm El-Sheikh. States will need to carry on the work after the summit, individually and collaboratively, drawing in the private sector, civil society and communities. Significant progress can be made at COP27 , if governments show commitment. Besides the action it enables, a COP that exceeds expectations would send important signals to states, publics and markets that world leaders are serious about safeguarding the future. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen has been Chairman of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) since 2022 and was Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nations between 2017 and 2021.

The 27th Conference Of Parties ( COP27 ) on Climate Change comes at a time when we are facing unprecedented challenges due to the magnitude and the interconnected nature of our multiple structural crises. The world's average temperature is now at 1,1?. For many years now, we have been experiencing irreversible damage to the planet, and the loss of homelands, cultures, ecosystems, on a daily basis. Record-breaking heat has hit North America, Europe, China, Australia, India and Pakistan, sparking wildfires in many places. More than a third of heat-related deaths in summer from 1991 to 2018 occurred as a result of human-caused global warming. European and Latin American cities are among the worst affected by summer heat deaths due to the climate crisis. Terrible floods have swept Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, and South Africa. Super typhoons have brought untold damage to people and communities in the Philippines, the Caribbean, the Pacific and the gulf and southern areas of the United States. But does COP really hold any value anymore? We have been seeing consistent efforts to dilute the outcomes of previous climate change conferences, often driven by the world's fossil fuel addiction and intensive lobbying of big polluters prioritizing their agenda of greed and profit over the lives of billions of frontline communities suffering the devastating impact of climate crisis daily. At COP 26, the Glasgow Outcomes were presented as if they were more relevant than the Paris Agreement (which is legally binding). The UK presidency had enough time to build up a narrative around false solutions, including the charade of net zero targets for all by 2050 (undermining again the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) through carbon offsets and nature-based solutions that further continue with the agenda of commodification of nature for the profit of the same usual polluters. World governments, especially rich countries have consistently failed to deliver on their climate finance commitments of $100 billion per year. This annual goal urgently needed by grassroots communities to mitigate and adapt to climate change has not been met even once by the governments. There has been constant pushback for a loss and damage finance facility and mechanism that can support vulnerable countries and peoples on the ground recover from climate change induced disasters. Loss and damage were only introduced in the COP27 agenda after consistent push by civil society groups globally. The climate conferences are increasingly becoming spaces for greenwashing of not just the big polluters' crimes, but also of the regimes and presidencies hosting COP. COP27 is taking place in the Southern Sinai city of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, and as all eyes turn to Egypt, the campaigns to Free Alaa and other political prisoners, as well as for civic space to open up in Egypt, is gaining momentum. As the world leaders and negotiators gather for the summit, it is not only communities in Sinai that continue to suffer from the increasing violence of climate impacts but peoples everywhere, with the most marginalized - peoples of color, Indigenous Peoples, communities in the Global South, frontline communities, women and children - hit first and hardest. It is imperative that we stand in solidarity with impacted and frontline communities everywhere and reiterate our demands for urgent and drastic action to justly address the climate crisis. At COP27 , DCJ will continue with its struggles and demands for profound social transformation and the achievement of immediate concrete results in terms of drastic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and enabling peoples to deal with the impacts of the climate crisis. Like other global crises, climate change arises principally from historically unequal economic and social structures, from practices and policies promoted by rich, industrialized countries, and from systems of production and consumption that sacrifice the needs of the many to the interests of a few. And it is the communities around the world that have contributed the very least to climate change that are paying the highest price-their lives and livelihoods. We demand from all governments that if international negotiations are to mean anything, they must deliver outcomes that will prevent catastrophic climate change and ensure just and fair sharing of drastic emission reductions in keeping with the goal of limiting the rise of global average temperature to below 1.5\'ba C. We demand an end to pursuit and implementation of false solutions disguised in the form of nature-based solutions. We demand that rich countries deliver fully on their obligations to provide adequate and appropriate climate finance on the basis of countries' responsibility for climate debt and as part of reparations to all affected peoples. We demand mechanisms that ensure climate finances are rewound to the empowerment and benefit of peoples and communities most impacted by the climate crisis. We demand that developed countries support appropriate technology transfers without intellectual property rights barriers. Will COP27 COP27 must deliver a strong message to the world that the multilateral system can still play a role in fighting the climate crisis. It cannot be remembered as just another meeting, but as a moment to show major progress through real solutions. It must generate outcomes towards an urgent reset of the system. A moment to abandon the old, profiteering, polluting world order, and a time to reimagine and rapidly implement global collaboration that centers equity, science, humanity. We don't have to tell you what another failed COP will mean for people and the planet.

The Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Her Excellency Barbara Creecy will on Monday, 14 November 2022, launch the South Africa Pavilion at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The South African Pavilion is hosted jointly by the South African Government and South African business, coordinated by the National Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) and the National Business Initiative (NBI). The Pavilion at the UNFCCC's 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) brings together businesses and civil society to collaborate with public sector policy makers to discuss critical climate related issues, the Just Transition in South Africa and to highlight key investment opportunities in the country. The South African Pavilion is providing the global community with evidence that multi-sector collaboration in Africa is working to mitigate the effects of climate change, transforming economies and building resilient societies in a manner that is just, equitable and ensures no one is left behind. COP27 marks the fifth South African Pavilion which showcases the collaboration between government and business in the fight against climate change. The first joint pavilion was at COP23 in Bonn, Germany, followed by COP24 in Katowice, Poland, COP25 in Madrid, Spain and COP26 in Glasgow, UK, respectively. \</doc>

The latest HYPERLINK https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)01540-9/fulltext Lancet Countdown report HYPERLINK https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2105482118 increases by 2% each year.\~ In the coming decades, the interplay between the climate crisis and public health could create a perfect storm of global devastation and disruption. The good news is that if we take immediate steps to transform our health systems, we can avert another Covid-style catastrophe. As with the current pandemic, the obstacles to mitigating climate change are not just scientific or technological, but also rooted in geopolitics and market forces. Self-interest can undermine public health, particularly when it comes to equitable access to resources.\~ Even so, the international community came together to introduce innovative mechanisms like the Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access facility (Covax), which was designed to remove the financial barriers that prevented lower-income countries from obtaining vaccines. We must launch similar mechanisms for addressing the global public-health impact of climate change. While we already know many of the likely solutions, their effectiveness requires that we put them in place before disaster strikes. This is not just a moral imperative; it is also a smart economic choice that would likely reduce the overall cost of outbreaks and other climate-related catastrophes. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ) in Egypt this past November underscored the fact that sustainability is not just about decarbonisation, electric vehicles, or climate adaptation measures such as flood defences. It is also about pandemic preparedness.\~ More broadly, climate change is expected to shift the habitat range of deadly pathogens, causing infectious, mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, yellow fever, and dengue fever to spread as far as northern Europe and Canada. At the same time, the climate crisis threatens to increase the prevalence of malaria, cholera, and schistosomiasis across the developing world. The world's poorest countries remain the most vulnerable to climate change, despite contributing the least to creating the problem. That is why the international community must take immediate steps to ensure that impoverished, marginalised people have access to vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics.\~ Given the devastating effect that a single virus has had on billions of lives, livelihoods, and the global economy over the past three years, it is abundantly clear that we must urgently take steps to counter climate-related health threats. The global effort to ensure equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines provides a useful model. The Gavi Covax Advance Market Commitment, a financial HYPERLINK mechanism funded by donors and accelerated by the European Investment Bank, enabled people in the world's 92 poorest countries to obtain free vaccines. These lower-income countries, representing roughly half of the world's population, would have struggled to secure access otherwise. So far, more than 1.6 billion Covax doses have been HYPERLINK https://reliefweb.int/report/world/five-reasons-why-covax-supports-all-nations delivered to developing countries, helping to ensure that 52% of their citizens are fully vaccinated, compared to a global average of HYPERLINK https://covid19.who.int/table 64% .\~ This is a remarkable achievement, particularly in the context of intense vaccine hoarding by developed countries, the export restrictions that some countries placed on vaccines and the components needed to produce them, and the actions of some manufacturers that have seemingly prioritised profit over fairness. The Covax model's success shows that there is scope for similar innovative financing solutions to climate-related health risks. For example, several private-sector actors are currently exploring a HYPERLINK https://frontierclimate.com/ Climate Advance Market Commitment Similarly, there is great potential for mechanisms based on the model of the International Finance Facility for Immunization, which uses dedicated " HYPERLINK https://iffim.org/press-releases/international-finance-facility-immunisation-issues-first-sukuk-raising-us-500 vaccine bonds " to frontload long-term donor commitments so that funds can be made available immediately. Multilateralism is essential to establishing these safety-net mechanisms. Covax was possible only because it united the financial firepower and know-how of more than HYPERLINK 190 governments , along with private-sector partners, civil-society groups, and international agencies, around a common cause that benefited everyone.\~ But if Covax had already existed before the pandemic, equipped with at-risk contingency financing and surge capacity, it could have mounted its response - the world's largest and most complex global deployment of vaccines ever - even faster, ultimately saving more lives. After COP27 But what matters most is that these steps are taken now. As The Lancet report warns, the countdown to the next global health crisis has already begun. - \£9 Project Syndicate Seth Berkley is the chief executive of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and Werner Hoyer is the president of the European Investment Bank.

In May, Egypt\' s Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouli launched the country\' s National Climate Change Strategy (NCCS) 2050. This comes ahead of the country hosting the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, in November, and against the backdrop of being one of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change. Yet, its global share of carbon emissions is less than 0.6 percent. Climate change threatens Egypt\' s economic and human development across sectors such as agriculture, water, health, and infrastructure development. In Africa, Egypt has been a forerunner in climate change adaptation and sustainable development, with the goal of becoming the region\' s hub for clean and renewable energy by the stipulated timeline. The NCCS 2050 is an extension of the country\' s 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and other green policies and projects launched in the country over time. This includes pioneering the first sovereign green bond in the Middle East and North Africa region worth $750 million (about R12 billion). Its impact report indicates that 46% of the proceeds have been earmarked for clean transport and 54% for sustainable water supplies and wastewater management. Egypt has successfully sourced financial support from the World Bank for climate finance geared towards multiple projects including clean air and traffic system, green housing solutions and the likes. While Egypt has taken great strides toward climate action, there remains a question about its ability to fulfil the vision embodied in the NCCS 2050. The NCCS 2050 embodies five main goals and 22 objectives. Of importance to this article is goal #1,  achieving sustainable economic growth and low-emission development in various sectors . Within this goal are four key objectives: a) energy transition by increasing the share of all renewable and alternative energy sources in the energy mix; b) reducing emissions associated with the use of fossil fuels; c) maximising energy efficiency; and d) adopting sustainable consumption and production trends for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from other non-energy activities. These goals and objectives are in pursuit of a green energy transition, in alignment with the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Glasgow Pact of November 2021. At the Accelerating Action for the Future Sustainable Clothing and Footwear Industry event organised by the UN Economic Commission for Europe in collaboration with the UN Industrial Development Organisation, Egypt\' s Minister of Environment, Yasmine Fouad, stated that the focus of COP 27 will be on implementing the decisions, pledges and outputs of the COP26 Glasgow Summit held in November 2021. Thus, it is imperative to examine the state\' s capacity to green its national development agenda. In pursuit of green (energy) transition, Egypt has adopted a series of development policies and projects to this effect. Its economic development is hinged on the energy sector which accounts for 13.1% of the country\' s gross domestic product. Thus, the security and stability of energy supply are crucial to Egypt\' s economic welfare. Embodied in the country\' s 2030 Sustainable Development Vision is the target to achieve a diversified, competitive, and balanced economy within the confines of the UN SDGs. Egypt has made considerable efforts in increasing the share of renewable energy in its generation and consumption mix. Given the high potential for renewable sources of energy like solar, wind, and hydropower, the country is looking to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and reduce its carbon footprint by 2050. To this end, the government initiated the Integrated Sustainable Energy Strategy 2035 which seeks to explore new and cleaner sources of energy to generate about 42% of electricity by 2035. Since 2015, Egypt\' s share of renewable energy sources has increased at a staggering compound annual growth rate of 35%. In 2019, the Egyptian government completed the largest solar power plant in the world \- the 1 465-megawatts Benban solar park. Increasing the share of green energy in the country\' s mix has required a shift in organisational structure emphasising the importance of an inclusive approach. While the state-owned energy utility Egyptian Electricity Holding Company dominates the electricity sector and the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy is tasked with drafting the sector\' s development plans, electricity pricing and the supervision and implementation of projects, the sector is regulated by the Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency. In an attempt to include the private sector and key actors in meeting the 2030 and 2050 vision, Egypt seeks to privatise the electricity sector into a fully competitive market by 2025. Thus, the unbundling of the electricity sector would increase participation in the market but can be construed as a strategy to garner crucial funding from institutions like the World Bank and African Development Bank, to fund green energy transition initiatives. Given the above, it can be argued that Egypt is a befitting candidate to host COP27 and well on track to attaining its green vision embodied in its 2030 and 2050 development agenda. An example worth emulating in the African continent. Monyae is an Associate Professor of Political Science and International Relations Ddrector of the Centre for Africa-China Studies.

Namibia said at the COP27 summit on Tuesday, 8 November, that it had secured over (EURO)540m in climate finance from the Dutch government and European Investment Bank. One of the world's sunniest and least densely populated countries, Namibia wants to produce green hydrogen and position itself as a renewable energy hub in Africa.The Dutch grant is from infrastructure funding vehicle Invest International, while the facility from the European Investment Bank is to build green hydrogen and renewable energy projects in Namibia.President Hage Geingob said the funds represented the largest amount of concessionary finance to combat the effects of global warming that his country had secured to date.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/65/704/233303.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/65/704/233303.html :EMBED-->MoU with EU on renewable hydrogenAlso on Tuesday, Namibia signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Union on renewable hydrogen and rare raw materials.Geingob gave no specifics on the agreement but said experts from both sides would soon meet to hammer out joint plans.Hydrogen is categorised "green" when it is made with renewable power and is seen as key to help decarbonise industry, though the technology remains immature and relatively costly.In May, the EU's energy strategy set a goal of importing at least 10 million tonnes of "green" hydrogen by 2030, with another 10 million tonnes to be produced within the bloc. \</doc>

EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu has criticised President Cyril Ramaphosa for making commitments to transition South Africa from its coal use to renewable energy while developed countries still relied largely on fossil fuels. South Africa is one of the International Partner Group nations that have joined hands to bring an end to greenhouse emissions, but it seems South Africa is expected to make the first move while countries such as Germany have gone back to importing coal due to the failure of renewable energy initiatives. Ramaphosa made the recent commitments at the 2022 Conference of Parties \- or COP27 summit \- held at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt this week. Last year, nations signed the Glasgow Just Transition Declaration at COP26 in Scotland. COP26 gave birth to the Just Energy Transition Partnerships model, which came with an $8.5 billion (R151bn) pledge from International Partner Group partners France, the US, the UK, Germany and the EU, with the aim of helping South Africa enjoy an  equitable, inclusive energy transition . During the COP27  As a country, we are guided by a Just Transition Framework and an investment plan that outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve our decarbonisation goals over the next five years, he said. Ramaphosa said South Africa needed assurances from its partners.  We are already scaling up investment in renewable energy, and are on course to retire several of our ageing coal-fired power plants by the end of 2030.  At COP26 in Glasgow last year, France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU offered support in the form of a Just Energy Transition Partnership. It is our hope that this partnership will offer a groundbreaking approach to funding by developed countries for the ambitious but necessary mitigation and adaptation goals of developing countries. In a video that went viral on social media, Shivambu had no kind words for Ramaphosa.  There won\' t be any American who is going to build energy security here in South Africa. We have got our own capacity. There\' s also a lot of options that we can explore with relation to coal.  There\' s clean coal technology that we can explore. We have got 400 years of coal lifespan and we are just instructed by Americans to \' stop that and we are going to give you money\' , he said. Shivambu said Ramaphosa had failed South Africans when he signed the Glasgow agreement.  The most nonsensical thing  was that COP26 deal which was signed by Ramaphosa because he is (in) the pockets of the West. They are controlling him and using him to control the entire continent of Africa.  If they want to experiment with the transition from coal to different energy sources, let them go and do it in Germany first. Germany is still dependent on coal despite an attempt to go green. They are still using coal, they are still polluting the world.  We have new power stations that have been built for billions of dollars. How on earth do you build billions of dollars worth of coal power stations and then you announce that \' I\' m closing all those power stations because I want to have green energy\' ?  You can see this is a colonial take-over and it\' s engineered by the West. The Presidency had yet to comment by late yesterday. \</doc>

It is a decade since Durban hosted the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference and the world\' s leading environmental event returns to Africa, this time in Egypt. So much has changed since COP17 and COP27 , yet the political landscape is reminiscent. Back in 2011, the  Durban deal was about deliverance and finally beginning to address how to balance the needs and responsibilities across the developed and developing world. But has there been significant political progress and changes to help target the hosting continent a decade on? As we head to Sharm El-Sheikh next month it is the moment to shine the spotlight on the fact Africa is disproportionately suffering from climate change impacts that it did not cause. Yet, many countries in the Global North continue to indulge in planet-harming consumption patterns, as well as failing to deliver on financial commitments on loss and damage and dedicate funding for sustainable adaptation practices. It is also the moment for countries to show progress on their commitments, made at last year\' s meeting, towards renewing efforts to urgently deliver the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Four Paws asserts that to achieve this transformation and stay within the 1.5\'b0C goal, an urgent and drastic reduction in the number of animals we farm and consume is needed. This is estimated to be about 70% by 2030 in the Global North \- that produces and consumes more animal products \- and 50% by 2040 globally and would be supported through higher welfare and environmentally sound farming practices and a shift to plant-based diets. Historically, United Nations climate COPs have tended to be about coal and cars, whereas food and farming have been neglected, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation. Yet, food systems are responsible for a third of global greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global warming by 1.5\'b0C will not be achieved without significant changes to the food system. This year, hopefully, marks a turning point. Four Paws is co-hosting the first-ever pavilion on food systems in COP history, Food4Climate. We aim to put farm animals, diet change and food system transformation firmly on the UN Agenda. One way the pavilion will address the role of food in climate action is to really draw attention to demand-side policies. A meat-based diet is responsible for twice the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as a plant-based diet. Therefore, changes to food production and to diets would have a huge impact on the overall global emissions released each year. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it crystal clear; overconsumption of animal-based products needs to be part of climate action. As well as the long-awaited conclusions of the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture, the Egyptian presidency has dedicated an official day of programming on Agriculture and Adaptation. Four Paws will be advocating that as well as mitigating greenhouse gases and adapting to climate change, systemic food system transformation can bring positive co-benefits to the environment, animal welfare and human well-being and contribute to sustainable development outcomes. Shifting to better farming systems such as agroforestry or where there is the practice of integrating trees, forage, and the grazing of domesticated animals in a mutually beneficial way is advised. This uses the principles of managed grazing and will also make farms more resilient to climate change. We cannot afford to go down the road of  sustainable intensification . Farming systems must work with nature and animals and not be reliant on false technological fixes that so often increase the suffering of animals. Animal welfare concerns in Africa are frequently complicated and connected to socio-economic, political, religious, and cultural aspects but as a previous host nation 11 years ago, South Africa knows the need for further transition and progress on the political issue of our time. Four Paws urges South Africa to take seriously the impact of livestock farming and the prevalence of meat consumption on the environment with regard to greenhouse gas emissions. We hope that the presence of Food4Climate pavilion at COP27 in Egypt will be the first step as a catalyst for change and will empower governments to pave the path for the transformation of their country\' s food systems. \</doc>

Lea is a three-year-old from Mexico who loves ladybirds. Siddhiksha, a six-year-old from India, has a passion for trees and wild animals. Rachelle is a 12-year-old Tanzanian who is wise beyond her years. They are smart and adorable and they are among the stars of a short film that is aiming to remind the leaders taking part in the COP27 UN Climate Conference that they have a duty of care towards young and future generations. "My biggest anguish is literally not knowing what the world is going to be like," says Cora, 13, from Brazil, in the film. "I'm afraid the world could suck, with a lot of species not being able to survive 50 years from now". Meera, a 15-year-old from Chennai, India, says she sees the effects of the climate crisis every day. "Lately, I've noticed that it's very hot in Chennai and there are many unseasonal floods in Bangalore. Parents for Future Global's demands for COP27 are that nations must agree to no new coal, oil and gas projects and to stop subsidising existing fossil-fuel projects and that they pledge to start paying for loss and damage "There are forest fires all over the world almost every day. "This is actually becoming scary and serious". "The aim was to create a film that the kids could identify with, using a kids' perspectives, making kids feel empowered and recognised," Sandra Freij, the photographer and filmmaker who directed and produced the short, told IPS. "We wanted to put kids' voices before the decision-makers at COP because their voices need to be heard and they have so much to say". Children from 16 different countries feature in the film, speaking about their dreams and fears for the future. Freij had the tough task of selecting them from contributions from almost 100 children sent in by parents from all over the world. "It was super important for us to make sure we did not put words into their mouths. When we invited them to speak about their dreams we encouraged them to speak about simple things like football or rainbows," she said. "I never imagined we'd receive messages of such a grown-up nature. "It was an emotional few months receiving message after message from kids that have connected the dots and who experience grief and fear about what the future holds". Our Kids' Climate and Parents For Future Global are among several groups of people who are channelling their concerns about the impact the climate crisis will have on their children into action to bring about positive change. Other groups include India's Warrior Moms, who focus on the need to fight air pollution, and Britain's Mothers Rise Up. The latter group hit the headlines in June when they staged a spectacular song-and-dance protest outside the headquarters of Lloyd's of London, inspired by the Let's Go Fly a Kite scene in Mary Poppins, to tell the insurance giant to stop underwriting the fossil-fuel projects that endanger our children's future. Parents For Future is a network of independent national groups from countries both in the Global South and North. The national and local groups take action that is most fitting to their contexts. Then these groups join forces at the global level. Among other things, Parents for Future Global has been working hard to support the campaign for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. What makes this cooperation between different national groups possible is the recognition by all involved that you cannot solve the climate crisis unless you tackle the injustices that cause it. And that means the countries of the Global North owning up to being largely to blame and taking action to remedy that via, among other things, loss-and-damage compensation. Parents for Future Global's demands for COP27 are that nations must agree to no new coal, oil and gas projects and to stop subsidising existing fossil-fuel projects and that they pledge to start paying for loss and damage. The actions of these determined parents have not gone unnoticed. "World leaders better watch out," Dr Maria Neira of the World Health Organization said at the launch of the #KidsFirst film at COP27 . "There is nothing worse or better than a mom fighting for the health of her children. "Now I have a lot of hope. This battle will be the one that we are going to win." \</doc>

COP27 is happening at the ultra-elite luxury island of Sharm-El Sheik, just 500km from the Great Pyramids and that massive lioness with the head of a Cleopatra. Nice. Now let\' s move to what\' s happening at the conference just across the peninsula and check out exactly what it is pursuing. Mother Earth used to have a great balance. It had a habit of cooling down during the night after an exhausting hot day and returning all that heat back to outer space. Everybody was very happy for billions of years, including penguins and polar bears. But man suddenly appeared and discovered oxygen, fire, motor cars, fridges and other appliances that emitted excessive amounts of the evil carbon dioxide. Up to now, no good wood is allowed to be imported from Mars. So our goody-goody trees had to go. They were doing their bit by consuming excess carbon dioxide and using it to make more trees, green beans and carrots. Even seasonal watermelon and nectarines. What then is this meeting all about? In between a grand spread of a buffet breakfast till 10am. Tea at 11.30am, lunch at 2pm, the closing of shop at 4.30pm (3pm on Fridays) and free weekends to fly \- fully paid \- to ride camels and gape at the olden-day assault on the atmosphere \- the hundred years building \- and plan for the awesome pyramids. In-between, some discussions will be seen to be done. And on the last day, a grim faced chairperson will sum up:  Yes, folks, things are really bad. The waters are really rising, far worse than Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner\' s days. We have got to do something. Just use less coal. Manufacture fewer petrol-driven cars.  More battery driven. These batteries don\' t need charging. They use solar power and windmills. Don\' t slaughter cows. Use their dung as fertiliser. Tell the wife to set the dinner table on the floor. No more chopping trees for oak furniture.  Stop using air conditioners forthwith. Use Harem girls waving palm leaves as fans. They are far sexier. The fans too. Have a safe journey home. All the best. Till next time. \</doc>

Wealthy Western nations facing an energy crunch are eyeing https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-11-08-cop27-sa-receives-an-extra-10-bn-to-shift-from-fossil-fuels/ natural gas in Africa at the expense of supporting green transition in poorer countries, climate activists at COP27 charge. European countries have been scrambling for alternative sources of gas after the continent's former top supplier, Russia, slashed exports in apparent retaliation for Western sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February. Gas-rich Norway has since overtaken Russia as a leading supplier, but Europe sees great potential in African fossil fuel reserves, including promising oil and gas discoveries in Senegal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Europe wants "to turn Africa into its gas station", Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa think tank, said at the United Nations climate summit in Egypt. "We don't have to follow the footsteps of the rich world that actually caused climate change in the first place." Exporting natural gas may bring short-term profits but exacerbate the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-change/ climate crisis and leave African nations worse off in the long run, activists, researchers and advocacy groups said. Research group Climate Action Tracker called the global dash for gas a "serious threat" to the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global warming well below 2\'baC, and preferably at 1.5\'baC compared to pre-industrial levels. \~'Stranded assets'\~ Some African leaders argued the potential benefits for people on the world's poorest continent outweighed the harm from the production and export of fossil fuels. COP27 . Germany, the European country most dependent on Russian supplies before the war, has been keen to tap Senegal's gas deposits. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, secretary general of the African Petroleum Producers' Organisation, argued the slight increase in the continent's marginal contribution to greenhouse gas emissions "would make a fundamental difference in whether people live or die". "We have 600 million people in Africa who don't have access to electricity at all. We have over 900 million people in Africa who do not have access to modern [forms] of energy for cooking or domestic heating," he said. "No progress can be made in any society without energy." But advocacy groups were not convinced Africa's poor would reap any benefits. "History shows us that ... extraction in African countries has not resulted in development," said Thuli Makama, African programme director at Oil Change International. Makama, a lawyer from eSwatini, said the Ukraine war would only trigger "short-term" demand from Western nations, leaving African countries with "stranded assets" - infrastructure that becomes obsolete as the world turns to renewables. Governments and companies would have invested in infrastructure only to be "left with stranded assets, clean-up expenses and all the devastation that comes with the industry for local people", Makama warned. A report released Monday by the Carbon Tracker Initiative think tank said Western investment in fossil fuels will eventually evaporate, encouraging African countries instead to seize on the potential offered by solar power. "The way to help us actually address our energy poverty challenge is for us to tap the incredible renewable energy potential that exists on the continent of Africa," Adow said. African nations could refuse any further extraction of fossil fuels and make the continent a "green leader", he added. But investment in renewable energy across the continent last year fell to its lowest level in 11 years, the research group BloombergNEF said last Wednesday. Out of the $434-billion invested worldwide in renewables in 2021, a meagre 0.6% went to projects in Africa, the report said. The Carbon Tracker Initiative report said the solar industry across Africa provided 14 gigawatts of power in 2021. It noted however that with production costs falling, solar power in Africa "has the potential to grow ... to over 400 gigawatts by 2050" - half of the continent's energy needs. - AFP The post HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-11-14-western-thirst-for-african-gas-raises-alarm-at-cop27/ Western thirst for African gas raises alarm at HYPERLINK COP27 appeared first on HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za The Mail & Guardian \</doc>

Developing nations have pinned the success of the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) underway in Egypt on the outcomes of talks on climate liability and reparations, officially regarded as "loss and damage". Off the back of accelerating global climate impacts and devastating floods in Pakistan and South Africa, vulnerable countries came to COP27 demanding a deal on loss and damage. There is no finance under the current UN framework to address loss and damage. Following COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland last year, broad agreement was reached among developing nations that COP27 in 2022 was the moment to resolve issues around loss and damage. Despite this, loss and damage was almost kicked to the curb entirely as an official agenda item for this year's COP during the "Glasgow Dialogues" that took place in June 2022 when parties convened in Bonn, Germany. Delaying, derailing and stalling loss and damage discussions has been a long-standing position by countries like the United States and the European Union who share the bulk of liability for present, past and future climate-related disasters. "The successful outcome of the loss and damage does have a strong bearing on the outcome and credibility of this COP. It is widely understood that mistrust between developed and developing nations are at an all-time high. Good progress on loss and damage would restore some of that trust if it is pushed out without tangible outcomes that mistrust is going to grow," said Brandon Abdinor, climate advocacy lawyer at the Centre for Environmental Rights (CER). Abdinor added that a poor outcome will cause developing countries to possibly use sound climate action as a bargaining chip. "We end up in a stalemate with the loser being sound climate response," he said.\~ Support the journalism that helps you navigate your world Subscribe to the M&G today for just R30 for the first three months to gain access to this story and all our best journalism, subscriber-only newsletters, events and a weekly cryptic crossword."

BADGER Climate change cognitive dissonance clouds COP27 BADGER While SA, emitter of less than 1% of total global greenhouse gases, is enjoying the COP27 limelight for a plan to reduce those emissions to zero by 2050, a new report shows that globally, the world added an additional SA last year alone. Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and cement have increased by 0.8% in 2022, hitting a new record high of 36.6-billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. The estimates come from the 2022 Global Carbon Budget report by the Global Carbon Project. The remaining carbon budget for keeping warming below 1.5\'b0C will be gone in nine years if emissions remain at current levels. So before we get too excited by our modest first steps as a country, given climate change is a problem for the global commons, we are still in serious trouble. All nations have to demonstrate intent and plans to reduce emissions in lockstep, captured in the nationally determined contributions. At last year's COP26, it was proposed that the nationally determined contributions be submitted annually as opposed to every five years, both to keep nations on track with their commitments and to increase the pressure to ratchet up commitments more frequently, given that action must be taken by 2030 to avoid the irreversible effects of climate change. As COP27 A recent survey by asset manager Ninety One found that while more than half of fund managers and asset owners surveyed say fighting climate change is one of their fund's strategic objectives, only 19% use transition finance to any extent, and fewer still are investing in transition-finance assets in emerging markets, the regions where emissions and populations are growing the fastest, and real-world impact is limited. With this colossal climate cognitive dissonance, no wonder most view these annual jamborees as COP-outs. The battle in the bushveld for outright control and ownership of Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBP) entered an intriguing new phase last week when Northam finally put its voluntary offer on the table almost a year since Impala's offer was tabled. The market had been questioning whether Northam could stump up the cash, but as CEO Paul Dunne told Business Times, "the R10bn is in the bank and has been confirmed independently by the [takeover regulation panel]". At R172.70 a share, the R10bn represents the maximum cash component of a cash and share structure that will require full cash settlement if 19.9% or less of RBP's issued capital is tendered and values RBP at R32bn. While some in the market may question this allocation of capital given the global environment of rising costs, potential global economic slowdown and platinum group metals (PGM) prices off recent cycle highs, if the PGM basket continues to be a key commodity in the global green energy transition, there may be years of buoyant PGM basket prices ahead. In a world where almost no new major sources of PGMs are coming on stream, you buy what you can when you can. Second, in a few years' time 50% of the processing of RBP's concentrates could be switched from Amplats to Northam, with obvious financial benefits to the latter. Additionally, Northam's technical input could add a few percentage points to RBP's concentrate recoveries. Incrementally, these two benefits could create material bottom line uplift to the respective operations. Finally, and probably less subtly, this deal may starve Implats' Rustenburg operations of oxygen. The Public Investment Corporation (PIC) is still the kingmaker here with its 10% shareholding in RBP. That is provided the Competition Tribunal, whose decision is imminent, rules in favour of Impala. I was on a panel with the PIC's Ken Wienand, discussing business rescue at the lavish Fancourt resort in George (without a hint of irony) last week, when Wienand reminded the audience that the PIC had a dual financial and social mandate. I reckon the PIC's decision is most likely to be based on additional factors above the offer considerations, particularly the sustainability of jobs at Impala and RBP. Despite Northam's commitment to investing in the RBP footprint and extending the royalty agreement, the majority of jobs likely at risk in future are within Impala. On life of mine and jobs preservation, the scales still seem to tip in favour of Impala. But given the deeper relationship and trust between the Bafokeng and Northam, balance is restored. The outcome of this bushveld brawl is entering the final rounds without a clear winner in sight, but with Northam now edging ahead on points with the latest offer.

COP 27 Until the final hours of the climate talks, it was uncertain whether the deal would be sealed, given behind the scenes diplomacy by the COP Presidency team. The G77/China was led by Pakistan, that wielded a strong moral voice at the conference, following the catastrophic and devastating floods which was attributed to climate change. It was a big win for loss and damage issues at Sharm el-Sheikh, to spotlight what was once seen as an 'orphan child' of the process, with usual priority given to mitigation (emissions reductions), while adaptation to climate impacts is treated as the 'step child'. However, there is nothing significantly meaningful on finance, given the overall stance of developed countries in the process, with the loss and damage fund remaining empty for now, with the hope that it will deliver more in the coming years when the fund is set up and is resourced. The Santiago Network on Loss and Damage (SNLD), which is to be a technical assistance facility for developing countries also was devoid of any financial commitments. The finance decisions adopted only exhorted developed countries to deliver on the USD 100 billion per year by 2020 pledges and to double adaptation funding. New pledges, totalling more than USD 230 million, were made to the Adaptation Fund at COP27 , a small sum given the scale of the needs in developing countries. An overarching alarm and agony of many developing countries at the Sharm el-Sheikh talks were the persistent efforts by developed countries to not own up to their historical responsibilities for past emissions, and to delete or dilute the foundational principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDRRC) between developed and developing countries under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. This attempt was repeatedly called out by developing countries, especially from the Like-minded developing countries (LMDC), the African Group, the Arab Group and ABU (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay). The effort to remove this differentiation was at the heart of the fight on many fronts, especially on the issue of mitigation and finance, which seemed like a repeat of negotiations in Paris. Developed countries continued their efforts at using terms such as 'major emitters', 'major economies', and the 'G20' in relation to who should show more ambition on mitigation, while in the discussion on finance, it was about "broadening the donor base". The retort from developing countries was that these issues were already settled under the Paris Agreement and that the principles and provisions of the Agreement should be respected and implemented. The climate talks which began on Sunday, 6 Nov, were supposed to end Friday, 18 Nov, but decisions were only gavelled early morning of Sunday, 20 Nov, when the official plenary began at 4 am. Delegates were visibly exhausted and bleary-eyed following long days and nights of negotiations which were particularly intense since Wed, 16 Nov. Apart from the loss and damage fund, other issues that were deadlocked during the week were the cover decisions (as to what they should contain), the mitigation work programme, the global goal on adaptation and matters related to finance. Among the sticky issues in relation to mitigation were on how the temperature goal of 1.5\'b0C should be reflected, how to advance efforts following the controversial paragraph adopted on the phase down of unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies from COP 26 decision in Glasgow, and the peaking of emissions by 2025. In order to avoid spats in public given the wide divergence between Parties in the full glare of the public and world media, the COP 27 Presidency team resorted to informal consultations and diplomatic efforts behind the scenes to find compromises on the difficult issues with draft texts which were reviewed by Parties. This was the reason for the delay in convening the final plenary, as Parties also wanted to gauge if they could live with the draft decisions, as they assessed the overall balance of the package of decisions among the key issues of mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and finance. COP 27 President Sameh Shoukry convened plenary and gavelled the adoption of the various decisions. Following the adoption of the decisions, he said that "despite the difficulties and challenges of our times, the divergence of views, level of ambition or apprehension, we remain committed to the fight against climate change... . and that as much as sceptics and pessimists thought that climate action will be taking a back seat on the global agenda, we rose to the occasion, upheld our responsibilities and undertook the important decisive political decisions that millions around the world expect from us." Minister Shoukry added that "We listened to the calls of anguish and despair resonating from one end of Pakistan to the other, a country with literally more than a third of its area flooded, a resounding alarm of the future that awaits us beyond 1.5 degrees. A bleak future... , a future that I do not wish for my grandchildren nor for any child on this planet." "Today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, we establish the first ever dedicated fund for loss and damage, a fund that has been so long in the making. It was only appropriate that this COP, the implementation COP in Africa, is where the fund is finally established." "Millions around the globe can now sense a glimmer of hope that their suffering will finally be addressed, swiftly and appropriately," he said further, adding that "We leave Sharm el-Sheikh with renewed hope in the future of our planet, with an even stronger collective will and more determination to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement." Among the significant decisions adopted are highlighted below. The cover decisions - Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan The cover decisions adopted under the COP (Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC) and CMA (Conference of Parties to the Paris Agreement) are referred to as the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan. The COP and CMA decisions are similar in many respects. Highlights of some of the main aspects of the decisions adopted under the CMA are as follows: The decision "Stresses that the increasingly complex and challenging global geopolitical situation and its impact on the energy, food and economic situations, as well as the additional challenges associated with the socioeconomic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, should not be used as a pretext for backtracking, backsliding or de-prioritizing climate action." It "Reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 \'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \'b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change;" and "Reiterates that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 \'b0C compared with 2 \'b0C7 and resolves to pursue further efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \'b0C". On enhancing ambition and implementation, the decision "Resolves to implement ambitious, just, equitable and inclusive transitions to low-emission and climate-resilient development in line with the principles and objectives of the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, taking into account this decision, the Glasgow Climate Pact (GCP) and other relevant decisions of the COP and the CMA." (The developed countries of late, have been mainly focussing on the GCP, and much less on the Paris Agreement and even less of the Convention. Some major developing countries have raised concerns that the GCP is being put at the same level as the Convention and the Paris Agreement.) On mitigation, the decision "Notes with serious concern the finding in the latest synthesis report on nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that the total global greenhouse gas emission (GHG) level in 2030, taking into account implementation of all latest NDCs, is estimated to be 0.3 per cent below the 2019 level, which is not in line with least-cost scenarios for keeping global temperature rise to 2 or 1.5 \'b0C" and "Emphasizes the urgent need for Parties to increase their efforts to collectively reduce emissions through accelerated action and implementation of domestic mitigation measures in accordance with Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement." (Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement states: "Each Party shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive NDCs that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.") The decision also "Calls upon Parties to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation and energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power and phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognizing the need for support towards a just transition." (This is a repeat of the decision from the GCP). A new and significant outcome on "pathways to just transition", where there is a decision to "establish a work programme on just transition for discussion of pathways to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement". It also decided "to convene, as part of the work programme on just transition, an annual high-level ministerial round table on just transition, beginning at its fifth session". On finance, the decision "Notes with concern the growing gap between the needs of developing country Parties, in particular those due to the increasing impacts of climate change and their increased indebtedness, and the support provided and mobilized for their efforts to implement their NDCs, highlighting that such needs are currently estimated at USD 5.8-5.9 trillion26 for the pre-2030 period." It also "Expresses serious concern that the goal of developed country Parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020... has not yet been met. The decision also "Calls on the shareholders of multilateral development banks (MDBs) and international financial institutions (IFIs) to reform MDB practices and priorities, align and scale up funding, ensure simplified access and mobilize climate finance from various sources and encourages MDBs to define a new vision and commensurate operational model, channels and instruments that are fit for the purpose of adequately addressing the global climate emergency... ". Loss and damage fund In a separate decision, Parties agreed to "establish new funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, in responding to loss and damage, including with a focus on addressing loss and damage by providing and assisting in mobilizing new and additional resources, and that these new arrangements complement and include sources, funds, processes and initiatives under and outside the Convention and the Paris Agreement." It was also decided "to establish a fund for responding to loss and damage whose mandate includes a focus on addressing loss and damage." Parties also agreed to "Establish a transitional committee on the operationalization of the new funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage. Mitigation work programme Parties decided "that the work programme shall be operationalized through focused exchanges of views, information and ideas, noting that the outcomes of the work programme will be non-prescriptive, non-punitive, facilitative, respectful of national sovereignty and national circumstances, take into account the nationally determined nature of NDCs and will not impose new targets or goals." (This was a grave concern to many developing countries). It was also decided "that the work programme shall function in a manner that is consistent with the procedures and timelines for communication of successive NDCs established in the Paris Agreement," and "that the scope of the work programme should be based on broad thematic areas relevant to urgently scaling up mitigation ambition and implementation in this critical decade...

The Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Barbara Creecy, has welcomed the decision to establish a fund on loss and damage to address the impacts of climate change. 'The key milestone agreed to at COP27 was on financial arrangements to address loss and damage due to climate change. COP27 agreed to set up a fund on loss and damage. It established a Transitional Committee to work on the modalities of this fund, with a view of taking a decision at COP28 in 2023,' Creecy said on Tuesday. The Minister was addressing a virtual media briefing on the outcomes of the recent United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Sharm el-Sheikh Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ). 'The COP27 outcomes reflect the urgency of the climate crisis, and the need to keep the 1.5-degree (Celsius) temperature target alive during what the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls the 'Critical Decade', including by providing a clear programme to advance the mitigation agenda from now to 2026. 'This agreement on a four-year work programme consists of at least two global dialogues, and a review at the end of the four years on whether to continue the programme (after 2026),' Creecy said. The Mitigation Work Programme will cover the IPCC 2006 key emissions sectors and the IPCC WG [Working Group] III report. There will be an annual decision by the Conference of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) for the four years. 'The agreed text in the all-important Cover Document frames the climate crisis and its solutions in terms of the sustainable development goals and Just Transitions, 'Leaving no one left behind', and the need for broader financial sector reform to achieve these. 'The call for multilateral consensus on making financial flows consistent with pathways towards low emissions and climate resilient development could open new investment opportunities in Africa for clean energy investments, critical for addressing energy poverty on the continent,' Creecy said. She said COP27 COP27 called on the shareholders of these institutions to take decisive action to scale-up climate finance in 2023 and make their institutional arrangements fit for purpose. 'There was also agreement amongst Parties to accelerate work on reducing vulnerability of societies due to climate change impacts. While we must acknowledge that from our national perspective, we did not see the advancement on actually operationalising the Global Goal on Adaptation we had been hoping for. In particular, South Africa had called for a target to increase the resilience of global population by 50% in 2030. 'We had also called for COP27 to establish a framework for the Global Goal on Adaptation, which contained high level indicators and targets to galvanise collective global action and support. 'Instead, the outcome focused more on workshops to build understanding in critical sectors such as health, poverty and livelihoods; terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; oceans and coasts; water resource management; food; cities and settlements; cultural heritage and mountain regions, and biodiversity,' the Minister said. South Africa will engage in these discussions with a view of setting up concrete targets and indicators that can help track progress on reducing vulnerability of the population. 'The Presidency's package on finance, in the context of the failure of developed countries to meet the USD 100 billion goal by 2020, provides incremental progress on moving forward to the establishment of the new collective goal in 2025, but falls short of action to meet developed countries obligations. ' COP27 COP27 also marked the fifth South African Pavilion (partnership between the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment and National Business Initiative), which showcased the collaboration between government and business in the fight against climate change. The South Africa Pavilion provided an excellent platform for business and government to showcase South Africa's efforts towards co-creating and implementing a Just Transition to net zero emissions by 2050. More than 50 events were hosted at the Pavilion during COP27 . - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

COP27 Since then, the Conference of the Parties has been hosted in a different country each year. These conferences broadly provide a platform for the negotiation of international climate change treaties. The very first treaty acknowledged that the responsibility for action was different for developed and developing countries, because developed countries were responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions. Despite some gains, commitment to these treaties has not translated into the action necessary to shift the course of global climate change. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that global average temperatures have already reached 1.1\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and that warming of over 1.5\'b0C is all but inevitable unless drastic action is taken. Everyone is affected by climate change, but some people and regions are more vulnerable than others. Regions that will experience the most adverse impacts of climate change are West, Central and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, Small Island Developing States and the Arctic. Populations living in informal settlements will have the worst of it. Vulnerability to climate change impacts is driven by socio-economic, political and environmental factors. African countries have already experienced loss and damage due to climate change. For example, food production, economic output and biodiversity have all declined and more people are at risk of dying due to climate change in African countries. COP27 is therefore important because that is where decisions are made about how to respond to climate change. Three international treaties have been adopted on international climate change co-operation. The first treaty was the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The second was the Kyoto Protocol, established in 1997. Countries made commitments to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. The third and most recent treaty was the 2015 Paris Agreement. It aims to limit the rise in temperatures to less than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels.. A key weakness of the Paris Agreement is that it is non-binding. Also, the commitments are self-determined. A recent study found that even if all countries did meet their commitments, it would not be enough to limit warming to below 2\'b0C. It is important to understand and engage in these processes as the impacts of climate change are increasing globally. The increase in the global average temperature is one of several climate impacts. Others include increased likelihood of droughts or floods, and increased intensity of storms and wildfires. The frequency of climate events will increase as temperatures rise. There is an urgent need for action to prevent global warming from rising above 2\'b0C. Temperatures over 2\'b0C will result in irreversible climate impacts such as sea level rise, and affect far more people than an increase of 1.5\'b0C. Responses to climate change There are three policy areas which have emerged to respond to climate change. The first is mitigation \- the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to stabilise the climate. The second is adaptation \- interventions which would support climate resilience and reduce vulnerability. The last policy area deals with loss and damage. Loss and damage refers to  the economic and non-economic damages associated with slow onset events and extreme weather events caused by global warming and the tools and institutions that identify and mitigate such risks . Many climate activists from the global south feel that if a financing facility for loss and damage is not discussed at COP27 , it will be a failed conference. | The Conversation Valodia is a Pro Vice-Chancellor: Climate, Sustainability and Inequality and Director Southern Centre for Inequality Studies at Wits.

Africa is counting on COP27 to deliver it from climate change. But will it? Global leaders from more than 125 countries gather in the resort city of Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for the 27th meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), from November 6-18, 2022. The UNFCCC is a global treaty mandating signatories to prevent "dangerous human-induced interference with the climate system by stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations". The Convention puts the responsibility of cutting dangerous carbon emissions on the shoulders of developed countries. The major carbon emission emitters are China, the European Union, the United States, Australia, Japan, India, and Russia. Africa contributes 3.8 percent of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuels and industry. However, it is experiencing significant impacts from climate change. From Angola to Zimbabwe, cyclones, floods, high temperatures, and droughts are killing and displacing millions of Africa as climate change upends a continent unable to cope with its devastating impacts. Dubbed the 'African COP', COP27 convenes in a changed world experiencing a combination of economic and political crises, including food and fuel crises. There are mixed expectations on how to save the world from a fiery Armageddon as climate change rises. For Africa, more is expected from COP27 than at any other time. The money and adaptation COP The African Group of Negotiators (AGN) says Africa is expecting to see the implementation of commitments made at COP26 for advancing the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and addressing the adverse climate change. "African countries have committed the most ambitious NDCs under the Paris Agreement now the priority should be how to implement these targets. And for these, developed countries should deliver on their climate finance pledges," Selam Kidane Abebe, Legal Advisor to the AGN, explained. Abebe contended that the special needs and special circumstances of Africa are a priority for the AGN, as the recognition was reflected under the UNFCCC decisions. Such recognition is also important as Africa contributes less of the total historical and current emissions, and climate change is impacting Africa's development trajectory, so even if African countries have strong development plans, their trajectory is going to be impacted by the adverse impacts of climate change," she said, noting that African countries were investing up to 9% of the GDP on adaptation, money that should be invested in development sectors. In 2009, developed countries committed to giving $100 billion annually until 2020 to help developing countries reduce emissions and cope with climate change. The money never came, and this target has been moved to 2023. Will it ever arrive? "We hope so because it is the responsibility of developed countries to come forward with it," Ambassador Wael Aboulmagd, Special Advisor to the COP27 President, told a media briefing in the buildup to COP27 last week. "In all reality $100 billion is not going to solve the problem; it is not even close to addressing a fraction of the climate needs... the numbers are in trillions. The overall financial landscape needs to be revisited," Aboulmagd noted, convinced that developed countries must be nudged to find a workable solution in climate finance. Loss and damage Finance is at the heart of the COP27 negotiations. Africa is anxious for a solution to the issue of loss and damage and is pushing for finance to address loss and damage as a result of global warming. At COP27 , the argument is that developed countries largely responsible for climate change should pay for the loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure, not to mention economic and cultural losses endured by developing countries that do not have the means to deal with the impacts of climate change. An argument has been toyed with is that why not allow African countries to raise their emissions levels and develop their economies as developed countries did in industrializing? In Egypt, Africa is hoping to get commitments towards a specific loss and damage facility. Developed countries are reluctant to pick up the tab. While countries have strengthened their commitments to tackle the climate crisis, climate change is not letting up. Floods in Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa, droughts in Kenya and Somalia, and food crises in the Horn of Africa have led to massive deaths and huge damage to homes and infrastructure that cannot be recovered. Who will pay for the climate damage? " COP27 COP27 ". According to scientists at the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), life would be threatened should global temperatures rise beyond 1.8C. The Paris Agreement pledges have meant to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. The COP Presidency is convinced a balanced approach that meets various interests is needed. Questions abound on what should be the arrangement for loss and damage, what kind of funding entity will be there, and who shoulders liability and compensation. "As the COP27 Hot energy finance Despite some countries developing new and revising their NDCs, to raise their emission reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement, switching to clean energy and phasing out coal has been slow. Rising fuel prices as a result of the Ukraine war have flipped the script. Some developed countries are increasing subsidies for fossil fuels, while others have fired up coal plants and natural gas lines to fill the energy gap. Even China has recently approved new coal mines. But should Africa - yearning to boost industrialization - abandon fossil fuel dependence and join the race for renewables? "The speed of this energy transition should not be the same for every country around the world, many African countries are languishing in extreme poverty, and they make the case that if we are being told to keep that resource underground for the global good then the international community has to come up with a package to allow us otherwise to eliminate poverty and pursue our sustainable development goals," opined Aboulmagd. He said while there is a global case for emissions reduction targets and transition to renewables, developing countries cannot just be told to quit fossil fuels without financial support to go green. A tailored approach for every country, depending on its circumstances, is called for. "It is essentially telling people to stop having energy; by the way, Sub-Saharan Africa has less than 20 percent access to energy in their entire population. We need to make sure that when we make a demand of a country it is a reasonable one that they can reasonably be expected to do without almost devastating their development objectives and poverty reduction elimination objective," he urged. Time for talking is over; action now A UN report released last week found that the world is off track in meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperatures below 1.5\'b0C by the end of the century. The Emissions Gap Report 2022 warns that the window is closing and that the world must cut carbon emissions by 45 percent to avoid global catastrophe because governments have failed to effect adequate cuts as pledged since COP26 in Glasgow. The report finds that, despite a decision by all countries at the 2021 climate summit in Glasgow, UK (COP26) to strengthen Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), action has been poor and ambition low that the world could be facing a temperature rise of above the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2\'b0C. The report shows that current policies alone will lead to a 2.8\'b0C temperature rise highlighting the gap between actions and promises. "Climate adaptation may not seem like a priority right now," says Inger Andersen, United Nations Environment Programme, Executive Director, opined. "Even if all commitments are implemented immediately, the reality is that climate change is going to be with us decades into the future. And the poorest keep paying the price for our inaction. It is, therefore, imperative that we put time, effort, resources, and planning into adaptation action." IPS UN Bureau Report Follow @IPSNewsUNBureau \</doc>

Following the recent release of the country\' s Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) Investment Plan, the JETP reached a milestone yesterday at the UN climate conference, COP27 , where France and Germany signed loan agreements that will see each nation extend R10.7 billion towards South Africa\' s de-carbonising efforts. The JETP was established at COP26 last year to signify a collaboration between South Africa and the International Partners Group (IPG) to fast-track the country\' s reduced reliance on coal through a Just Transition to cleaner energy sources. The two loan agreements form the first part of the R153bn pledged by the IPG and indicates that actual money will now begin to flow to South Africa \- though the R153bn pledge was just a snippet of the R1.5 trillion investment plan President Cyril Ramaphosa handed over to the IPG on Monday for the next five years. A dialogue on  Financing the Just Transition in South Africa was hosted by the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team and the Presidential Climate Commission yesterday at the South Africa pavilion, on the sidelines of COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. A moderated panel discussed how to ensure the money was allocated accordingly and accountably to meet South Africa\' s Just Transition needs. Daniel Mminele, head of the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team, said the loans would be provided by the French and German public development banks AFD and KfW, directly to the South African government via its National Treasury, and this money would likely flow early next year. However, the big push after COP, Mminele said, was for them to develop an implementation plan to track progress, ensure accountability and set up governance structures.  This is what we are going to do without delay in the first quarter of next year and have it finalised so that we can get to the real hard work, the actual implementation of the JETP, Mminele said. Lebogang Mulaisi, Cosatu head of policy and Presidential Climate Commission commissioner, said there was increasing anxiety about job displacement among people who worked in industries that relied on fossil fuels and the coal value chain. Mulaisi said they needed to address what these plans, deals and concepts meant in terms of bread and butter needs of the ordinary workers that relied on these sectors. \</doc>

As the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop27 United Nations HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop27 Climate Change Conference ( https://cop27.eg/#/ COP27 ) unfolds in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, realistic conversations about the implementation of South Africa's nationally determined contribution, a climate action plan to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts, is required.\~ South Africa has taken several steps to meet the nationally determined contributions (NCDs), such as funding for research, development and innovation programmes; finalising the Climate Change Bill; establishing the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team and adopting the Just Transition Framework and National Adaptation Strategy. In her HYPERLINK https://www.gov.za/speeches/opening-remarks-minister-forestry-fisheries-and-environment%C2%A0-ms-barbara-creecy%C2%A0-pre-cop27-3 opening remarks during the pre- COP27 negotiations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo last month, the forestry, fisheries and environment minister, Barbara Creecy, said that there had been a "failure by developed countries to meet their commitment of mobilising $100-billion by 2020". This pointed to the need for developed countries to contribute financing for a just transition and limit international finance that exacerbates Africa's indebtedness. Despite Africa's insignificant contribution to climate change, the continent is heavily affected in some regions because of multiple factors that include underdevelopment, low adaptive capacity, heavy dependence on climate-sensitive sectors and limited access to finance and technology.\~ Creecy rightfully highlighted that "we need everybody to show progress in the implementation of their nationally determined contributions and need new finances for our just transitions, including direct budget support for developing countries to build adaptation and resilience". This is important because African countries need substantial investment for climate change adaptation. Multilateral and international private-sector financing is crucial. But there is concern regarding how South Africa's NDCs and climate change interventions are disjointed from socioeconomic realities and how the calls for climate financing do not take into account South Africa's public finance corruption problems. It is one thing for the country to call for climate financing but it's another for developed countries and private sector financiers to contribute public financing if South Africa is not able to administer the money without misuse.\~ Last year, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana warned that rampant corruption was a persistent problem which was draining http://www.treasury.gov.za/documents/mtbps/2021/mtbps/FullMTBPS.pdf public finances . For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, corruption disrupted the advancement of key social and economic rights, such as education, the creation of employment, entrepreneurial pursuits and digital access.\~ Several cases of public procurement corruption are being investigated. For example, the Special Investigating Unit is looking into procurement irregularities worth R14.8-billion associated with Covid-19 spending from April 2020 to June last year.\~ South Africa is trying to combat corruption in various ways.\~ Among the steps taken are the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture which exposed institutional weaknesses; task teams have been set up in a number of provinces to deal with extortion and violence at construction sites; the Financial Intelligence Centre's Fusion Centre was established to act on fraud and corruption in the procurement of Covid-related goods and services; the HYPERLINK https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/202105/national-anti-corruption-strategy-2020-2030.pdf National Anti-Corruption Strategy HYPERLINK https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201901/42188gon63politicalpartyfundingact6of2019.pdf Political Party Funding Act Despite this, South Africa isn't doing enough to combat corruption in the public sector. Key regulatory and oversight agencies HYPERLINK https://pmg.org.za/committee-meeting/31632/ are underfunded and poorly led. This can have dire consequences, especially for the delivery of public services.\~ HYPERLINK https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/ejc-jpad-v55-n3-1-a11 The most vulnerable In addition, South Africa has made slow progress in recovering assets lost to state capture and corruption and in prosecuting those who are responsible for such corruption. This, in turn, affects the government's ability to redirect those funds for essential service delivery. Proper financial resourcing of public institutions which are tasked with anti-corruption work is vital to prevent public finance losses.\~ This will be important for tracking expenditure from multilateral and international private sector financing for climate adaptation and resilience.\~ An effective legal or regulatory instrument that creates an enabling environment to implement climate change and environmental sustainability programmes, while maintaining transparency and accountability in the management of the funds, is essential.\~ Incorporating programme implementation that involves direct financial management and accountability by multilateral institutions, civil society organisations and other countries' governments, through their embassies or consulates, is something to be considered by our government to build effective accountability systems.\~ For South Africa and other African countries, the conversation of climate financing must be accompanied by anti-corruption instruments being put in place to mitigate the appropriation of public funds from multilateral institutions and the international private sector.\~ As long as African countries fail to effectively tackle corruption, their calls for climate financing to be released for the purpose of climate adaptation and resilience may end up being ineffective.

With a violin on his back and maps in his bag, Dan Hodd left Spain a month ago and was cycling through busy Baghdad as he heads to the COP27 climate talks in Egypt that he firmly intends to reach without flying.  I am trying to illustrate the importance within the transport sector to do more about the climate crisis, the 29-year-old Briton said.  We need to consider the way we are travelling around the world, bouncing back and forth on budget holidays or for work trips. Hodd has cycled, taken trains, buses and shared taxis to reach Iraq en route to Jordan and eventually Sharm el-Sheikh where the climate talks take place from November 6.  In 2019, airlines were responsible for 2.4% of global CO2 emissions, said Dan Rutherford, who directs the International Council on Clean Transportation\' s aviation programmes, adding that because of the climate impact of aviation, its warming impact rises to 3.5%. After a drop during the coronavirus pandemic, air traffic is expected to bounce back to 2019 levels by 2024-25, he said. Avoiding flying is not only part of Hodd\' s message. His trip to Egypt is part of a long-term project to visit 100 countries in 10 years without flying, busking with his violin to earn enough to go on.  A lot of why I have been travelling this way is a bit a guilt that I knew this insatiable wanderlust would have me travelling around the world for a long time, Hodd said. | Reuters \</doc>

Nations around the world reached a historic breakthrough agreement at the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The agreement was to fund the loss and damage incurred during climate-related disasters which are largely linked to past emissions by a few of the world's most developed countries.\~ Loss and damage talks remained the most contentious item on the agenda at the meeting and delegates were given three proposals by different countries or negotiating blocs over the weekend. The decision was that a financial support structure on loss and damage for the most vulnerable must be set up by the next COP in 2023. Costs from extreme weather events are estimated to be HYPERLINK https://gsccnetwork-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2MANk5f8aDQW3M6WSPXMajHYGjHpsc6lP8Lk4CJHb-ALdd3qUhAF4tDka6xNZ7xfSiOON49nRQCkfm4pi3Ea9odnNEbIkeozcLqtAbS892avnyGrYTByHaA8pvDBF7HuiX7aCVxKZ8wlnSa3rdUvoawSlVZ3s9TUu8fGk-MQjqVBgYixWCbt7qttwlCj0qJ25Ot4oG_n9-i3bN_KiAmEFkM-QPkQgOOqslNe2Rni_MJgvwzwbK7dTFcvh7PZJG0eGPhGbNurhBuZfPyOuFMJotYEdvUVblRoFmbE8FPlULQYDU58n $200 billion annually.\~ Loss and damage funding was mostly provided by the G7's Global Shield programme, an insurance initiative for 20 of the world's most vulnerable nations. Finance also went to UN early-warning systems, with some commitments to the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/santiago-network/about#:~:text=The%20Santiago%20Network%20will%20connect,and%20addressing%20loss%20and%20damage.

This is a network that connects vulnerable developing countries with providers of technical assistance, knowledge and resources in relation to averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage due to rising temperatures.\~\~ COP president and Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said political decisiveness had been shown at COP27 , despite the differences between parties.\~ "It was only appropriate that this COP, the implementation COP in Africa, is where the fund is finally established. Millions around the globe can now sense a glimmer of hope that their suffering will finally be addressed swiftly and appropriately." A lack of trust Trust has been a major issue for the developing world as a result of failed financial promises in global climate diplomacy. Despite this, Shoukry pleaded with parties to realise their collective goals.\~ "Throughout this journey I came to better understand the climate challenge and to acknowledge the complexities and intricacies around it and to feel the agony and suffering. I came to realise that, despite the seemingly wide gaps in positions between parties at times, we are all here working for the same purpose in different ways. We need more trust, more empathy and more understanding - we all deserve this," he said.\~ The fund is among the most celebrated outcomes and a big step towards HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-11-17-cop27-will-be-a-failure-if-reparations-for-loss-and-damage-are-not-properly-addressed/ climate justice at HYPERLINK COP27 , which concluded HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-11-18-last-push-for-consensus-as-cop27-draws-to-a-close/ two days over schedul HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-11-18-last-push-for-consensus-as-cop27-draws-to-a-close/ e \~ HYPERLINK on Sunday morning after intense negotiations on the final declaration.\~ " COP27 Speaking during the closing plenary session just after 5am, Essop cautioned countries that failing to declare a phase-out of all fossil fuels would increase the burden of loss and damage. "While COP27 begins to address the consequences of the climate crisis, it fails to commit to phasing out all fossil fuels which are at the root of the climate crisis. More fossil fuel equals more losses and damages," she said.\~ "At the beginning of these talks, loss and damage was not even on the agenda and now we are making history. It just shows that this UN process can achieve results and that the world can recognise the plight of the vulnerable.\~ "It's worth noting that we have the fund - but we need money to make it worthwhile. What we have is an empty bucket. Now we need to fill it so that support can flow to the most impacted people who are suffering right now at the hands of the climate crisis," said Mohamed Adow, executive director at Power Shift Africa. Major gaps for preventing the worst or the money to adapt to it Climate adaptation is equipping people and the environment to deal with climate shocks. Finance for adaptation has thus far been wanting and countries are already due to agree on a new global goal on adaptation. This has been pushed to COP28 in Dubai 2023. Signatories to the 2015 Paris Agreement, that commits the world to limiting warming below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and to try to keep it below 1.5\'b0C, have largely failed on financial promises in most areas of climate action, including a $100 billion a year promise to help developing nations prepare for changing climate.\~ Some regions of the world are already HYPERLINK https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2865/a-degree-of-concern-why-global-temperatures-matter/ reaching 1.5\'b0C averages, while assessments have found that Africa is already 1.2\'b0C warmer and the impacts are showing.\~ The UN 2022 HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2022?gclid=Cj0KCQiA4OybBhCzARIsAIcfn9na_dJMGDAT8Jz41r_A4a5ERHbRBggYdnR7y7PYAW8vFLHOvpTJPZ4aAuSUEALw_wcB Adaptations Gap Report It found that international adaptation finance to developing countries had continued to rise, reaching $28.6 billion in 2020. This represents a 34% share of total climate finance to developing countries in 2020 and is a 4% increase from 2019. It said that combined adaptation and mitigation finance flows in 2020 fell at least $17 billion short of the $100 billion pledged to developing countries, even by climate finance providers' own accounting. Mitigation At the same time, mitigation, the act of limiting warming by stopping emissions, has shown little improvement in moving with science. Global emissions need to peak globally by 2025 to meet the 1.5\'b0C goal. This failed to manifest in the final cover text at COP27 .\~ The failure at COP27 to move on emissions occurred in a year when the world has experienced massive climate impacts, such as flooding in Pakistan, Nigeria and Australia, and drought in the US, which will mean support structures, such as the loss and damage fund, have to work even harder. The 1.5\'b0C goal was referred to in the deal but only to recognise it. Specific plans to actually achieve it were absent.\~ Sharma said a number of proposals about how to reach the goal were made at the beginning of COP27 but many failed to materialise.\~ "We joined with many parties to propose a number of measures that would have contributed to this. "Emissions peaking before 2025, as science tells us is necessary. Not in this text. Clear follow-through on the phase-down of coal. Not in this text. A clear commitment to phase out all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text, weakened, in the final minutes. "Friends, I said in Glasgow [COP26] that the pulse of 1.5\'b0C was weak. Unfortunately, it remains on life support and all of us need to look at ourselves in the mirror and consider if we have fully risen to that challenge over the past two weeks," he said.\~ Uneven climate change A key point scientists have made in HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/ major scientific assessments on the effects of warming is that the impacts of climate change haven't been spread evenly around our planet and they won't be in the future.\~ An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming shows that limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C is expected to significantly reduce the probability of heat stress, drought and risks related to water availability in some regions, particularly in the Mediterranean (including Southern Europe, Northern Africa and the Near East), and in Southern Africa, South America and Australia.\~ About 61 million more people in the world's urban areas would be exposed to severe drought in a 2\'b0C warmer world than at 1.5\'b0C warming. This is among the reasons the final outcome of the past two weeks of talks among countries is underwhelming for human and environmental rights advocates who witnessed world leaders fail again to commit to a complete phase-out of fossil fuels in order to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.

The climate and ecological arguments for moving away from fossil fuels are now overwhelming \- we have to wean our economies off this dependency to ensure the continuation of life. The planet has now warmed by 1.1\'b0C and is on track for an average increase of 3\'b0C. Despite pledges to halve emissions by 50% by 2030, we are heading for a 14% increase. Irreversible tipping points loom over our decisions. Natural systems are the basis of life on Earth, but one million species are threatened with imminent extinction, and the extinction rate is accelerating. Africa has retained its wilderness areas and diverse wildlife more than most places. These resources are of immense value and should not be given away to fossil fuel companies to destroy. Africa has the potential to become a leader and exporter in the renewable energy sector. The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) has reported that Africa\' s resource potential in wind, solar, hydro and geothermal energy is 1 000 times larger than its projected demand for electricity in 2040. The Irena also reports that central and southern Africa have abundant mineral resources essential to producing electric batteries, wind turbines, and other low-carbon technologies. And renewable energy costs are reduced. Africa can harness this vast potential. If Africa goes down the fossil fuel path now, it will be creating sunset industries with stranded assets and stranded jobs. The big emitters are responsible for enabling Africa to leap-frog fossil fuel technology and build renewable energy. The climate crisis is the incentive to do this, and Africa can leverage it. However, the global North pushing Africa to invest in renewable energy but continuing to invest in new sources of fossil fuels is in bad faith and causing confusion and loss of trust. It leads to conspiracy theories that rich countries want to deprive Africa of the benefits of fossil fuels while they carry on benefiting. COP27 must address this mistrust. Governments can address energy demand through instruments such as subsidies and carbon taxes. The fossil fuel industry attracts significant investments from grants that lower the fuel price. These subsidies also make it difficult for renewable energy to compete with fossil fuels. Making a portion of these subsidies available for renewables will enable a wider roll-out of the technology and make it more accessible. Similarly, the carbon tax has got to disincentivise present and future emissions. South Africa\' s current carbon price is insufficient to attract significant carbon reduction investments, representing a lost opportunity to generate climate finance through the fiscus. Rejecting fossil fuels is not turning away from development imperatives. It is turning towards development within planetary boundaries. Scientists have warned that 3\'b0C of warming will take us into ecological collapse and the breakdown of society. Movement-of-movements is a civil society coalition across the African continent calling for climate justice at COP27 . It released an open letter calling on parties at COP27 not to rescind their pledges for climate finance and support. We need a just transition, informed by the Paris Agreement\' s climate target of 1.5\'b0C and the African Common Position on Climate Change to address Africa\' s broader development objectives. Africa must drive this agenda at COP27 and not let fossil fuel companies create diversions that serve their interests.

Financing faster energy transition on continent set to be key issue at UN climate indaba Inside Africa's pitch for COP27 Seth OnyangoGreen financing, tech transfer and climate adaptation will top the list as African states work to present a unified front at the UN Climate Change Conference 2022 ( COP27 ) in Egypt. "Act now" will be Africa's clarion call as the continent intensifies calls for a just energy transition amid a worsening climate crisis. The action is likely to be seen more in the halls and offices of the world's financing institutions than on the ground, however, as Africa battles with how to finance its energy requirements. African envoys will press heavily polluting, rich economies to offset the continent's environmental damage from global warming with favourable financing packages. Africa accounts for a fraction of global emissions - at just under 4% - in contrast to China (23%), the US (19%) and Europe (13%). Studies show Africa is most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, with extreme weather such as drought and flooding already becoming commonplace on the continent. African governments want wealthier nations to make big investments in clean technology and infrastructure to support developing countries. Africa is keen to obtain green technology that can reduce costs and increase competitiveness in the clean energy sector. This includes deploying efficient tech to help drive down the cost of producing green hydrogen, wind power and solar energy. International non-profit Local Governments for Sustainability expects Africa to push for reliable financing to establish renewable energy pathways through just energy transitions in Egypt. Last month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revealed rich nations failed to keep a US$100bn (R1.7-trillion)-a-year pledge to developing nations to help them achieve their climate goals. But commentators - particularly those focused on the fossil fuel industry, which has experienced disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine - are beginning to cast aspersions on the commitment of developed economies in light of the geopolitical environment. "Going forward, the Ukrainian crisis will structurally push the world into a new phase of geopolitics that is likely to downgrade spirit and unity of purpose in global climate goals implementation," Petroleum Focus Consultants director George Wachira wrote. On the flip side, the EU is likely to accelerate investments into green energy - with Africa viewed as part of the solution - to wean itself from dependence on Russian gas. This could unlock an avalanche of finances for renewables projects the world over, especially in Africa, which boasts some of the biggest potential. But African states are not coming from a position of weakness - their policy decisions would either sabotage or reinforce global climate change-mitigation efforts. University of Nairobi economist and senior lecturer in economics Samuel Nyandemo argues that Africa's leverage is its fossil fuel energy production which, if scaled, would add to the damage being done to an already fragile climate. Given Africa's rapid urbanisation rate, plans for cities to adapt and urbanise sustainably can also be expected to be among the priorities of COP27 . On July 15, the 41st Ordinary Session of the Executive Council adopted the African Common Position on Energy Access and Just Transition, a comprehensive approach that charts Africa's short, medium, and long-term energy development pathways to accelerate universal energy access and transition without compromising its development imperatives. It stipulates that Africa will continue to deploy all forms of its abundant energy resources, including renewable and non-renewable energy, to address energy demand. "This is an important step forward towards ensuring and confirming Africa's right for a differentiated path towards the goal of universal access to energy, ensuring energy security for our continent and strengthening its resilience, while at the same time acting responsibly towards our planet by improving the energy mix," the AU's commissioner for infrastructure and energy, Dr Amani Abou-Zeid, said. She said it was a timely measure to push for favourable outcomes and tangible investments in energy and infrastructure at COP27 . According to Time magazine, Africa's pitch at the UN summit could further include "moving from high-carbon energy sources like oil and gas to renewables, and 'carbon credit' schemes, where foreign governments and companies pay for tree planting in exchange for producing greenhouse gases". The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the vast majority of African nationally determined contributions contained mitigation and adaptation targets that were conditional on receiving international financial and other support. The contributions are self-determined emissions targets each country is required to submit as part of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate. "In aggregate to date, 48 African countries have requested over $1.2-trillion (R20.45-trillion) of international financial support by 2030 to implement their [contributions]. "Six countries - Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia and SA - account for about 60% of the finance requested to implement [their contributions]." - Bird Story Agency \</doc>

African nations rich in energy but otherwise underdeveloped must secure a right to growth and power at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt in November, senior officials from across the continent said this week. - Rich nations must not let concerns over emissions causing climate change hinder energy projects, including fossil fuels, energy leaders told the African Energy Forum in Brussels. For many, the sanctions and reduced flows from Russia that have sent European countries scrambling to shore up their energy supplies from elsewhere is a boon, as the energy crunch drives up inflation and stokes recession fears. "All the arguments we heard at COP26 are not the same anymore," Cheikh Niane, vice petroleum minister of emerging gas power Senegal told Reuters. "At COP27 we are expecting the G7 and all developed countries to consider in the energy transition letting African countries develop gas which finances electricity for our citizens and helps industrialise our countries." Nearly 200 countries at last year's summit in Glasgow, Scotland, agreed to strengthen climate pledges. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/647/229014.html :EMBED--> Untapped oil and gas potential But for Osvaldo Abreu, minister of infrastructure and natural resources of Sao Tome and Principe, his attendance left him dreading his poor island nation would never see revenues from untapped oil and gas prospects. "What we're asking from the big economies is to look at our conditions: we would be prepared in the final case to stop exploration if we got the minimum financial support we need," Abreu told Reuters. Wealthy nations disappointed many in Glasgow by saying they would not deliver the $100bn per year promised from 2020 until 2023 to help developing countries with their energy transition and with adapting to a warming world. "We need this oil ... and what we need is for them to keep their promises, because we have seen nothing so far," he added. Egypt, a natural gas exporter, takes over the presidency of the UN climate talks from Britain and hosts the COP27 summit, 7-18 November summit in Sharm el-Sheikh. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/228604.html :EMBED--> COP27 to be a 'different flavour' "The COP27 session is going to be a different flavour," said Ayman Soliman, CEO of the Sovereign Fund of Egypt, adding the conference will focus on agreements to finance fuel and power projects especially climate-friendly ones like its plan to ramp up green ammonia for shipping in the Suez Canal.

COALGermany still stands by Africa in fighting climate crisis before COP27 Russia's war is not taking EU powerhouse back to fossil fuels, it is pursuing a greener future faster than beforeAs the world gathers at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt for COP27 , we are facing a dual challenge. The climate crisis is hitting with ever-greater force. All of this shows the climate crisis is the biggest security challenge humanity faces in the 21st century - and taking action is more urgent than before. Meanwhile, Russia's war against Ukraine has been eroding the international trust needed for successful global climate action. President Vladimir Putin's war is not only inflicting unspeakable suffering on Ukraine, but is also trampling the UN Charter underfoot. It has shaken global energy markets and fuelled a hunger crisis, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. Putin's aggression has taken geopolitical polarisation to heights not seen since the Cold War. As the German delegation heads to COP27 , we are keenly aware of this tough environment. We know this will be a particularly difficult climate conference. Still, as Germany and with our EU partners, we will do all we can to advance climate action. TIME Now is the time for ambitious emissions cutting by all countries to stay on the 1.5 \'b0C path. Now is the moment to show solidarity with the children, women and men hit hardest by storms and droughts. As a major economy and emitter, we know Germany has particular responsibilities. When entering office last year, our government set out ambitious energy transition plans. Now, in response to Russia's weaponisation of energy, we are taking painful steps that seem to contradict those plans. Many people from Africa, the Middle East and Asia are asking us, "Now that Russia's war rages in Europe, has Germany cancelled its energy transition and its promises on solidarity?" Our answer is clear - and it is also our message for COP27 : Germany is not deviating one inch from its climate goals. On the contrary, we are doubling down on them. Yes, we are taking tough decisions to get Germany and Europe through this and next winter. But the coal-fired power plants we have reactivated will run only until until March 2024. New permanent pipelines we are building to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) are required by law to be hydrogen-ready. And in the EU, we have committed to cutting gas consumption by 15% this winter - not least to push global LNG prices down. Most importantly, our government has boosted Germany's energy transition. In July, the Bundestag passed the most ambitious legislation yet to expand renewables and energy efficiency. In the first half of 2022, the share of renewables in our electricity mix rose to almost 50% - and with the new legislation, it will climb to 80% by 2030. The EU, after the Green Deal and the Fit-for-55 agenda, presented one of the strongest climate packages in its history in June - with stricter rules for renewables, energy efficiency and carbon dioxide pricing. All this is making it clear that Russia's war is not leading us back to a fossil fuels past. Instead, we are moving towards a greener future faster than before. Every solar panel and every wind turbine means more security: for our country and Europe, since they make us less dependent on fossil energy imports. Similarly for the world, as every tenth of a degree less global warming means the effects of climate change globally are lessened. Germany is also stepping up global climate solidarity. By increasing our contribution to international climate financing to \€ 6bn, we are doing our part to ensure that industrialised countries finally live up to their $100bn pledge. The Group of Seven (G7) most economically advanced countries are committed to doubling adaptation financing by 2025. And we will work hard to achieve progress on loss and damage at COP27 . With the Global Shield, the G7 is reaching out to vulnerable countries to expand disaster risk financing and insurance. From the Pacific to South Asia to the Sahel, rising sea levels, scorching heat and terrible floods are a threat to people's safety and security. We hear you and we see you - and we stand by your side. Germany is doing this also through its new climate diplomacy. The technologies for the global energy transition are out there. Now we have to transfer them to countries in the south - and mobilise financing away from fossils to renewables. Germany, its partners and SA are setting up a just energy transition partnership. Together we are investing billions in renewables - and in ensuring that communities dependent on coal mining get new opportunities to make a living. The G7 is working on more such partnerships with other countries: Senegal, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. Not only to help them protect the climate, but to transform their entire economies. It is important to keep these opportunities of the green transition in mind as we meet in Sharm el-Sheikh this week. The dual challenge of ever harsher climate effects and geopolitical tensions will make negotiations hard, and their outcome is unclear.

During COP26, the world witnessed the launch of the global sustainability standard-setter, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). To meet the demand from international stakeholders, the objective of the ISSB is to provide sustainability-related information that will enable investors to make better economic and investment decisions. At COP27 A key consideration in the adoption of the climate standard is capacity building to ensure successful implementation. The specific needs and circumstances of emerging and developing economies as well as smaller entities, many of which operate within global value chains, are being deliberated on and addressed.Whilst some countries have announced plans to adopt the ISSB climate disclosure standard and make this applicable for companies within their jurisdictions, the world awaits the first global disclosure standard on climate which is expected to be published in early 2023.More information on these developments can be found on HYPERLINK http://www.saica.org.za www.saica.org.za \</doc>

They were on the brink of shipwreck and did not leave happy, but did feel satisfied that they got the best they could. The countries of the global South achieved something decisive at COP27 : the creation of a special fund to address the damage and loss caused by climate change in the most vulnerable nations. The fund, according to the Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan, the official document approved at dawn on Sunday Nov. 20 in this Egyptian city, should enable "rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction" following extreme weather events in these vulnerable countries. Decisions on who will provide the money, which countries will benefit and how it will be disbursed were left pending for a special committee to define. But the fund was approved despite the fact that the issue was not even on the official agenda of the summit negotiations, although it was at the center of the public debate before the conference itself. "We are satisfied that the developed countries have accepted the need to create the Fund. Of course, there is much to discuss for implementation, but it was difficult to ask for more at this COP," Ulises Lovera, Paraguay's climate change director, told IPS, weary from a longer-than-expected negotiation, early Sunday morning at the Sharm El Sheikh airport. "This COP has taken an important step towards justice. I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period," said U.N. Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres. He also described as an achievement that a "red line" was not crossed, that would take the rise in global temperature above the 1.5-degree limit. More than 35,000 people from nearly 200 countries participated in the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) on Climate Change in Sharm El Sheikh, an Egyptian seaside resort on the Red Sea, where the critical dimension of global warming in the different regions of the world was on display, sometimes dramatically. Practically everything that has to do with the future of the modes of production and life of humanity - starting with energy and food - was discussed at a mega-event that far exceeded the official delegations of the countries and the great leaders present, such as U.S. President Joe Biden and the Brazilian president-elect, Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva. Hundreds of social organizations, international agencies and private sector stakeholders came here to showcase their work, seek funding, forge alliances, try to influence negotiations, defend their interests or simply be on a stage that seemed to provide a space for all kinds of initiatives and businesses. At the gigantic Sharm El Sheikh International Convention Center there was also a global fair with non-stop activities from morning to night in the various pavilions, in stands with auditoriums of between 20 and 200 seats, where there was a flurried program of presentations, lectures and debates, not to mention the more or less crowded demonstrations of activists outside the venue. In addition, government delegates negotiated on the crux of the summit: how to move forward with the implementation of the Paris Agreement, which at COP21 in 2015 set global climate change mitigation and adaptation targets. On the brink of failure Once again, the nine-page Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan did not include in any of its pages a reference to the need to abandon fossil fuels, but only coal. But in the end, the goal of limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, established in the Paris Agreement, was maintained, although several countries tried to make it more flexible up to 2.0 degrees, which would have been a setback with dramatic effects for the planet and humanity, according to experts and climate activists. "Rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions (are) required - lowering global net greenhouse gas emissions by 43 percent by 2030 relative to the 2019 level - to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C target," reads the text, although no mention is made of oil and gas, the fossil fuels most responsible for those emissions, in one of the usual COP compromises, since agreements are reached by consensus. The priorities of the South Developing countries, however, focused throughout the COP on the Loss and Damage Fund and other financing mechanisms to address the impacts of rising temperatures and mitigation actions. "We need financing because we cannot deal with the environmental crisis alone. That is why we are asking that, in order to solve the problem they have caused, the rich nations take responsibility," Diego Pacheco, head of the Bolivian delegation to Sharm El Sheikh, told IPS. Environmental organizations, which showed their power in Egypt with the presence of thousands of activists, also lobbied throughout COP27 for greater commitments, including mitigation actions. "This conference cannot be considered an implementation conference because there is no implementation without phasing out all fossil fuels," the main cause of the climate crisis, said Zeina Khalil Hajj of the international environmental organization 350.org. "Together for implementation" was precisely the slogan of COP27 , calling for a shift from commitments to action. The crises that came together Humanity - as recognized by the States Parties in the final document - is living through a dramatic time. It faces a number of overlapping crises: food, energy, geopolitical, financial and economic, combined with more frequent natural disasters due to climate change. And developing nations are hit especially hard. The demand for financing voiced by countries of the global South thus takes on greater relevance. Cecilia Nicolini, Argentina's climate change secretary, told IPS that it is the industrialized countries, because of their greater responsibility for climate change, that should finance developing countries, and lamented that "the problem is that the rules are made by the powerful." However, 80 percent of the money now being spent worldwide on climate change action is invested in the developed world, according to the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the world's largest funder of climate action, which has contributed 121 billion dollars to 163 countries over the past 30 years, according to its own figures. In this context, the issue of Loss and Damage goes one step further than adaptation to climate change, because it involves reparations for the specific impacts of climate change that have already occurred, such as destruction caused by droughts, floods or forest fires. "Those who are bearing the burden of climate change are the most vulnerable households and communities. That is why the Loss and Damage Fund must be established without delay, with new funds coming from developed countries," said Javier Canal Alb\'e1n, Colombia's vice minister of environmental land planning. "It is a moral and climate justice imperative," added Canal Alb\'e1n, who spoke at a press conference on behalf of AILAC, a negotiating bloc that brings together several Latin American and Caribbean countries. The financing needs of these countries for climate action until 2030 were estimated at 5.6 trillion dollars, but developed countries - as the document recognized - have not even fulfilled their commitment to provide 100 billion dollars per year, committed since 2009, at COP15 in Copenhagen, and ratified in 2015, at COP21 which adopted the Paris Agreement. It was the absence of any reference to the need to accelerate the move away from oil and natural gas that frustrated several of the leaders at the COP. "We believe that if we don't phase out fossil fuels there will be no Fund that can pay for the loss and damage caused by climate change," Susana Muhamad, Colombia's environment minister, who was at the two-week conference in Sharm El Sheikh held Nov. 6-20, told IPS. "We have to put the victims first in order to make an orderly and just transition," she said, expressing the sentiments of the governments and societies of the South at COP27 .

The countdown to the UN Climate Summit COP27 , which will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to November 18, has begun. This summit has drawn the attention of world leaders, high-ranking United Nations officials, and thousands of environmental activists worldwide. The COP27 About 90 heads of state have confirmed their attendance at the COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, according to the special representative of the Egyptian presidency. Amr Abdel-Aziz, Director of Mitigation at Egypt's Ministry of Environment, noted that the central theme for COP27 is implementation. "We hope to demonstrate what that looks like in terms of mitigation and adaptation. If the summit can address the topic of implementation in all of its discussions, it will be a sign of its success," Abdel-Aziz said. The primary objective of COP27 is to achieve positive results in terms of emissions reduction; on the agenda is also a discussion of financing losses and damage. "We also intend to advance the agenda to double climate adaptation financing by 2025 and reach an agreement on the unfulfilled $100 billion financial pledge from developed countries," Abdel-Aziz told IPS. The overarching goal is to strike a balance between all parties' interests. The mitigation program, for example, is primarily driven by developed countries and small island developing states, which are currently experiencing severe climate change impacts. On the other hand, emerging markets are principally accountable for adjustments, losses, and damages. "Our goal is to achieve a balanced result that meets all of these goals and objectives," he continued "We wanted to cover as much of Egypt's total emissions as possible," Abdel-Aziz explains, "So we focused on three sectors: energy, oil and gas, and transportation. We also chose the industries that are most likely to reduce emissions." Abdel-Aziz says he is optimistic about meeting the goals, especially in the transport sector, which could even exceed the goals as there has been significant progress including in the area of "transportation electrification and other forms of sustainable mobility." The summit's top priorities are to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals and progress in the fight against climate change. According to scientific research, limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C by 2030 requires cutting emissions in half. "Climate finance must be available for this to occur," COY 17 Programme Leader Hossam Imam told IPS. COY17 is an annual event organized by YOUNGO, the Official Youth Constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This year's event will take place on the sidelines of the 27th Party Summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt ( COP27 ). "The impact of climate change on indigenous peoples and coastal city dwellers who face flooding is one of the most pressing issues to be addressed in COY 17," Imam said. Environmental activist Ahmed Fathy told IPS that the most significant obstacle to developing countries achieving their climate goals is a "lack of adequate and adequate financing from developed countries. And, despite years of neglect, adaptation financing remains a top priority for developing countries. Without it, developing countries cannot combat and mitigate the effects of climate change." The Nile Valley and Delta, where about 95% of Egypt's population resides, make up only 4% of the country's natural area. Climate change is predicted to put pressure on these areas, particularly the Nile, and the region could experience more frequent droughts. "Egypt is also one of the few nations that actually struggle with water scarcity," Fathy added. "Since the world faces several economic issues in addition to the energy crisis, we expect that the conference will produce workable proposals," said Fathy, the founder of the 'Youth Love Egypt Association,' involved in organizing the COY17 conference and the promotion of the COP27 . "We expect the summit to produce a workable charter and to be COP for actions rather than COP for pledges." IPS UN Bureau Report Follow @IPSNewsUNBureau \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa says the time has come for the African continent to integrate and work more closely together. The President was speaking at the Kenya-South Africa Business Forum held on Wednesday evening in the East African country where he is on an official state visit. 'For us to surge forward, to address the issue of integration, it is about time that indeed Africa is more integrated. When we look at other continents, especially Europe, their inter trade is up to 70% and ours is a paltry less than 20%. 'When you go into the markets that we have...I often begin looking where these goods are made. And I get appalled when I realise that goods which we could have made ourselves on the continent are imported from other environments in the world,' he said. The President cited the COVID-19 pandemic and how the African continent worked together as an example of how integration can be achieved. 'As the world was gripped by this massive pandemic, as a continent we were able to distinguish ourselves in the manner in which we approached and addressed COVID-19. We were the only continent that during this horrific pandemic, were able to unite and to act as a continent in an integrated manner. 'Right at the outset of the pandemic...we developed an African strategy of how to address and to approach COVID-19. No other continent that I know of...was able to develop as good a strategy as we did and that spoke to our integration. 'That to me showed us that working together...we are able to achieve enormous feats. If we work together, we are able to achieve much more than what we imagine,' he said. President Ramaphosa also cited Africa's collective approach to deliberations at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) held in Egypt recently. 'As Africa and as African leaders, we...collectively called upon the more developed economy countries to honour their commitments. At COP21 in Paris, they made a commitment that they would be...making available $100 billion per year [to address climate change], they have not met those commitments. 'Collectively...one message, several voices, we said we want them to address the loss and the damage that our countries are suffering from. Once again, Africa is showing a great deal of integration of thought, effort and articulation,' he said. President Ramaphosa reflected that the African continent continues to bear the brunt of climate change. 'We are hardly responsible as a continent, for the damage that has been done and continues to be done to the climate and we therefore want [developed economies] to pay up. It is about time that the money is brought to Africa to enable us to address the damage they have caused to our climate,' he said. Kenya-South Africa trade The President reflected that for more trade to occur between South Africa and Kenya, issues that 'hold us back' must be addressed. 'What's holding us back seems to be fear. Fear of the unknown. Where we almost fear our own shadows. Today we were able to announce that there should be visa free travel...[for] Kenyans going to South Africa. 'The other thing that holds us back is bureaucracy and regulatory environment. [South Africa and Kenya] have already identified to unlock the way we deal with each other and unlock unnecessary bureaucracy, red tape and regulatory unnecessary strictures,' he said. He told the business forum that ministers from both countries are already working on ways to reduce the red tape. 'The opportunities are enormous. Opportunities that straddle between the private sector as well as the public sector. Opening up the Kenyan market for both our private sector and state owned enterprises. 'Similarly...we want to open up also South Africa's market for [Kenya's] goods and services and indeed for [Kenyan] public sector companies that can come to do business,' he said. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

South Africa, France and Germany have signed loan agreements for the two European nations to each extend pound 300 million in concessional financing to South Africa to support the country's efforts to reduce its reliance on coal through a just transition to cleaner energy sources. This was on Wednesday confirmed by National Treasury. In a statement, Treasury said the French and German public development banks, AFD and KfW, have provided the loans directly to the South African government via National Treasury. The financing agreements were acknowledged and welcomed by President Cyril Ramaphosa, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Olaf Scholz, the Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, at a ceremony held during the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), currently taking place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Treasury said the signing represents a significant milestone in the implementation of the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) announced at COP26 in November last year. 'The JETP is a long-term partnership between South Africa, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, United States, and the European Union. The first initiative of its kind, the JETP aspires to support South Africa in accelerating its journey to a low-carbon economy and climate-resilient society,' said Treasury. Last year, the founding partners of the JETP, known as the International Partners Group (IPG), pledged to mobilise an initial amount of $8.5 billion over the next three to five years to advance the partnership. South Africa continues to be dependent on coal to produce most of its electricity and the coal sector remains significant to the country's national economy and the livelihood of several communities. 'One year ago, French President Emmanuel Macron pledged that France was ready to commit significant support for South Africa's ambitious decarbonisation project for a just energy transition. We are now putting those words into action with this important loan,' said Arnaud Roux, Charg\'e9 d£ffaires of the French Embassy. Audrey Rojkoff, AFD Regional Director for Southern Africa and Country Director for South Africa, said most countries around the world are trying to find a balance between the inevitable short-term trade-offs and the long-term perspective of a future, where nature and people prosper. 'All partners can make better progress by sharing their experiences and international institutions have an important role to play by encouraging dialogue. This first public policy loan to South Africa aims precisely at promoting policy dialogue between our countries.' She indicated that along with dialogue and knowledge-sharing with other countries, continued research will also be essential to fully understand potential climate risks and their impact on South Africa's financial system. As such, the AFD loan will be accompanied by grant financings from France to support several key South African actors involved in the production of knowledge and further policy development related to the JET. "We expressly welcome South Africa's commitment to reducing electricity generation from environmentally harmful coal," said Silke Stadtmann, KfW Development Bank's Country Director for South Africa. She said the development was an important step in achieving the country's climate goals. 'As a long-term partner of South Africa, we support these efforts not only with concessional loans for necessary investments and grants for a Just Energy Transition, but also with comprehensive studies on energy sector reform.' Ismail Momoniat, acting National Treasury Director-General, said the South African government welcomes concessional funding. 'While South Africa still requires more support for its Just Transition path, considering the scale of the required transition in the context of the current socio-economic challenges of high unemployment, high level of poverty and inequality, this funding will assist in addressing the challenge of financing the critical adaptation and mitigation programmes and supporting a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive growth,' Momoniat said. The funding will also provide the much-needed catalytic funding for the implementation of the Just Energy Transition investments plan in mapping out a just transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient economy and society. These loans are concessional and contribute to government's efforts to mitigate rising government debt costs. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

The venue of the 27th United Nations Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) on Climate Change, held in the ultra-luxury Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh, points to at least half of what is wrong with such elite junkets.\~ As expected, COP27 This, essentially, is the problem with elite conferencing as the primary tool to address the problems caused by the behaviour of the elites themselves.\~\~ As the elites of national governments, business and civil society fly around the world to debate "The Climate Crisis", it remains women in rural and peri-urban areas, who play key roles as food producers and caregivers, that ultimately face the reality of this crisis.\~ Many depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, so extreme climate-related droughts, flooding and other disasters disproportionately affect women's health, food security and livelihoods. In places where mining and extractive industries produce greenhouse gases and associated chemicals that cause severe environmental problems, women often bear an unequal share of the social, economic and environmental risk.\~ Contamination of farmland destroys their livelihoods and forces many women into dependent relationships, which exacerbate the pandemic of gender-based violence and femicide. Mining pollution also threatens women's reproductive health, resulting in higher rates of miscarriage and children born with abnormalities.\~ Emerging from all these underlying social pathologies is the realisation that the climate crisis is a direct consequence of the capitalist political economy, which produces at least four types of externalisation of costs, in a process which socialises the costs of doing business but privatises the profits. The costs to society take the form of extraction of surpluses, both economic and thermodynamic, as:\~ 1) A social debt to dispossessed host communities; 2) A social debt to inadequately paid workers; 2) A social debt to women family caregivers; and\~ Proceeding from the understanding that we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them, it is reasonable to suggest that addressing these problems requires a new paradigm in which we toss out the flawed bias towards economic imperatives of privatised profits and socialising of costs in the ways we assess costs and benefits.\~ The climate debate should then at the very least lay a foundation to catalyse a genuine just transformation of financing, extraction, production, transport and distribution, consumption, and disposal systems. The issue of climate change is integrally linked to democracy. The link between nature and society manifests through the ways in which large corporations in the minerals and energy sector have historically shaped (and continue to shape) the politics and economics of modern South Africa. The extraction of surplus value from exploration, mining, processing, distributing, subsidising and consuming of energy is often prioritised above the interests of marginalised people, leaving a legacy of destruction and poverty wherever these activities are carried out.\~\~ The interests of large corporations are used to shape legislation that dictates the way in which we live, the way in which we are governed and the way in which we organise our economy, including the way we produce and consume. An approach to the climate crisis that does not seek to reshape the way that societal priorities are identified and developed will inevitably lead to a continuation of the same patterns of extracting surplus value, which has devastated the planet and subjected millions to poverty. A critical focus of our plans to address the climate crisis in a just and equitable way must ensure that global priorities and local realities are able to participate in dialogues that recognises the importance of each. Decisions taken at the local level have a significant contribution to make towards the resolution of the global crisis. But by the same token, decisions that are taken at a global level have consequences at the local level. Informing, educating and working with people who are both marginalised and directly affected by climate change, are critical to addressing the egregious structural violence that continues to legitimise patterns of disadvantage, such as racial and gender inequality. Despite the high-level hoopla about broad discussions on the Climate Change Bill and plans for renewable energy projects, the reality is that the process is still essentially an elitist one, which is biased towards private business interests and has failed to produce a different set of economic metrics through which the current crisis response could contribute towards a more just society. Instead, it is clear that what is on offer now is deeply corrupted by the same old paradigms that, in South Africa, produced the most unequal society in the world.\~ The views expressed are those of the author and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Mail & Guardian.

At a time when sustainable farming approaches such as agroecology have been removed from the text at ongoing global climate negotiation ( COP27 ) taking place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, activists are urging African governments to explore new steps to integrate agriculture into the UN climate agreement. According to the most recent assessment of climate impacts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), loss and damage can broadly be split into two categories: economic losses involving "income and physical assets"; and non-economic losses, which include - but are not limited to - "mortality, mobility and mental wellbeing losses". In the agriculture sector, estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) indicate that despite overall gains in food production and food security on a global scale, many countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, have failed to make progress in recent decades. According to UN experts, the region produces less food per person today than it did three decades ago, and the number of chronically undernourished people has increased dramatically. "This must change because many of Africa's agricultural and food security problems have been related to misguided policies, weak institutions in the context of climate crisis," said Million Belay, the Alliance for Food Sovereignty coordinator in Africa (AFSA). Belay pointed out that the industrial food system is a major culprit driving climate change but is still not being taken seriously by climate talks. "Real solutions like diverse, resilient agroecological farming are crucial for farmers [in Africa] to adapt to climate chaos, but they are being sidelined and starved of climate finance," he told IPS on the sidelines of COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. While COP27 The industrial food systems such as monocultures, high-fertilizer and chemical use are described by experts as an enormous driver of climate change in Africa, while small-scale, agroecological farming and indigenous systems comparatively have significantly less GHG emissions and can even work to sequester carbon in healthy ecosystems. "Historically, these philanthropists and multinationals have been considering Africa as a continent facing an agriculture productivity crisis, yet the serious problem is instead related to resilience crisis," Belay said. As global warming patterns continue to shift and natural resources dwindle, agroecology is considered by climate experts as the best path forward for feeding the continent. Most experts agree that under current growth rates, Africa's population will double by 2050 and then double again by 2100, eventually climbing to over 4 billion by the end of the century. The latest estimates by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) show that feeding this growing population will require significant advancements in Africa's food systems. Martin Fregene, the Director of Agriculture and Agro-Industry at the African Development Bank, told delegates at COP27 that the power of agricultural technologies to raise productivity and combat malnutrition on the continent are desperately needed. Speaking during a session that focused on major solutions for a sustainable Agriculture sector in Africa, Fregene pointed out that the inadequate public investment in agricultural research, training and infrastructure and the limited mobilization of the private sector are some major contributing factors to food insecurity affecting Africa because of Climate Change. In May this year, the African Development Bank launched an African Emergency Food Production Facility to provide 20 million African smallholder farmers with seeds and access to fertilizers in a bid to enable them to rapidly produce 38m tons of food - a $12bn increase in production in two years. The programme aims especially at providing direct subsidies to farmers to buy fertilizer and other inputs, as well as financing large importers of fertilizer to source supply from other regions. While climate-induced shocks to the food system used to occur once every ten years on average in Africa, experts show that they are now happening every 2.5 years. Estimates show by 2050, warming of just 1.2 to 1.9?, well within the range of current IPCC projections, is likely to increase the number of malnourished in Africa by 25 to 95 percent-25 percent in central Africa, 50 percent in east Africa, 85 percent in southern Africa and 95 percent in west Africa. Both activists and climate experts agree that the public sector in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa can do more to engage the private sector to ensure that smallholder farmers are taking ownership of established adaptation strategies. Matthias Berninger, the senior Vice-President of Global Public and Government Affairs at Bayer, a global Life Science company with core competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture, told IPS that yet there are positive examples showing how the private sector is getting involved in agricultural adaptation to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa, there is still a long way to go. "The continent has adaptation projects that are now demonstrating their potential, but there is still a pressing need to reshape Africa's food system to be more resilient, productive and inclusive," Berninger said. One of the major findings is that most governments, especially in Sub-Saharan still favour "green revolution" approaches, believing that chemical-intensive, large-scale industrial agriculture is the only way to produce sufficient food. "Green revolution solutions have failed," said Belay. IPS UN Bureau Report \</doc>

AS THE CURTAIN came down on the COP27 yesterday, environmental activists have called for parties to intensify their efforts to deliver breakthrough agreements on key issues that are far from agreement and have seen little progress so far this week. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) yesterday said that the summit was failing to deliver on the  implementation theme prioritised by the Egyptian presidency. The WWF urged the negotiators to agree to a finance facility to deal with the pivotal issue of loss and damage. It said that after a year of devastating climate-related weather impacts around the world, including devastating flooding in Pakistan and droughts in Eastern Africa, it was vital a facility was established with concrete money on the table. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the WWF global climate and energy lead and COP20 president, said that the talks must rapidly intensify, and culminate in new agreements and a powerful cover decision that sets the tone for the year ahead.  We cannot afford to have so many negotiation areas go unresolved until the next COP. We don\' t have time for more delays and excuses, Pulgar-Vidal said.  This was intended to be a COP for implementation, where governments could showcase their progress and commit to significant new climate finance, action and targets, but that is not what we have seen.  But yet again, we have also seen talks stall, with parties and groups at odds on a range of issues, and some looking to delay key decisions.  However, from loss and damage financing to mitigation, adaptation, and the Koronivia agriculture and food talks, there remains hope that COP27 can still achieve a strong outcome.  Negotiators must seize this moment and do everything possible to secure a positive legacy. Every moment matters now. We are in a race against time to prevent the climate crisis spiralling out of control. The Climate Action Window is an initiative of the African Development Fund, the AfDB Group\' s concessional lending window to low-income African states. It will be mobilising up to $13 billion (R224.6bn) for climate adaptation for some 37 low-income and fragile states, the worst hit by climate change. German State Secretary for Economic Co-operation and Development, Jochen Flasbarth, said the contribution by Germany was part of its efforts to balance parity in funding between climate mitigation and adaptation, despite current global economic challenges.  All our countries have challenges to get the right balance between adaption and mitigation, but we want to do that, Flasbarth said \</doc>

Ahead of this year's COP27 in Egypt, industry and government representatives from 15 developing countries across Asia, Latin America and Africa met in a series of consultations about the challenges and opportunities they face in decarbonizing some of their most energy intensive industries like steel, cement and concrete. A report from these consultations - which were organized by the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), where I work - will be released during COP27 's Decarbonisation Day (Friday 11 November) and should be widely-read by decision-makers across energy, environment and industrial sectors. During these meetings, it was evident that the pace of progress so far is too slow and that puts us at real risk of not meeting global climate commitments. It simply won't be sufficient for industrialized countries to lower emissions within their boundaries and enforce restrictions for products entering their markets. This must happen everywhere. Global action and new forms of inter-sectoral cooperation are urgently needed to address critical questions including: what are the opportunities for emissions reductions, and what is needed to deliver these reductions in the fastest and most economical way? How do we speed up the development and implementation of new carbon-cutting technologies - and ensure that they are widely accessible and affordable, including to small and medium sized enterprises? Currently, many developing country governments do not have reliable and up-to-date data on the emissions of their different industries and how they compare internationally. Relatively little has been established so far in the way of infrastructure to facilitate the widespread introduction of new and emerging technologies for industrial decarbonization. Access to and know-how about low-carbon technologies is largely concentrated within industrialized countries and large multinational companies. This must change. For industrial decarbonization efforts to succeed, we need to see significantly increased investments in research and development into new technologies - but we also need to scale up the deployment of technologies that exist but are not yet widely available, including those for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). We also need to much more widely implement strategies and technologies that are already available and affordable - including on energy efficiency, which lowers the demand for energy including from renewable sources. Some of the steel and cement (which is also used to make concrete) businesses working in developing countries are multinational companies which are bringing decarbonizing technologies into their operations from abroad. This is a good thing. But there are also local companies - including within the supply chains of these multinationals - which need to be involved in order to make decarbonization succeed. In India, for example, more than half of the steel manufacturing industry is small and medium sized enterprises without the same access to these technologies. Does this local market currently have the technical capacity to adopt and service new hydrogen fuel installations, for example? Unfortunately, the answer is: Not really. In many cases, these local companies will likely be unaware of the need to actually change their practices to move towards something that's low-carbon - let alone how to do this and what technology options exist to help them. The speed of change needed means that the world cannot wait for them to do this alone. Governments everywhere have a role to play here, in ensuring that their policy frameworks drive decarbonization, promote the right technologies and prevent the proliferation of production processes that aren't low-carbon. Imagine: If construction products are in demand in a developing country and they're not already or sufficiently available on the market, a company or investor may see an opportunity to set up a new business - and if stringent regulations aren't in place, they might do this using outdated technology with higher emissions. Decarbonization is not the mandate of small steel and cement manufacturers, as participants noted in the pre- COP27 Asia consultation, or their area of expertise. It is an area that requires collaboration across different sectors - including to get better and more detailed data, and measurement, reporting and verification frameworks on emissions that can help guide government, and industry, decision-making. Steel and cement companies might often be seen by some of the public as 'bad guys'. Globally, these sectors do currently contribute about 50% of industrial greenhouse gas emissions. But they produce essential materials to build our houses, schools and cities and are needed for our growing communities. The demand should not be to stop production today, but to make it low-carbon today. Without more meaningful global partnerships on industrial decarbonization, there's a big risk that we won't be able to deliver on our climate commitments. We cannot afford this. Countries and industries globally need to move all together towards the same climate goals at the same time. Cooperation - including on policy, infrastructure development, and technology - will be key to doing this. Rana Ghoneim is the Chief of the Energy Systems and Infrastructure Division, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in Vienna. Country consultations mentioned in this op-ed, which will be released during COP27 's Decarbonization Day (Friday 11 November), will be available on the website of UNIDO's Industrial Decarbonization Accelerator.

Climate change is worsening injustice globally, and the poor and vulnerable communities are the most affected. It is time the world acted on fulfilling human rights and building a liveable planet, says Yamide Dagnet, director for Climate Justice at Open Society Foundations. "We are so slow to take climate change seriously," she told IPS in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the COP27 conference in Sharm El Sheikh, in which she speculated that greed and doubts have crept in about solutions. "The solutions are there," Dagnet says. "But we need to organise ourselves and create blended solutions in tackling climate change and upholding human rights." COP27 is in its final week to hammer agreements on saving the world from climate change doom. "This is injustice. In every country of the world, the social justice sentiment is that the most marginalised communities are suffering the most. You also have the intergenerational aspect, which means that the youth will pay the consequences for what is happening now," says Dagnet, who co-founded and launched Allied for Climate Transformation by 2025, a consortium that amplifies the voice and priorities of vulnerable countries and communities. Excerpts of the interview: IPS: You are advocating for climate justice. Does climate change have anything to do with human rights? YD: We need to understand why vulnerable nations and communities are frustrated and demanding legitimate social justice from the Paris Agreement and climate talks. One of the objectives of the UNFCCC is to first stabilise global temperatures. We have obviously failed to do that. Temperatures have increased. Another objective is to protect the most vulnerable. Over the past decades, there has been a focus on how to stabilise and reduce emissions and maximise the means that were to be provided to populations dealing with the impacts of climate change. If you reduce emissions, you reduce the impacts of climate change. But we failed. We have even slid backwards since the Glasgow COP, which goes against human rights. At this COP in Sharm El Sheikh, frustration is at its highest because, as science has it, there has not been a lot of reduction in emissions at all. Even if we were taking the radical step now to reduce emissions, we would still have to deal with a changing climate and have intensified and more frequent disasters. You have everywhere the notion that the delays and prioritisation of some issues over others and the neglect of the priorities in developing countries and communities exacerbate vulnerability resulting in losses and damages. Now there is an effect on livelihoods as some (communities) are displaced and can't rely on their water sources, like in Chad. (This results in) conflict between pastoralists. Or (in the Pacific) atoll nations that know that unless something radical is done, they will be underwater - (and ask) what will happen to their cultural heritage. You have so much at stake beyond economic damage. IPS: Are human rights and justice at stake at the COP27 talks? YD: Absolutely. Everything is at stake. Every human does not need to (just) survive. Human beings have a right to thrive and be protected. Another human rights issue is that some of our most unsung heroes, protecting our forests, and demanding justice from global corporations, are the most affected. The number of environmental defenders being killed is increasing. This is a human rights issue too. IPS: Would you say climate change laid bare the inequalities in the world today? YD: Yes. It is a vicious loop. Unfortunately, inequalities in the world (and) within each country will be exacerbated because of climate change. The impact of climate change will affect the most vulnerable populations from class and gender, with intergenerational impact and from a race point of view. All aspects of inequality will be amplified. When you do not even have the issue of inequality, you will see that climate change and security are going to be exacerbated because climate change is a threat multiplier when it comes to security and economic vulnerability. For example, a country can do everything that the International Monetary Fund asks it to do to reduce debt and have a good GDP, and within eight hours of a hurricane (hitting), it can lose 200 percent of its GDP. The victims are the people and their livelihoods, which are changed in eight hours. IPS: On the agenda of the COP27 talks is the issue of loss and damage, with developing countries seeking support from developed countries for the damage they have suffered due to climate change. Do you think the current negotiations can unlock funding crucial for developing countries to get help? YD: We have already made history. Thirty years ago, the small islands brought up the issue of losses and damages, but nothing was done. They were told to reduce emissions first, and then there was no compensation liability. All progress was hindered because of the fear developed countries had of (paying) compensation and liability when developing countries were asking first and foremost for solidarity. (The developed world) promised to help them be more resilient and reduce emissions, but none of those commitments was fulfilled. This is now why the issue of reparations is coming. They have been asking for space to discuss this issue and how to finance those different losses and damage. The type of finance you need to deal with a disaster like a hurricane or a drought is very different from what you need when a whole nation (displaced and needs to) deal with the loss of cultural heritage. Vulnerable countries are fighting hard to get a financial mechanism, but we need to figure out how to resource this mechanism. We know that trillions are needed. Look at (one country like) Pakistan; we are talking of billions. We have failed since 2009 to mobilise $100 billion a year when we know we need trillions. The more we wait it will be difficult to achieve, and we need to think pragmatically and forcefully not only to create the fund but also about how it will be replenished. What will it come to? Should developing countries go to the International Court and have developed countries tried for climate crimes against humanity, or can we wait for COP200 for a solution? Vanuatu has not waited to start. (They're) saying: Hey! Enough is enough, and we need to take this to the International Court of Justice. So, whether this will result in a country, or seven countries being sued for not doing what they promised to do and taking action and providing reparations remains to be seen. We know this is creating a lot of anxiety because developed countries do not want any liability or (pay) compensation. The other aspect is that the polluters who need to pay are not just the governments but also the corporate sector. Fossil fuel companies are profiting the most from the current energy crisis, for example, so this is why there are discussions about a windfall tax and how to use such a tax on fossil fuel companies to compensate for loss and damage. IPS: Are the voices of those suffering the most from the impacts of climate change being heard by COPs? YD: I think at COP27 , the UNFCCC is putting on one of the most inclusive COPs, but there is still a lot of work to make it more inclusive and effective. This is why philanthropies like us also have a responsibility and can use catalytic funding to really support and protect the movement of those voices that need to be heard. The supporting accountability mechanism outside the countries is to empower civil society to hold their governments and companies accountable, to use naming and shaming, and litigation is important, but it is also important for international platforms like the UNFCCC to have the right accountability mechanism to create the pressure.

COP27 'Every fraction matters' mantra is a cause for concern After my previous column, bemoaning the absence of any mention in SA's key positions for the COP27 climate negotiations of article 6 market-based solutions processes, our company thought it wise to send me to Egypt to engage in person with the SA delegation among others. At the best of times these negotiations are a confusing whirlwind of activity in which one can easily get swept up in the cacophony of parallel events, pronouncements, protests, launches and side-meetings. At this COP the general confusion was heightened by shoddy communications by the organisers, the inaudibility of discussions thanks to industrial grade air-conditioning systems and general crankiness among delegates, who could find neither food nor drink for the first four days of the event. However, one does not trek to the annual global meeting deciding the future of humanity for shits and giggles. So despite the distractions one must focus through the noise to hear what is really going on. What I heard was not heartening. A year ago, at COP26 in Glasgow, the mantra "Keep 1.5 alive" held sway, referring to the imperative of keeping the average global temperature increase below 1.5\'b0C. At this COP a new, far less catchy slogan has begun to insinuate itself - "Every fraction matters", with alarming implications for humanity's future. The reason for the concern is that beyond 1.5\'b0C of warming four of the major climate tipping points move from being possible to likely, with cascading effects on our climate regime. Of these the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets and northern permafrost thaw are of the highest concern, as the first two may be sufficient on their own to stop the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) system. This is the system of weather-regulating ocean currents that carry warm water from the tropics into the North Atlantic. As for the permafrost, reaching this tipping point may be sufficient to drive global warming beyond our control altogether. Thanks to Vladimir Putin's delusions of grandeur, governments at this year's COP have been raising the war in Ukraine and associated effects, including inflation, cost-of-living concerns and the global energy crisis, as obstacles to action. The UN Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report 2022, released last month, reads that updated pledges since COP26 in Glasgow take less than 1% off projected 2030 greenhouse gas emissions. Under the current best-case scenario, with full unconditional nationally determined contributions additional net-zero emissions commitments fully implemented, we are looking at a 1.8\'b0C rise. Despite the ominous undertone, some promising developments have taken place, such as US President Joe Biden's address on Friday, in which he renewed the commitment by the world's second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases to meet emissions reduction targets by 2030. Washington and the EU also issued a joint declaration alongside Japan, Canada, Norway, Singapore and Britain pledging more action to build on an international deal launched last year to cut economywide emissions by 30% in about 130 countries this decade, leaving us 15% short of the reductions required to "keep 1.5 alive". Of particular interest was the high level of attention given at the event to nature-based solutions to climate change, and the pressure being applied by business groups to find solutions to the hurdles slowing down progress on the article 6 carbon market mechanism. With this was the launch of a report from the UN's high-level expert group on the net zero emissions commitments of nonstate entities that is set to tighten controls on net zero greenwashing and provide a guide to ensure credible, accountable net zero pledges. With UN Framework Convention on Climate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell and COP president Sameh Shoukry now cracking the whip, it seems there may still be hope for these negotiations. However, the ambition gap remains wide and the clock is ticking. Maguire is carbon project manager at Climate Neutral Group SA. He writes in his personal capacity. \</doc>

South Africa is one of the winners at COP27 - the International Partner Group (IPG) of five nations pledged an extra $10-billion to support the country's transition investment plan from fossil fuels\~ - but it will be costly. This was announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa, who was speaking at a virtual press briefing at COP27 South Africa, which is the world's HYPERLINK 13th-biggest source of greenhouse gases, with almost half of its emissions coming from coal-fired electricity generation, is being supported by IPG partners France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States and European Union to move away from its reliance on coal. Ramaphosa said the $8.5-billion the IPG pledged last year comes in the form of loans and grants. "The grant component was quite low, at 2.7%. The rest [ HYPERLINK 98% ] comprised concessional loans and loans from commercial institutions," he said. He added that South Africa told the partners the country required R1.5-trillion. "We need to restructure the Glasgow negotiations and have more grants as already we can see that our investment plan requires much more money to be properly and fully implemented.\~ "We have HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-10-24-creecy-at-cop27-developed-countries-must-honour-climate-funding-promises/ communicated this to our partners and said, because South Africa carries a sizable loan burden, which it has to service from its fiscus, we require more grant funding."\~ HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/news/2022-11-04-podcast-the-downfall-of-the-don-of-killarney-thabo-mbeki/ Despite the indorsement, Ramaphosa called on the partners to honour their pledges because their failure to do so after COP26 in Glasgow and COP21 in Paris had created lack of trust between developing and developed countries. He also called on lending partners such as development banks and the World Bank to reform their policies so that developing countries could pay back their loans. "Because failing to honour these commitments breaks trust and confidence in the process. International funding institutions needed to transform for the plans to move forward at present, multilateral support is out of reach of the majority of the world's population due to landing policies that are risk-averse and carry onerous costs," he said. Several countries are doubling down on their plans to push for more finance to enable them to respond to climate change effects without worsening their debt. Last week, during a virtual presidential HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-11-04-ramaphosa-sa-will-require-r1-5-trillion-to-fight-climate-change/ climate briefing, Ramaphosa said the $8.5-billion pledged by the IPG at COP26 last year was not enough for South Africa. He reiterated calls for developed nations to honour their commitments of financial support to developing economies to respond to the climate crisis. "The country will require about R1.5-trillion over next five years to meet targets in transitioning from coal to renewable energy," he said at a meeting of the Presidential Climate Commission, citing the country's climate investment plan. On Tuesday, he added that although the partners had endorsed the country's investment plan, it risked pushing the country into more debt, which is already about R4.7-trillion. SA ahead in renewables In his weekly HYPERLINK newsletter , the president said the move from fossil fuels to greener, cleaner energy sources cannot take place at the expense of economic growth and job creation. "A transition to a low-carbon, climate change-resilient economy should not jeopardise South Africa's developmental goals," Ramaphosa said. He explained the importance of the deal and the just transition more generally.\~ "The imperative of a low-carbon transition that is just and inclusive is particularly important for developing economy countries, which are the worst affected by climate change.\~ "Although Africa carries the least responsibility for climate change, the continent experiences much of its harshest effects. The same is true for vulnerable countries and communities in other parts of the world, including small island states." Extreme weather such as floods and droughts are driving food insecurity, displacing populations, causing damage to infrastructure and leading to the loss of livelihoods. HYPERLINK https://www.news24.com/fin24/climate_future/news/beyond-85bn-rich-countries-commit-more-money-for-sas-energy-transition-20221108 News24 reported that the $8.5-billion comprises $1-billion each from France, Germany, the US and EU. The UK has pledged $1.8-billion and $2.6-billion of the funds will be accessed from the Climate Investment Funds Accelerating Coal Transition (CIF ACT) Investment Plan. The CIF ACT monies include $500-million (about R9-billion) with Germany, the UK, and US providing about 65% of the funds, which will support the decommissioning and repurposing of coal power stations, community development and energy efficiency projects in Mpumalanga.

https://cop27.eg/ COP27 HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/ is the 27th Conference of the Parties (countries) that signed up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The convention was established at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, and has been ratified by 198 countries. They agreed to stabilise the production of greenhouse gases in order to prevent dangerous climate change. Since then, the Conference of the Parties has been hosted in a different country each year. These conferences broadly provide a platform for the negotiation of international climate change treaties. The very first treaty acknowledged that the responsibility for action was different for developed and developing countries, because developed countries were responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions. Despite some gains, commitment to these treaties has not translated into the action necessary to shift the course of global climate change. The recent HYPERLINK Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that global average temperatures have already reached 1.1\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and that warming of over 1.5\'b0C is all but inevitable unless drastic action is taken. Everyone is affected by climate change but some people and regions are HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/ more vulnerable than others. Regions that will experience the most adverse impacts of climate change are West, Central and East Africa; South Asia; Central and South America; small island developing states and the Arctic. Populations living in informal settlements will have the worst of it. Vulnerability to climate change impacts is driven by socioeconomic, political and environmental factors. African countries have HYPERLINK already experienced The COP27 is therefore important because that is where decisions are made about how to respond to climate change. Climate change treaties Three international treaties have been adopted on international climate change cooperation. They led to the development of different bodies which all convene under the banner of the COP. COP is where they meet, negotiate and evaluate progress, even though COP technically only refers to the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The first treaty was the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The second was the Kyoto Protocol, established in 1997, whereby countries made commitments to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases. The Kyoto Protocol was based on the principle of common, but differentiated, responsibilities. It acknowledged that because of their higher levels of economic development, developed countries could, and should, take greater responsibility to reduce emissions. The third, and most recent, treaty is the 2015 Paris Agreement. It covers climate change mitigation, adaptation and financing and aims to limit the rise in temperatures to less than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. All signatories need to develop a plan for climate change mitigation, including reducing emissions. They also have to report on progress. A key weakness of the Paris Agreement is that it is non-binding. Also, the commitments are self-determined. A https://unfccc.int/news/climate-plans-remain-insufficient-more-ambitious-action-needed-now recent study found that even if all the countries did meet their commitments, it would not be enough to limit warming to below 2\'b0C. It is important to understand and engage in these processes as the impacts of climate change are increasing globally. The increase in the global average temperature is one of several climate impacts. Others https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/ include increased likelihood of droughts and floods and increased intensity of storms and wildfires. The frequency of climate events will increase as temperatures rise. There is an urgent need for action to prevent global warming from rising above 2\'b0C. Temperatures over 2\'b0C HYPERLINK https://ocean-climate.org/en/ipcc-report-urgent-adaptation-needed-to-address-rising-impacts-of-climate-change-on-the-ocean-and-populations/ will result in irreversible climate impacts such as sea level rise and affect far more people than an increase of 1.5\'b0C. Responses to climate change There are three policy areas which have emerged to respond to climate change. The first is mitigation - the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to stabilise the climate. Examples of mitigation include replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources and developing electrified public transport to replace private vehicles powered by combustion engines. The second is adaptation - interventions which would support climate resilience and reduce vulnerability. Examples include improved water management and conservation to reduce the risk of drought; initiatives to improve food security and support for biodiversity. The third policy area deals with loss and damage. HYPERLINK https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Loss-and-Damage-Issues-and-Options-for-cop27.pdf Loss and damage refers to "the economic and non-economic damages associated with slow-onset events and extreme weather events caused by global warming and the tools and institutions that identify and mitigate such risks". Interventions to address loss and damage can include risk management support and finance, often framed as climate reparations. Mitigation and adaptation are well understood and established within climate policy. And they have finance mechanisms within international treaties, even though existing commitments to these mechanisms have https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-00990-2 not materialised in practice, particularly when it comes to adaptation. Loss and damage, however, has received far less attention in international treaties and negotiations. Highlighting loss and damage The HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/workstreams/loss-and-damage/warsaw-international-mechanism#:%7E:text=The%20COP%20established%20the%20Warsaw,that%20are%20particularly%20vulnerable%20to Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage was established in 2013 to provide a framework to address loss and damage. It aims to improve understanding of risk management approaches, increase coordination and dialogue among stakeholders and enhance action and support. The issue of loss and damage was incorporated into the Paris Agreement but without any specific commitments around it. During negotiations at COP25, the Santiago Network was set up to avert, minimise and address loss and damage for developing countries but it focuses mostly on technical assistance rather than finance. At COP26 (in 2021) there was an HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop26-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-glasgow/ agreement to fund the Santiago Network , but the institutional framework is not yet finalised. Loss and damage was raised as an important issue to be addressed during COP26. There were some promising moves, such as Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop26-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-glasgow/ pledging \£32-million towards a loss and damage finance facility. But many rich nations did not support this. The negotiations led to the proposal to establish the Glasgow Finance Facility for loss and damage. But the wording of the decision was HYPERLINK changed at the last minute COP27 , and holding other countries to account for the HYPERLINK $100-billion annual commitment towards climate finance which has yet to materialise. Many climate activists from the Global South feel that if a https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/15/climate/pakistan-floods-global-warming.html financing facility for loss and damage is not discussed at COP27 , it will be a failed conference.

US President Joe Biden started a week-long trip to Egypt and Asia yesterday to grapple with some of the US\' s thorniest foreign policy issues, boosted by a better-than-expected showing by Democrats in the midterm elections. Biden hops from an international climate summit in Egypt today to an Asean meeting and the East Asia Summit in Cambodia tomorrow and on Sunday to the annual gathering of the G20, or Group of 20 industrialised nations, in Indonesia from November 14-16. He\' ll hold his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the G20, where he hopes to explore Xi\' s  red lines , talk to allies about punishing Russia for its Ukraine invasion and discuss containing North Korea after a barrage of missile tests. Biden said this week that his goal was to get a deeper understanding of Xi\' s priorities and concerns, in a meeting expected on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia. He will also discuss the disputed island of Taiwan with Xi. Biden said he wants to lay out  what each of our red lines are , understand what Xi believes to be in the national interest of China, discuss US interests and  determine whether or not they conflict with one another . Beijing and Washington have been working on an in-person meeting between the two leaders since Biden took office in January 2021, US officials have said previously, even as they have talked on the phone and met virtually. There\' s still no public date or time for this meeting.  The big question is ... are the two leaders going to come in a sort of more conciliatory mode or sort of a more defiant one, said Matthew Goodman, senior vice-president for economics at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. Biden will also reaffirm the US\' s commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, a rules-based international order in the South China Sea, and discuss trade and China\' s relationship with countries in the region. Tensions have been high between the US and China over Taiwan after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\' s visit to the self-governing island earlier this year. Biden, facing new challenges in US efforts to squeeze Russia\' s funding sources eight months into Moscow\' s invasion of Ukraine, plans to be  unapologetic in his defence of Ukraine, and address the war\' s impact on energy and food security at the G20 meeting, the officials said. Biden has said US aid for Ukraine will continue uninterrupted and any territorial compromise between the two countries is up to Ukraine. He also said he hoped Russian President Vladimir Putin will be willing to talk about a potential prisoner swop to secure the release of US basketball star Brittney Griner. Putin will not attend the G20 summit in person but is due to join one of the meetings virtually, an Indonesian government official said. Indonesia has also invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has said he would not take part if Putin does and was expected to join virtually. Biden will also meet Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan and South Korean President Yoon Suk-Yeol during the Asean summit in Cambodia on Sunday to discuss how to stem North Korea\' s nuclear programme, a White House official said. They will address North Korea\' s  unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes , the official said. At the COP27 Biden will have a bilateral meeting with Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and  human rights will feature prominently in those discussions , administration officials said. | Reuters \</doc>

The world looks to COP27 to negotiate our future against a ticking clock. With the event taking place on African soil this year, this is a valuable opportunity to gain climate wins for the continent. The African Group of Negotiators (AGN) has been representing the common interests of African nations as a bloc since 1995's first COP in Berlin, Germany, ensuring that Africa's voice on climate issues is heard over competing interests. Since 2015, they have been supported by the African Group of Negotiators Expert Support (AGNES), who provide scientific evidence to inform the African position by facilitating the exchange of ideas between experts and negotiators. AGNES has been working with Oppenheimer Generations Research and Conservation (OGRC) as well as researchers from their partner programme, Future Ecosystems for Africa (FEFA), to incorporate the latest science on African environments into Africa s COP27 position.The African position can be encapsulated in four key points:Emphasis on nature-based approachesThere is increasing emphasis on nature-based approaches for minimising the extent and impact of atmospheric CO2 on climate change, and land- and ocean-based mitigation approaches have become a key part of the climate negotiations at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) while also having large impacts for the Convention on Biodiversity.The convention is a multilateral treaty which aims to conserve biological diversity, promote sustainable use of its elements, and to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from genetic resources.The joint UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report on biodiversity and climate change emphasises the critical need to address both of these challenges simultaneously, highlighting that several land and ocean-based actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore ecosystems have co-benefits for climate mitigation, climate adaptation and biodiversity objectives.However, there is also a crucial acknowledgment that there are important trade-offs that need to be recognised and managed.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/363/233396.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/363/233396.html :EMBED-->Stumbling block to mobilisationThere are myriad suggestions for both ocean- and land-based climate actions, but the evidence-base and technical understanding of their value in an African context is often unclear, which is a stumbling block to mobilisation. Investment by private capital into mitigation and other nature-based approaches has much potential for impact but can also lead down many maladaptive pathways if not considered holistically and within scientific and local knowledge.Further capacity for decision-making can sometimes be limited and many knowledge gaps remain on how most effectively to enhance climate action on land and integrate and strengthen ocean-based action. Non-state actors have a key role to play in fostering pathways that emphasise co-benefits from ecological approaches rather than just focusing on singular metrics.The Future Ecosystems for Africa programme, in collaboration with AGNES and OGRC, recognised the need to mobilise African science and evidence from the continent to feed into these important discussions and provide an integrated, technical summary of the potential synergies and trade-offs between climate actions and sustainable development from the perspectives of African scientists and practitioners.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/233314.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/233314.html :EMBED-->Key scientific reasoningAt a We Mean Business event, which took place at Sharm el-Sheikh in November, FEFA and OGRC showcased the two technical reports that resulted from this initiative: Enhancing climate change adaptation and mitigation actions on land in Africa, and Integration of ocean-based adaptation and mitigation actions into the regional and national climate policies in Africa. Earlier in 2022, these technical documents helped to provide some key scientific reasoning to bolster some of the positions of African group member states.Each document was pulled together by one main author with a review process and inputs from others, but they are as such starting points for a broader, more engaged conversation on the state of the science of climate mitigation and adaptation on the African continent.Potentially this will make even stronger ties not just to the UNFCCC process (which could leverage more financing and also steer actions away from maladaptation), but also to the Convention on Biodiversity and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). These are starting points to launch a more African-informed evidence base to inform decision-making in the intergovernmental negotiations.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/707/233290.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/707/233290.html :EMBED-->Supporting a stronger, louder voice from AfricaAfrica is a vigorous contributor to many forums engaging with climate change challenges: at COP, critically, but there is also a BRICS position that South Africa sits on, a UN Group of 77 (G77) position, and then the LDC (Least Developed Countries, which includes many African counties) and even SIDS (Small Island Developing States). No party except country designated negotiators can influence a position, but the science to help inform it comes from organisations such as OGRC, AGNES and FEFA.The scientific evidence is enlisted to emphasise the need for coherence around land and the oceans on the continent, the importance of tying UNFCCC to other convention objectives so they do not undermine each other, to unpack some of the technical aspects of what mitigation potential looks like on the continent and its ecosystems, and to ensure co-benefits for adaptation, livelihoods and the environment from mitigation efforts.Oppenheimer Generations Research and Conservation (OGRC) supports a stronger, louder voice from Africa, strengthened by African research on African priorities, and this is to be heard at COP27 . \</doc>

African ministers meeting in Cairo two months ahead of the COP27 climate summit called on Friday, 9 September, for a sharp expansion of climate financing for their continent while pushing back against an abrupt move away from fossil fuels. Egypt, an oil and gas producer considered highly vulnerable to climate change, has positioned itself as a champion for African interests as it prepares to host the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh in November.A communique released after a three-day forum for finance, economy and environment ministers said Africa benefited from less than 5.5% of global climate financing despite having a low carbon footprint and suffering disproportionately from climate change.It urged rich countries to meet and expand climate pledges, and said poor countries should be able to develop economically while receiving more funds to adapt to the impact of climate change.The document stressed "the need to avoid approaches that encourage abrupt disinvestments from fossil fuels, as this will... threaten Africa's development".Role of gas in energy transitionThe role of gas in the transition to cleaner energy is set to be a key point of contention at COP27 . Climate activists say it needs to be quickly phased out and replaced with renewables.Nigerian finance minister Zainab Ahmed told the Cairo forum that gas was a matter of survival for her country."If we are not getting reasonably-priced finance to develop gas, we are denying the citizens in our countries the opportunities to attain basic development," she said.The communique also called for focusing on climate change in a review of multilateral development banks and international financial institutions.It suggested the creation of a sustainable sovereign debt hub that could reduce the cost of capital for developing states and support debt-for-nature swaps.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/704/231138.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/704/231138.html :EMBED-->Funding hinderedExperts say there is private as well as public sector appetite for financing and investing in climate projects in Africa, but funding is hindered for reasons including risk perception, underdeveloped green finance markets, and local technical and policy constraints.States have seen their cost of borrowing rise due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine."This is keeping us up at night how to decrease the cost of borrowing," Egypt's deputy finance minister Sherine El Sharkawy told the forum.Kevin Chika Urama, chief economist at the African Development Bank, said Africa faced a climate financing gap of about $108bn each year."Climate finance structure today is actually biased against climate-vulnerable countries. The more vulnerable you are the less climate finance you receive," he said. \</doc>

Western sanctions appear to have hindered the growth of vulnerable developing economies and upended their progress in tackling climate change. One glaring example is Zimbabwe, whose economy has been crippled by severe restrictions, as Emmerson Mnangagwa, president of Zimbabwe, outlined at COP27 .  The sanction-induced economic mire has inflicted a myriad of real challenges on Zimbabweans, especially amid an unprecedented global pandemic.  Although the Zimbabwean government said the land reform would promote democracy and the economy, Western countries launched repeated sanctions with little regard for the average person\' s suffering, the economist continued. The issue of Western restrictions slapped on Zimbabweans was raised by Mnangagwa at COP27 (the UN Climate Change Conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt). Mnangagwa emphasised that the West\' s  illegal economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe upends its climate goals and demanded that the  unwarranted and punitive measures be lifted.  In 2021, the UN Special Rapporteur on unilateral coercive measures, Alena Douhan, said in a report she compiled after visiting Zimbabwe that Western sanctions were undermining the human rights of ordinary Zimbabweans because the government had been forced to cut funding, Salameh noted.  She said that sanctions have prevented the Zimbabwean government from using resources to develop and maintain essential infrastructure, thereby affecting the country\' s whole population, especially those in extreme poverty. Zimbabwe  lost well over $42 billion in revenue over the past 19 years because of the sanctions , with a negative influence on most sectors of its economy and the investment climate, according to a 2020 report by the Southern African Development Community. Meanwhile, 63% of Zimbabwe\' s 15.6 million population live below the poverty line and 24% of the country\' s children between six months and 5 years face malnutrition.  The sanctions against Zimbabwe aren\' t justified in any shape or form because they aim to protect and perpetuate the relics of Western imperialism in Africa, argued Salameh. However, Zimbabwe is just one among dozens of countries subjected to a unilateral sanctions regime by the US and its Nato allies and partners. Sanctions have become nothing short of a tool used by the West to achieve its geopolitical objectives, punish countries that don\' t toe the US foreign policy line, and contain potential competitors, according to Salameh.  Since 1998 the US has imposed economic sanctions on more than 20 countries under one pretext or another, the oil economist said.  Prominent among these sanctioned countries are Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Syria, Cuba and North Korea. One common factor among all these s countries is that they have fallen foul of the US, either by objecting to its foreign policy or following policies the US considers counter to its national interests. Zimbabwe is no exception. The sanctions spree has by no means been helpful for the international community\' s joint interests, such as combating terrorism, global crime, pandemics and climate change. While the latter issue has become the focus of the Global North over the past few years, the negative impact of Western unilateral restrictions on the climate has been routinely overlooked by the architects of sanctions. Non-profit think tanks, academia and institutions have raised alarm over sanctions\' long-standing ramifications on the environment. In particular, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University argued that Western restrictions imposed on Iran, Russia and Venezuela significantly contribute to increased pollution, declining water resources, deforestation and desertification, as well as irreversible biodiversity loss in the given nations. Many countries subjected to harsh sanctions have been forced to increase their dependence on fossil fuels and even resort to unsustainable agricultural practices to maintain their citizens\' well-being and shield their populations from existential crisis, according to the institution.  For countries whose economies and their livelihood are badly suffering from harsh US sanctions, the last thing on their minds is to contribute to the global efforts to control climate change and help reduce harmful emissions, said Salameh.  For countries like Zimbabwe and many others under US sanctions, their priority is to use whatever resources they have to feed their people and improve their standard of living rather than fighting climate change, thus inadvertently affecting the global efforts to reduce global emissions. In addition to that, the aforementioned sanctions policies sometimes backfire on their initiators. In May, the Royal United Services Institute, a UK-based think tank, drew attention to the fact that sanctions on Russia have collectively induced a steady rise in crude oil prices, disrupted global grain and fertiliser markets, and led to environmental damage and reactive forced-hand policies to divest from Russian energy sources. The report highlighted that unforeseen effects of Western policies imposed continuous stress on global markets strained natural resources and increased carbon emissions in direct contradiction with the Paris Climate Accord goals of 2015. Russia used to provide roughly 40% of all imported gas to the EU. However, in the wake of the US-led Russia energy embargo, Europe has to slash coal, gas and oil deliveries from Russia and eventually reactivated many coal-fired power plants. Earlier this year, prices for thermal coal, used to generate electricity, mounted to record levels. According to the press, Europeans are buying coal from places such as Tanzania, Botswana, and even Madagascar. The White House has also repeatedly released crude from the nation\' s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, prompting criticism from progressives and environmental activists. It also appears that Washington has no scruples about capitalising on the EU energy crunch by selling expensive liquefied natural gas to its European allies.  The US will always look after its own interests irrespective of any adverse impact on others, even its own allies. This is the ugly face of Western capitalism, said Salameh. The policy of unilateral economic sanctions pursued by the West has become a catalyst for environmental degradation. Some experts believe that the US should adopt a so-called  environmentally conscious foreign policy and consider the climate implications of the sanctions they impose. However, Salameh noted that the US and the collective West in general have on multiple occasions demonstrated that it is not interested in maintaining such an approach, which throws into question the sincerity of the Western climate agenda in the first place.  Experts who believe that the US, which is the cradle of capitalism, will ever transform itself to a global benevolent utopia must be deluding themselves or daydreaming, the oil economist remarked. Sudanese-British billionaire Mo Ibrahim argued before COP27 that African nations could use their rich gas deposits as a  transition fuel and insisted on the necessity to fund the creation of gas and electricity infrastructure on the continent. However, US climate czar John Kerry made it clear that Washington opposes any investment in long-term gas projects in Africa since they contradict the net-zero targets. As a result, African states would be forced to continue to use dirty fuels to cook food or warm themselves, while Western corporations would continue to extract crude and gas on the continent for the needs of the Global North, according to the oil economist. Needless to say, against this backdrop, Western restrictions further paralyse the development of African nations, making it almost impossible for them to become self-sufficient, let alone reach any climate goals in the future.

In Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where the 27th UN annual effort at solving the climate crisis is halfway to failure, negotiators and anyone interested in South Africa\' s welfare might get the wrong impression, given the hype flowing in speeches by President Cyril Ramaphosa and World Bank President David Malpass. The highlight of the first week was $8.5 billion (about R147bn) in Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) financing that Western powers are directing \- 97% as loans, just 3% in grants \- towards Eskom\' s supposed decarbonisation, as well as electric vehicle export subsidies (benefiting mainly German automakers) and a probably-fictional green hydrogen industry (led by ultra- polluter Sasol). The World Bank provided another $500 million loan for what it considers to be Eskom\' s Komati coal-fired generator\' s  decarb . Malpass, who was Donald Trump\' s rogue appointee in 2019, even visited the site last weekend. As he reported back at the COP27 on Wednesday,  Developing complex projects like this take a long time, as will the implementation.  That helps explain the key role played by the World Bank Group working with Eskom, the South African federal and local governments, and the JETP partners as part of the country platform. (Affected workers and communities were not worth mentioning.) Malpass bragged of Komati:  The World Bank is proud to lead this successful approach to reducing emissions. But leaving the leadership of Eskom\' s decarbonisation pilot to Malpass is asking for trouble. Last month, an Extinction Rebellion and DebtForClimate.org protest at the Bank\' s Johannesburg office drew scores of community and environmental activists insisting not only on Eskom debt cancellation, since a 2010 Medupi coal-fired power plant credit of $3.75bn was the World Bank\' s largest project loan, and it occurred when Malpass\' predecessor Robert Zoellick knew that Hitachi had bribed the ANC with a free 25% local co-investor share. In 2017, when he was deputy US finance minister testifying to Congress, Malpass (correctly) accused the Bank of malfeasance, remarking of its staff:  They\' re often corrupt in their lending practices, and they don\' t get the benefit to the actual people in the countries. They get the benefit to the people who fly in on a first-class plane ticket to give advise to the government officials in the country. Asked by congressional finance committee leader Maxine Waters,  Do you have an example of that?, Malpass didn\' t hesitate:  South Africa is heavily indebted and not making progress and is not being well served by its relationships with international financial institutions. The revelation was logical, in the wake of Hitachi\' s 2015 prosecution under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. But there were plenty of other fingerprints, including on Eskom\' s whites-only electricity infrastructure dating to the first World Bank loan to South Africa, in 1951, and several more through 1967. Even eight years after apartheid ended, the Bank made a venture capital investment in a massive white-owned coal mine \- Tendele \- bordering Hluhluwe-iMfolozi nature reserve (Africa\' s oldest), displacing hundreds of residents without having obtained legally required environmental permission. On October 20, 2020, anti-coal activist Fikile Ntshangase was assassinated there, at a crucial point in the struggle against Tendele\' s expansion, resulting in her lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi demanding reparations: the return of mine profits worth millions of dollars to the victimised community, which includes World Bank pay-offs as an original investor. The anti-bank protesters also demanded an end to the $2m initial financing of a Richards Bay Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal that began in 2019. At Richards Bay and Komati, Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter repeatedly told the Bank and other JETP partners he would ideally find R85bn for two new methane gas generators with 4 000MW capacity. Tragically, the JETP inflow frees up De Ruyter\' s revenues to pursue those plans, even though methane is 85 times more potent than CO2 over the next 20 years. Moving Eskom from decarbonisation to methanisation will, in turn, make those South African export products reliant upon gas-fired electricity much more prone to international climate sanctions. In September, former US vice president and climate campaigner Al Gore called for the firing of Malpass, due to his  ridiculous climate denialism, but the problem is evident when other bank staff push methane gas projects or demand Medupi debt repayment. In all this, South African officials play a pernicious official role, one that was called out by Basani Baloyi of the Institute for Economic Justice on Thursday in a COP27 briefing:  The World Bank\' s vice president of integrity, Leonard McCarthy, a former director of the Directorate of Special Operations (Scorpions) with close relations to the ruling party, refused a request to investigate the corruption associated with the (Medupi) loan. The COP27 Again, former Shanduka Coal tycoon Ramaphosa\' s interests are the opposite, to reject any liability for climate damage, even though South Africa\' s historic emissions rank 16th highest at 30 billion tons, adding 500 million more each year. But mimicking the dogmatic, unethical US position against acknowledging any liability, one of Ramaphosa\' s COP27 delegates claimed on Tuesday:  There are a set of rules vis-\'e0-vis funding arrangements and no attempt must be made to re- open them. For the self-interested Pretoria delegation \- strongly allied with local corporate fossil-fuel abusers in the National Business Initiative and Business Unity South Africa \- this logically refers to the Paris Climate Agreement\' s provision that the 2015 deal  does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation . Breaking free of this insidious influence \- combining Western imperial financing sources, supine politicians, high-polluting local corporates promoting a sub-imperial climate policy stance, and the climate-debt-denialist World Bank \- has never been more urgent. But with leaders like Ramaphosa and Malpass, it\' s never seemed more unlikely. \</doc>

With the continent facing climate extremes despite its limited contributions to the crisis, political leaders and campaigners have called for global spending on clean energy development. Just days away from the UN climate summit in Egypt, The Guardian has highlighted how the US government is pouring billions into African fossil fuel projects while making relatively limited investments in renewables. For fiscal years 2016-2021, the US spent $13 billion (about R236bn) on fossil fuel projects globally, compared with $4bn on renewable energy and $1bn on other projects. Two-thirds of fossil fuel spending, or $9bn, went to projects in Africa. Just $682 million went to renewables there \- meaning the US spent 13 times more on polluting projects across the continent. Leading up to the COP27 summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, African campaigners and leaders have stressed not only the need for loss and damage funding from wealthy nations that have largely created the climate emergency but also greater investments in renewables. As Kenyan President William Ruto argued earlier this month, the continent has  immense potential for renewable energy, and this abundance of wind and solar energy can power the development of Africa .  The loopholes for \' strategic\' projects, and the lack of action at home, leave big gaps, Fossil Free Media director Jamie Henn said at the time.  It\' s time to end government support for all fossil fuels everywhere. Climate campaigners remain critical of the administration, especially in light of The Guardian\' s findings. Kate DeAngelis, international finance programme manager at Friends of the Earth, said that she  was thrilled with the promises of the current administration, but since Biden took office last year,  it\' s been a slow walk back to the point where you couldn\' t tell the difference between him and his right-wing predecessor in terms of fossil fuel finance abroad.  It\' s been frustrating and tiresome to see so many opportunities lost to transition away from fossil fuels, she continued.  It\' s just business as usual. We are seeing some of the most vulnerable communities in Africa be negatively impacted and they don\' t have a voice. As the newspaper detailed, the Export-Import Bank of the US (Exim), a primary funder of overseas energy projects, has ramped up its support for renewables in recent years but DeAngelis said the agency had shown no intention of ceasing fossil fuel funding.  They\' ve said to us they will approve fossil fuels in Africa and beyond and not to get bogged down on that because they are doing renewables too, she said.  It shows the lack of seriousness (with which) the Biden administration is taking this crisis. From 2016 until last year, Exim\' s financing of fossil fuels in Africa dwarfed renewable funding by a factor of 51 to one. This approach to lending threatens to undercut Biden\' s message of climate leadership at what has been dubbed  Africa\' s COP , to be held over the next two weeks in Egypt. While Exim did not respond to the paper\' s request for comment, a spokesperson for the Development Finance Corporation said that the DFC is  committed to safeguarding US geostrategic interests, while accounting for rising energy demand and security around the world , and  seeks to invest in highly developmental, affordable, and sustainable energy access in alignment with the Biden-Harris administration\' s long-term climate goals, including a net-zero future . The reporting and final preparations for COP27 come as climate scientists and other experts continue to warn of the need to rapidly transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy on a global scale. A World Meteorological Organization report confirmed yesterday that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide hit record highs last year, which WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said  has underlined, once again, the enormous challenge \- and the vital necessity \- of urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global temperatures rising even further in the future . The UN Environment Programme delivered a similar message about how far off the world is from meeting the Paris temperature goals for 2100, warning that there is  no credible pathway to 1.5\'b0C in place , which necessitates a  rapid transformation of societies .

Rambharos to join US non-profit Environmental Defense Fund POWER GENERATION HAJRA OMARJEE, TIISETSO MOTSOENENG, LINDA ENSORThe head of Eskom's energy transition department has resigned, leaving the utility scrutinising the terms of a R150bn package pledged by rich nations to finance a quicker transition from coal. With more than 20 years in the energy industry, the departure of veteran Mandy Rambharos at the end of October is likely to leave SA's delegation to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change one person short at the 27th annual meeting ( COP27 ) in the first week of November. At last year's meeting in Glasgow the EU, Britain, France, the US and Germany promised $8.5bn (R153bn) to help Eskom expedite its transition to green energy. In exchange, SA has to come up with a plan for how it will shut down the coal-fired power stations and repurpose them for renewable energy farms. Negotiations with the partners about the investment plan are meant to end before the start of COP27 Eskom is unfazed by the exit of Rambharos - who is joining the Environmental Defense Fund, a US non-profit - with spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha saying that the energy transition programme will proceed as planned. The announcement of Rambharos's departure came a day after public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan named a new Eskom board that combines a mix of legal, engineering and financial skills. The board of directors, which began work at the weekend, is led by Mpho Makwana, a bachelor of arts graduate who returns to the utility after serving in the same capacity in 2010. He is currently the chair of Nedbank, and also holds a number of other corporate positions. He served for nine months as Eskom CEO. The new board members have taken oversight of a state-owned company that faces an energy supply crisis, which has damped business sentiment, undermined economic growth prospects and left millions of South Africans frustrated. They will also have to assess the performance of Eskom's executive management team led by CEO Andr& xE9; de Ruyter, who took the reins at the start of 2020. First task Makwana said the board would meet the executives on Monday as SA grapples with weeks of load-shedding. Makwana said the new board would within days speak about the way forward amid calls from the EFF and the Black Business Council (BBC) for De Ruyter and COO Jan Oberholzer to be fired. "The BBC would like to advise the new board that their first responsibility and task is to release the incompetent CEO and COO as they have plunged the country into darkness that has paralysed the country and its economy," said CEO Kganki Matabane as the lobby group joined a chorus welcoming the new board. Business Unity SA (Busa) believes the right people have been appointed to chart the way forward. "The board has an appropriate mix of expertise and we expect it to provide strategic guidance to the Eskom executive and to take responsibility for the executive's performance," CEO Cas Coovadia said. "We also expect it to engage robustly to get the shareholder to play its role in ameliorating and managing the ongoing load-shedding crisis."

The United States will advocate against investing in long-term oil and gas projects in HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-10-28-loss-and-damage-caused-by-climate-crisis-must-top-the-cop27-agenda/ Africa at COP27 in Egypt, said US climate envoy John Kerry. In a conference call with journalists last week, he advised against the continued financing of oil and gas projects in Africa. This is despite the decision by the US government to continue funding gas projects on the continent, which is against last year's COP26 agreement in Glasgow, Scotland, which stated that developed countries should stop investing in "dirty fossil fuel projects". World leaders will begin climate talks in Sharm el-Sheikh starting on the 6th of November. Tensions are expected to run high in the negotiations around reducing carbon emissions. Kerry said developed countries planned to implement all the promises they made at COP26, including encouraging countries to adopt clean energy and development banks to increase funding. "We view this year's conference as an implementation COP. And the purpose of it is to make sure the promises that were made in Glasgow are actually being pursued at the pace they need to be pursued at, but also the folks who didn't step up in Glasgow are, according to the Glasgow agreement, supposed to step up here and provide new NDCs [nationally determined contributions], new indicators of what they are prepared to do,"\~ he said. He added that the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting is the " HYPERLINK https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/brief/social-inclusion-in-africa stepping stone to the next opportunity for all of us to get together and be able to measure where we are and what we need to do, to get on track where we aren't today". Africa's push for fossil fuels But African countries are set to use the UN conference to advocate for massive new investment in fossil fuels in Africa. During COP27 pre-negotiations leaders from African countries such as HYPERLINK https://www.zawya.com/en/economy/africa/african-countries-to-push-for-more-fossil-fuel-projects-at-cop27-fz6lyfu0 Uganda , HYPERLINK Nigeria and HYPERLINK https://www.africanews.com/2021/11/30/senegal-president-opposes-halting-financing-of-fossil-fuel-extraction//#:~:text=Senegal's%20President%20Macky%20Sall%20on,like%20the%20West%20African%20country. Senegal advocated for an energy mix, with the use of fossil fuels to expand their economies and increase people's access to electricity. "Africa has woken up and we are going to exploit our natural resources," said Uganda's energy minister, Ruth Nankabirwa Ssentamu, during Africa Energy Week in Cape Town\~ last month. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, secretary general of the African Petroleum Producers' Organisation, told Reuters: "There is no way you can develop any economy, any society without energy. We are talking about coal, we are talking oil and we are talking about gas. At this time we are not discriminating." During a HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7THMR7Crxf4 business forum discussion in June, Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum said the decision to stop the funding of fossil fuel projects in Africa was a punishment and they would continue to fight for them to resume. "We are going to continue to fight; we have fossil fuels that should be exploited."\~ According to the International Energy Agency, 43% of Africa's people don't have electricity, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.\~ Missing funding At the COP meeting in Denmark in 2009, governments around the world committed to allocating $100-billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries address the harmful effects of climate change and mitigate further rises in temperatures.\~ Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development HYPERLINK https://www.oecd.org/climate-change/finance-usd-100-billion-goal/ analysis shows that developed countries have not met the pledged amount to help African countries since 2019. One of the key issues is how to ensure that African countries get the money to fight climate change that wealthier nations have pledged. Frustrations at this failure are contributing to rising tensions ahead of COP27 .\~ Kerry admitted that finance was a challenge and that the US and other countries were holding back on the capital or simply did not have it. "The trick is to persuade both governments and financiers to take a chance on new technologies and meet their pledges. The biggest challenge in that regard is figuring out how to help poorer nations get the necessary capital without being short paid. The US is looking for money to give these poorer countries, so they can get on board," he said\~ If Africa continued with exploration for gas, and oil, it would be close to impossible for the world to limit global heating to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, Kerry said. African countries will be hit the hardest A report from the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/climate-plans-remain-insufficient-more-ambitious-action-needed-now United Nations Environment Programme finds that African countries have fallen drastically behind in mitigating the effects of climate changes needed to avoid a future of even more extreme storms, heatwaves and floods.\~ The report showed that countries globally have failed to meet the requirements agreed to at the Glasgow conference last year to limit the planet's warming level to 1.5\'b0C. The report added that developed countries are leading the planet to a minimum of 2.5\'b0C, a level deemed catastrophic by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. "Most countries are lagging on their existing commitments to cut carbon output, with global greenhouse gas emissions set to rise to 10.6% by 2030. Although this is an improvement from last year which showed a 13.7% increase by 2030, and a continued rise of emissions after 2030, it is still not nearly enough to keep warming below the 1.5\'b0C threshold," the report said. African countries are marginal contributors to global carbon emission yet are bearing the brunt of extreme climate change. A report by the HYPERLINK World Bank estimates that, by 2030, 118 million people on the continent will be exposed to drought, floods and extreme heat if action is not taken now. Loss and damage Kerry urged developed countries to support developing countries with the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. He added that there should be sufficient conversation about loss and damage that developing countries will face. "I think that the developed world has to take the lead in helping the developing world to be able to withstand the impacts of climate and to get ahead of the curve on the new energy future, and I'm all for it," he said." "What's important is that we've got to find new mechanisms of releasing the funding and new ways of providing concessionary funding to help countries to transition." He added that the US was prepared to support countries through finance for loss and damage and would lead discussions with other countries to discuss why a move to clean energy is better. "We are prepared to discuss in Sharm el-Sheikh fully all the ways in which we can try to be fair and gather the efforts of the world to help us address the concerns of a lot of countries. So, we're very supportive of addressing loss and damage in the context of the process of the UN - of the COPs," he said.

DESPITE developmental challenges and pressures of poverty eradication, countries including Brazil, South Africa, India and China - representing the BASIC Group have each highlighted their country\' s commitments to lead from the front on climate change actions. This commitment came at a meeting of environmental ministers representing BASIC, held at the 27th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on Tuesday. The meeting was chaired by Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Minister Barbara Creecy, and attended by Minister for the Environment of Brazil, Joaquim Leite, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of the Republic of India Bhupender Yadav, and China Special Envoy for Climate Change XIE Zhenhua, among others. The COP27 South Africa noted that it is guided by a national framework on Just Transition and an investment plan that outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve its decarbonisation goals over the next five years.  South Africa has submitted a Climate Change bill before its parliament and commenced implementation of its national Adaptation Strategy, the officials said. \</doc>

Climate Conference of the Parties (COPs) are not an end in themselves but a meeting point to assess and define the road ahead. Indeed, the COP27 It is important to see this as a development COP and not just an environmental get-together. It is important to consider the African COP as a way to shift the narrative of the climate transition from one focusing on the continent as a risk to the global drive towards decarbonisation \- such as security threats,  inability of African countries to meet targets, among others \- to a constructive narrative on opportunities. Africa\' s own climate issues tend to be viewed through a parochial lens. As a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report noted, those who discuss African climate issues tended to be people outside of the continent rather than from the continent. Furthermore, it is usually a framing that wraps Africa\' s own climate challenges as victims without agency. To be more precise: Africa is often talked of, and perceived as, a place in need of others\' care. It is important to have a vision that ties climate resilience with economic resilience. Economic resilience speaks to a concern \- to ensure that dependency on enclave economies (dominated by resource extraction and mining to port infrastructure investments) has a broader base. As it was for the oil and gas industries, the growing interests in Africa\' s minerals is critical for the clean energy revolution. Specifically, it is important to ensure that extraction is converted into more sustainable dividends \- increased electrification, industrialisation, strengthening technical and scientific capacity and many other forms of durable capital that protect against the ups and downs of economic cycles, given that Africa is still dependent on external trade and investment flows. Resilient economies ensure resilience against climate risks, as an increase in national income and household income supports a more self-reliant trajectory, which is the basic challenge with Africa\' s climate diplomacy at every COP. Africa needs to pivot discussions on adaptation, mitigation and climate finance around its future economic trajectory and competitiveness. Advanced economies and blocs like the EU, with its Green Deal, have turned Paris on its head. Their interventions in scaling clean solutions, penalising flows of carbon- intense goods into Europe and making access to preferential finance for low-carbon technology and infrastructure are aimed at making Europe the leaders in new technology and making decarbonised sectors the new standard for competitiveness. It is in this light that we cannot enter COP negotiations as if the old game is still being played when the new game and rules are stridently shifting the world into a different trajectory. This is the danger of having Africa\' s climate ambitions stuck in old forms of climate diplomacy and style where the breadth of how things are changing outside the Paris process is often not sufficiently grasped. This is why we need a whole economy approach. Ultimately, the Paris Agreement and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change grew out of environmental multilateralism. However, South Africa\' s ability to turn its Nationally Determined Contribu- tions ambition into a platform to secure large-scale climate finance has dramatically brought out the realisation that country platforms, and NDC targets, can be oriented toward driving clean energy investments and we can do that for adaptation and resilience. It behoves us to recognise that country platform ideas were conceptualised as an original idea from within the continent, driven by economic, investment and just transition imperatives, and are new ways to apply more Mission Orientated objectives (because of the scale of interventions and finance required) \- to use the economist Mariana Mazzucato\' s framing for how we should think about making Green Deals across the world happen: ambitious, large-scale and impactful. The essence of country platforms is to combine climate ambition, political will and a credible investment plan as a way to package and leverage climate finance and other sources of funding. The aim of the COPs must connect the dots between environmental and social goals that are built within, or are outcomes of, real economic interventions. On the continent, it is not just decarbonisation, it is decarbonisation plus \- decarbonisation must solve the economic question and enhance resilience. For example, energy access is not only about the clean and green but includes cheaper and more decentralised sources of electrification that transforms the model of energy services and access. More importantly, they have other dividends \- especially in the urban sector \- by transforming unproductive informal economies into more productive activities. Furthermore, digital access does not only enhance political voices but also increases the participation of Africans in the global economy. There is a real chance that climate competitiveness, given the size of the African economy, its resource base and the nascent nature of new technology waves from renewables, electric vehicles and green hydrogen production are opportunities for Africa. With the right geopolitical partner- ships its presence and role in green industrialism can be fast-tracked. Also, the aim of decarbonisation to meet new net-zero goals can be met. Never has there been an opportunity to do something different and rethink traditional forms of climate diplomacy as at the COP 27 in Sharm el-Sheikh.

African nations united in message to COP27 African countries are heading to the COP27 climate conference in Egypt next month with one voice: they won't transition to cleaner energy at the expense of their people or follow an agenda set by the developed world. Ministers and leaders from several countries on the continent attending the annual Africa Oil Week conference in Cape Town this week acknowledged the need to move to low-carbon energy, but are adamant they won't be dictated to by Western countries, which built their economies on fossil fuels. They noted that in the past two decades, Africa's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions fluctuated between just 3% and 4% - the smallest share among all the world's regions. Climate change is arguably the most pressing issue facing the planet. More than 70 countries, including China, the US and the EU - the world's biggest polluters - have agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible by 2050, a target known as net zero. If successful, the target would cover about three-quarters of global emissions, according to the UN. "Africa's lack of energy means it has to utilise all forms of its abundant and untapped energy resources," said Amani Abou-Zeid, the AU commissioner for infrastructure and energy. "The estimates are that we need to quadruple efforts if we are to reach universal access to energy. It is a difficult path ahead of us. Now is not the time for picking and choosing how we are going to get there." Even if all available resources were used, including fossil fuels, the continent's emissions would not exceed 3.5% of the global total, Abou-Zeid said. "This is a figure that needs to be remembered before anyone starts lecturing or preaching to Africa about emissions or how it must reduce its footprint. When we use all the resources at our disposal, we are still doing it with a very low carbon footprint," she added. "Our ambition is simply to have fast-growing economies that are competitive and industrialised." South African minister of mineral resources & energy Gwede Mantashe told delegates that demands for Africa to abandon fossil fuels sat uncomfortably with energy poverty. "We do not have enough energy. It's that simple," he said. The priority is to meet the continent's needs rather than trying to pacify developed countries or environmental groups, he added. "I see the protests outside this venue that say fossil fuel is a killer, but I can tell you that hunger kills faster," Mantashe said. Developed countries were quick to point out that Africa needed to move away from fossil fuels, yet when facing energy crises were only too happy to rely on Africa's coal, he added. "In South Africa, we have seen the increase of coal purchased from the EU growing eightfold. As they take our coal, they at the same time tell us to move out of it quickly," he said. "That is a contradiction." Ibrahim Matola, Malawi's minister of energy, said hungry people knew no law. "You cannot come to Africa with your bottled water and tell us we cannot have any water," he said. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, secretary-general of the African Petroleum Producers' Organisation, said the obligation was first and foremost to bring the continent out of poverty. Doing that would include using oil and natural gas and the continent was not planning to bypass resources it had in abundance, he said. That view was echoed by Ugandan energy & mineral development minister Ruth Nankabirwa, who said African countries have no intention of abolishing investment in oil and natural gas, even if it is opposed by the international community at large. "It's like you are asking Africa to be poor," she said. Claude Illy, energy sector leader for Sub-Saharan Africa at auditing, financial and advisory firm Deloitte, said the energy crisis in Europe in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine "has demonstrated that the energy transition cannot and will not happen overnight. It will be a gradual process that should benefit both Africa and the developed world. Any transition plan needs to meet international objectives but also satisfy the agenda of African countries that have the right to develop their natural gas and oil resources." Mantashe said African governments were not denying the need for an energy transition, but taking developmental needs into account "it must be managed systematically. It must include the use of gas and renewable energy and other energy sources, while scaling down the over-reliance on coal." He said the transition to low-carbon economies would have to be sustainable and ensure energy security, job security and economic growth. Oil and natural gas were a sure way to accelerate and guarantee affordable change, he added. According to Illy, moving to natural gas is the only viable solution to deal with SA's energy crisis. "The government should do everything in its power to help recover the two offshore [gas] resources, Brulpadda and Luiperd. These projects are potential game-changers ... Monetising these resources as quickly as possible makes sense for the country." Gas discoveries in Namibia and Mozambique have the potential to address energy shortages, he said. French energy company TotalEnergies suspended a $20bn liquefied natural gas export project in northern Mozambique in March 2021 after attacks linked to Islamic State, but is expected to make a decision by March 2023 to resume work. Mozambique's Antonio Saide, vice-minister of mineral resources & energy, said regional energy partnerships were the key to developing the continent's oil and natural gas assets. "We should not just be looking at our internal demand but how we can improve regional integration working together to solve the energy crisis." "Africa is not the one polluting, yet we are suffering and expected to reduce our emission impact," Saide said. Ruth Nankabirwa, Uganda's minister of energy & mineral development, was a delegate at the Africa Oil Week 2022 conference in Cape Town. Reuters \</doc>

Climate change is a global problem that requires cooperation between all nations. That's why today more than 30 newspapers and media organisations in more than 20 countries have taken a common view about what needs to be done. Time is running out. Rather than getting out of fossil fuels and into clean energy, many wealthy nations are reinvesting in oil and gas, failing to cut emissions fast enough and haggling over the aid they are prepared to send to poor countries. All this while the planet hurtles towards the point of no return - where climate chaos becomes irreversible. Since the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow 12 months ago, countries have only promised to do one fiftieth of what is needed to stay on track to keep temperatures within 1.5\'b0C of pre-industrial levels. No continent has avoided extreme weather disasters this year\~ - from floods in Pakistan to heatwaves in Europe, and from forest fires in Australia to hurricanes in the US. Given that these came about from elevated temperatures of about 1.1C, the world can expect far worse to come. As many nations seek to reduce their reliance on Russia, the world is experiencing a "gold rush" for new fossil fuel projects. These are cast as temporary supply measures, but they risk locking the planet into irreversible damage. All this underlines that humanity has to end its addiction to fossil fuels. If renewable energy was the norm there would be no climate emergency. The world's poorest people will bear the brunt of the destruction wrought by drought, melting ice sheets and crop failures. To shield these groups from the loss of life and livelihoods will require money. Developing countries, says one influential report, need $2 trillion annually to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with climate breakdown.\~ Rich countries account for just one in eight people in the world today but are responsible for half of greenhouse gases. These nations have a clear moral responsibility to help. Developing nations should be given enough cash to address the dangerous conditions they did little to create - especially as a global recession looms. Rich nations should deliver on the promise of previously committed funds - such as the $100bn a year from 2020 - to signal their seriousness. As a bare minimum, a windfall tax on the combined profits of the largest oil and gas companies - estimated at almost $100 billion in the first three months of the year - needs to be enacted. The United Nations was right to call for the cash to be used to support the most vulnerable. But such a levy would only be the start. Poor nations also carry debts that make it impossible to recover after climate-related disasters or protect themselves from future ones. Creditors should be generous in writing off loans for those on the frontline of the climate emergency. These measures need not wait for coordinated international action. Countries could implement them on regional or national levels. A nation's cumulative emissions must be the basis of its responsibility to act. While private finance can help, the onus is on big historical emitters to stump up the money.\~ Solving the crisis is the moonshot of our times. Getting to the moon succeeded within a decade because huge resources were devoted to it. A similar commitment is needed now. But an economic crisis has reduced rich countries' appetite for spending and the planet risks being trapped in fossil-fuel-dependence by a rearguard action of big business. Yet during the pandemic central banks across the world lubricated states' expenditure by buying up their own governments' bonds. The trillions of dollars needed to deal with the ecological emergency demands such radical thinking returns. \~This is no time for apathy or complacency; the urgency of the moment is upon us. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change must be about the power of argument not the argument of power. Key to maintaining the consensus in Egypt is not to let disputes over trade and war in Ukraine block global climate diplomacy. The UN process may not be perfect. But it has provided nations with a target to save the planet, which must be pursued at Cop27 to stave off an existential risk to humanity.

COP27Climate change emergency is far worse than acknowledged before In SA, we're fighting for keys to a Ford Pinto when we can go for a Tesla as we insist on our 'fossil fuel rights'In less than a week, the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) begins, hosted by the human rights abusing Egyptian regime. The usual divergence between COP policy and reality will be worse this year - in the past two months extraordinary new scientific evidence of climate instability has emerged. Things are far worse than we feared. The emerging new evidence makes many COP conventions and the "net zero by 2050" narrative hopelessly outdated. Climate scientists have long feared that humanity's carbon emissions will destabilise key natural systems - climate "tipping points" - which will accelerate global warming. The evidence now suggests some of these processes may already have begun. The polar and Greenland ice sheets are deteriorating, and permafrost is thawing in many places. The Amazon, until recently one of the world's great carbon sinks, has become a net carbon emitter. Some polar temperatures have been 40\'b0C higher than seasonal averages - the equivalent of a 65\'b0C day in Johannesburg in October. Also scary is a "disturbing recent surge in atmospheric methane", a 25 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. It usually only remains in the atmosphere for 10 years, but natural mechanisms that remove it are breaking down. Methane is the main constituent of fossil ("natural") gas, which our energy officials want to increase in our national energy mix ("Our ambitious climate goals must be backed up by solid action", October 31). But widespread infrastructural leaks negate fossil gas's supposed advantages over coal. "Climate responses" that include gas are madness. They combine the supposed ambition to capture and store underground one greenhouse gas - carbon dioxide - while pumping out from underground another that is far more potent. Climate breakdown, we are learning, is not slow, predictable, linear and reversible, but messy, accelerating, often unpredicted and substantially irreversible. Many climate scientists are now so desperate to get this message past the fossil fuel shills and soap operas dominating politics and media that in the US and Europe they are turning to civil disobedience (Google "scientist rebellion"). A proper climate response demands ending some outdated convictions. Care for the environment is not a luxury. The environment is the foundation for the economy. Adam Smith observed that in agriculture "Nature labours along with man; and though her labour costs no expense its produce has its value as well as that of the most expensive workmen". Last year, the World Bank said, "Preserving nature and maintaining its services are critical for economic growth," pointing to potential annual global savings of $2.7-trillion. Economic growth is not necessarily good in and of itself; it is a poor measure of prosperity. Yes, we need some growth - of sustainable energy, housing and transport, education, real food and health care. But growth policies that celebrate deadly industries because the headline numbers look good mostly channel profits to elites. Economic policies for all must focus on outcomes. Another essential concept for escaping the climate crisis is understanding uneconomic growth. Balance sheets and national accounts do not capture the full costs of climate degradation, pollution and resource depletion - the so-called externalities - so we live under the illusion that we are growing richer even as we destroy the natural "capital" on which we depend. Development based on fossil fuels comes at such great cost to the environment, climate, socioeconomic stability and human health that it has long failed to deliver net economic benefit. We need to stop thinking that as an African country we benefit from delaying our transition from fossil fuels. Our "right" to continue using fossil fuels became irrelevant once solar became the cheapest source of electricity. We're fighting for the keys to a Ford Pinto when we can go for a Tesla. It's a public policy disaster as self-defeating as the UK's lemming-like plunge out of the EU. BEE via coal and gas has been a con job. In reality, fossil fuels are a recipe for mass black immiseration. It is awful that people were sold a Ford Pinto, and they really deserved better. But pretending now the Pinto is a Tesla is undignified. Having ditched our illusions, we must act. Economies must be retooled to drop fossil fuels as fast as possible, make agriculture regenerative, preserve and rebuild ecologies, and adopt a circular economy. Institutionally, these changes demand stronger democracy, devoted attention to basic rights, and ending extreme inequality. A just transition is important but would be unnecessary if we already took proper care of our people. Profits from fossil fuels must be outlawed. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has called for a global windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. But taxes are insufficient. Fossil fuel companies that are not cutting carbon meaningfully right now - and few are - must be nationalised (as the US did with General Motors and Chrysler in 2008) or put into caretaker administration while they are decarbonised or wound down. We need greater investment in public transport. The maximum permissible size of engines in passenger vehicles must be limited. Speed limits should be reduced to 100km/h (as they were during the 1970s energy crisis). Equally, the silence of social leaders must end. Why are Constitutional Court judges, top sports people and business figures, influencers and politicians not speaking up on the greatest crisis of our time? The death of Desmond Tutu has left a void where there should be many voices of conscience. Raymond Zondo, John Steenhuisen, Julius Malema, Adrian Gore, Thuli Madonsela and others: please speak up for climate justice. Only one university in SA, the University of Cape Town, has had the vision to divest from fossil fuels (after a campaign I helped lead). But divestment is a minimum first step. Our vice-chancellors and CEOs should be leading climate marches. University auditoriums and churches should be the site of mass public lectures to explain the science of climate change. Academics should lead a wave of public climate education. The same urgency and commitment that caused unprecedented public funding towards Covid-19 is needed for climate action. Global climate finance is woefully inadequate, yet even a small proportion of what was spent on Covid-19 could get us on track for meeting the ambitions of the Paris climate agreement. SA must support the visionary "Bridgetown agenda" of Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley for financial instruments to muster the annual trillions of dollars needed to support the climate transition. The science is extremely clear: to have even a chance of averting the worst effects of global warming, we must rapidly eliminate fossil fuels. This means global emission cuts of more than 50% by 2030. "Net zero by 2050" is too slow to avoid triggering tipping points. There is no "remaining carbon budget". If you're in any position of influence please take determined action on climate. If you dispute our analysis, get in touch or call one of our many great climate scientists or civil society climate leaders for dialogue. Honourable mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe, we'd gladly present these facts in detail to you and colleagues.

His brief was to support the motion that "Africa should ignore the world's green agenda and make full use of its fossil fuels".\~ Wealthy countries, whose production and consumption patterns created the environmental destruction with which we all live, now preach from a posture of comfort and affordability.\~ The onus, therefore, rests on wealthy countries to ensure a just transition if they are to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement targets in a way that avoids pushing African countries deeper into poverty, especially in the wake of the inflationary effects of the Russian war in Ukraine and debt difficulties with the United States Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes.\~ But it is not entirely true that divestment imperatives consistently fail to consider the vital role some fuels play in powering the growth of developing economies, as Osinbajo put it. Nigeria, by way of example, is rich in natural resources but still energy poor. It is correct to argue that the transition to net-zero emissions must not come at the expense of affordable and reliable energy for people, cities, and industry.\~ Less right, though, is the idea that continued reliance on fossil fuels will help to aid such a transition, even if the preference is predominantly for natural gas rather than oil per se. This position was well articulated by James Mwangi, founder of the Climate Action Platform for Africa, at the Financial Times Africa Summit. Mwangi's HYPERLINK https://africa.live.ft.com/agenda/session/941590 position was compelling. Missing from too many just transition analyses is an acknowledgement of why countries like Nigeria and Angola remain energy poor despite being oil wealthy. Both countries HYPERLINK failed to translate their prodigious oil wealth into inclusive and sustained development.\~ Clean energy is central to the Nigerian government's plan to transition to net-zero emissions. The goal to electrify five-million households through the Solar Naija programme by 2023 is admirable.\~ Osinbajo nonetheless contests that Nigeria's "citizens cannot be forced to wait for battery prices to fall or new technologies to be created in order to have reliable energy and live modern, dignified lives" and that gas-fired power remains preferable to renewables in the short run. We address three factors in the debate.\~ l First, solar and wind projects, strategically positioned, need not rely on centralised grid infrastructure. Microgrids should be a major focus for African countries in the years ahead.\~ Precisely because they do not rely on the establishment of expensive transmission grid infrastructure, these systems are ideal for overcoming energy poverty. Centralised grid networks should largely be abandoned in a world that has to wean itself from fossil fuels. Moreover, trying to distribute electricity over vast distances is subject to significant energy (and rent) leakage, rendering the system inefficient.\~ While developing countries have concerns over being locked into expensive arrangements entailed in renewable energy projects, HYPERLINK innovative arrangements l Second, the pro-gas argument presupposes that gas is cheap and renewables are prohibitively expensive. But all recent research points to the sheer speed of simultaneous improvements in quality and decrease in costs of solar grids and batteries. A June HYPERLINK https://www.2035report.com/electricity/ 2020 report by the University of California, Berkeley, noted that the US could derive 90% of its power without greenhouse gas emissions at lower electricity tariffs.\~ Gas-fired power stations still take a long time to build, and mega-projects of any kind are subject to unproductive rent-seeking. The idea of natural gas as a bridge towards a green economy sounds plausible in theory, but the practical governance risks are material. By the time a gas-fired power station is built, the costs of renewable energy and battery storage will probably have decreased further.\~ l Third, continued investments into fossil fuels - the exploration, production and burning of them - have two destructive economic effects.\~ First, it comes at the opportunity cost of allocating resources towards building local industries that can improve and expand renewables. Foregoing the latter risks leaving African countries even further behind their industrialised counterparts.\~ Second, it locks countries into destructive path-dependence because mega-projects typically exhibit sunk-cost fallacies. South Africa's two newest coal-fired power stations, for instance, are still not fully operational and have incurred significant cost and time overruns.\~ African countries have an opportunity to leapfrog traditional industrialisation paths by tapping into global value chains associated with the transition to clean energy.\~ On the grounds of justice, it is technically true that African countries should not be denied the opportunity to exploit their natural gas reserves. But there are practical moral barriers to such arguments. Past experience, for instance, strongly suggests that fossil fuels are unlikely to suddenly transform energy poverty into wide\£d-scale electrification.\~ Justice is ultimately about ensuring that we entrust a better world to our children and grandchildren. The divestment movement provides an opportunity to truncate the negative historical relationship between environmental degradation and income per capita.\~ African countries have HYPERLINK https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003001317-10/mining-low-carbon-economy-anja-berretta-ross-harvey vast quantities of minerals and metals that the world requires for the global transport and energy revolutions, along with other new technologies. African countries' focus should be on exploiting those in ways that develop our capabilities to optimally tap into the global value chains associated with new products such as solar panels, electric vehicles, batteries, and wind turbines.\~ The idea of justice in the context of an energy transition places a moral imperative on all countries - developed and developing - to be assessed under the same rules. At the core of arguments made by Osinbajo and Ayuk is that the approach of developed countries to the energy transition is hypocritical. For instance, Germany and other European countries returned to the use of fossil fuels after Russia's invasion of Ukraine having previously led the charge to shift away from fossil fuels.\~ Additionally, clean energy does not address the problem of historical emissions, which will continue to affect everyone. Therefore, carbon capture and storage, carbon sequestration and a carbon tax must form part of plans for a global just energy transition.\~ Ultimately, the key to ameliorating the climate change problem lies in exploiting the opportunities involved in clean energy technologies. There is no silver bullet, but countries stuck in fossil fuel dependency need to break the cycle of rent and energy inefficiency. It will be crucial for countries to come out of COP27 with a collectively agreed-upon taxonomy for the energy transition to bolster the existing rules defined by the 2015 Paris Agreement.\~ It would be a real shame if the conversation at COP27 was orientated around African countries' "rights" to use their fossil fuels instead of appropriate mechanisms by which to finance a justly attainable low-carbon transition.\~ After all, one can be right and still lose; we only have one shared planet.

SOUTH Africa\' s Just Energy Transition Programme (JETP) has been given further boost with a R7.2 billion investment by the European Investment Bank (EIB) to generate an additional 1 200MW of solar and wind energy. This comes after French and German public development banks, AFD and KfW, extended R10.7bn in concessional financing to South Africa to support the country\' s efforts to reduce its reliance on coal through a just transition to cleaner energy sources. On Friday the EIB and the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) formally agreed EIB financing that will back a new targeted financing programme to unlock \€ 400 million, or R7.2bn, for private sector renewable energy investment across South Africa. The agreement was signed at the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP27 , in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The initiative will be backed by \€ 200m from the EIB and provide financing for a range of new renewable energy projects across South Africa. The scheme is earmarked to increase clean energy power generation and contribute to DBSA\' s Embedded Generation Investment Programme (Egip) that is co-financed by the Green Climate Fund. DBSA\' s Egip supports the development and upscaling of solar photovoltaic and wind renewable energy embedded generation projects, developed by independent power producers operating by offering a credit support mechanism through the provision of risk capital. The Fair Finance Coalition of Southern Africa last week scored the DBSA higher on financing renewable energy generation among six development finance institutions, but said the bank had still not pronounced fossil fuels as unacceptable. DBSA chief executive Patrick Dlamini said they have a clear goal to increase investment in renewable energy and improve energy security, not only in South Africa but across the African continent.  South Africa, like many African countries, is already suffering the effects of climate change, Dlamini said.  This new investment from the EIB in our Embedded Generation Investment Programme is an important contribution to South Africa\' s resilient and sustainable growth. The new initiative is expected to generate an additional 1 200MW of generating capacity and avoid 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions once all the supported projects are operational. The financing will be available for renewable energy projects \- solar photovoltaic and onshore wind energy generation \- and potentially also energy efficiency projects promoted by the private sector in South Africa. The projects it will finance are expected to create hundreds of new jobs during construction and operation and support local companies. EIB vice-president Ambroise Fayolle said they were committed to supporting South Africa\' s efforts to decarbonise, adding that the agreement was the largest ever EIB investment in South Africa.  EIB Global is pleased to build on three decades of partnership with DBSA to boost renewable energy generation which will contribute to energy security and a just transition in South Africa.  The EIB is stepping up our efforts to support green energy projects globally, with a special focus on Africa and economies dependent on carbon intensive activities that are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. President Cyril Ramaphosa last week said the $8.5bn pledge made by the International Partners Group towards South Africa\' s JETP last year at COP26 was a far cry from the R1.5 trillion required in investment over the next five years alone. Emerging economy leaders at COP27 have been calling for the developed world to fulfil its pledges and commitments toward financing initiatives aimed at dealing with climate change. \</doc>

ENERGY TRANSITION COP27 funding decisions 'must help African industrial development' Energy WriterCOP27, the next round of global climate talks, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in November, should see advanced economies fulfilling and expanding on pledges made at COP26 to close the huge funding gap in the transition of African countries to low-carbon economies. Africa needs billions of dollars for the transition from fossil-fuel energy systems to renewables and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. According to Deon Fourie, senior economist at research group Oxford Economics Africa, conditions attached to such funding should be affordable and promote rather than restrict industrial development on the continent. Estimates of Africa's energy investment needs vary widely depending on the time frame and on country-specific circumstances, Fourie said in a presentation. Nigeria, for example, would require about $9.7bn a year to achieve net-zero by 2050, while SA needs about $6.6bn a year to shift away from a predominantly coal-fired energy system. Due to huge public debt burdens and insufficient fiscal leeway to finance large capital investments, most African governments cannot fund their switch to renewable energy on their own. These countries also face challenges in raising finance at affordable rates without further compromising their debt burdens. Government investment has therefore generally lagged private-sector fixed investment from 2017 to 2021. Conditions attached to international financing must be realistic and not stifle growth on the continent, Fourie said. "There needs to be a careful balance between net zero ambitions, Africa's development goals and the need to ensure energy security, access, reliability, and affordability." Conditions must also be fair and not impose restriction on African countries that advanced economies aren't prepared to adhere to themselves, he said. Some of the countries that have committed funds to SA as part of a landmark climate finance agreement announced at COP26 - under which rich countries such as the UK, US, France and Germany will provide $8.5bn to help SA manage the "just transition" of its carbon-intensive economy - have indicated that any new investment by SA in coal-fired power generation would be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of the funding package. According to Fourie, 39 advanced economies and development organisations committed to stop funding fossil fuels, including natural gas, at last year's COP26 climate conference in Scotland. Yet many of these countries are pressing ahead with their own new hydrocarbon developments. Climate mitigation plans for Africa must be pragmatic to ensure that a structural shift to renewable energy does not compromise energy security and affordability, Fourie said. "It is difficult to talk about net-zero emission when over 600-million people on the continent still must get by without any access to electricity," he said Analysis by Oxford Economics Africa of 10 African countries - including SA, Nigeria, Kenya, Botswana and Mauritius - shows that biomass is still the largest source of energy for several of them. In Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, 60%-90% of total domestic primary energy supply comes from the burning of biomass (such as wood and charcoal) and waste. The disproportionate reliance on biomass is a result of inadequate access to electricity and cleaner cooking alternatives. Africa is far from achieving the basic sustainable development goal of delivering universal access to energy, said Fourie. Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria and SA fare best in terms of access to electricity, but in Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, 50% or less of the population has access to electricity. However, even in countries that perform better in terms of electricity access, the poor state of electricity infrastructure contributes to uncertainty of supply. For example, in Kenya about 24% of electricity generated is lost during transmission; in Nigeria backup generators used during frequent power outages is equal to half of the country's total installed capacity. "Sudden, deep and disruptive changes to energy trajectories of countries reliant on fossil fuels may not only jeopardise their energy systems, but can also have serious economic, social and development repercussions. This will be unjust," said Fourie. Other important considerations for policymakers and investors at COP27 should include the broadening of pledges by advanced economies to African countries into tangible finance agreements. In addition, said Fourie, for Africa's transition to net zero to be successful, international financial support should be accompanied by technical support. That should not be limited to mitigation, but should also prioritise adaptation and improving Africa's climate resilience. erasmusd@businesslive.co.za Picture: 123RF/ANDRIY POPOV \</doc>

COP26 held in Glasgow, Scotland, last year was a tense affair. Some of the critical themes were loss and damage as a result of a changing climate, access to climate finance and widespread climate action.\~ Developing countries and vulnerable communities were keen to see real action from major economies and polluters. We cannot keep having the same conversations without employing new and creative solutions to the challenges we face. We have to change the way we speak and the people we influence. We have to find new and increasingly accelerated pathways to our goals. The initial conversations surrounding promised climate funding for developing nations to build resilience and adapt to climate change were charged, with $20-billion in funding not having materialised.\~ At a pre-COP event, the head of the United Nations Development Programme Achim Steiner told the HYPERLINK https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58741704 BBC , "Isn't it ridiculous, that in the midst of a trillion-dollar emergency response economy, that we're seeing right now, we are haggling over a $20-billion price tag to essentially unleash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions of dollars, of developing country investments. Time is running out and we can't find a way in which we can finance this. It's just not acceptable."\~ Steiner's position was echoed by Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley in her HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjw_abKiPbI opening speech at the summit, during which she highlighted that the communities living on the front lines of climate change are watching and would remember the decisions taken at COP26.\~ The summit itself received mixed reviews. Negotiators fought to find common ground, and several multilateral agreements were signed, headlined by South Africa's " HYPERLINK Just Energy Transition Partnership Climate finance, loss and damage and more direct climate action did not progress as many had hoped, leaving many activists angry at the lack of support being made available to vulnerable communities. Delegates and negotiators called for patience and pointed to COP27 as the next major summit at which a solution to these long-standing problems could be found. In the meantime, developing countries continue to deal with severe weather events and environmental problems. This year there is a chance to address these in Egypt. International accountability for vulnerable communities\~ Where gaps in financing and support have been identified, many communities are turning to innovative local solutions to build a resilient, sustainable future. An example of this is HYPERLINK https://www.virgin.com/virgin-unite/latest/the-resilience-scorecard-is-transforming-how-caribbean-nations-are The Caribbean Climate Smart Accelerator , which helps island nations respond to the climate crisis. There are also a number of projects all over the continent where communities are harvesting rainwater or coming up with innovative energy solutions, HYPERLINK https://africa.iclei.org/climate-action-at-community-level-african-solutions-that-really-work/ for example .\~ Developing local technology and policy is a key to adapting to climate impacts but funding is critical to growing solutions. Investment from the public sector, considering vulnerability and the myriad competing priorities, compound existing challenges and the injustice of climate change in developing countries where the cost of adaptation is difficult to juggle with other infrastructure and societal needs.\~ Private finance can fill the commercial HYPERLINK https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/focus/20220710/racquel-moses-building-climate-resilience-through-private-finance funding gap but far more philanthropy and bilateral grant funding is needed from larger nations which are responsible for, and have grown wealthy from, the carbon in our atmosphere. We need to unleash all of the solutions in our toolkits, including parametric insurance, carbon credits, impact investment and private sector innovation.\~ In addition to stronger climate action to maintain a maximum of 1.5\'b0C warming by 2100, decisions need to be made on loss and damage and on concessionary and grant funding. The accountability of major nations also needs to be addressed. As climate activist Vanessa Nakate HYPERLINK https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/02/17/vanessa-nakate-african-and-eu-leaders-are-already-breaking-cop26-promises explains , "[UK COP26 President] Alok Sharma is demanding that low-income countries, who have done relatively little to create the climate crisis, raise their levels of climate action ambition.Yet, [the UK] is expanding a coal mine in Wales and is giving a green light to a new oil and gas field in the North Sea - and considering six more fossil fuel developments."\~ Nakate points to the EU's recent designation of natural gas as a sustainable energy source, as well as foreign-owned fossil fuel projects across Africa, as examples of counterproductive climate actions.\~ "These infrastructure projects will, at some point, become stranded assets. The East African Crude Oil Pipeline will only land Africans with more debt on top of the debt. African nations are already struggling to pay rich nations at crippling interest rates."\~ This adds weight to Steiner's question prior to COP26 - how can global powers continue to drag their feet on meeting their climate policy goals when funding is made readily available, and policy changed rapidly, if it benefits vested interests? COP27 must provide answers This year's climate summit, being held in Sharm El-Sheik in November, provides an opportunity for decision-makers, non-state actors and activists from vulnerable communities to problem solve from a different perspective. Last year's summit in Glasgow was marred by accessibility issues due to Covid travel restrictions and the usual barriers of entry that limit or discourage the involvement of smaller nations. Egypt, itself no stranger to HYPERLINK https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/06/15/CF-Egypt-Nile-Delta-sea-level-rise climate pressures , has long been a gateway between Africa, the Middle East and Europe, therefore, positioning it uniquely to host the summit.\~ Accessibility might continue to be an issue for some delegations but having a global climate summit held on a continent with strong grassroots and indigenous activists calling for climate action will hopefully mean more representation from vulnerable communities and more unique perspectives from indigenous communities. COP27 must provide creative solutions to core issues - and it must be a platform for those of us on the front lines of climate change. Together our voices are stronger.

African countries will use the COP27 climate talks in Egypt next month to advocate for a common energy position that sees fossil fuels as necessary to expanding economies and electricity access, African Union (AU) commissioner for infrastructure and energy Amani Abou-Zeid said on Tuesday, 4 October. The African position, criticised by environmental groups, could overshadow global climate talks in Sharm El-Sheikh seeking to build on the previous Glasgow summit and make good on financing targets by rich nations to poorer countries that have fallen far short of the promised $100bn a year by 2020."We recognise that some countries may have to use fossil fuels for now, but it s not one solution fits all," said Abou-Zeid."It is not time to exclude, but it is the time to tailor solutions for a context," she told Reuters on the sidelines of an oil and gas conference.An AU technical study attended by 45 African countries on 16 June seen by Reuters outlined that oil and coal will play a "crucial role" in expanding modern energy access over the short to medium term.In tandem with renewable sources, Africa also sees key roles for natural gas and nuclear energy."Our ambition is to have fast-growing economies, competitive and industrialised," Abou-Zeid said.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/834/232147.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/834/232147.html "There is no way you can develop any economy, any society without energy," said Omar Farouk Ibrahim, secretary general of the African Petroleum Producers' Organisation."We are talking about coal, we are talking oil and we are talking about gas. At this time, we are not discriminating," he told Reuters.Outside the Cape Town conference venue, a handful of Extinction Rebellion activists poured a reddish, oily mixture over their heads to protest."We believe the fossil fuel industry is killing us," spokeswoman Judy Scott-Goldman told reporters. \</doc>

The AfCFTA Guided Trade Initiative (GTI) is the latest development designed to boost trade in the Africa's continent-wide free trade zone. The GTI was launched in October 2022 with the aim of testing meaningful, continuous trade under AfCFTA and to assist in the development of regional value chains that will allow for more climate-friendly, sustainable trade across the continent. The GTI will test AfCFTA's policies, legal framework and operational and institutional environments. There are eight countries participating in the GTI that have all met the minimum requirements in terms of AfCTA's tariff book and rules of origin - Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda, Tanzania and Tunisia. The GTI will allow the shipment of goods from these countries through customs clearance, including ceramic tiles, sisal fibre, batteries, and beverages and foodstuffs, including tea, coffee, processed meat products, corn starch, sugar, pasta, glucose syrup and dried fruits. African countries receiving these goods will benefit from reduced tariff treatment (and possibly eventually from zero tariffs). The GTI will also focus on increasing opportunities for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), youth and women in trade.Simplifying tradeAfCFTA has the ultimate goal of increasing the ease of trade and investment across African borders, as well as eliminating tariffs on intra-African trade, reducing unemployment, increasing infrastructure development and creating a more competitive and sustainable environment for cross-border trade. However, the continent's massive gaps in infrastructure, especially its utilities and transport infrastructure, have hampered the ability of African countries to trade. Transport challenges in African countries, made worse by the issues in global supply chains in the past few years, have caused significant trade blockages, especially with regard to transporting goods to, and out of, the continent's ports. Other issues, such as severe weather events, are also affecting trade supply chains in Africa.For Africa to make the most of free trade, the continent must address these challenges. Projects are already in progress to boost the development of continent-wide infrastructure. For example, Tanzania's construction of the Standard Gauge Railway Project is expected to provide a safe and reliable means for efficiently transporting people and cargo to and from the existing Dar-es-Salaam port. Other large projects underway include the Trans-Maghreb Highway in North Africa, North-South Multimodal Corridor, the Central Corridor project and the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway project.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/513/228562.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/513/228562.html :EMBED-->Further, the African Union African Peer Review Mechanism 2020 noted that Africa's supply chain challenges could be addressed if the continent boosted its manufacturing capacity, reducing its reliance on global suppliers. As a result, many African countries have begun looking at ways to improve their manufacturing capacity so that they can produce local components that don't need to be imported and that can be traded within the continent.Foreign importsA Baker McKenzie report recently found that Africa's external imports accounted for more than half of the total volume of imports in the continent, with the most important suppliers being Europe, China and the rest of Asia including India. By contrast, imports from other parts of Africa account for only 16% of total merchandise imports. Manufacturing GDP represents on average only 10% of GDP in Africa. Limited production capabilities within Africa are therefore being compensated for through foreign imports. The aim is to ensure this manufacturing deficit is satisfied within the continent and enabled by AfCFTA.Shortening supply chains will also make them more sustainable. According to the World Trade Organisation global greenhouse gases (GHGs) released by the production and transport of trade in goods and services account for around 20-30% of global GHG emissions.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/518/224272.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/518/224272.html :EMBED-->Climate financingTo facilitate sustainable trade under AfCFTA, Africa requires a drastic increase in climate financing for its continent-wide major investments in infrastructure, manufacturing capacity, clean energy and climate change adaptation. The African Development Bank (AfDB) has noted that around $1.6tn in financing is needed by 2030 to assist Africa to adapt to and mitigate the risks of climate change, as well as for African countries to effectively implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. These funding commitments have been a key topic of discussion at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in Egypt.A boost in local production and regional trade (currently being developed through initiatives such as the GTI), as well as the development of climate resilient infrastructure and manufacturing will make Africa more competitive globally. If the continent's gaps in infrastructure and manufacturing can be developed in a sustainable way, via for example, investments in renewable energy projects, food security initiatives, shortened supply chains and projects that assist SME, women and youth traders, Africa's free trade successes will benefit the whole planet. \</doc>

Brazilian President-elect Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva on Wednesday declared at a UN climate conference that  Brazil is back on the international stage, pledging to a rapturous crowd his intention to build his nation back into a global climate leader after four years of rapid deforestation of the Amazon. Lula\' s appearance at the COP27 climate talks in Egypt was closely followed by Brazilians and globally by advocates who hope his leadership could prove crucial to international efforts to avoid the worst-case effects of climate change. Because the Amazon rainforest is so vast, its fate is critical to global emissions. And because Brazil is a major developing nation, it has the credibility and heft to pull wavering countries into increasing their climate ambitions, giving it a power that transcends its borders. The talks were entering their final days on Wednesday, as nations argued over how much money vulnerable countries were owed for the damage of a warming world. Negotiators were having difficulty agreeing on who should pay and for what, with especially sharp disagreements about the role of China, the world\' s biggest emitter, which has fewer climate obligations because it is still classified as a developing country. It is unusual for a politician who does not yet formally hold office to dive into international negotiations in a format such as the climate talks \- Lula takes the reins on January 1, and the current president, Jair Bolsonaro, has sent his emissaries to represent Brazil in an official capacity at the talks. But Lula met top officials, including US climate envoy John Kerry and China\' s top climate negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, a sign of the global urgency to engage with a Brazilian leader who, unlike Bolsonaro, does not question basic climate science.  This is an acknowledgement that the world is in a rush to discuss with Brazil again about the future of the planet and the future of the inhabitants of this planet, Lula told a packed room of people, some of whom punctuated his speech with cheers, applause and soccer chants that included his name.  There is no climate security for the world without a protected Amazon. We will spare no effort to bring deforestation and degradation of our biomes to zero by 2030, he said.  The fight against climate change will have the highest profile in the structure of my government. Lula also offered to host a future UN climate conference, suggesting it could be held in the Amazon region. Under Bolsonaro, rates of deforestation in the Amazon reached record highs. Satellite images show the ecosystem has shrunk by about 17%, and parts of the forest now emit more carbon dioxide than they absorb. Preliminary data from Brazil\' s National Institute for Space Research shows that between January and October this year, the deforestation rates were the highest since the current monitoring system began in 2015. That means many advocates depict the election results as a crisis barely averted, even as they acknowledge the scale of the challenges Lula will face as he addresses competing interest groups and a deeply divided society that only narrowly delivered him to office.  We Brazilians were deciding between having an Amazon or having Bolsonaro, said Marcio Astrini, the executive secretary of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, a research group. Lula  really understands the weight of these agendas. In one first measure of Brazil\' s newly open attitude toward international climate co-operation, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia on Monday announced an initiative to try to channel international funding toward forest protection efforts. The plan left many details unresolved, but advocates still said that the fact that Brazil was engaging in international projects was a promising sign for the future, especially as an international leader in fighting deforestation.  The 60 million Brazilians who voted for Lula may well have voted to save the planet, said Steve Schwartzman, who oversees tropical forest policy at the Environmental Defense Fund. Lula was Brazil\' s president from 2003 until 2010, a stretch during which Amazon deforestation also decreased even though climate issues were not the dominant focus of his presidency. But he made global warming and deforestation major issues in this year\' s campaign and vowed in his victory speech last month to elevate climate issues during his presidency \- which was why he decided to attend the summit even though he is not yet in office. The decision to go to COP27 created a logistical challenge, and he has received some criticism in Brazil for travelling to Egypt in a private jet owned by a businessman who has been investigated for corruption. Lula\' s party acknowledged the political cost but said he could not afford to pay for his private transportation and that taking a commercial flight was a safety risk.  Lula is as convinced today about the environmental issue as he has always been about the social issue, Marina Silva, who was an environmental minister under Lula and is his spokesperson for environmental issues, said in an interview last month. Global climate policymakers gathered in Egypt welcomed the interest. They said that given the shared sacrifice and compromises that are often needed to advance negotiations, having the productive engagement of a major country like Brazil can make a big difference in pulling others along. Ghanaian climate envoy Henry Kokofu called it  quite gratifying to see Lula at the Egypt talks, especially after the country\' s relative lack of climate ambition under Bolsonaro.  Brazil is a big brother when it comes to rainforest goals, he said. The importance of the Amazon and the size of the Brazilian economy give the South American country much more clout in negotiations, he said. Rainforest nations, including Ghana have been concerned about how previously existing programmes that pay for forest preservation will fit into a new carbon market being established under the Paris agreement.  Brazil is the forest superpower. So they exercise a lot of gravitational pull when it comes to other forest nations, said Glenn Hurowitz, the chief executive of Mighty Earth, a Washington-based environmental activism group that has fought deforestation in Brazil.  It\' s remarkable to have a head of state of a country as big and important as Brazil, making climate as big a priority as he is, Hurowitz said.  When you combine the US\' s dramatic increase in climate action with the deforestation action Lula has planned, it could make broader international climate action significantly easier. Apart from eliminating the use of fossil fuels, scientists say, preserving the Amazon and other tropical forests is one of the most meaningful measures humanity can take against climate change \- allowing the world to avoid about 1\'b0C of warming. The landscape also plays a critical role in regulating weather patterns; its trees saturate the air with a massive amount of water that ultimately rains down on countries thousands of kilometres away. A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change in March showed the Amazon could soon approach a  tipping point, at which areas of rainforest are replaced by drier, more open spaces. This would release millions of tons of carbon stored in the rainforest\' s soils and trees, making it impossible for the world to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels.  President Lula\' s return lived up to the immense hope of Brazilian and global society that Brazil is back as a protagonist in the fight against climate change, said Ana Toni, executive director at the Brazil-based Institute of Climate and Society.  Only together, North and South countries, can we face this challenge, and Lula clearly understood this responsibility. Additional reporting: Sarah Kaplan reported from Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

Developed nations agreed to set up a  loss-and-damage fund to compensate vulnerable nations for climate change-related disasters at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, last Sunday. Will the new initiative fly, unlike the broken $100 billion Copenhagen promise of climate finance?  There are quite a few environmentalists celebrating victory on the loss-and-damage fund. But I think tough questions must be asked, Dr Patrick Bond, professor at the University of Johannesburg\' s Department of Sociology, political ecologist and scholar of social mobilisation, told Sputnik.  If we\' re not careful, loss and damage funding will fit tightly inside climate finance, an industry that is full of the kinds of disreputable characters we\' ve come to know from the most volatile sector of the world economy: international banking.  The climfin (climate finance) professionals began practising their sport nearly 20 years ago, through the corruption-riddled EU Emissions Trading Scheme (and ill-fated Chicago Climate Exchange), the Clean Development Mechanism, and other offset gimmicks, and accounting tricks needed to hide stranded fossil assets, the professor added. The loss-and-damage concept first emerged during the global climate negotiations in 1991. It looked to describe the impact of developed nations, which have emitted most of the carbon dioxide historically fuelling climate change, on poorer nations, which have not contributed significantly to the problem but suffer greatly from it. The decision to set up a loss-and-damage fund has been called  historic and a  breakthrough by the mainstream Western press, which acknowledged that industrialised nations had long blocked the idea of  compensation for polluting the environment. Still, there is not much clarity about who exactly will pay for the fund and how it will operate.  It\' s not clear how quickly or how this fund will support vulnerable countries, said Dr Nisha Krishnan, director for climate resilience at the World Resources Institute, Africa.  The fund will be designed over the next year or so, with recommendations to be presented at COP28 in Dubai next year. The fund also currently has no resources allocated to it yet. NJ Ayuk, the executive chairperson of the African Energy Chamber, cautiously welcomed the deal on the loss and damage fund.  The real issue here will be the details, he noted.  We are also concerned that it should not be like the other climate promises that have been broken by Western nations. A big part will be clarity on what is considered as future loss and damage aid. The newly reached agreement says developed nations cannot be held legally liable for not paying their fair share.  It\' s been made clear that these resources are not \' reparations\' , particularly as the decision to establish this fund has clearly said this is not compensation of any kind, Krishnan explained. The absence of any legal leverage to hold industrialised nations accountable for not paying to the fund means there are no guarantees that they will indeed deposit money into the new endeavour. This evokes strong memories of the COP15 climate summit in 2009, during which developed nations committed to collectively provide $100bn a year for climate reparations to developing states by 2020, but substantially missed the target. For its part, the US provided only $7.6bn (or 19% of its fair share) in 2020, with Canada, Australia, and the UK giving just 37%, 38%, and 76% of their fair share, respectively, according to Carbon Brief, a UK-based investigative journalism website. In previous years, the $100bn goal had likewise been repeatedly missed, according to Nature, a British weekly scientific journal. What\' s more, the $100bn pledge is minuscule compared with the investment required to tackle the disastrous impact of climate change. It is estimated that the economic cost of loss and damage in developing countries will be between $1 trillion and $1.8 trillion by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF).  Of course, $100bn a year was already inadequate, then and now ... but what, concretely, have climfin watchdogs done to get the missing $75bn/year on to the public agenda, south and north? As far as I can tell, just a few placard demos every November, said Bond.  Meanwhile, the people who really need massive foreign debt cancellations and the West/BRICS climate debt to be paid are butting their heads against the wall, with little or no recognition from the climfin-advocacy technocrats in the climate NGOs scene. In addition, there are no guarantees that the US, one of the most polluting nations, won\' t unilaterally withdraw from the loss and damage initiative one day, the professor noted, citing former US president Donald Trump\' s pulling out of all such UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) obligations between 2017 and 2020. Even though Trump\' s successor, President Joe Biden, re-entered the UNFCCC in January 2021, the new administration still avoids any sort of legal accountability, said Bond.  While climate-denialism was Trump's philosophy, climate-debt- denialism remains the central pillar of the Biden team\' s climate finance policy, he remarked. Meanwhile, some previously established international climate funds have a rather controversial record, not only in terms of underfunding but also in terms of accountability, accessibility and transparency, according to Bond, who referred to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to illustrate his point. Bond noted, citing climate-finance scholars, that since its inception in 2014 three key barriers have prevented GCF from meeting its objectives and delivering finance to the local level. First, GCF lacks a unified framework for identifying and defining the local level, local actors and local adaptation processes. Second, the fund demonstrates limited transparency and accountability about how approved funding for adaptation is spent. Third, some accredited entities have limited experience and capacity for designing and implementing projects that deliver finance to the local level, because the local delivery of finance is not prioritised by GCF during the accreditation of entities. As a result, even though industrialised nations pledged billions for GCF, developing countries complained that accessing money has been too difficult and faced bottlenecks, with a minuscule part paid out, according to Bond. He does not rule out that the newly established loss and damage fund will suffer the same fate, especially given that all major climate endeavours are operated by the same  bureaucrats .  Is there any reform within multilateralism (UNFCCC, IFIs, and WTO) on the horizon, when the same people within the COPs (and in South Africa, the main financial establishment characters) are still the ones making the rules? Bond asked rhetorically. To complicate matters further, the new loss-and-damage fund has been set  in the shadow of macro-economic instability and energy price crisis , according to Vaibhav Chaturvedi, a research fellow at the Council on Energy Environment and Water, India.  Such macro-economic challenges complicate the issue of climate finance as it leads to less fiscal room for the developed world to loosen their purse strings, he said.  This larger backdrop would have definitely been playing in the mind of developed country negotiators. The major industrialised states have been fighting with growing inflation and an unfolding recession, which adds to scepticism related to the newly established loss and damage initiative, especially given that the developed world had not been very generous even during the fat years. EU nations in Central and Eastern Europe saw an economic slowdown in the third quarter of this year, with the euro area annual inflation reaching 10.6% in October, up from 9.9% in September. The European Commission expects that most EU countries will be engulfed by a recession in the last quarter of this year.

The shadow of Europe's energy crisis - and the rich world's resurgent hunger for fossil fuels - looms over HYPERLINK COP27 , the annual international climate talks to be held in Egypt in November.\~ As the first HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop Conference of the Parties Debates are raging over the adequacy of climate finance, the responsibilities of high emitters to the most vulnerable countries, and investment rules for natural gas. This should be Africa's year to get the best deal possible but African and European views are sharply diverging over the shape and ambition of the continent's energy transition. African negotiators are at risk of making a tactical mistake if they cede ownership of their technology choices - particularly over the use of local gas - in exchange for vague new pledges of climate cash. In May, 10 African energy ministers declared gas to be a transition fuel, helping countries move from coal and diesel power to renewable energy, and increased their goal of how much electricity each person needs.\~ HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-change/ climate-related damage For African leaders, giving up control over their energy future would be a moral and strategic surrender. Here are five hard truths that explain why. 1. Rich countries will always prioritise their own energy security over climate All countries have to balance multiple national goals but when push comes to shove, energy prices and domestic jobs have always superseded emissions cuts, a phenomenon that political scientist Roger Pielke in 2010 called the "Iron Law" of climate policy. That explains why, just months after pledging aggressive timelines for reaching net zero emissions, Germany restarted its coal plants, Norway ramped up gas production and other Europeans scrambled to secure long term gas contracts. Germany's chancellor travelled to Senegal, in part to secure his country's access to West African gas. Whatever is pledged at climate summits, rich countries themselves are not yet abandoning gas. 2. Rich countries will continue to object to Africans getting financing for gas projects on climate grounds Before HYPERLINK Russia 's invasion of HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/ukraine/ Ukraine in February this year triggered the energy crisis in Europe, the remaining tolerance for financing gas projects in Africa had been growing thin. The World Bank stopped investing in projects to get oil and gas out of the ground in 2019, while agreeing to allow exceptions for some projects that refined oil and gas, but under stringent conditions. In 2021, influential European shareholders proposed getting rid of all these exceptions by 2025. None of these policies - designed to dissuade poor countries from building infrastructure for gas-fired power, fertiliser production and cooking gas - applied to rich countries. Despite the energy crisis and Europe's African gas shopping spree, the policies intended to hold back gas infrastructure on the continent remain. The hypocrisy has not been lost on anyone. In a candid moment, the European Union's climate czar, HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/timmermans_en Frans Timmermans , said: "Many of our citizens in Europe will not buy [the moral] argument today because their worries are linked to their own existence in this energy crisis."\~ 3. The promised windfall of new climate finance for poor countries is not happening At the 2009 COP, rich countries promised to find an additional $100-billion a year in climate finance for poor countries. Not only has that figure never been reached, little of the billions reported as climate funding is new. Most of this involved relabelling standard aid projects as climate-related. Aid, even genuinely additional aid, is mainly controlled by donors and they are not giving up control of how it is used. That's why African leaders trading away policy flexibility for new promises makes little sense. Big climate cheques are not coming. 4. Rich countries will never agree to pay for loss and damages The "polluter pays" principle means the case for transfers from wealthy emitters to vulnerable poor non-emitters is ethically strong. Resources are needed for African countries to grow their economies, repair damage and build climate resilience. But rich countries have already made clear that they reject the notion of legal liability for climate reparations.\~ At the African Ministerial Conference on Environment in Dakar earlier this month, the United States' special climate envoy, John Kerry, declared that: "Mother Nature does not care where those emissions come from."\~ 5. Africa giving up control of its own policies in exchange for big payouts is a recipe for failure The pattern at climate and development summits has become familiar: moral arm- twisting, agreeing to a large aid number, a flurry of relabelling, missed targets, finger pointing, rinse, repeat. Conclusion: A strong common position is the only way to counter the divide-and-conquer tendencies of the Global North. Some of the larger economies such as South Africa and Egypt are negotiating their own energy transition packages with the major economic powers. Such deals may help those specific countries but will provide nothing for the others and could have the effect of splitting the continent and watering down demands.\~ Africa needs a common position on the energy transition that asserts its own agency to set policies and pursue development, even if it means some countries will experience short term increases in emissions. Anything less would only widen the global inequality gap and create even worse climate injustices.

The search for energy diversification has taken a more frantic pace amidst the global energy transition debate. Unlike in the past when some countries were skeptical or outrightly ruled nuclear out in the Net Zero debate, it will be one of the options at COP27 in Egypt. The return to nuclear is this time being backed by the European Union and some of the advanced economies that are reversing their anti-nuclear stance during COP26 In June, International Energy Agency (IEA) released the Nuclear Power and Secure Energy Transitions report, which observed a growing appetite for nuclear power. "There has been good progress since 2019 when we made our first report in 2019. Now 10% of nuclear capacity in the world has been granted lifetime extensions. The main message is nuclear is set to make a comeback," said Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of IEA. According to IEA, at the end of 2021, 439 nuclear power reactors were in operation in 32 countries around the world, with a combined capacity of 413 GW. Around 270 GW of that capacity was in advanced economies. One of the key observations is that despite the presence of enormous uranium resources, South Africa is the only African nation with a 1.86GW operational nuclear power plant. Apart from South Africa, Egypt, which is hosting this year's COP27 or the UN Climate Change Conference, commenced the construction of the four 1200 MWe reactors as part of its ambition to provide steady electricity to its people over the next decades. Studies have found that fossil fuels and hydropower dominate Africa's energy generation mix. Renewable sources like solar and wind contribute just 1.6% of the energy in Africa. Energy demand in Africa is projected to grow by 80% by 2040. That is, at 3.5% per year, faster than the global average of 1.3%. As such, several African countries have expressed interest in nuclear power. According to studies by a Ghanaian Research Scientist, Dr Simon Adu, a number of African countries have substantial amounts of uranium deposits, but it has not been deployed in the energy mix. "For example, Namibia provides about 7% of the world's uranium reserves. Sadly, African access to electricity is the lowest in the world according to the World Bank, and infrastructure in many parts of the continent is scarce," notes Adu. As of the end of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, 17 countries in Africa had expressed interest in nuclear energy. These include Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, Niger, Morocco, Sudan, Uganda, and Rwanda. This month, Uganda announced that it was pushing ahead with its plan to put up a 2000 MW nuclear reactor plant to be commissioned by 2031. A team had just cleared the East African country of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to proceed to the next stage of using nuclear for peaceful application. The IAEA conducts an Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) of member states to ensure the safe establishment of nuclear power plants. The last mission to Uganda was in May this year. "As Uganda prepares to introduce nuclear energy to meet growing electricity demand, it is important the government continues to support further development of the infrastructure needed for a safe, secure, and peaceful nuclear power program," said Mehmet Ceyhan, who led the IAEA mission to Uganda Similar missions have been conducted in Ghana, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, Niger, Morocco, Sudan, South Africa, and Rwanda. With the IAEA clearance, Uganda's Energy and Mineral ministry's permanent secretary, Irene Batebe, told IPS that nuclear power would be part of the country's effort to meet its Net Zero ambitions. "As we are going into the energy transition, nuclear power is a very clean option for as long as you manage the waste very well," she said Batebe observed that nuclear remains a very sensitive investment area, especially in Africa, given the radioactive nature of uranium and the consequent fuels that arise from it. "Usually, the question is does the country have a robust legal and regulatory framework. Given the risk of proliferation of nuclear. It is important to emphasize that we are members of the IAEA. So are regulated at global level," she said "From our feasibility, we have decided that we can bring on board 2000MW of nuclear power by 2031. You might think that this is ambitious, but working with IAEA, we are still on course for that target," Batebe told IPS Atoms to Africa Others have observed that Africa cannot afford the cost of putting up nuclear reactors. Uganda, for example, needs $9bn for the 2000MW plant to be located on the shores of Lake Victoria. A Ugandan Electrochemical Energy Conversion expert, Dr Justus Masa, told IPS that rather than spend $9bn on nuclear, Uganda should invest in solar and geothermal. "Germany has installed solar capacity of 50,000 Mw. It has only about six months of sunshine a year. During the summer, they can go 100 percent renewable. Looking at the price of solar energy. I see that solar has enormous potential for us in Africa. I could see that solar is cheaper than nuclear," observed Masa, also a Senior Staff Scientist with the Germany-based Max Plank Institute for Chemical Energy. The Executive Director-Minerals Africa Development Institution (MADI), Frank Dixon Mugyenyi, however, told IPS that while solar and geothermal are viable in the case of Uganda, nuclear should be part of the energy mix in Uganda and Africa. "When you look at Ukraine, as of 2021, 55.5 percent of its electricity was produced by nuclear. They have four nuclear plants. I don't think in Africa we should shy away because of the sensitivities around it," said Mugyenyi, formerly the Coordinator of the Africa Minerals Development Centre (AMDC) According to Mugyenyi, rich countries will use COP27 climate talks in Sharm El-Sheikh to prioritize their energy security, including nuclear. He suggests that the African position should demand packages that include nuclear for energy security. "One of the big issues when talking about nuclear energy and nuclear technology is the governance superstructure because that is critical. We know that from the energy perspective, nuclear is not a fossil fuel. And we need it. But the ability to keep it safe and how it is governed is crucial," argued Mugyenyi As the debate about climate change proceeds at COP 27 , the contrast is that as a result of the war in Ukraine, the energy security issue in Europe and climate change is driving nuclear power back into the agenda. "We have seen policies in many countries and regions. For example, in June, there was legislation by the European Parliament to include nuclear in the taxonomy of sustainable technologies," said Adnan Shihab-Eldin, a Senior Visiting Research Fellow at Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. "Many European Ministers wrote and said to stay on course for decarbonization, we need a change in approach to nuclear power," Shihab-Eldin told IPS. "Even countries that still have had strong opposition to nuclear energy like Germany reluctantly announced that the last three power reactors will remain operating." Countries like Belgium had taken a nuclear phase-out decision but instead decided to extend the lifetime of their operating nuclear power plants by ten years. The UK said it will have eight new nuclear power reactors by 2030, French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested 6-8 new nuclear power reactors, yet they earlier planned a shut of 14 reactors. Climate Change and Nuclear power 2022 report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) observed that over the past five decades, nuclear power has cumulatively avoided the emission of about 70 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) --equivalent to the emissions from the entire global power sector in the five years between 2015 and 2019 -- and continues to avoid more than 1 Gt CO2 annually. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA Director General, said countries, international organizations, scientific experts, and other members of civil society are more unequivocal than ever about the key role nuclear energy must play in responding to climate change. "And the level of public acceptance and advocacy continues to rise. Nuclear now has a firm seat at the table, where it will again be represented by the IAEA at COP27 in Egypt in 2022," he said On the other hand, the European Nuclear Society (ENS) Nuclear for Climate COP27 position paper urged negotiators and policymakers at COP27 to take a scientific and technology-neutral approach to energy policy and financing that can promote sustainable collaboration between nuclear and other renewables. It said Net Zero needs nuclear because nuclear can promote global socioeconomic benefits and can be aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). IPS UN Bureau Report \</doc>

In this year's COP 27 two-weeklong summit in Egypt, which concludes November 18, a rough count indicates there will be 40 different sessions organised by, for, and about, religious engagements in/on climate change and related issues. This is likely the highest number of events by and around religious actors, organised at a COP event. The reason? Religions, religious engagement, interfaith, etc., are the flavour of our geopolitical times. For better or worse. His Holiness Pope Francis and His Eminence the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar were just addressing a major conference in Bahrain on East-West relations, with the King of Bahrain. After also putting in a similar appearance and speaking together with the President of Kazakhstan, in September. Both countries were hosting major international meetings of religious leaders, in the fanciest of hotels, convened from many corners of the world, replete with lavish food banquets and generous hospitality and care for their every need. I should know, as I am a most grateful recipient, albeit not a religious leader, but an aspiring servant to religious multilateralism. But I run ahead of myself here. In convening, countries appear to be competing with Saudi Arabia, which hosted such a seminal gathering (in May 2022, bringing together Buddhist and Hindu faith leaders, for the first time, as equals with their Muslim, Christian and Jewish brethren), as well as with the UAE, Qatar, and Oman, who are also hosting international gatherings of religious leaders this very month. This year alone, there have been over 50 meetings of religious actors, that is more than 2 per month, and this is not a comprehensive tally. Each of these major and rather expensive conferences, provides a platform not unlike the UN General Assembly, where each leader gets his (for invariably they are mostly men) time to speak, often eloquently, about their own faith tradition. Each of these speeches regales with how diligent the efforts of faith/community/organisations are, to secure peace and human dignity for all people. As they remind of the spiritual wisdom each faith upholds, they also speak of past and upcoming initiatives, meant to safeguard dignity for all. Sometimes they also remember to speak about the planet and our responsibility to save it. As someone who spent decades serving at the United Nations and in diverse international academic and development organisations, and now listening to the religious actors speaking, I find myself asking the same question: if each of these governments, and now these religious bodies, are working so hard and serving so amazingly, why is our world the way it is? Why are so many governments and peoples and communities at war with one another inside and outside nation-state boundaries? Why are we listening to hate speech from every type of mouth and all types of platforms given ample media attention? Why are arms and drugs the biggest industries? Why are the rich getting richer and the poor poorer while our planet becomes more bare and parched in one part, and flooded to death, in another? Why is violence of all kinds, inside families and within all communities, a pandemic? Why are medicines, and now even values, a commodity to trade power and privilege with? Why is nuclear war back on the agenda of consciousness and politics? In short, why do we hate/fear one another one another so much, and so deeply? Because what ails our multilateral system, in spite of the speeches (and efforts) of political leaders (in and out of electoral times for those fortunate enough to have genuine elections of their national leaders), and now also in spite of the speeches and works of religious actors, is fundamentally the same: each to his own. Multilateral - as an adjective defined by the Oxford Dictionary, where "three or more groups, nations, etc. take part", is an endangered species. The United Nations, the premier multilateral entity of 193 governments, is struggling to strengthen multilateralism, yet not necessarily by looking internally at its own behemoth infrastructures, or culture. Ever seen an organogramme of the United Nations system? One should. It is a universe of wonder where every human and non-human thought and action appears to have a dedicated office or structure of some sort. But before we point fingers at the political multilaterals (who are remarkably good at either ignoring faith communities, or using them to the hilt, or both), we need to ask ourselves, how often do we see or hear of "three or more" religious institutions (not of the same faith) working together to actually deliver needs to diverse peoples around the world? The answer is, that beyond the speeches, the lavish meetings and innumerable projects, multilateral religious collaboration (where money and efforts from many and diverse are pooled to serve, together, the needs of all, regardless of gender, national, ethnic, racial or religious affiliation) remains rare. Please do not misunderstand: religious institutions are working to serve hundreds of millions of people on every area of need, humanitarian and development - and now also political. Just as Indigenous Peoples are the original carers of all nature, religious leaders and institutions are the original carers for myriad human needs. There is plenty of evidence about this. HIV and AIDS, Ebola and the Covid pandemic highlighted how critical religiously managed health infrastructure is to communities - rich and poor. A glance at the education sectors, psycho-social care, migrants and displaced peoples, and other humanitarian areas of need, will show clearly that religious institutions still serve many, widely, and in the remotest areas. So, it is not a dearth of service to humanity that diverse faith actors need to come to terms with. It is the famine of multireligious collaborative services - as in giving and doing together. At Religions for Peace, for over half a century of supporting interreligious platforms serve the common good in over 95 countries, we live the challenges of multi religious collaboration, on peace mediation, food and human security, migration and displacement, education, gender and women's empowerment, and trying to save together, the world's remaining rainforests, through, among other efforts, the Interfaith Rainforest Initiative. We know that even within the realms of religion, the manner of dealing with these challenges tends to mirror prevailing colonial mindsets, with tendencies to give prominence to one religion, insistence on singular branding, and jockeying for more political influence and financial resourcing. More and more faith leaders - young and older - are (rightfully) expecting financial remuneration for their time and energies spent in international work, thus slowly but surely reversing a trend of volunteerism that used to uniquely characterise religious service and giving. Just as governments are failing to systematically work together as inhabitants and leaders of one planet, and just as too many civil society groups and corporations compete for branding and 'market share', so too, do religious organisations. Some religious entities are replicating a secular catastrophic practice of seeking to build other/new/different/more 'specialised' entities and initiatives, rather than shoulder the heavy cross of seeking to work together in spite of the damning challenges (both puns intended). In so doing, many of these religious actors are effectively dispersing efforts. One of the many lessons of failed multilateralism is that more, or different, or new and/or specialised, may well be the well-intentioned road to hell. When it comes to actually investing in one another's work so that they are speaking as one and serving together, many religious leaders and leaders of religious organisations will smile, say some nice words, and move on to the next sermon/meeting/international conference, or nevertheless doggedly pursue their own special/unique initiative(s). Such that we have now so many religious initiatives, dominated by one or a bilateral religious partnership, or two and a half (relatively tokenistic representation of another faith), working on the same challenges, facing all of humanity. What ails multilateralism is not the absence of resources, tools, values, the clarity of the crisis, or even the will and creativity to serve. Multilateralism fails when some want only their values, truths, communities, nations, cultures, security needs, and/or specific institutions, to prevail. And with the failure of multilateralism is a failure of common humanity, and planetary survival.

Your Excellency President Pedro S\'e1nchez, Ambassadors, Ministers, Officials, Members of the Media, Good afternoon. It has been an honour to receive His Excellency President S\'e1nchez and his delegation. We have just concluded a very successful engagement, where we exchanged views on how to consolidate and deepen the bilateral relations between our two countries. I am pleased to indicate that we held in-depth discussions on deepening trade and investment between South Africa and the Kingdom of Spain. Later today, President S\'e1nchez and I will engage with business leaders from Spain and South Africa at a business forum. South Africa is greatly encouraged by Spain's interest and investment in sectors that are key to the development and growth of our economy. It is only through collaboration, foreign direct investment and growing trade that we can overcome poverty, inequality and unemployment. South Africa and Spain are the two largest exporters of citrus fruit globally. During our discussions, President S\'e1nchez and myself agreed that a solution is needed regarding the new regulations imposed by the bloc on South African citrus fruit imports, and he has assured that there was a commitment to address the matter and find solutions. Through a process of rural development, land reform and enlarging the role of youth and women in agriculture, more producers will enter the agricultural space and we have seen this with more black citrus farmers entering this space as well. We would like to see them grow and gain access to key markets like Spain and the rest of the EU. The Kingdom of Spain has played an important role in the global response to the pandemic, supporting COVAX with funding and vaccine donations, donating more than 20 million vaccine doses to African countries, and providing financial support to the Global Fund, among other efforts. We also had an opportunity to discuss issues of regional and international importance. South Africa and Spain are fully committed to preserving and strengthening the rules-based multilateral system as the primary instrument for the resolution of conflicts and other global challenges. We pledged to work together to achieve a prosperous, secure and peaceful future for those areas on our respective continents facing conflict and instability. With less than a month to go before the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , we discussed avenues for collaboration as part of the global response to combat climate change. South Africa and Spain agree that climate change, the loss of biological diversity and other environmental challenges must be addressed within the context of sustainable development. An important part of our collective response to climate change is increased support for green, sustainable energy policies and technologies. Several Spanish companies are active in the renewable energy sector in South Africa and we want to see such investments expanded. This is a call I will be making at the business forum later today. We welcome Spain's interest in collaborating on our national effort to achieve a just transition to a low-carbon, climate change resilient economy and society. President S\'e1nchez and I re-affirmed the bonds of friendship and solidarity that exist between our two countries. And we look forward to continued engagement that will benefit the peoples of Spain and South Africa. I thank you. \</doc>

While thousands of international delegates gather at Sharm el Sheik in Egypt for the Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), KwaZulu-Natal will at the weekend welcome delegates who will be attending the 20th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture, which will place climate change under the spotlight. For the first time in history, KwaZulu-Natal will be hosting the prestigious annual lecture, which will take place at Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre (ICC) in Durban on Saturday, 12 November 2022. The lecture will be held under the theme 'Social Bonding and Decolonisation in the Context of the Climate Crisis: Perspectives from the Global South', and Prime Minister Mottley is expected to delve on the impact and responses to climate change, especially in the developing world. KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, has welcomed the hosting of the lecture and the fact that the Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF) is using the lecture to focus on climate change, just as the world gathers for COP27 and following the devastating April floods, which left many families displaced. 'On behalf of the people of KwaZulu-Natal it is an honour to be hosting the 20th Nelson Mandela Lecture, an event that attracts global attention and which will focus much-needed attention on our province. 'We are also honoured that the lecture will be given by the Prime Minister of Barbados. This is a clear demonstration of the world's solidarity with the people of our province as we recover from the destructive impact of this recent climate change-related weather condition,' Dube-Ncube said. Ensuring full implementation of Paris Agreement COP27 , which takes place from 06 to 18 November 2022, opened with the key aim of ensuring full implementation of the Paris Agreement and Convention. UN Secretary-General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres noted that this year's COP27 takes place against a backdrop of extreme weather events worldwide, an energy crisis propelled by the war in Ukraine, and scientific data, reiterating that 'the world is not doing enough to tackle carbon emissions and protect the future of our planet.' The Secretary-General said COP27 must deliver a 'down-payment' on climate solutions that match the scale of the problem. 'Climate change is the defining issue of our age. It is the central challenge of our century, and it is unacceptable, outrageous and self-defeating to put it on the back burner. 'Indeed, many of today's conflicts are linked with growing climate chaos. The war in Ukraine has exposed the profound risks of our fossil fuel addiction,' Guterres noted. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

Remarks by the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment her Excellency Barbara Creecy during the opening of the 13th Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin, Germany Excellencies, A special word of thanks to thank Chancellor Scholz and the government of Germany for organizing this important. Congratulations to the Arab Republic of Egypt as the incoming Presidency of COP27 . We look forward to the African COP. South Africa is further accelerating its climate actions, in the context of just transitions and sustainable development. Since COP 26, we have finalised our Just Transitions Framework, which will form the basis for our long-term climate action. To this end, we have set up a Task Team to develop an investment plan for the Just Energy Transition Partnership or 'JETP' announced in Glasgow, with our Partner countries - Germany, France, the UK, the US and the EU. However, we are very concerned at the lack of progress in the multilateral negotiations under the UNFCCC on key areas since COP 26. The discussions on loss and damage, finance, adaptation, and the just transition remain trapped in process-related discussions. Last year in Glasgow some developing countries were vilified for stressing their national circumstances in relation to some of the desired outcomes in the Glasgow Climate Pact. Yet just over six months after Glasgow we're witnessing many developed countries reverting back to coal in response to their negative national circumstances. We cannot have backtracking by developed country Parties. Developed countries must continue taking the lead with ambitious action. The ultimate measure of climate leadership is not what countries do in times of comfort and convenience, but what they do in times of challenge and controversy. Climate change is currently costing African countries between three and five percent of their GDPs. Regionally, Africa is experiencing extreme climate impacts which the Continent had very little role in causing. The African continent supports ambitious realism which recognises our special circumstances and our need to negotiate pathways that meet both the developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations The adaptation agenda truly needs a 'Boost' at COP27 . A "Boost" that will promote its global visibility, balance and scale-up. For Africa, the Global Goal on Adaptation must increase the resilience of our population to the adverse impacts of climate change by at least 50% by 2030 and by at least 90% by 2050. Focus must be placed on the most vulnerable people and communities; To support health and well-being; food and water security; infrastructure and the built environment; as well as ecosystems and ecosystem services. The reality is we have failed in promoting adequate ambition on finance. To put things in perspective: according to the UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance, developing countries need between 5 to 11 trillion US dollars, to meet their climate objectives. And yet according to the OECD only around US$ 80 billion was mobilised. This represents less than 2% of developing country needs. The only way we can re-establish credibility in financial provision is to set a realistic goal for developed countries to mobilise at least one trillion US dollars per annum to assist developing countries meet their climate change objectives. COP 27 needs to focus on supporting a people -centered just equitable transition in the developing world. The urgent need is to adapt now, while we build resilience for the future. We can only avoid loss and minimize damage with the appropriate scale of public finance that does not exacerbate the indebtedness of Africa. \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa says the transition from coal dependent energy sources towards cleaner energy must be in line with South Africa's developmental goals. The President was addressing the nation through his weekly newsletter on the eve of the 2022 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also known as COP27 . 'Although South Africa is playing its part in the global climate change effort, we have been consistent in emphasising our right to development. We must ensure that the transition to a low-carbon, climate change resilient economy does not jeopardise our developmental goals. 'The move from fossil fuels to greener, cleaner energy sources cannot take place at the expense of economic growth and job creation,' he said. The President reflected that COP27 comes at a time when developing countries face 'increasing pressure' to decarbonise. He added that for that to happen, developed economies must fulfil commitments to assist smaller economies to 'meet their climate change commitments'. 'Seven years since the Paris Agreement was adopted at COP21, countries with developed economies have largely failed to honour their commitments to provide substantial financial support for climate actions in developing economies. 'One of the issues we will be highlighting at COP27 is that multilateral financial institutions need to lower the cost for developing economies to borrow money to fund their climate adaptation and mitigation efforts,' President Ramaphosa said. Climate change impact The President reflected that historically, the continent of Africa 'bears the least responsibility for climate change, but it is Africa that is feeling its effects most'. He cited recent flooding in parts of the country which claimed more than 400 lives and destroyed public and private infrastructure as an indication of the effects of climate change. 'Many people may think that the discussions taking place in Egypt at COP27 are far removed from their everyday lives. This is far from the case. We all have a clear stake and an abiding interest in the outcomes of COP27 . 'The flooding earlier this year, the wildfires in the Table Mountain range, the locust plague outbreak in parts of the Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape, are all associated with climate change. They affect our health and safety, our social and economic infrastructure and our nation's food security,' he said. President Ramaphosa acknowledged that South Africa itself will need 'substantial support...to build the resilience that is needed to protect our country and safeguard our economy' against the economic and social effects of natural disasters induced by climate change. 'It is only with significant additional funding that we can ensure that future generations of South Africans live in an environment that is clean, conducive to health and well-being, and that has not been destroyed because of the inaction of today's leaders,' he said. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

More rich countries keen to support SA's just transition Creecy reports having several meetings at COP27 Energy WriterThe government is confident it will be able to secure more funding from developed countries to support its R1.5-trillion development plans linked to climate change. Forestry, fisheries & the environment minister Barbara Creecy briefed the media on Tuesday on some of the important outcomes for SA and other African countries at the UN's COP27 climate conference that ended at the weekend at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. Creecy said she had some bilateral meetings during COP27 with other developed countries that were interested in supporting SA's just transition energy plan. The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), which was announced at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, last year, secured pledges for $8.5bn in funding for SA's efforts to cut emissions by moving the energy sector away from coal. The pledges came from the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU. SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP), published in the run-up to COP27 , showed the country would need to invest about R1.5-trillion over the next five years to achieve its transition targets. "I cannot at this stage announce anything concrete, but there is interest from other developed countries and we do expect in due course to announce the inclusion of further partners in the JETP," Creecy said. Securing additional financing will be critical to SA meeting its emissions reduction targets. Africa contributes 4% to global emissions and SA about 50% of this, or 2% of global emissions. SA's revised nationally determined contribution (NDC) submitted at COP26 committed the country to reduce domestic carbon emissions in a target range of between 350-million tonnes and 420-million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. That would be a reduction of 20%-33% from current emissions by 2030. "We are putting a lot of effort into mobilising finances for our just transition so that we can achieve that target," Creecy said. In getting towards the R1.5-trillion funding target, she said the money required should be in the form of highly concessional loans and grants. The money so far secured through the JETP has been mainly in the form of concessional loans and it is expected that less than 3% of the $8.5bn will be grants. Creecy said that COP27 also emphasised the need for increased momentum to reform the multilateral development banks and international financial institutions. Developing countries in particular were calling on the shareholders of these institutions to take decisive action to scale up climate finance in 2023, she said. "The multilateral banks that should be supporting just transitions are very risk averse, which makes it very difficult to access climate financing, and it also makes it very expensive. In our view, development banks should be less risk averse and be prepared to take a first-loss position," the minister said. According to Creecy, SA's classification as a middle-income country is "not helpful when it comes to finding sources of climate financing" because it cuts the country off from access to bilateral aid. "While we might have an average income which puts us in the category of a middle-income country, we know that 50% of our population live in poverty and we also know that we have very high unemployment rates." erasmusd@businesslive.co.za Poor country: Forestry, fisheries & the environment minister Barbara Creecy says SA's classification as a middle-income country hampers the search for climate financing.

Mbongeni Buthelezi\' s unique paint technique takes upcycling to a new level of creativity. His works have been showcased in full colour at the UN Climate Change Conference or Cop27 , currently under way in Egypt. His artworks feature abstracts, as well as depictions of animals. They are vivid and striking, in hues of blue, reds, and violets. The KwaZulu-Natal-born artist\' s masterpieces are created using a technique that allows him to work with  paint made from safely melted plastic waste. The 56-year-old mentor uses a heat gun that emits hot air to melt the plastic. Once the plastic is piping hot, he applies it to a recycled canvas. Every action in the creation of Buthelezi\' s artworks, from the sourcing of plastic waste to the painting process, is a deliberate attempt to minimise pollution and find new uses for what would end up in landfills.  The work that I do is not about impressing everyone, nor is it about an object that hangs on the wall without any meaning. It is meant to create important conversation about climate change. The materials that I use directly inform my subjects he says. Buthelezi is following the tradition of other global contemporary artists who use their profiles and work to support important causes. His activism espouses the spirit of climate action, mitigation and adaptation, all key measures to reducing climate change. This year\' s climate conference is taking place against the backdrop of increasing climate shocks and extreme weather across the world. The UN is planning to use COP27 to launch an action plan to achieve early warnings for the next five years. Plastic waste pollution is increasing around the globe and threatening marine life. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in the oceans. Although many countries, including South Africa, have put in place measures and regulations to minimise plastic pollution, the efforts were still not enough. Through his artworks, Buthelezi highlights and combats plastic pollution. During his time at COP27 , he created a new portrait that amplified his message of saving ocean life from plastic pollution. On Tuesday night, two of his works were on display at a private reception, where people with influence and even bigger platforms got to come up close and personal with his interpretations of the world. His art has also been integrated throughout the venue where the main climate talks are taking place, and they are also adorning the walls at the Bloomberg Climate Hub.  The invitation to display my work here at COP27 came as a huge surprise to me. Although I have done many displays all around the world, this is the highlight of my career as an artist, Buthelezi explains. Buthelezi was handpicked through an initiative backed by Bloomberg Philanthropies, which will also see the charitable organisation donate art and music supplies to students and young people in KwaThema, Soweto and Orange Farm. These are three communities that Buthelezi works with to support emerging talent and inspire ongoing creative responses to the local climate emergency. The funding of emerging artists is especially close to Buthelezi\' s heart. Once upon a time, he was a struggling artist who benefited from the goodness of others. Jemma Read, global head of corporate philanthropy at Bloomberg LP, says the charitable organisation is deeply passionate about finding and supporting voices that amplify climate action.  Tackling climate change requires innovative thinking and collaboration across society. We want to provoke reaction from audiences and support initiatives that allow people to think deeply about climate change and other environmental issues around the world, says Read. Bloomberg Philanthropies is driving several artistic partnerships to raise awareness of climate issues in innovative ways. Buthelezi\' s work on the destructive impact of single-use plastics on the world\' s oceans will be on display until the end of COP27 . \</doc>

Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Barbara Creecy, has called on developed countries to meet their commitments towards climate change adaptation. 'We need everybody to show progress in the implementation of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and need new finances for our Just Transitions, including direct budget support for developing countries to build adaptation and resilience, and to address losses and damages brought about by climate change,' the Minister said on Monday. Addressing the Pre-27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP27 ) negotiations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Creecy noted with disappointment the failure by developed countries to meet their commitment of mobilising US$ 100 billion by 2020. She emphasised the importance of developing nations delivering the $100 billion per year, from now through to 2025, for building trust and faith in the multilateral process. 'Our call for developed countries to deliver on their commitments to meet their goal and ensure progression of efforts in the ongoing mobilisation of climate finance is a fair one. ' COP27 needs to be a watershed moment for implementation by securing the Means of Implementation, in the form of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building, for African and other developing countries. This is important if we are to transition from negotiations to implementation,' the Minister said. The government of the Arab Republic of Egypt will host COP27 with a view to building on previous successes and paving the way for future ambition to effectively tackle the global challenge of climate change. The Minister said the urgent need is to adapt now, while nations build resilience for the future. She appealed for focus to be placed on the most vulnerable people and communities in order to support health and well-being; food and water security; infrastructure and the built environment, as well as ecosystems and linked services. ' COP27 COP27 further needs to focus on supporting a people-centred, just and equitable transition in the developing world. 'For too long, these issues of critical importance to Africa have seen only process-related outcomes in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations, due to the mitigation-centric approach of developed countries,' the Minister said. Creecy said COP27 'We also need an outcome on a key set of adaptation finance goals as part of the GGA, focusing on core adaptation support in a range of sectors, and also as part of the deliberations on a new collective quantified goal on finance, and present a clear roadmap to deliver on the Glasgow decision to double adaptation finance by 2025. 'This roadmap, as stated in the AMCEN Dakar decisions, should include projected annual contributions, the timing of such contributions, and the multilateral institutions that will channel these resources to developing countries. 'We need everybody to show progress in the implementation of their NDCs and need new finances for our Just Transitions, including direct budget support for developing countries to build adaptation and resilience, and to address losses and damages brought about by climate change,' the Minister said. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

Ministers of Brazil, South Africa, India and China representing the BASIC Group met on 15 November 2022 at the 27th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The meeting was chaired by H.E. Ms. Barbara Creecy, Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment of the Republic of South Africa, and attended by H.E. Mr. Joaquim Leite, Minister for the Environment of Brazil, H.E. Mr. Bhupender Yadav, Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of the Republic of India and H.E. Mr. XIE Zhenhua, China Special Envoy for Climate Change and H.E. Mr. ZHAO Yingmin, Vice Minister, Ministry of Ecology and Environment of People's Republic of China. Ministers pledged their full support to the Egyptian COP27 Presidency for a successful conference, which should deliver an ambitious, equitable and balanced outcome, including substantial progress towards the establishment of a finance mechanism for Loss and Damage, the New Collective Quantified Finance Goal and operationalisation of the Global Goal on Adaptation, as well as completion of the Work Programme on Mitigation. The introduction of a dedicated agenda item on a funding arrangement for Loss and Damage, at the initiative of developing counties, is a welcome development. Above all, COP27 should promote equity and justice by recognizing the fundamental equality of all people and their inalienable human right to pursue economic growth and sustainable development, including the achievement of the SDGs by 2030 and ensuring and enabling just and equitable transition of developing countries. Ministers highlighted that despite the enormous developmental challenges and pressures of poverty eradication at a time of global economic downturn and economic recovery, the BASIC countries continue to lead from the front on climate change actions, in the context of their overarching sustainable development imperatives. The ambitious nationally determined contributions goals announced by BASIC at COP26 last year are already being implemented, attesting to the sense of urgency and seriousness with which BASIC countries tackle climate change. The following additional and progressive actions have been taken by BASIC countries since COP26: Brazil increased its mitigation ambition, in 2022, with a new target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, based on 2005 levels. Brazil announced strategic measures for its 2050 climate neutrality commitment, including zero illegal deforestation by 2028, restoring and reforesting 18 million hectares of forests by 2030, as well as encouraging the expansion of the national rail network. Brazil also announced the creation of the National Program for the reduction of Methane Emissions - Zero Methane, which will be responsible for generating economic resources through the reduction of methane emissions in the country. Brazil has also implemented a set of policies and incentives to increase investments in renewable energy, particularly wind power and green hydrogen in offshore areas, reaffirming the country's long-term commitment to an affordable energy transition. South Africa is guided by a national framework on Just Transition and an Investment Plan that outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve its decarbonisation goals over the next five years. South Africa has submitted a Climate Change bill before its parliament and commenced implementation of its national Adaptation Strategy. India is now the world's fifth largest economy and moves forward with a vision of 'One Earth, One Family, One Future' to foster stronger international cooperation in tackling shared global challenges like climate change. India has launched Mission LIFE (Lifestyle for Environment) to create a global mass movement for sustainable lifestyles and a paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilization. Mission LIFE has a focus on encouraging individual choices and actions that support sustainability and create a world of 'pro-planet people'. At COP27 As per the updated NDC, India will reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels and achieve about 50 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030. India is addressing energy-related carbon emissions in its growing transport sector and aims at enhanced electric passenger vehicle sales by 2030; 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025; and rapid progress towards 100% rail electrification and net-zero railways. India has also launched a National Hydrogen Mission. To promote domestic manufacturing and self-reliance in key green sectors, India has announced production linked incentives for high efficiency solar PV modules and advanced storage technologies. To drive initiatives for environment, sustainability and climate action, India has announced the issue of sovereign Green Bonds and promotion of thematic funds for blended finance. China updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets in 2020 as per the requirement to 'reflect its highest possible ambition' under the terms of the Paris Agreement. As a developing country, China has made its utmost effort in response to climate change based on its development stage and national conditions. China is leading a Comprehensive Green Transformation of Economy and Society with Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality, including making the plans on key fields, industries and sectors, and has achieved substantial progress and outcomes, in 2021, China's carbon intensity dropped by 3.8% and 50.8 percent from the level respectively in 2020 and 2005, non-fossil energies accounted for 16.6 percent of energy consumption, non-fossil energy power generation capacity reached 1,120 GW accounting for more than 30% of the global total capacity. China provides around 50% of the global wind power equipment and 80% of the global solar power generation equipment, making an outstanding contribution to the reduction of worldwide renewable energy costs. China has promoted new-energy vehicles vigorously, with a quantity of more than 10 million, accounting for more than 50% of the global quantity. A unified national carbon trading market officially started online trading in 2021. China ratified the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol and made new progress in controlling greenhouse gas emissions in key areas. By the end of 2021, the national forest coverage rate in China reached 24.02 percent with a forest stock of 19,493 billion m3. China has drafted methane action plan, and will control methane emission in addition to its NDC. These reflect China's substantial contributions to global mitigation. Ministers welcomed the key political messaging from the COP27 Climate Implementation Summit, including the need for enabling means of implementation support for developing countries at a time when the Paris Agreement is being implemented in accordance with the best available science and on the basis of equity and the principle of common but different responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of national circumstances. Developing countries require predictable and appropriate support, including climate finance at the necessary scope, scale and speed and access to technology and markets to ensure and enable their sustainable development. In this regard, Ministers underscored the urgent need for a fundamental transformation and modernisation of the global financial architecture, including a systematic reform of the multilateral development banks to make them fit-for-purpose in supporting sustainable development and just and equitable transitions. The key is to address risk aversion in investing in developing countries, to prioritise grant support and to dramatically lower the cost and conditionality on borrowing money that places multilateral support out of reach of the majority of the world's population, including in BASIC countries. BASIC countries are gravely concerned that developed countries are still not showing leadership or responding with a matching progression of effort. There has been backtracking on finance and mitigation commitments and pledges by developed countries. There has also been a significant increase in the consumption and production of fossil fuels in the past year by developed countries, even as they continue to press developing countries to move away from the same resources. Such double standards are incompatible with climate equity and justice. Ministers are concerned that climate finance provided by developed countries continues to fall short of the USD 100 billion per year commitment, as it has every year since the goal was set in 2009, and despite the deep regret expressed at COP26 last year. This is despite the USD 100 billion being only a tiny fraction of the financing which will be necessary for an economy-wide transformation and to meet the needs and priorities of developing countries. Developing countries, and especially the BASIC countries, have to channel many times this amount of financing from their domestic resources or from commercial loans and developing countries cannot afford to transform their economies without assistance. Finance to developing countries is also increasingly with unilateral conditionalities and eligibility criteria, predominantly in the form of loans rather than grants, aggravating the financial constraints faced by developing countries. Many of the pledges to the Adaptation Fund made at COP26 remain unfilled, delivering on the commitment to double adaptation financing remains unclear and there are significant outstanding contributions by developed countries to the Green Climate Fund. Adaptation financing needs to be impact based. The new collective quantified goal by developed countries must therefore go beyond the floor of USD 100 billion per year, be significantly public funded with greater transparency and predictability, provide incentives to enhance access modalities, be periodically reviewed, and take a balanced approach towards mitigation and adaptation in light of evolving needs and priorities of developing countries. For this a clear roadmap for deliberations in 2023, including on discussions on possible timeframes, should be adopted at COP27 . They underscored the necessity for a special report on GGA to be produced by the IPCC to help deepen global understanding on defining and achieving the GGA. We also recognise that adaptation actions taken at the local level have an important global contribution. Minsters emphasised that the Mitigation Work Programme shall be guided by the objectives, goals and principles of the Convention and its Paris Agreement, being facilitative, non-prescriptive, nationally determined in nature, and aim at promoting exchange of best practices, exploring opportunities, and identifying challenges on implementation of their respective NDCs. The Mitigation Work Programme shall not result in an alteration of the goals as set out in the Paris Agreement, imposing sectoral targets and benchmarks, or duplication with arrangements regarding mitigation. Developed countries must honour their Pre-2020 commitments regarding mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation and support provided, without transferring any burden and responsibility to developing countries. Developed countries are required to take immediate actions to close the Pre-2020 implementation gaps. Ministers welcome the COP26 decision on market and non-market mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and the follow up work undertaken at COP27 . BASIC countries encourage the public and the private sectors to make use of arrangements that provide a share of proceeds to the Adaptation Fund, to secure predictable resources. Unilateral measures and discriminatory practices, such as carbon border taxes, that could result in market distortion and aggravate the trust deficit amongst Parties, must be avoided. BASIC countries call for a united solidarity response by developing countries to any unfair shifting of responsibilities from developed to developing countries. Ministers underscored the need for enhancing adequate, predictable and timely technical and financial support for developing countries to participate effectively in the Enhanced Transparency Framework, including establishing a long-term workplan to support developing countries under the UNFCCC. This includes the establishment and enhancement of reporting systems within the national governments of developing countries. They further emphasized that developed countries need to further enhance the transparency of climate finance. BASIC Ministers reiterated their support for Pakistan, as the current Chair of the Group of 77 and China, with a view to strengthening the unity of the Group of 77 and China and advancing the common interests of developing countries. \</doc>

Plea for a new approach on climate Nedbank sustainability head tells of wide acceptance and recognition at COP27 of SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan Energy WriterThe magnitude and type of financing that will be needed to pay for climate change and mitigation will require a new approach to risk on the part of financial institutions. This is according to Brigitte Burnett, head of sustainability at Nedbank, who is attending the COP27 She told Business Day that one of the successes for SA has been the "wide acceptance and recognition" of the country's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP), which was launched at the conference last week. "SA's JET-IP has been well received but there is still a lot of work for our negotiators in terms of really securing the funds that are needed to make the plan a reality," she said. The JET-IP, developed by the Presidential Climate Task Team under the leadership of Daniel Mminele, focuses on three priority sectors - electricity, electric vehicles, and green hydrogen. An estimated R1.5-trillion will be needed to implement the plan over the next five years. The JET-IP proposes to use $8.5bn in financing from Germany, France, the US, UK and EU, under the Just Energy Transition Partnership announced at COP26 in Scotland in 2021, as a "stepping stone towards the country's broader just energy transition plans". Commenting on negotiations for financing to support the JET-IP, Burnett said there has been a strong message from SA that any funding the country does receive "should not belabour the debt situation that SA is in, and that it should be concessional funding that is catalytic in nature". "The plan is for investment and finance, but there is still a need for a funding framework that SA can put forward that will provide more detail around how we action that." In addition, she said, the JET-IP should be supported through an accountability mechanism that can be attached to the plan. "This may help release more concessional funding than what has been coming through at the moment," Burnett said. There is a "huge amount of appetite" among local banks to play their role in financing climate transition in SA, she said. "We are looking at what kind of blended finance opportunities there are to bring together different financiers at different levels, whether it be concessionary funding or development bank funding, or government-supported funding together with the private sector." She supports the three priority areas put forward in the JET-IP and given that the energy sector is the largest carbon emitter in SA it is "definitely the first [sector] that needs to be addressed". But SA should also "think beyond the low-carbon pathway" and include issues such as diversity and ecosystem management considerations so that the country's overall climate change response will "encompass what that means from a larger natural capital perspective". "Many of the businesses [attending COP27 ] are thinking about immediate mitigation elements that they can look at, which is why issues such as biodiversity, agriculture and how we can fund sustainable food production to achieve greater food security have been more topical at this [conference]," Burnett said. There has been a clear call at COP27 from developing countries and some developed nations for a transformation of the global financial system, including reform of multilateral development banks to make them fit for purpose to support just transitions. COP27 released a joint statement saying that this reform should "address risk aversion in investing in developing countries". Burnett confirmed that this has been a priority agenda item. "The main discussion is around how do we revisit and change our view on risk, and how do we advocate for policy and regulatory changes that will incentivise the right behaviour to support financing institutions to take on this type of risk." It has been interesting and unusual, she said, to have conversations with the local banks on how they could work collaboratively to change the finance sector to make possible a different view of risk. erasmusd@businesslive.co.za Key focus areas: SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan focuses on three priority sectors: electricity, electric vehicles, and green hydrogen.

For the first time in the history of climate talks, the importance of water is coming to the fore at a high level, says Darko Manakovski, from the Global Water Partnership, who has been attending the UN COP27 climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt this week. "There is tremendous momentum for the water and climate agendas to be integrated together. Water is being highlighted to such a degree, and it is a positive sign," said Manakovski, the partnership's head of global development. "The drought and flooding we have seen in the last year everywhere, particularly in Africa, means we need to look more at adaptation and need to invest more in infrastructure." Adaptation to change - helping the world's most vulnerable communities and countries weather the damage caused by global warming - across themes including food and agriculture, water and nature, and adaptation funding, are among the key issues at COP27 . "Local action, the way we manage the land, impacts on global hydrological systems and patterns of drought and flood," he says, noting water security is vital to food security and livelihoods. The livelihoods of communities affected by the plans for a "just energy transition" - to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and pursue low-carbon renewable sources of energy while protecting jobs - has been a priority for SA delegates at the summit, from the minister of environmental affairs, forestry and fisheries to activists and lawyers at COP27 . "For the transition to be just, we need an inclusive process where people can meaningfully engage on plans," said lawyer Brandon Abdinor, from the Centre for Environmental Rights, on the need for procedural justice. "Often the most vulnerable people, for example, people who live in coal-affected areas in SA or other fossil-fuel affected areas, do not get to be meaningfully consulted," he said on Friday. "By meaningful, we don't mean a high-level delegation coming in or some officials coming in for an hour or two speaking to the people using technical terminology and leaving again, ticking a box to say the people have been consulted. "The consultation needs to be in-depth ... so people are having a conversation they understand and can put forward their views properly," said Abdinor. The centre represents communities, including in legal challenges when their environmental rights are threatened. On a global scale financial packages have been coming through for mitigation (to lower carbon emissions) and the energy transition to renewable energy, said Abdinor. "There is money in renewable energy for electricity generation, and this kind of thing for contractors and service providers, but we are not seeing that kind of financial assistance coming through for adaptation," he said. The UN has appealed for half the climate funding to go to adaptation, but most of it flows towards mitigation, including reducing emissions. Despite commitments at COP26 last year to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, emissions are rising, scientists revealed in an alarming report on Friday. The Global Carbon Budget report indicates emissions were set to rise about 1% this year, bringing the world precariously close to catastrophic levels of climate change. By 2030, global greenhouse gases needed to drop by 43% to meet the internationally agreed target of limiting global warming to 1.5& xB0;C to prevent climate disaster. Responding to the findings, Prof Mark Maslin, professor of climatology, University College London (UCL), noted carbon emissions were "at the highest level ever" and that there was no sign of the large annual cuts needed in emissions to meet the 1.5& xBA;C target. "There is good news with emissions dropping in China [0.9%] and the EU [0.8%], but these are offset by emission increases in the US [1.5%] and India [6%], with the rest of the world rising by 1.7%," he said. COP27 - emissions must come down rapidly now." - Premium VOICES: Activists hold banners as they demonstrate at the Sharm El Sheikh International Convention Centre, during the COP27 climate summit, in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.

China\' s top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua said he expected to continue direct co-operation on climate change with his US counterpart John Kerry after the COP27 summit taking place in Egypt comes to a close. China and the US are the world\' s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, and co-operation between them is seen as vital to international efforts to avert the worst impacts of climate change. China\' s President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden had agreed to restart co-operation on climate change earlier this week after a months-long hiatus due to tensions over Taiwan. Xie said he had met with Kerry at the COP27 summit as time allowed in the wider negotiations, according to a recording of a briefing Xie gave to journalists, reviewed by Reuters. He added that there was still much to be discussed between the two countries, and the results of the talks could only be announced at a later date. The Chinese negotiator said the conversations with the US were  candid, friendly, positive and active , and that  overall it\' s been very positive . Xie was not asked for his reaction to an announcement by the State Department on Friday that Kerry had tested positive for Covid-19 and was finishing his work at the conference in isolation and by phone. Xie said he could not speculate about the ultimate outcome of COP27 , where negotiations that had been due to end on Friday spilled into the weekend.  We cannot prejudge the outcome, he said. He said China supported the work being done to establish a fund on  loss and damage to help poor countries to pay for irreversible damage caused by climate change, one of the key sticking points in the talks.  (It) satisfies developing countries\' requirement and represents major progress, Xie said about the inclusion of loss and damage on the official agenda. He added that China shares the views of the larger G77 bloc of developing countries on loss and damage and that it is  earnestly optimistic that a deal could be done. While it is the world\' s second-biggest economy, the UN classifies China as a developing nation. Xie said it was the responsibility of developed countries to help poorer countries pay for addressing climate change, but Xie reiterated China\' s view that the fund should leave the door open for all developing countries to benefit, differing from an early proposal by the EU that it should be only for the most vulnerable countries. | \</doc>

Hundreds of environmental groups called yesterday for the issue of loss and damage finance to be on the formal agenda of the forthcoming COP27 UN climate summit in Egypt. Developing nations have for years called for funding from rich polluters to help them reduce emissions while growing their economies and adapt to the impacts of global heating. They argue that historic polluters also have a moral imperative to pay for the loss and damage, impacts being felt that countries cannot adapt to, such as Pakistan\' s devastating floods, that their emissions are accelerating. At the UN climate summit, COP26 in Glasgow last year, countries representing six out of every seven people on the planet called for the establishment of a dedicated loss and damage  facility that at-risk nations could instantly access to help them recover from extreme events. That was shot down by richer nations, however. A loss and damage  dialogue was offered as an alternative before COP27 , which begins in November in Sharm el-Sheikh. More than 400 aid agencies and activist groups yesterday signed an open letter demanding that loss and damage finance be added to the official negotiating agenda. They said discussions around money for impacted nations was needed  to ensure a meaningful outcome at COP27  . Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, said that the conference\' s credibility was  hanging by a thread . | AFP \</doc>

Maintaining the Water Day theme of COP27 yesterday, activists from Extinction Rebellion (XR) Cape Town staged a protest in the form of  sea theatre (as opposed to street theatre) at the Glencairn tidal pool to highlight the threat that rising sea levels pose to coastal communities. The activists were dressed to the nines, sipping champagne and eating cake at a table in the centre of the pool to illustrate how big oil, big gas and governments lavishly make deals to expand oil and gas, drilling while ignoring the literal water lapping at their ankles as a result, representing sea level rise as well as the other devastating impacts of the climate crisis. Yesterday\' s theme at COP27 focused on how climate change affected water and so to resonate with the COP27 theme, the XR team based themselves and their performance in water. XR Cape Town spokesperson Jacqui Tooke said:  We want to draw attention to the fact that the wealthy global north and greedy fossil fuel industry are not only responsible for the majority of carbon emissions which have caused climate chaos, but they continue to make \' dirty deals\' for further fossil fuel exploration knowing that the science is clear \- that we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground, transition to renewable energy and halve emissions by 2030 for us to have any chance of a liveable future. This comes after the Provisional State of the Global Climate in 2022 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) which found that the past eight years were on track to be the warmest on record.  The tell-tale signs and impacts of climate change are becoming more dramatic. The rate of sea level rise has doubled since 1993. It has risen by nearly 10mm since January 2020 to a new record high this year. The past two and a half years alone account for 10 percent of the overall rise in sea level since satellite measurements started nearly 30 years ago, the report states. XR was concerned about how the Global South and poorer countries, least responsible for carbon emissions, were now the most vulnerable to the sea level rise and the many other devastating impacts of climate change. \</doc>

Climate funds 'out of Africa's reach' Multilateral development banks 'need to be reformed to meet needs of developing economies' Economics WriterPresident Cyril Ramaphosa called on developed countries to honour the commitments made to African countries in supporting the continent's right to development, international equity and transitions that are just and inclusive. Speaking at COP27 He said that to do this, multilateral development banks need to be reformed to meet the needs of developing economies for sustainable development and climate resilience. "At present, multilateral support is out of reach of the majority of the world's population due to lending policies that are risk averse and carry onerous costs and conditionalities," Ramaphosa said. "We need a clear road map to deliver on the Glasgow decision to double adaptation financing by 2025." The COP27 "To achieve this, our continent will need a predictable, appropriate and at-scale funding stream and technological support. This must support our right to development, international equity and transitions that are just and inclusive," he said. SA unveiled its just energy transition (JET) investment plan on Friday ahead of the COP27 climate summit. The plan, which is the first of its kind globally, was sparked by the $8.5bn (R128bn) that the UK, US, France, Germany and theEU offered to support SA's just energy transition, at COP26 in Glasgow a year ago. CABINET It was approved by the cabinet last week and endorsed by the international partner group, and is expected to be launched formally by the leaders of the group and Ramaphosa in Egypt this week. The JET investment plan outlines the total investment needed over the next five years - in electricity, green hydrogen and new-energy vehicles - to enable SA to achieve its ambitious climate targets in a just way. Ramaphosa told delegates that at a national level, SA is fully committed to achieving the most ambitious end of the mitigation range in its updated Nationally Determined Contribution. "As a country, we are guided by a just-transition framework and an investment plan that outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve our decarbonisation goals over the next five years," Ramaphosa said. "We are already scaling up investment in renewable energy, and are on course to retire several of our ageing coal-fired power plants by the end of 2030," he said. At COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, France, Germany, the UK, US and EU offered support in the form of a Just Energy Transition Partnership. "It is our hope that this partnership will offer a groundbreaking approach to funding by developed countries for the ambitious but necessary mitigation and adaptation goals of developing countries," Ramaphosa said. zwanet@businesslive.co.za Right to development: President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses world leaders at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt yesterday.

The family of Egypt\' s jailed dissident Alaa Abdel Fattah, who has been refusing food and water, said yesterday that prison authorities had told them he is  under medical intervention . The family have demanded information on the health of the British- Egyptian activist amid what they said were  rumours of force-feeding . His mother Laila Soueif, at the Wadi al-Natroun prison north of Cairo, was informed that  medical intervention was taken with Abdel Fattah  with the knowledge of judicial entities , his sister Mona Seif wrote on Twitter. International concern has mounted since Abdel Fattah, 40, escalated his months-long hunger strike by also declining liquids since Sunday, the start of the UN climate summit COP27 hosted by Egypt. Abdel Fattah, a veteran pro-democracy and rights campaigner, is serving a five-year prison sentence for  spreading false news by sharing a Facebook post about police brutality. A key figure of the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time autocrat Hosni Mubarak, Abdel Fattah gained British citizenship this year. The dissident\' s aunt, novelist Ahdaf Soueif, this week said the family were concerned about  rumours of force-feeding and sleep-inducing drugs . UN rights chief Volker Turk has warned that Abdel Fattah\' s  life is in great danger . Activists at COP27 have posted widely on Twitter under the hashtag #FreeAlaa, and several speakers have ended with the words  you have not yet been defeated . | AFP \</doc>

The UN flagship climate summit is usually a lively affair. As well as drawing world leaders, scientists, and even executives, thousands of activists travel to cities hosting the COP talks staging colourful demonstrations to demand more urgent action and holding events to raise awareness of specific issues. Not this year. Non-profit organisations and activists seeking to attend COP27 in Egypt\' s remote seaside resort of Sharm el-Sheikh say they\' ve faced unprecedented hurdles getting accreditation and finding accommodation, potentially limiting civil society representation, and even hindering the outcome. The restrictions have prompted high-profile Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, who has expressed solidarity with Egyptian political prisoners, to skip what she called the  greenwashing conference. Climate campaigners from developing countries such as Pakistan, where global warming significantly exacerbated this year\' s record floods, have faced particular difficulties getting funding to attend.  The real voices and real struggle of people in Pakistan should be featured on stage, said Pervez Ali, a 19-year-old Pakistani activist with Fridays for Future who, unlike many fellow campaigners, secured accreditation and funds to take part.  The small number of activists is going to affect the results, and the fair and free process of COP \- if you\' re not allowing activists who are suffering the consequences of climate change to tell their stories, if you\' re blocking them, you\' re hiding that reality from the world. Egyptian officials say they are making efforts to ensure civil society groups can participate meaningfully, but the difficulties campaigners have endured offer a glimpse into the challenges local activists face in their home country on a daily basis. Demonstrations are effectively banned in Egypt, and NGOs operate in a highly restrictive environment, their leaders often facing government pressure, trial, and even imprisonment. The crackdown on civil society has worsened since President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi seized power in 2013, reversing democratic gains made during the Arab Spring uprisings, violently crushing protests and rounding up political opponents. That has turned climate activism, like any activism in Egypt, into a perilous undertaking, according to a recent report by Human Rights Watch. Egypt ranks 168th out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index. Despite a series of pardons this year, thousands of political prisoners, including both Islamists and secular critics, continue to be held in its jails, often in poor conditions and without proper trial, Amnesty International said. They include about 21 journalists, making Egypt one of the world\' s biggest jailers of journalists, according to Reporters Without Borders. Among them is prominent Egyptian-British blogger Alaa Abdel Fattah, who has been on hunger strike since April. Wael Aboulmagd, special representative for the Egyptian COP27 presidency, said organisers would ensure civil society organisations are able to participate in all activities except for the negotiating process, which is open only to country negotiators.  We\' ve exerted every effort to ensure their presence, he told reporters at a briefing last month. But the number of accreditations available to attend the conference is limited, and the costs are particularly prohibitive for young campaigners from developing nations, according to the Fridays for Future movement, which estimates that attending COP27 would set each activist back about $7 000 (R128 648). The group launched a crowdfunding effort to send 75 people from Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania, as well as black and indigenous people to the conference. They have so far raised about $19 000 \- not enough to dispatch three people. It\' s not just young activists from poorer nations struggling to make it. The director of a Western research centre who had booked and paid for accommodation in a five-star hotel in Sharm el-Sheikh months in advance was suddenly notified the charge would be increased fourfold, attributing it to a government directive. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the person said their organisation had found alternative accommodation that, even if less convenient, would allow them to attend. Egyptian authorities deny intervening to raise hotel prices for COP27 . The government is subsidising  a few thousand rooms in two- and three-star hotels and hostels, Aboulmagd said. For Egyptian activists, the situation is more challenging than money. Sharm el-Sheikh is a resort town on the Sinai peninsula, one almost exclusively dedicated to tourists and conferences. More than a 500km drive from the capital, it is otherwise surrounded by barren expanses of desert, making it easier for the government to secure, but harder for campaigners to get in. Over the past few weeks, people heading to Sharm el-Sheikh have been stopped at airports and road checkpoints, questioned and forced to turn back, said Amr Magdi, a senior HRW researcher, who, as an Egyptian living in Germany, has been advised not to travel home for COP27 . Though security checks aren\' t unusual in Sinai, where tourists have been killed in Islamist terrorist attacks, including a 2015 aeroplane bombing, climate activists say they\' ve been targeted.  Every Egyptian citizen should be able to participate, but there are a lot of restrictions, he said, adding that those who make it will be closely watched by security services, hindering their freedom to speak openly. Initially, the number of state-approved NGOs in Egypt was so small that the government released one-time accreditations for about 25 so they could attend COP27 , Aboulmagd said. NGOs in Egypt are tightly regulated and those invited by the government to attend are unlikely to be critical or outspoken, said HRW\' s Magdi. While there\' s a margin of tolerance for environmental work, big issues like water security, industrial pollution and harm from tourism, as well as agribusiness and large real estate developments, are off limits, according to activists.  This year\' s climate talks could be undermined without effective and free participation by the civil society, said Magdi,  which is what is likely to happen. | Bloomberg \</doc>

AS Eskom struggles to supply the country with power, President Cyril Ramaphosa was in Washington, cap in hand, negotiating for more money to wean the utility off its dysfunctional coal power plants. Ramaphosa and US President Joe Biden discussed a number of issues on Friday including the country\' s energy crisis, investments and the war between Ukraine and Russian. South Africa has, so far, managed to resist joining Washington\' s campaign against Moscow for the war in Ukraine. The struggling state utility implemented extensive power outages and is scheduled to do so again this week, as Eskom battles its worst period of power cuts since it started more than a decade ago. Following the meeting, Biden announced $45 million (R792 billion) in funding for an $8.5billion multinational venture aimed at accelerating the phasing out of coal-fired power generation in South Africa. Yesterday, the presidency said both leaders agreed that South Africa required more funding to achieve an effective transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.  The investment plan for the transition partnership between South Africa and four Western countries and the European Union is expected to be completed at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in November in Egypt, read the presidency\' s statement. The announcement comes as Eskom is seeking an average power tariff increase of just more than 32% for the financial year that starts on April 1, 2023. Energy regulator Nersa has said it intends to announce its decision in November. The new request means electricity users, already grappling with a cost of living crisis, could face much higher power bills next year. Eskom also expects a final decision on a new $476 million World Bank loan to repurpose its Komati coal-fired power plant into a renewable station before the COP27 summit, chief executive Andre de Ruyter said on Friday. He was speaking at the 2nd Southern Africa Oil and Gas Conference convened in Cape Town under the theme:  Shifting gear: towards a sustainable oil and gas future for Southern Africa. De Ruyter told delegates he was in favour of using gas in the electricity mix.  Gas has a role to play in the future energy mix as evidenced by many studies \- more specifically as a transition fuel to reduce emissions, he said. However, De Ruyter said it would take up to five years to build a fully functional gas-powered power station. Solar was the fastest to build \- around 12 to 18 months and a nuclear power plant would take up to 15 years to build.  New conventional nuclear is unlikely to be successful because it is a mega-project and mega-projects are very difficult to execute, such as Medupi and Kusile have proven, De Ruyter said. Economic and political analyst Dr Dale McKinley said Biden\' s latest funding move was too little, too late.  The northern developed countries have a historical and moral duty to not only fund the vast majority of this but to push it, given their history in ensuring that countries in the global south, or basically the engine rooms for fossil fuels, basically fuel the growth of their own economy.  It is to be welcomed, but it should be much much more and much much faster, he said. CEO of the Petroleum Agency of South Africa (PASA), Dr Phindile Masangane, said the country was ready for gas and oil industry.  The industry is actually part of our energy mix even if we transition into a cleaner energy mix. Masangane told delegates at the summit that oil and gas could be a boost to tax revenues. \</doc>

As the world observes COP27 , the 27th UN Climate Change conference in Egypt this week, more than 700 African youths have signed a joint open letter calling on the leadership of the AU to prioritise systemic change in the face of the worsening climate crisis. The letter comes after a series of conferences aimed to amplifying messaging from communities across Africa whose voices were not always heard in the negotiations taking place at meetings such as COP27 . This was organised by the African Climate Alliance, a youth- led, Cape-based group acting and advocating for Afrocentric climate justice. During online conference sessions, youth from across the continent discussed pertinent issues arising in communities affected by climate change and vowing to collaborate on the development of the open letter. COP27 In the letter, the youth appealed for further financing and development of renewable energy sources in Africa as well as the inclusion and consultation of indigenous knowledge in creating climate solutions. African Climate Alliance programmes manager Mitchelle Mhaka said:  We need to prioritise indigenous knowledge and to call on the global north to provide climate reparations to address the loss and damage facing communities in Africa due to climate impacts. The youth believed that while some argued for African countries to now be given the opportunity to exploit fossil fuels, history should not be misused as an excuse to build fossil fuel infrastructure and put the land and people in harm\' s way.  As leaders of the African Union (AU), you are in a unique and powerful position to negotiate for climate reparations for loss and damage finance rather than loans that accrue interest.  Climate reparations are essential to compensate for the loss and damage in Africa due to the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. Reparations will also assist in building green infrastructure, the letter stated. The letter was also endorsed by 350 Africa, Don\' t Gas Africa, Power Shift Africa, Khantsa Energy and others. South African team leader Glen Tyler-Davies for 350 Africa said young people have the most to gain or lose in how they respond to climate change, and therefore often speak with the greatest clarity.  Their calls for people-centred development powered by renewable energy and an end to the extractive economies that powered colonialism are especially timely, Tyler-Davies said. \</doc>

South vs north on climate cash African countries at Cop27 urge rich nations to pay up for damage caused by climate change South takes on north at Cop27 South Africa is pushing for rich nations to bear financial responsibility for environmental damage caused by climate change in poorer and developing nations. The country, along with other African nations, has forced onto the COP27 agenda discussions on the issue of loss and damage (L& D) and liability for climate change. One estimate is that rich nations might need to pay up to $1.8-trillion (about R30-trillion) to developing nations suffering the adverse effects of climate change by 2050. An annual target of $100bn in climate finance committed by developed nations in 2015 is yet to be realised, with only $23bn being made available so far. At the last climate change meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, South Africa secured $8.5bn from the US, France, Germany and the UK to help in the transition from coal-fired to renewable energy sources. Barbara Creecy, minister of environmental affairs, forestry & fisheries, told Business Times from Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt: "The fact remains these nations are responsible for climate change. L& D is a thorny issue at COP27 . That it is finally on the agenda is a step forward, but it is far too early at this stage to know if we are going to be making any relevant progress on the matter." Creecy said South Africa supported the African group of negotiators along with G77 countries and China in calling for an equitable and transparent mechanism through which countries affected by climate change could access finance for L& D. "Differentiated responsibility is inherent in the Paris Agreement," said Creecy. "All countries have a common interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We understand that no single country can fight climate change on its own, but we have to take into account that there have been differentiated responsibilities in creating climate change. Accordingly, countries have different capabilities for building climate resilience, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation." She said Africa had historically contributed only 4% to greenhouse gas emissions over the past two centuries while facilitating the wealth of developed countries. "African countries, therefore, must be allowed to transition at their own pace and to their own agenda." Creecy said it was imperative that countries responsible for climate change be held responsible for L& D suffered by developing countries that are experiencing an increase in extreme weather events such as prolonged droughts or flooding. "Mozambique, for example, has not contributed anything to greenhouse gas emission accumulation, but a few years ago Beira was almost wiped out by a cyclone overnight," she said. "They have a vulnerable economy with no significant fiscal resources. How is that economy expected to rebuild itself?" Led by a group of developing countries, negotiators fought long and hard for a meaningful discussion on L& D. Few of the developed nations that are responsible for most greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution are willing to take responsibility for the disproportionate impact on countries that have contributed the least to global warming. The inclusion of L& D as a sub-agenda item under finance at COP27 came only after negotiators agreed that discussion on "funding arrangements to respond to the adverse effects of climate change" would not involve liability or compensation. "Quite simply, emitters are still not intending to pay for the damage they have caused," said Brandon Abdinor, a climate advocacy lawyer with the Centre for Environmental Rights. "These countries are trying to avoid being held liable at all costs. They do not subscribe to the policy that the polluter must pay." Western nations have been reluctant to commit to climate financing as they are dealing with the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has raised energy prices, and are still recovering from the pandemic. Addressing the conference on Wednesday, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, urged countries of the global north to "step up their climate finance to the global south". "Team Europe is providing its fair share of the $100bn promise," she said. "For the second year in a row, we have exceeded $23bn despite the Covid pandemic, despite the Russian war and a big bulk of our climate finance goes already to adaptation. So it is doable, and we call on others to step up too." Emmanuel Siakilo, a senior adviser on climate resilience and adaptation at Power Shift Africa, said the discussion on L& D was long overdue. "A number of countries in the global south are facing the wrath of climate change. The floods in South Africa this year, the cyclones in Mozambique and the famine in Kenya and Somalia are but a few examples. Countries that have contributed the least to climate change are paying the highest price. This is not just an economic or social issue, it is the moral imperative of developed countries to not run away from that which they have caused." He said though the issue was finally on the table, celebrations would have to wait for the outcome of the talks. Delivering his national statement at COP27 , President Cyril Ramaphosa said Africa and the world needed a dramatic increase in global mitigation. "Like other vulnerable regions, Africa needs to build adaptive capacity, foster resilience, and address L& D as we agreed at Paris COP21. "To achieve this, our continent will need predictable, appropriate and at-scale funding and technological support. This must support our right to development, international equality and transmissions that are just and inclusive." Ramaphosa said developed economies had a responsibility to honour their commitments to the countries facing the greatest environmental, social and economic effects of climate change. Bobby Peek, director of the groundWork NGO, said the mendacity of developed countries was shocking. "They have yet to deliver the $100bn per year promised several years ago. This money, pledged by wealthy nations to developing countries to help them to adapt to climate change and further rises in temperature, has remained a promise. Yet in the global south there are hurricanes, there are droughts, there are floods. You can no longer adapt and mitigate because people are suffering real loss and real damage. They have to be compensated for that." Siakilo said: "The US and the EU are the greatest polluters and the biggest contributors to climate change. Our arguments, that they are responsible and should be held accountable for the losses and damages, are based on science. They have built their countries on the back of fossil fuels at our expense, yet we are paying the price." President Lazarus Chakwera of Malawi said in a fair system the benchmarks for climate change in the developed world could not be the same as for vulnerable nations. Countries needed to be held accountable for their culpability. Glen Tyler-Davies, the South African team lead for 350 Africa, said it was not unreasonable to expect those responsible for destructive climate events to pay for them. "It is estimated that L& D could reach $1.8-trillion by 2050. That is the extent of the financial damage they have caused, but it goes beyond a number. There are biodiversity losses, loss of cultural heritage, and people dying. This is all happening to countries that have had little or no responsibility for climate change. Agreeing to co-operate to facilitate some form of payment but still not accepting liability is just not good enough. They have avoided the issue long enough." Creecy said attempts by the developed world to shy away from the issue were no longer an option. "Developed countries have a responsibility, not only to lead the reduction in greenhouse gas emission but also to financially and technologically support the process of those countries suffering the worst effects of climate change. "We must also not forget that this debate about L& D comes at the end of a much broader injustice, the lack of financing from the countries responsible for climate change to allow developing countries to adapt. If this commitment was honoured, loss and damage could be prevented."

Across the continent, countries in Africa are gearing up for the energy transition by implementing policy and legislative frameworks that take into account the energy crisis and the need for a renewable, decarbonised, decentralised energy supply that addresses climate change and the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 The aforementioned was further developed through Cabinet Decree No. 56 of 2022, which specified a series of requirements to be met for a project to be considered a strategic and/or national project. In addition to meeting a set of conditions, said projects must be a development in one of the fields specified in the cabinet decree, which include, but are not limited to, green hydrogen projects, green corridor projects, renewable energy projects aimed at supplying desalination projects and green hydrogen production projects with energy, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects. The conditions, set out in the cabinet decree, will be subject to a yearly review in light of any changes to the State's economic development plan.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/232793.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/232793.html :EMBED-->Among the other incentives provided under the Investment Law, and which can be included in the License, Article 11 provides that companies set up before 28 October 2023 to operate in certain industry groups, could obtain a deduction from their taxable income. This incentive is limited to seven years from the date of commencement of the project and is not perpetual. Furthermore, the Investment Law provides that additional incentives around, for example, utilities connection costs, land allocation costs and technical training may be made available to a project by a cabinet decision.The Government of Egypt has now also expressly recognised the production, storage and export of green hydrogen and green ammonia among the areas falling within the State's economic development strategy. It has passed a decree that would allow green hydrogen and green ammonia projects to benefit from a wide range of State support under the country's existing Investment Law, including tax incentives. This is a key development for Egypt's hydrogen economy and we expect that it will stimulate private investment and the development of new green hydrogen and ammonia projects in the country.GhanaSefakor Kuenyehia, Solicitor & Barrister, Kimathi & Partners in Ghana:A recent legal development in Ghana was the amendment of the Renewable Energy Act, 2011 (Act 832) by the Renewable Energy (Amendment) Act, 2020 (Act 1045) (amended Act). The amended Act was passed on 29 December 2020 and establishes a procurement scheme to deliver a competitive market rate for electricity generated from a renewable source.The Government of Ghana, through the Energy Commission, has also produced the Renewable Energy Master Plan 2019, and the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Energy Financing (Sunref) 2021. Under the Renewable Energy Master Plan, the government proposes incentives in the form of substantial tax reductions. It also proposes exemptions of import duties and VAT on materials, components, equipment, and machinery (that cannot be obtained locally) for manufacturing or assembling renewable energy resources. Also, under the Sunref Programme, the government, in collaboration with other agencies, is offering businesses, organisations and households an opportunity to access financing for sustainable energy projects, and technical assistance in structuring green investment.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/604/232753.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/604/232753.html HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/231411.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/702/231411.html :EMBED-->The new legal framework will allow industries to produce their own renewable energy for their operating needs and supply it to other consumers.

To facilitate this energy transition, the Ministry of Mines and Energy introduced National Integrated Resource Plans (NIRP), being medium to long-term plans that guide state and private investors on least-cost investments in the energy sector, planning scenarios, and greenhouse gas consequences of energy projects. Further, the Harambeee Prosperity Plan II aims to implement targeted policy programmes to enhance post-pandemic economic recovery in Namibia. Improving energy security in Namibia is part of this plan.Namibia currently produces about 40% of its own energy requirements, with around 60% imported from neighbouring countries, including South Africa. The planned renewable energy projects in the country aim to fill this gap and ensure the production of a reliable energy supply in the country. Renewable energy projects in the pipeline include those focused on biomass, solar, wind and battery energy storage.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/232011.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/232011.html :EMBED-->Existing solar and wind resources puts Namibia at an advantage in the production of green hydrogen and ammonia, which could assist in making the country the first in Africa to achieve carbon neutrality.The country's green hydrogen and ammonia plans are supported by the government's national Green Hydrogen Initiative, which aims to secure high impact environmental, educational, economic and social investments in the country. The Tsau Khaeb National Park Southern Corridor Development Initiative, with Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, was announced in June 2022. This is the country's first large-scale green hydrogen project, with the first phase of production planned for completion by 2026.

Each of the last eight years, if projections for this year hold, will be hotter than any year prior to 2015, the UN said yesterday, detailing a dramatic increase in the rate of global warming. Sea level rise, glacier melt, torrential rains, heat waves \- and the deadly disasters they cause \- have all accelerated, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report as the COP27 UN Climate Summit opened in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.  As COP27 Earth has warmed more than 1.1\'b0C since the late 19th century, with roughly half of that increase occurring in the past 30 years, the report shows. Nearly 200 nations gathered in Egypt have set their sights on holding the rise in temperatures to 1.5\'b0C, a goal some scientists believe is now beyond reach. This year is on track to be the fifth or sixth warmest recorded despite the impact since 2020 of La Ni\'f1a \- a periodic and naturally occurring phenomenon that cools the atmosphere.  The greater the warming, the worse the impacts, said WMO head Petteri Taalas. Surface water in the ocean -- which soaks up more than 90% of accumulated heat from human carbon emissions \- hit record high temperatures last year, warming especially fast during the past 20 years. Marine heat waves were also on the rise, with devastating consequences for coral reefs and the half-billion people who depend on them for food and livelihoods. Overall, 55% of the ocean surface experienced at least one marine heatwave this year, the report said. Driven by melting ice sheets and glaciers, the pace of sea level rise has doubled in the past 30 years, threatening tens of millions in low-lying coastal areas.  The messages in this report could barely be bleaker, said Mike Meredith, science leader at the British Antarctic Survey.  All over our planet, records are being shattered as different parts of the climate system begin to break down. Greenhouse gases accounting for more than 95% of warming are all at record levels, with methane showing the largest one-year jump recorded, the WMO\' s annual State of the Global Climate found. The increase in methane emissions has been traced to leaks in natural gas production and a rise in beef consumption. This year, a cascade of extreme weather worsened by climate change devastated communities across the globe. A two-month heatwave in South Asia in March and April bearing the unmistakable fingerprint of man-made warming was followed by floods in Pakistan that left a third of the country under water. At least 1 700 people died, and 8 million were displaced. In East Africa, rainfall has been below average in four consecutive wet seasons, the longest in 40 years, with this year set to deepen the drought. China saw the longest and most intense heatwave on record and the second-driest summer. Falling water levels disrupted or threatened commercial river traffic along China\' s Yangtze, the Mississippi in the US and several major inland waterways in Europe, which also suffered repeated bouts of sweltering heat. Poorer nations least responsible for climate change but most vulnerable to its dire impacts suffered the most.  But even well-prepared societies this year have been ravaged by extremes \- as seen by the heatwaves and drought in parts of Europe and southern China, Taalas said. In the European Alps, glacier melt records have been shattered this year, with average thickness losses of between three and over four metres, the most recorded. Switzerland has lost more than a third of its glacier volume since 2001.  If there was ever a year to swamp, shred and burn off the blinkers of global climate inaction then 2022 should be it, said Dave Reay, head of the University of Edinburgh\' s Climate Change Institute. Delegates at the climate summit agreed to discuss whether rich nations should compensate poor countries most vulnerable to climate change for their suffering.  This creates for the first time an institutionally stable space on the formal agenda of COP and the Paris Agreement to discuss the pressing issue of funding arrangements needed to deal with existing gaps, responding to loss and damage, COP27 president Sameh Shoukry told the opening plenary. The item was adopted to the agenda yesterday as world leaders arrived for the negotiations set to run until November 18. Much of the tension at COP27 is expected to relate to loss and damage \- funds provided by wealthy nations to vulnerable lower-income countries that bear little responsibility for climate-warming emissions. At COP26 last year in Glasgow, high-income nations blocked a proposal for a loss and damage financing body, instead supporting a new three-year dialogue for funding discussions. The discussions now on the agenda at COP27 will not involve liability or binding compensation, but intend to lead to a conclusive decision  no later than 2024, Shoukry said.  The inclusion of this agenda reflects a sense of solidarity for the victims of climate disasters, he added. Inside the UN negotiations this week, small island states - whose vulnerability to climate change has seen them play an outsized role in past UN talks \- will push a proposal for a UN-hosted  response fund to pool and distribute cash to countries struck by disasters. The  V20 group of 58 climate-vulnerable countries and the Group of 7 rich nations will launch a  Global Shield to strengthen insurance and disaster protection finance. Germany is expected to commit money for the scheme. | AFP and Reuters \</doc>

Seth OnyangoWith the smash of a hammer, COP27 President Sameh Shoukry announced on Sunday that states had agreed to establish a kitty to compensate vulnerable states for the climate change fallout. The announcement put to rest, at least temporarily, weeks of intense political brokering to ram the landmark deal over the line in the face of pushback from the states most responsible for climate damage. The mechanism will see rich economies and donors provide the funds required to save lives and livelihoods from climate change-related catastrophes. According to pan-African parliament vice-president Lucia Passos, the deal to set up a fund shows what unity among African states can achieve during critical multilateral negotiations. Compensation of states for loss and damage emerged as a sticking point at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, as developing nations and their island counterparts refused to back down in their appeal for cash to help mitigate the effects of climate change. But strong opposition from rich and heavily polluting economies caused the issue to be pushed back until one year later, when the climate talks opened again, this time at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. On the sidelines of the negotiations, African leaders intimated that they would not relent until the loss and damage deal was on the table and a payment plan featured in the final resolutions of the talks. They achieved both. Speaking in the closing plenary, Shoukry thanked delegates for concluding historic agreements. "The work that we've managed to do here in the past two weeks, and the results we have together achieved, are a testament to our collective will, as a community of nations, to voice a clear message that rings loudly today, here in this room and around the world that multilateral diplomacy still works. "Despite the difficulties and challenges of our times, the divergence of views, level of ambition or apprehension, we remain committed to the fight against climate change... we rose to the occasion, upheld our responsibilities and undertook the important decisive political decisions that millions around the world expect from us," he said. "This was not easy. We worked around the clock. Long days and nights. Strained and sometimes tense, but united and working for one aim, one higher purpose, one common goal that we all subscribe to and aspire to achieve. In the end, we delivered." This comes as drought, cyclones, rising sea levels, and flooding wreak havoc in Africa and other developing countries. "This outcome moves us forward," said Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary. Governments have also agreed to establish a transitional committee to make recommendations on operationalising the new funding arrangements and the fund at COP 28 next year. The inaugural meeting of the transitional committee for COP 28 is to occur before the end of March next year. At the same time, parties also agreed on the institutional arrangements to operationalise the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage, to catalyse technical assistance to developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. The talks also delivered a package of decisions reaffirming commitments to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 & xB0;C above pre-industrial levels. The package is expected to strengthen action by countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change, as well as boost support for developing countries finance, technology and capacity-building needs. However, the UN climate talks in Sharm el-Sheikh failed to reach an agreement on phasing out fossil fuels, with African states blocking the attempts unless it falls under a "just energy transition" framework. "The issue of fossil fuel phase down cannot come without other major commitments being delivered. In short, there are winners and losers. There are promises to support those countries that lose out in implementing some of these decisions," said the organisation's president, Fortune Charumbira.

The damage is already being done is a moral imperative that can no longer be ignored. COP27 , also termed the  The African COP , is an opportunity for Africans to stand up, speak their voice and demand the change that is urgently needed right now. But will this occur for us? Or is this just another conference  party ? The goal of COP27 COP26: Was it a success? At the Glasgow climate summit, the world made significant strides toward solving the climate catastrophe but stumbled when making the great leap required to keep global warming to 1.5\'baC. When compared to its own goals, COP26 missed the mark. The nations that are mostly responsible for the escalating climate problem did not act. Wealthy nations also fell short of meeting the demands of the most vulnerable nations by failing to adequately fund adaptation efforts or commit resources for the loss and harm these nations are already experiencing. Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate stated:  Finance for adaptation is critical, but for many of us in vulnerable countries, adapting to climate change is no longer enough. You cannot adapt to starvation. You cannot adapt to extinction. You cannot adapt to lost culture and heritage. The transformative action that the world so sorely needs was not delivered at COP26. Each nation, notably the biggest emitters, must adopt and implement more aggressive 2030 objectives that are in accordance with their fair share of reductions in order to prevent global warming of more than 1.5\'baC. To assist and build the momentum required to raise targets, we must act quickly to shift from targets to the policies and legislation required to meet the current targets. People on the front lines of our changing world must be supported, and they must participate in decision-making processes. The losses of the poorest and most vulnerable nations, who have contributed the least to climate change, must also be acknowledged by wealthy nations. Governments are required by law to protect human rights, which includes addressing climate change by slashing greenhouse gas emissions quickly and assisting citizens in coping with its effects. Governments should make a concrete recommendation to swiftly phase out all fossil fuel use and production at the COP this year. Governments should pledge at COP27 to stop approving any new fossil fuel projects. In order to drastically reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change on human rights, they should also stop all forms of support for oil, gas and coal production, including subsidies and foreign financing. The rights of communities that are directly impacted by fossil fuel operations, such as those who live near locations for fossil fuel exploration, production, storage, transit, consumption and disposal, should also be protected by governments. Governments should pledge to safeguard the people who are most vulnerable and secure their involvement and representation in climate change decision-making. This COP, which will take place on the African continent, is an excellent opportunity to talk about the unique requirements and circumstances of Africa as a whole, without bias towards other vulnerable regions or groupings of countries. Governments should also develop a grievance procedure and specify the guidelines for international carbon trading at this year\' s COP in order to protect and enhance the human rights of communities impacted by carbon-offsetting projects. Additionally, those who are most impacted by the climate catastrophe and least able to adapt should benefit from decisions on climate finance and adaptation. These choices should be made after thorough consultation with all relevant groups, including senior citizens and individuals with disabilities. More people need to peacefully protest and voice their thoughts in the streets for effective climate action, not fewer. Civil society, particularly child and youth activists, must be fully and meaningfully involved in climate action for it to be effective and protect human rights. This includes individuals who are directly affected by climate catastrophe and the populations most at danger from its negative effects. The summit this year in Egypt will focus heavily on implementation. The meeting in Glasgow the previous year produced some ambitious new targets. Now, nations must work hard to determine how they will achieve the targets they have set, including how to pay for climate action. The COP27 COP27 is not far away.

The Ministers of Brazil, South Africa, India and China have expressed concern that there has been a significant increase in the consumption and production of fossil fuels in the past year by developed countries, even as they continue to press developing countries to move away from the same resources. 'Such double standards are incompatible with climate equity and justice,' the Ministerial Joint Statement by the Ministers of Brazil, South Africa, India and China representing the BASIC Group said on Tuesday. COP 27 'BASIC countries are gravely concerned that developed countries are still not showing leadership or responding with a matching progression of effort. There has been backtracking on finance and mitigation commitments and pledges by developed countries,' the BASIC Ministerial Group said. Developing countries require predictable and appropriate support, including climate finance at the necessary scope, scale and speed and access to technology and markets to ensure and enable their sustainable development. 'In this regard, the Ministers underscored the urgent need for a fundamental transformation and modernisation of the global financial architecture, including a systematic reform of the multilateral development banks to make them fit-for-purpose in supporting sustainable development and just and equitable transitions. 'The key is to address risk aversion in investing in developing countries, to prioritise grant support and to dramatically lower the cost and conditionality on borrowing money that places multilateral support out of reach of the majority of the world's population, including in BASIC countries,' the Ministers said. They are concerned that climate finance provided by developed countries continues to fall short of the US$100 billion per year commitment, as it has every year since the goal was set in 2009, and despite the deep regret expressed at COP26 last year. 'This is despite the US$100 billion being only a tiny fraction of the financing which will be necessary for an economy-wide transformation and to meet the needs and priorities of developing countries. 'Developing countries, and especially the BASIC countries, have to channel many times this amount of financing from their domestic resources or from commercial loans and developing countries cannot afford to transform their economies without assistance. 'Finance to developing countries is also increasingly with unilateral conditionalities and eligibility criteria, predominantly in the form of loans rather than grants, aggravating the financial constraints faced by developing countries,' the BASIC Ministerial Group said. Many of the pledges to the Adaptation Fund made at COP26 remain unfilled, delivering on the commitment to double adaptation financing remains unclear and there are significant outstanding contributions by developed countries to the Green Climate Fund. Adaptation financing needs to be impact based. 'The new collective quantified goal by developed countries must therefore go beyond the floor of US$100 billion per year, be significantly public funded with greater transparency and predictability, provide incentives to enhance access modalities, be periodically reviewed, and take a balanced approach towards mitigation and adaptation in light of evolving needs and priorities of developing countries. For this a clear roadmap for deliberations in 2023, including on discussions on possible timeframes, should be adopted at COP27 ,' the BASIC Ministerial Group said. The Ministers expressed concern that adaptation is still not being accorded the balanced and substantive attention they deserve in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, despite the opportunities and linkages with loss and damage. 'It is essential to maintain a systematic and continued process to work on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA), with a view to fully operationalising the GGA. They underscored the necessity for a special report on GGA to be produced by the IPCC to help deepen global understanding on defining and achieving the GGA. We also recognise that adaptation actions taken at the local level have an important global contribution,' the Ministers said. They also emphasised that the Mitigation Work Programme should be guided by the objectives, goals and principles of the Convention and its Paris Agreement, being facilitative, non-prescriptive, nationally determined in nature, and aim at promoting exchange of best practices, exploring opportunities, and identifying challenges on implementation of their respective Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The Ministers said the Mitigation Work Programme should not result in an alteration of the goals as set out in the Paris Agreement, imposing sectoral targets and benchmarks, or duplication with arrangements regarding mitigation. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

There seems to be a mixed bag of reactions from the recent COP27 in Egypt, with some delegates taking the view that there was a lack of urgency given the growing climate crisis and its devastating effects, while others thought that the big win was the establishment of a loss and damage fund for countries that are vulnerable to climate crises (UN COP27 Decisions). Another significant win emanating from COP27 was the announcement of the Global Methane Hub (GMH) partnership which is the first co-ordinated approach to make available methane mitigation funding. The hub will focus on energy, agricultural, and waste sectors, which account for 96% of human-caused methane emissions. Reducing methane gas is the fastest way to address climate change in the short term. Methane emissions have contributed to roughly 30% of the current warming, causing harm to communities around the globe. (GMH)Speaking about this partnership, Lisa Moon, the Global FoodBanking Network (GFN) CEO who represented FoodBanks from all over the world at COP27 , of which FoodForward SA is also a member, noted that "the Global Methane Hub will advance the impact of food banks and food recovery for hunger relief and climate protection, since foodbanks provide an immediate response to climate disasters by helping communities adapt to the long-term impact of changing seasons and harvests. Lisa goes on to say that foodbanks are among the unsung heroes on the front lines of global climate action. In South Africa, more than 10 million tons of food is lost or wasted annually because of inefficiencies along the food value chain, causing copious amounts of harmful carbon emissions to be emitted into the atmosphere. For every ton of food wasted, 14 tons of greenhouse gasses are emitted into the atmosphere (CSIR 2021 Food Waste Prevention and Management Guide).In their 2021 Food Waste Index report, the United Nation s Environment Programme (UNEP) notes that Food loss and waste account for 8-10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) - contributing to an unstable climate and extreme weather events such as droughts and flooding. Inger Anderson, UNEP s executive director states that If food loss and waste were a country, it would be the third biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Climate risks severely impact the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable people and communities. Scientists warn that Africa is already experiencing huge losses and damage, and that this will only escalate with global warming. FoodBanks can play a pivotal dual role in mitigating the effects of climate change and address growing food insecurity.Another vehicle that can significantly reduce food loss and waste while promoting climate change mitigation / adaptation is Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting. Using this tool supply chain representatives can readily detect and constructively address the drivers affecting unsustainable production and consumption practices that lead to food loss and waste, and as they identify edible surplus food timeously, it can be donated.Regrettably, a recent survey released by KPMG reveal that SA CEOs are not taking ESG reporting seriously. KPMG interviewed 50 C-suite executives of listed companies and concludes that ESG has fallen down the boardroom agenda, and only 8% of SA CEOs are investing money towards adopting a more transparent approach (KPMG ESG Survey 2022).Often within large corporations, because of multi-layered bureaucratic structures and compliance and approval procedures, significant amounts of time lapses between when their supply chain decision-makers become aware of and authorise foods to be characterised as surplus (waste), and when the corporate affairs or sustainability divisions are informed to be able to donate this food while it is still good for human consumption.In order to bridge this disconnect and improve their ESG score, it is imperative for supply chain representatives to explore circularity and diversion strategies that are more robust and sustainable and incorporate surplus food recovery and distribution organisations (foodbanks) as an integral component of their upstream food ecosystems, rather than only at the end of the supply chain downstream. In this way, we can increase food security for the most vulnerable, drive better value, nurture improved productivity and efficiency throughout the food system, significantly reduce carbon emissions and reduce resource and energy loss. It s a win-win.On 29 September, which is the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and UNEP released a joint statement calling for urgent action, stating Tackling the scourge of food loss and waste represents a triple win opportunity - for the climate, for food security, as well as for the sustainability of our agrifood systems - and cannot be put on the backburner at a time of rising global hunger and surging food prices. We only have 8 years left to reach the SDG 12.3 target to halve food waste by 2030 and reduce food loss by at least 25 percent. Additionally, rising inflation fuelling the cost-of-living crisis, and looming threats of further climate crises, recessions, pandemics, and other shocks require an accelerated commitment to collective action now.Andy Du Plessis Managing Director, FoodForward SA</!> \</doc>

on my mind by LOOK BEYOND THE HOT AIR COP27 in full swing, it's worth remembering that the corporates sounding off so piously about the environment have for years stood in the way of climate change mitigation effortsThe 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP27 , began this week in Egypt.The annual gathering of heads of state, ministers, negotiators, civil society representatives, climate activists and business leaders aims to take stock of commitments made under the Paris Agreement, and to try (27th time lucky?) to agree on how to end the relentless rise of global emissions and adapt to the associated human and environmental devastation. We were way off target even before the war in Ukraine sparked a chain of events that has led to record-breaking fossil fuel profits and the "coal comeback" that has so delighted many local asset managers. In a move that must have irritated the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), The Economist's cover story last week called on readers to "Say goodbye to 1.5\'b0C". The less-understood irony is that policy failure on climate is to a large extent attributable to the very entities that are making a killing from the war. It is well documented (including in the IPCC reports) that the fossil fuel industry has played a huge role in spreading misinformation and influencing political officials to weaken and delay climate-related policy and regulation. Had countries taken the urgent action that scientists have for decades warned is necessary, their economies would not now be so reliant on fossil fuels from powers that use that dependency as a geopolitical weapon. COP27 - they include greenhouse gas behemoths Sasol, Thungela and Exxaro, and Standard Bank, Africa's largest lender to the oil and gas industry. However, this high-level public support for climate action is not matched by what these companies say when it comes to regulation that, if enacted, would force them to reduce emissions. Organised business submissions to parliament this year on the Climate Change Bill and proposed amendments to the Carbon Tax Act demonstrate this duplicity. Presentations by the Minerals Council South Africa, Business Unity South Africa (Busa) and the Chemical & Allied Industries' Association all started in much the same way: with assertions of how crucial climate action is and how much they support a robust policy approach from local regulators. Then each association went on to outline the reasons why regulation that affects their members is a bad idea with dire economic implications. In arguments to back up their claims, they largely accused the government of failing to "align" the carbon tax and carbon budgets under the Climate Change Bill; of exposing businesses to "double jeopardy" by seeking to limit emissions through a carbon budget and by taxing those emissions; and of unreasonably expecting industry to reduce emissions where there has been voluntary mitigation and further reduction is not "feasible or available" (a nonsense argument - all emissions are mitigable). Busa has also taken the staggering view that the Climate Change Bill should not be permitted to limit emissions from any existing authorised operations. Speaking with forked tongue The bottom line is that it doesn't matter what the government does or how far it bends to accommodate it, business will always resist to the full extent of its power any attempt to regulate it effectively. And this is precisely why we have laws: because humans do not voluntarily change behaviour that benefits them. In objecting repeatedly to legislated emission reduction requirements and an effective carbon tax, business eloquently makes the case for exactly why regulation is crucial if we expect to make any progress on climate change. Imagine a world in which organised business coalesced around positive climate action, rather than deploying so much energy and capital in resisting it. The many non-fossil fuel members of these business associations that have silently endorsed a regressive collective position on climate regulation should be ashamed of themselves.

FOSSIL FUELSSA and partners call out rich nations Ministers from a group of developing countries accuse developed countries of backtracking Energy WriterMinisters from a group of developing countries, including SA, have accused developed countries of "backtracking on [climate] finance and mitigation pledges", and of increasing their use of fossil fuels while expecting developing countries to move away from these resources. In a statement issued during the UN climate conference, COP27 , in Egypt, ministers from Brazil, SA, India and China (the BASIC group), led by SA's minister for forestry, fisheries & the environment, Barbara Creecy, said they were "gravely concerned" that rich countries were not "showing leadership" in cutting their use of fossil fuels and progressing in their efforts to meet their stated climate change mitigation goals. The 2022 Carbon Budget Report, released by the Global Carbon Project science team during COP27 , found that global carbon emissions from the use of fossil fuel were on course to rise 1% this year. This is being driven by emissions from coal and oil rising above their 2021 levels, with oil being the largest contributor. The growth in emissions from oil, the report said, could largely be explained by the delayed rebound of international aviation after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. The 2022 picture among major emitters is mixed and partly contradicted by the statement made by the BASIC group of ministers. The report said emissions were projected to fall in China (0.9%) and the EU (0.8%), and increase in the US (1.5%) and India (6%), with a 1.7% rise in the rest of the world combined. In SA, the only African country in the G20, fossil fuels still make up 92% of the energy mix, which is higher than the G20 average (81%), as reported in the 2022 Climate Transparency Report, and annual review of climate action and emissions by G20 countries. In their COP27 "This is despite the $100bn being only a tiny fraction of the financing which will be necessary for an economywide transformation and to meet the needs and priorities of developing countries," the ministers said. Financing that was being made available to developing countries, the ministers said, increasingly came with "unilateral conditionalities and eligibility criteria" and was predominantly in the form of loans rather than grants. This reflects SA's experience in the raising of finance through the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), which was announced at COP26. Through the JETP, Germany, France, the US, the UK and the EU committed $8.5bn in funding to support SA's transition from coal towards a low-carbon economy. But, as details of the funding become clear, the money will predominantly come in the form of regular and concessional loans, with less than 3% of it to come from grants. The ministers called for a "fundamental transformation and modernisation of the global financial architecture". This, they said, should include systematic reform of the multilateral development banks "to make them fit for purpose in supporting sustainable development and just and equitable transitions". They said: "The key is to address risk aversion in investing in developing countries, to prioritise grant support and to dramatically lower the cost and conditionality on borrowing money that places multi-lateral support out of reach of the majority of the world's population, including in BASIC countries." erasmusd@businesslive.co.za \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa has told world leaders at the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt that multilateral development banks and other funding institutions need to be reformed to help developing countries in their fight against climate change. "At present multilateral support is out of reach of the majority of the world's population due to lending policies that are risk-averse and carry onerous costs and conditionalities," said Ramaphosa. The president made the call while delivering SA's statement at the high-level segment hearing of heads of state on Tuesday. He said funding institutions need to transform and change the way they fund projects to enable countries to develop with regards to climate change. "The commitments needed for SA to embark on this difficult journey are close on $90-trillion (R1.6-quadrillion) and the categorisation of the funding needs to be well packaged so that there are meaningful grants, concessional loans and investments by a variety of institutions," said Ramaphosa. He added that a clear road map was needed to deliver on the Glasgow decision to double adaptation financing by 2025. "South Africa is committed to achieving the most ambitious end of the mitigation range in our nationally determined contribution," he said. Ramaphosa said SA was guided by a just energy transition framework, an investment plan that outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve decarbonisation goals over the next five years. On Friday Ramaphosa unveiled an ambitious just energy transition investment plan and asked the country to comment. The plan will provide government with a blueprint to address challenges of poverty, energy security and the urgent threat of climate change. A "just and fair" transition will be at the centre of the government's agenda. He made a commitment to use COP27 to canvass for large-scale investments needed to carry out the plan. Ramaphosa said at COP26 in Glasgow last year, France, Germany, the UK, US and the EU offered support in the form of a just energy transition partnership. "It is our hope that this partnership will offer a ground-breaking approach to funding by developed economy countries for the ambitious but necessary mitigation and adaptation goals for a number of developing countries." Like other vulnerable regions, Ramaphosa said, Africa needs to build adaptive capacity to foster resilience and address loss and damage as agreed at Paris COP21. "To achieve this, our continent will need a predictable, appropriate and upstream funding stream and technological support. This must support our right to development, international equity and transmissions that are just and inclusive." This, said Ramaphosa, places a great deal of responsibility on developed economies to honour their commitments to those countries with the greatest need and countries that face the greatest environmental, social and economic impacts of climate change. "The commitments must be honoured, because failing to honour these breaks trust and confidence in the process," he said.

As COP27 delegates in Egypt debate planet-heating emissions, the climate crisis is exacerbating devastating hunger across several African nations and will worsen further without urgent action, the UN said yesterday.  If drastic measures are not taken urgently, hunger will increase as climate change is felt everywhere, most intensely in vulnerable areas, such as Sudan, said Zitouni Ould-Dada, from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Sudan is among the East African nations facing  acute food insecurity , the Famine Early Warnings Systems Network warned earlier this month, highlighting the dire situation, especially in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. As the COP27 It warned that parts of Somalia are  projected to face famine . Africa is home to some of the countries least responsible for carbon emissions but hardest hit by an onslaught of weather extremes. Sudan, like many other countries on the continent, has been hit hard in recent years by erratic weather patterns -- harsh droughts and searing temperatures followed by torrential rains. Around a third of the population, over 15 million people, will need aid next year, the highest level for over a decade, according to the World Food Program (WFP). The climate summit in Egypt, billed as the  African COP , must be where the continent\' s food security is addressed, said Ould-Dada, deputy director of the FAO\' s Climate and Environment Division.  It does not make sense for Africa to import 40% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine when it itself is so rich in resources, he said, on the sidelines of the climate talks in Egypt\' s Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.  It takes political will to fight poverty and hunger globally. The FAO recently agreed a $10 million (about R173m) project with Sudan\' s forestry authority to help support farmers, including by protecting crucial gum arabic trees, which provide a key ingredient for fizzy drinks, to combat rapid desertification. With agriculture and livestock accounting for 43% of employment and 30 percent of GDP, conflicts over livestock and access to water and land continue. According to the UN, 800 people have been killed this year and more than 260 000 displaced in conflict across Sudan. | AFP \</doc>

South Africa will HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/environment/2022-11-04-barbara-creecy-south-africas-stance-at-the-africa-cop/ negotiate for more money from the Just Energy Transition partners at Cop27 set to begin on Sunday in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt. The partners include France, Germany, the United Kingdom, United States and the European Union. This is according to President Cyril Ramaphosa, who said the $8.5-billion HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/news/2022-10-14-how-eskoms-growing-debt-will-bite-consumers/ pledged by these nations at Cop26 last year in Glasgow, Scotland, was not enough for South Africa. The money was meant to help the country shut down coal-fired power stations and repurpose them for renewable energy, such as solar and wind. "The country will require about R1.5-trillion ($84-billion) over next five years to meet targets in transitioning from coal to renewable energy," he said at a meeting of the Presidential Climate Commission, citing the country's climate investment plan. "This is just the five years that the R1.5-trillion will be necessary. Going forward, much more money will be needed," he added. "With COP27 taking place in Africa, it presents an opportunity to advance African priority issues. Namely, raising the ambitions on mitigation, adaptation and support to developing countries; advancing arrangements for loss and damage; building on progress made in Glasgow on the importance of a just transition and advanced discussions on the special needs and circumstances of Africa," he said. More debt? Ramaphosa added that the just energy partnership investment plan had been released to countries for deliberation and South Africa was aware that transition could come with debt. He said South Africa needed financing to fight climate change in a way that matched the financial capabilities of the country and to ensure it didn't place a burden of debt on it. "We seek a package that upholds the development and climate finance principles and obligations that are due to developing countries and is inclusive and just," he said.

Your Excellency Joko Widodo, President of the Republic of Indonesia and President of the G20, Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, Ladies and Gentlemen, In Africa, as in many other parts of the developing world, millions of people are going hungry. Global food insecurity is getting worse. There are several reasons for this. The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has been uneven and inadequate. Climate change has increased the frequency and the severity of droughts, floods and wildfires, disrupting agricultural production and supply. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has hiked global prices of fuel, fertilisers, edible oil, sugar and wheat. We as South Africa still insist on dialogue between all the parties to resolve the conflict. Low and middle income economies are most affected by the resultant food shortages and therefore need substantial financial support to ensure food security and tackle the effects of climate change. With this support, low and middle income countries can invest in climate-smart agriculture, sustainable food production systems and climate change early warning systems. Trade restrictions are a major source of risk for global food price stability. We therefore support the call for multilateral trading systems that are transparent, inclusive, predictable and rules-based. South Africa welcomes the Indonesian Presidency's focus on just and sustainable energy transitions. We are, however, concerned at the lack of progress on key issues in the multilateral negotiations at COP27 , especially with respect to loss and damage, finance, technology, capacity building, adaptation and the just transition. The outcomes of both COP27 and this Leaders' Summit must reaffirm the principles of equity and 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities'. Industrialised countries in the G20 need to demonstrate more ambitious climate action and must honour their financial commitments to developing economies. South Africa will continue to contribute its fair share to the global climate change effort through a just transition that supports sustainable development. We call for continued G20 support for the African Renewable Energy Initiative as a means of bringing clean power to the continent on African terms. In this regard this can be best achieved with the African Union joining the G20 as a permanent member. It is only through a collective and united response that we can resolve the challenges of food and energy insecurity across our world. I thank you. \</doc>

Alstom, a global leader in sustainable and green mobility solutions, has released a new study titled The Role of Urban Rail in Sustainable Africa in collaboration with EY Climate Change and Sustainability Services. The study demonstrates how increased investments in urban rail transport in Africa can facilitate the avoidance of substantial carbon emissions and contribute to broader sustainability goals, delivering environmental, social and economic benefits for Africa's growing cities. The study forms part of the contribution to the important discussions facilitated at the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ).Africa has a fast-growing population and the world s highest urbanisation rate. The continent s urban population will increase from 600 million in 2021 to over 1.3 billion in 2050. A key challenge is to ensure that this growth meets the UN s Sustainable Development Goal 11: Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.The study shows that for this to happen African cities must advocate to develop more sustainable transport systems, both to reduce carbon emissions and to foster inclusive socio-economic growth.Benefits of investment in urban public transport"With COP27 s focus on implementation, Alstom commissioned this study with EY Climate Change and Sustainability Services to highlight the many benefits that increased investment in urban public transport can bring to Africa s cities and support their sustainable growth."It is indeed demonstrated that every increase in a modal shift to rail transport will bring better access to socio-economic opportunities, reduced congestion, increased safety, and improved air quality on top of decarbonisation," states C\'e9cile Texier, vice president CSR and sustainability, Alstom Group.According to the International Energy Agency, passenger rail s modal share has stagnated globally at around 6-7% for a decade and must grow by more than 40% in the next decade for transport to remain on track to meet net zero. This study, therefore, highlights the benefits that can be realised if the modal share of urban rail in African cities increases to 10% in 2030 and 20% in 2050 (compared to the baseline scenario of 1% today).A cumulative total of 1,005 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 (1 gigatonne [GT] of CO2) could be avoided between 2023 and 2050 in this scenario, compared to the status quo. This is equal to 32% of Africa s total GHG emissions in 2019. One hundred and seventy-three million additional tonnes of CO2 would be avoided between 2023 and 2050 if urban rail systems were fully powered with renewable energy.Building safer, healthier, and more inclusive citiesBy increasing the modal share of rail to 20% by 2050, 29 million cars would be removed from Africa s roads each day, leading to a significant decrease in congestion, road accidents and air pollution. Urban rail is more affordable and more accessible than cars and unofficial transport systems, giving passengers easier access to jobs and key services such as education and health.This shift from road to rail could also support job creation related to construction and operations and maintenance in Africa estimated at about 258 jobs per kilometre of new rail built. For example, a 60-kilometre urban project would create over 15,000 direct jobs.The study also highlights the benefits brought by Cairo s long-term commitment to public transport. "With COP27 in Egypt, it is an opportunity to highlight that Egypt was the first country in Africa to open a metro line in 1987 and have three operational metro lines, two additional metro lines planned and 2 monorail lines under construction."The additional metro and monorail lines alone, will allow the city to avoid a cumulative 35 Mt of CO2 emissions between 2023 and 2050, equal to 10% of Egypt s total GHG emissions in 2019."Additionally, it provides the city with other social and economic advantages such as the reduction of 595,000 cars every day and a sharp reduction in congestion, estimated to cost Egypt $8bn each year, savings that could be reinvested in green and digital mobility solutions," says Andrew DeLeone, president Alstom Africa, Middle East, and Central Asia.View the full report here. \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa believes the potential for SA to emerge as a significant player in the green hydrogen value chain is huge. "Globally, the demand for green hydrogen and green hydrogen-based products such as ammonia and synthetic jet fuels is rising significantly. "This presents a unique opportunity for SA and the continent to link its mineral endowment with its renewable energy endowment to drive industrialisation," Ramaphosa said at the inaugural South African Green Hydrogen Summit in Cape Town yesterday. He said the summit, which comes after the COP27 in Egypt, built on a foundation laid by the sustainable infrastructure development symposium held in 2021, which highlighted SA's potential as a global exporter of green energy. "SA used the platform of COP27 to elaborate on our just green transition. "The plan has been well-received across our country and the world." Ramaphosa said the plan outlined that SA needed about $98bn (about R1.6-trillion) over the next five years "to enable a just transition and achieve our ambitious emissions reduction targets". He said green hydrogen was identified in the investment plan as one of the four big frontiers of a just energy transition, indicating it had huge growth and investment potential. Such investment would create jobs, attract investment, bring development to rural provinces and support a just transition from fossil fuels. SA and Zimbabwe hold more than 90% of the world's known platinum group metal reserves. "Since 30% to 40% of the supply goes into the production of catalytic converters for internal combustion vehicles, the initial focus of the research was on hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles as an alternative market to the internal combustion engine vehicle." Ramaphosa said SA was estimated to have the potential to produce six-million to 13-million tonnes of green hydrogen and derivatives a year by 2050. "To do so would require between 140 and 300 gigawatts of renewable energy. "The focus would be on green hydrogen exports, electrolyser and fuel cell production, and the manufacture of green steel, sustainable aviation fuel, ammonia, fertilisers and renewable energy components." He said SA was ideal for investors. "This country is favourable, reliable and a stable place to conduct business. "We are driving regulatory and legislative reform to make our economy more competitive and attract more investment so we can create more jobs." - TimesLIVE President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses the South African Green Hydrogen Summit in Cape Town on TuesdayGCIS \</doc>

The Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which invests the pensions of government employees, has committed to providing early-stage capital for the development of SA's hydrogen value chain. Africa's largest state-run investment firm, which oversees about R2.548-trillion in assets, announced its "hydrogen investment strategy" in a statement on Monday, saying it wanted to "leverage" the more than 200 hydrogen projects announced worldwide. The PIC also said its strategy would look to help fund the about R4.3-trillion that is required to develop SA's hydrogen economy. "The Hydrogen Roadmap has identified the PIC as a potential co-investor with other finance institutions in hydrogen projects. Hydrogen can augment renewable energy production with a relatively affordable way to store and transport the excess energy produced from these sources," the PIC said. "SA also hosts the world's largest platinum group metals (PGM) resources which benefit significantly from increased demand that could arise from a well-developed hydrogen sector." The Hydrogen Roadmap aims to bring together public and private investors in hydrogen technology to boost economic growth and reduce the carbon intensity of SA's energy system. The PIC said hydrogen promises to be the next frontier in clean energy technology and investing in it is likely to help society, the planet and its clients' portfolios. "Other benefits include job creation and localised manufacturing; we could turn SA into a top exporter of green hydrogen in the world," the PIC said. SA is under global pressure to decarbonise its economy amid a worldwide push for greener energy solutions, which happens to coincide with an unprecedented local power generating crisis. President Cyril Ramaphosa recently unveiled an almost R1.5-trillion just energy transition (JET) investment plan aimed at enabling SA to gradually reduce its reliance on coal-fired power in favour of more renewable alternatives. The JET is partly a response to the $8.5bn funding package pledged by richer nations at the COP26 summit, which is aimed at supporting SA's just energy transition but which requires the country to present a credible and acceptable plan to access the money. Just prior the COP27 summit, Barbara Creecy, the minister of forestry, fisheries and environmental affairs, highlighted Sasol's ability to convert carbon into green hydrogen using Fischer-Tropsch technology. "This technology, which is SA-owned IP [intellectual property], is very significant because it allows the potential for the development of a green liquid fuel, and if we can do that, we would essentially be turning sunshine into oil," Creecy said in October. SA has unveiled a plan at COP27 to target the green hydrogen industry. Picture: BloombergBloomberg \</doc>

Yes, humanity faces existential risks. In the coming decades, billions of people in the world's poorest economies will be hit the hardest. It is now more likely than not that the planet will cross multiple climate tipping points.\~ A challenging future undoubtedly awaits, with rolling shocks shaking governments everywhere to their core. And, yes, we have only ourselves - or, more precisely, the wealthiest among us - to blame. But is a collapse of our freewheeling, endlessly inventive, often confounding civilisation inevitable? Absolutely not. As Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, told world leaders gathered in Egypt last week at the United Nations Climate Change Conference : "We know what it is to remove slavery from our civilisation, to find a vaccine within two years for a pandemic, to put a man on the moon."\~ But the only solution to the current crisis offered by politicians is economic growth. While growth is essential to pull the poorest countries out of poverty, resilient societies will be forged not by ever greater wealth, but by greater social cohesion, good governance, and the capacity to innovate. Two years ago, we launched the HYPERLINK https://www.earth4all.life/ Earth4All initiative HYPERLINK https://www.earth4all.life/book Earth for All: A Survival Guide for Humanity .\~ We explore two scenarios: Too Little, Too Late and The Giant Leap .\~ In both scenarios, the global economy grows throughout this century. In the former, the rich grow richer, leaving the poor further behind. Social tensions rise. Governments struggle to deal with major shocks. The risk of regional collapse grows every decade. We can be certain that on our current path, the global increase in average temperature is likely to hit a catastrophic 2.5\'b0 Celsius, putting the world in grave danger. This is the path we are on. But it is not the only path. With extraordinary effort, societies can transform themselves into "well-being economies" that are more resilient to shocks. Social tensions fall. Global temperature rise stabilises at around 2\'b0C. This is the Giant Leap. Earth4All can trace its origins to the HYPERLINK https://www.clubofrome.org/ Club of Rome -commissioned report HYPERLINK https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/ The Limits to Growth At the time, the conclusion that pushing beyond the limits of the planet could lead to collapse shocked many people. Over the last 50 years, the world has followed the report's worst-case scenario, and we are beginning to see deep fractures in Earth systems and within societies. But we believe our future will be built on economic optimism, not despair. Our analysis concludes that any strategy to build fair and resilient societies must address poverty, inequality, gender imbalances, food insecurity, and energy access. The transformation we need hinges on tackling all of them together. Redistributing wealth is needed to rebuild trust in democratic systems, which is essential to broaden political support for bold decisions. The policies we propose, including progressive income and wealth taxes, international tax alignment and a universal basic dividend, would ensure that the richest 10% will have less than 40% of national incomes by around 2030 and further reduce inequality beyond this date.\~ Addressing wealth and income inequality must also be closely linked to reining in the disproportionate greenhouse-gas emissions and biosphere consumption of the wealthiest. This is why a fair price on carbon is a smart way to redistribute wealth and cut emissions. Without profound change, climate chaos, food insecurity and poverty are likely to drive conflict and social turmoil in vulnerable regions, with spillover effects everywhere. As Mottley warned in Sharm El-Sheikh, we can expect a billion refugees by 2050.\~ This is a reasonable estimate, given that, without immediate deep emissions cuts, the largely uninhabitable zones around the equator are expected to expand in the coming decades, encompassing heavily populated areas. High-risk countries include some of the most fragile and vulnerable states on Earth: Egypt, Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Philippines. Today, it may seem the world is as far from an Earth4All future as ever. But we found some room for optimism. We may have already reached a positive social tipping point: citizens want change. Our HYPERLINK https://www.earth4all.life/news/attitudes-to-transformation-c9mna global survey finds that 74% of people in G20 countries want their governments to reform economic systems to prioritise well-being and the planet over a singular focus on growth and profits. Our civilization often does the right thing when we have exhausted all other alternatives. This point has now been reached. Humanity's future on Earth will be vastly more peaceful, prosperous and secure if we do everything in our power to rebuild our economies to maximise well-being and planetary resilience rather than shareholder value. - \£9 Project Syndicate Owen Gaffney is head of impact for Nobel Prize Outreach.

Nuclear energy supporters including politicians and activists sought to polish the industry\' s spotty image yesterday, using the COP27 climate summit in Egypt to argue that atomic power offers a safe and cost-efficient way to decarbonise the world. Rising concerns about the swift pace of climate change and tight power supplies around the globe have softened some policymakers\' view of nuclear energy, an industry that has struggled for years to draw investment because of worries about safety, radioactive waste, and huge costs for building a reactor. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), an intergovernmental organisation that seeks to promote nuclear power, opened an exhibit at the UN climate gathering of global leaders \- a first in 27 years of the annual international climate negotiations \- expounding the technology\' s potential to fight climate change.  Many countries faced with sharply rising energy costs and heightened security of supply concerns are turning to nuclear power, the IAEA said. US Special Climate Envoy John Kerry, pumped up the industry on Tuesday at a news conference at the summit, announcing the US Export- Import Bank\' s formal interest in providing $3 billion (about R53bn) in financial support for a nuclear plant in Romania.  We have a viable alternative in nuclear ... This is one of the ways in which we can achieve net-zero, he told reporters, referring to an international target of cutting net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.  We don\' t get to net zero by 2050 without nuclear power in the mix. The US has earmarked billions of dollars toward keeping existing nuclear power plants open as part of a broader strategy to decarbonise the economy and hopes to encourage new projects. Kerry announced plans yesterday for companies to buy carbon credits to support countries switching out of coal power. He said companies including Microsoft and PepsiCo were involved in the plans, while countries and environmental groups were also supportive. Fossil fuel companies were excluded, however, he said. Kerry said UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres was supportive of a US-led carbon market initiative, provided there were safeguards to it. The two met yesterday at COP27 . The US also sought to reassure the UN climate summit that it would stick to its energy transition even if Republicans triumph in midterm elections. The COP27 Meanwhile, South Africa\' s President Cyril Ramaphosa has appealed to Western leaders at the summit to honour their commitments. Africa needs to build adaptive capacity, foster resilience and address loss and damage as agreed at Paris COP21 in France some years ago, Ramaphosa told fellow world leaders in Egypt. Delivering South Africa\' s statement on Tuesday, Ramaphosa said to achieve this the African continent would need a predictable, appropriate and at-scale funding stream and technological support. This must support the continent\' s right to development, international equity and transitions that are just and inclusive.  This places a great responsibility on developed economies to honour their commitments to those countries with the greatest need and that confront the greatest environmental, social and economic effects of climate change, Ramaphosa said.  The commitments that were made must be honoured because failing to honour these commitments, breaks trust and confidence in the process. Developed nations promised in 2015 that they would provide developing countries $100bn annually for use in mitigating the effects of climate change but until now no finances have been advanced to them. Ramaphosa called for multilateral development banks to be reformed in order to meet the needs of developing economies for sustainable development and climate resilience. He emphasised that a clear roadmap is needed to deliver on the Glasgow 2021 decision to double adaptation financing by 2025. | \</doc>

Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe has vowed to push the legal wrangle with anti-gas exploration activists all the way to the Constitutional Court. Mantashe was speaking at the Africa Oil Week event, which saw politicians, bureaucrats, bankers and European suits roll into Adderley Street to discuss oil and energy prospects, while protesting eco-activists smeared fake blood on themselves and left splatters on the pavement at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. Mantashe said developments were unfolding in the upstream petroleum industry, and the government notedwith interest lobby groups\' pushback. On September 1, the Makhanda (Grahamstown) High Court squashed Mantashe\' s decision to grant Shell exploration rights for a seismic survey to explore gas and off the Wild Coast. The decision was first granted in 2014 and renewed last year, but activists reviewed the decision.  The court (case) in Grahamstown will end up in the apex court. That\' s how determined we are. Mantashe said.  South Africa needs development more than ever. We cannot give up and die in poverty.  Hunger is killing more people than anything else and we have a responsibility to develop the country, he said. Mantashe touched on the contentious $8.5 billion (R150bn) COP26 deal of 2021, which saw the US and EU agree to loan SA concessional and interest loans to wean Eskom off coal energy, transition and fast-track the country to green energy. Bloomberg reported on Monday that the deal was on the precipice as Global North powers seek to coerce SA in how these loans are to be used. The agreement is expected to be discussed at the COP27 summit in Egypt next month. Quizzed on the funding talks, Mantashe said:  I\' m tempted to give the COP27 (question) to technocrats, but let me make one point: Africa cannot be dictated to. There is a concept (of) encirclement. When you\' re encircled, it means as a smaller economy you have no space to think and you\' re a conduit of ideas of developed economies. I think that is bad for Africa. Many of the sufferings we have are a product of colonisation, so solutions must be home-grown. Africa itself must think about responding to its challenges. He said when developed economies say part of the $8.5bn loan  is going be on accelerated exit of coal, I think it\' s in their interest, not in our interest . Mantashe repeated his long-held view that South Africa must be systematic in moving away from coal and thoroughly weigh implications.  Africa is unique and has its own challenges. Whatever comes out of COP27 must respond to the challenges of Africa. We\' re not going to get solutions from the EU, he said. Mantashe said it was ironic that SA\' s coal exports to Europe had increased eightfold, or by 720%, while Europe pressures SA to completely shun coal.  Therefore, coal is a benefit to Africa, he said. Mantashe said climate change and the need to decarbonise  sits uncomfortably next to energy poverty and  the urgency for improved human development . Turning his attention to protesters, he said hunger killed faster than fossil fuels. Smeared in symbolic blood outside, Extinction Rebellion spokesperson Judy Scott-Goldman said:  We reject the idea of investing in new oil and gas projects in Africa as we increase carbon emissions every year, and we believe oil and gas (explorers) have blood on their hands. Mantashe expressed confidence in the new Eskom board and said though it was not operational, the new members had capacity and skill. \</doc>

My trajectory as an activist started in 1992 when I was a child in Brazil and the city of Rio de Janeiro hosted Rio 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development, also known as the  Earth Summit . As described on the UN\' s website,  this global conference brought together political leaders, diplomats, scientists, representatives of the media and NGOs from 179 countries for a massive effort to focus on the impact of human socio-economic activities on the environment. A \' Global Forum\' of NGOs was also held in Rio de Janeiro at the same time, bringing together an unprecedented number of NGO representatives, who presented their vision of the world\' s future about the environment and socio-economic development . Two of the many great achievements of the  Earth Summit were the Rio Declaration and its 27 universal principles and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which has hosted the Conference of Parties (COP) for the past 27 years. As a Brazilian girl breathing in the excitement of that convention, the first in which climate change was acknowledged to be a global concern, I was taken by the certainty that my generation would lead the environmental change as we had the information that the previous generations lacked to achieve sustainable development. Thirty years later, I entered COP27 , voicing the same concerns that I had in 1992 and still fighting for change. Over the past 30 years, there were many environmental wins: the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty that committed industrialised countries and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with agreed individual targets; the Paris agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change that drove countries into producing five-year cycles of commitments through their nationally determined contributions; among many others. Unfortunately, the excitement of many of these wins did not reflect in bold action, and the mechanisms that could enable bold climate action, including the necessary financing mechanisms that developing nations need to transition into an economy less reliant on fossil fuels, are lacking. At COP27 Unfortunately, the COP also exposes the resistance that power holders have when it comes to changing production systems and acting on the climate emergency. Carbon credits, offsetting, and waste-to-energy are some of the many  solutions proposed here that perpetuate the concentration of power, centralisation of decision-making and, above all, enable privileged rich countries and companies to continuously generate wealth that harms the planet and most people living in it. Even worse, the initiatives create a form of climate colonialism as they basically turn communities and ecosystems in the global south into enablers of profit in the global north. When I think of the young activist who emerged in Brazil in 1992, I confess that I question if I did justice to her dreams and ambitions. Despite 30 years of dedication to the vision of a balanced world and a planet in peace, I constantly ask myself if my contributions had any relevant impact in moving towards it. Frequently, when I look around, I find the most inspiring people I know asking themselves the same question. I remind myself that we are one link in a long chain of change and that each of us is here to take action forward and ease the load on the next generation, the generation of my two young kids, who will have to deal with all the commitments that we under deliver. As COP27 Thirty years later, the girl inside me still believes that the dream is possible. Do you? \</doc>

Egypt will position itself as an impartial arbiter while hosting this year's COP27 UN climate summit, as it pushes other nations to act on climate pledges while promoting the interests of the developing world, a senior Egyptian official said. - Egypt, where unauthorised public demonstrations are banned, would also welcome protests within the rules of the 7-18 November summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, said Wael Aboulmagd, special representative to the COP27 president. A natural gas exporter, Egypt takes over presidency of the UN climate talks from Britain. Last year's summit in Glasgow, Scotland, ended with the nearly 200 countries in attendance promising to strengthen their climate pledges this year. Wealthy nations also disappointed many in Glasgow by saying they would not deliver the $100bn per year promised from 2020 until 2023 to help developing countries with their energy transition and with adapting to a warming world. Delivering this financing is among Egypt's priorities for COP27 . It also wants to focus on securing separate "loss and damage" funds, or compensation payments to climate-vulnerable countries already suffering from climate-related weather extremes, Aboulmagd said in an interview. "There are issues that are of interest and priority to developing countries, and there are high expectations from us as a developing country to ensure that these issues are taken on board and that they achieve commensurate progress with how important they are," he said. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/702/227706.html :EMBED--> Mediating between developed and developing countries But Egypt also would seek to mediate between developed and developing countries that have clashed over issues including carbon emissions and climate financing, as it tries to help steer a move from pledges to action, Aboulmagd said. "In this particular year, it is in the interest of the process that a perception of impartiality and equal distance from everyone is maintained." Aboulmagd said Egypt was working to launch about 17 voluntary initiatives in areas including food and agriculture and water management, hoping to inspire ideas and action to help countries meet their pledges. Egypt is fine tuning its own updated target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC). "We intend to move even faster, despite very difficult circumstances," Aboulmagd said, referring to economic disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/701/227697.html :EMBED--> Including civil society organisations from Africa To promote global access and representation at COP27 , Egypt has sought to fast track accreditation for under-represented civil society organisations from Africa, Aboulmagd said, adding that he hoped climate campaigners and activists play a constructive role. "There are certain rules and we're working with the secretariat to ensure that if there are people who want to protest, they're entitled to do that, and it's done in a peaceful manner," he said. "It's good to have people yelling at you - hopefully not throwing stuff at you, but just yelling at you and we're accustomed to that." Egypt's government had worked with hotels to provide affordable accommodation for participants in Sharm el-Sheikh, a tourist resort on the Red Sea, he said. "What we have done to the utmost is to ensure that decent hotels and very reasonable rates are made available." - {\rtlch\alang1025\afs24\ltrch\fs24\lang1033\langnp1033\langfe1033\langfenp1033\cell \</doc>

World Bank loan for SA Funds to help green Eskom plantTalks in final stage World Bank loan will help Eskom repurpose Komati Editor at LargeThe World Bank is finalising talks with the government on a loan to finance the shutdown and "greening" of Eskom's old coal-fired Komati power station, as the bank builds on the $1.2bn in loans it has extended to SA over the past year and promises more budgetary support for SA if the government requests it. The bank's Komati project loan is separate from the $8.5bn that has been committed by the Just Energy Transition (JET) partnership comprising the UK, US, Germany, France and the EU. But it comes as SA is busy finalising its climate investment plan, which is due to be announced at the climate change COP27 conference in Egypt in November. World Bank vice-president for East and Southern Africa Victoria Kwakwa said the bank had been asked to help finance the decommissioning of the Komati power plant. "We were asked to do this not because of the financing we bring but also because we can support in the repurposing for renewables and we can help do it in a way that really puts the social issues front and centre ... in a process like this where you really want to make sure that the dislocation of workers and communities are taken care of, I think we bring some value to the table," Kwakwa said in an interview on Thursday. She did not disclose the size or terms of the Komati loan, which she expects will be announced in October ahead of the COP27 meeting. Energy industry sources say it will be a loan to Eskom, rather than to the government, though it will be guaranteed by the Treasury. Komati, in Mpumalanga, is one of Eskom's oldest power stations and its units are being gradually shut down as they reach the end of their useful lives. The last one is due to shut next year. Eskom plans to pilot it as a model for decommissioning old coal-fired stations and repurposing them to run on renewable energy or natural gas, in ways that reduce the effect of the transition on employees and local communities. The power utility has made it clear it will need concessional finance to enable this. The World Bank has lent money to Eskom before, granting a controversial $3.75bn loan in 2010 to help finance the building of Medupi and of two renewable energy projects (one of which was never built). But it was only during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 that the government itself turned to the bank and other international financial institutions, including the IMF, for the first time, borrowing from them at cheaper rates and better terms than it can obtain on global capital markets. The World Bank approved a $750m development policy loan to SA's government in January, which was for general budgetary support, and a further $480m loan in June for SA's Covid-19 emergency response, which helped retroactively to fund SA's vaccine rollout. The $1.2bn lent to SA during its fiscal year to end-June was a small part of the World Bank's $33bn of lending to Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, Kwakwa said, and it did not displace lending to other, poorer countries. It had also facilitated grants to projects in battery storage and carbon capture and is completing a detailed Country Climate and Development Report for SA, as well as for other countries such as India, for release ahead of COP27 . Speaking to SA media this week, the British high commissioner to SA, Antony Phillipson, said the JET partners are working closely with the SA government to develop an investment plan, with the aim of publishing it at COP27 . Under the agreement, SA would use the money to decommission coal-fired plants, partially replace them with cleaner energy, expand its transmission grid and compensate coal-dependent communities, Bloomberg reports.

Eyes on G20 Summit and COP27 Dear African Leaders, Ending hunger has been one of the greatest challenges of our times and the devastating events from the past two years have worsened food insecurity. In 2021, a staggering 278-million Africans - one in five people - were affected by malnutrition. The invasion of Ukraine has further exacerbated these conditions. Back-to-back emergencies, aggravated by climate change, conflict, and a pandemic, are affecting people across our continent. Many now face starvation, children are not getting the nutrients they need to grow to their full potential, and year-on-year droughts have caused failed harvests, making it hard for African farmers to grow food and for the continent to become self-sufficient. The good news is that immediate action by you can make a difference. In 2014, African leaders developed a framework - the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) - to enhance agricultural production. However, right now we desperately need you to meet your commitments for the future of the continent. The G20 Summit and COP27 are taking place in a few weeks and achieving global cooperation on food security would be a major win. Ahead of them, we are calling on you to urgently act to: increase the share of domestic agriculture expenditure on adaptation to be in line with CAADP commitments, such as improving social safety nets, investing in more dietary diverse food systems, and securing access to irrigated land; expand the African Emergency Food Production Facility to reach a total of 30-million farmers to boost their access to agricultural fertilizers, and allow them to produce food urgently; pledge to stop rising food prices by keeping them and agricultural markets open and guard against unjustified restrictive measures on food and agriculture exports; reduce reliance on food imports by investing in domestic production, agricultural adaptation, and increasing agricultural output in a sustainable manner. Act now so that everyone across our beautiful continent can have enough food to live and thrive. With hope, Nomzamo Mbatha, Ameyau Debrah, Esther Chungu, Thandi Vundamina, Natasha Vandermaas, Darkovibes, Berla Mundi, Sarkodie, Slap Dee, Gyakie, Sabrina Dhowre Elba \</doc>

It will take some time for the public to pick out the letters in the muddy alphabet soup served up by COP27 . This thin gruel was placed on the table after two weeks of hard-core hustling at the world's most important climate conference. Some say the global climate title fight, where world leaders and their sponsors slug it out in the ring to keep business going as usual, is a failure, serving only to mendaciously foster false hopes. For others, it is an important moment where humanity, staggering through an era of appalling demagoguery and alarming democratic decline, looks to find solutions. We have had a year of disturbingly lethal weather. In the global north, the UK roasted in 40.3& xB0;C record temperatures, swathes of Europe were on fire, killing hundreds, and the US and China were scorched. Ironically, the world's chief climate truant, the US, was also smashed by hurricanes. In SA on April 11, the "Durban bombs" - a subtropical-influenced storm - coalesced with planning failure to cause 459 deaths, and in the Eastern Cape the deluges killed 23. In the Buffalo City Metro on January 8 and 9, minor storms killed eight, and at 5.30am on August 8, a storm travelling at 126km/h smashed into the city and adjacent coastline, causing extensive damage. In 2021, the Dispatch launched a weekly Off Track page and was impressed at the response. Our readers are becoming climate smart in the new, unpredictable world. And yet, from COP27 , it appears that many African leaders have taken the myopic view that it's all about money - the polluter must pay. That is a justified position, but for African countries, among them our own, to say they intend to turn every ounce of their fossil deposits into energy and cash, means it is time for the public to sit up even straighter. Wealthier nations, the original polluters, with SA not far behind in contributing 12% of carbon emissions, have also stepped up their fossil fuel emissions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is perhaps a metaphor for this return to the dark age of coal. Global activists, led by SA's Climate Justice Charter movement, are calling for an end to "climate apartheid" and "ecocide" and are seeking to formalise an alternative COP, where all people talk without government and fossil lobby meddling. The core issues are how to move humanity towards renewable energy, and repair the damage done by extractive economics. As the increase in global average temperature heads to shoot way over 1.5& xB0;C, it is clear that only public action - from the smallest river health group to global movements taking on corruption and deceit - stands the best chance of creating a liveable planet for generations to come. \</doc>

HYDROGEN ECONOMY PIC buys into strategy to develop 'fuel of the future' Investment WriterThe Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which invests the pensions of government employees, has committed to providing early-stage capital for the development of SA's hydrogen value chain. Africa's largest state-run investment firm, which oversees about R2.548-trillion in assets, announced its "hydrogen investment strategy" on Monday, saying that it wanted to "leverage" the more than 200 hydrogen projects announced worldwide. The PIC also said its strategy would look to help fund the R4.3-trillion required to develop SA's hydrogen economy. "The Hydrogen Roadmap has identified the PIC as a potential coinvestor with other finance institutions in hydrogen projects. Hydrogen can augment renewable energy production by offering a relatively affordable way to store and transport the excess energy produced from these sources," the PIC said. "SA also hosts the world's largest platinum group metals resources, which benefit significantly from increased demand that could arise from a well-developed hydrogen sector." The Hydrogen Roadmap is a government strategy aimed at bringing together public and private stakeholders to invest in hydrogen-related technology as a means of boosting economic growth and reducing the carbon intensity of SA's energy system. The PIC said hydrogen promises to be the next frontier in clean-energy technology and investing in the local hydrogen economy is likely to have positive effects on society, the planet and its clients' portfolios. The PIC's statement comes as SA is under pressure to decarbonise its economy amid a worldwide push for more sustainable energy solutions, which happens to coincide with a local power-generating shortfall due to load-shedding from Eskom's largely coal-fired fleet of ageing power plants. President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled an almost R1.5-trillion Just Energy Transition Investment Plan just ahead of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, aimed at enabling SA to gradually reduce its reliance on coal-fired power in favour of more renewable alternatives. The plan is partly a response to the $8.5bn funding package pledged by the US, the UK, the EU, Germany and France at the COP26 summit last year. It is aimed at supporting SA's just energy transition, but requires the country to present a credible and acceptable plan to access the money. Before the COP27 "This technology, which is SA-owned IP [intellectual property], is very significant because it allows the potential for the development of a green liquid fuel, and if we can do that, we would essentially be turning sunshine into oil," Creecy said in October. theunisseng@businesslive.co.za 200 hydrogen projects announced worldwide so far $8.5bn funding pledged by the US, the UK, the EU, Germany and France at the COP26 summit \</doc>

The recent UN HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-change/ climate change conference ( HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop27/ COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh offered encouraging but insufficient signs of an emerging political consensus on the need for global solidarity in the face of HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/global-warming/ global warming . Now, world leaders need to attend to another existential risk to people and the planet: the alarming and growing loss of biodiversity. In Montreal, from Wednesday 7 December to Monday 19 December, governments will come together at the HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/events/conference/un-biodiversity-conference-cop-15 UN Biodiversity Conference HYPERLINK https://www.cbd.int/article/draft-1-global-biodiversity-framework recovery by 2030 . We cannot afford for this conference to be treated as a sideshow or afterthought to COP27 . The HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/biodiversity-crisis/ biodiversity crisis HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-crisis/ climate crisis , and it is escalating quickly. It must be a top political priority for all countries. Given the current rates of biodiversity loss, some scientists estimate that we are on track to lose HYPERLINK https://www.dw.com/en/what-to-expect-from-the-worlds-sixth-mass-extinction/a-60360245 three-quarters of the world's species within only a few centuries. This mass extinction and the ongoing threat to ecosystems and habitats are inextricably linked to climate change. That is why world leaders must come to COP15 with high ambitions and set a mandate for successful negotiations. To succeed, COP15 must not only deliver an agreement on the overall mission. It also must set clearly defined goals and establish concrete plans to protect HYPERLINK 30% of all land and ocean When I was first elected president of Colombia in 2010, I found myself running a country that was almost entirely flooded for 18 months. The climate pattern known as HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/la-nina-2/ La Ni\'f1a , aggravated by global warming, meant near-biblical levels of rainfall.\~ Lacking the tools or know-how to handle the situation, we saw that we needed to make peace with nature. Experts advised focusing on the protection of biodiversity, so that is what we did. Colombia, one of the world's most biodiverse countries, now has a HYPERLINK https://www.protectedplanet.net/country/COL combined protected area We understand both the value of nature and what we stand to lose when it is eroded. We also have come to appreciate what we can learn from those with the closest relationship to the land. Many indigenous communities had been warning of an ecological crisis for decades, only to have their voices and rights dismissed. Nature loss hurts people everywhere. It is already harming human health, reducing air quality, undermining our ability to grow food or obtain water, exacerbating extreme weather events and weakening our ability to mitigate or adapt to climate change. These problems make biodiversity loss a security issue. Continued damage to our ecosystems is one of the biggest long-term risks to our societies. As an economic matter, the collapse of certain essential ecosystems is all it would take to push countries like mine into bankruptcy. Consider, for example, that about HYPERLINK 75% of food crops rely on animal pollinators such as bees, birds and butterflies. The loss of all animal pollinators seems unthinkable, yet it is a real threat. And if food becomes scarcer, the poorest will suffer first. Moreover, the destruction of habitats is a serious public health threat, not least because it is bringing humans and animals into closer and more frequent contact. The HYPERLINK World Health Organisation HYPERLINK https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241563444 warns that this is both causing existing infectious diseases to spread more quickly and accelerating the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens. Finally, not only is climate change one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss; the destruction of ecosystems is undermining the planet's ability to neutralise the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions. South America's HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22459-8 Andean forests , for example, act as critical carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide that would otherwise be hastening the pace of global warming. Forests, wetlands, underwater kelp forests, mangroves and other natural systems also provide protection from extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, heatwaves and storms, by acting as natural buffers or reservoirs. Biodiversity loss not only makes climate change worse, but also eliminates our best line of defence against it. COP15 offers a major opportunity for governments to achieve a breakthrough - equivalent to the 2015 HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/paris-agreement/ Paris climate agreement To be sure, the current effort suffers from a lack of high-level political engagement, leading many to question why we have two separate convention processes for issues that go hand in hand. They are right to wonder.\~ Looking ahead, I would like to see us bring both conventions together, in recognition of the fact that climate change and biodiversity loss must be addressed in tandem. In the meantime, though, we cannot afford further delay on setting ambitious targets to protect and restore biodiversity this decade. The recent " HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/cop27-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-new-loss-and-damage-fund-for-vulnerable-countries loss and damage " agreement at COP27 demonstrated that, with sufficient resolve, countries can work together on seemingly intractable issues.

Thirty-year-old Difasi Amooti Kisembo is one of the demonstrators near the EU delegation offices in Kampala. He and a handful of others have traveled from Uganda's oil and gas-rich Albertine region's district to Uganda's capital Kampala to express their displeasure with an EU Parliament's resolution against the planned construction of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. "EU Stop neocolonialism and imperialism on Uganda's oil projects," reads the placard that Kisembo holding. Next to Kisembo is Lucas Eikiriza with a message: "Our pipeline is safe, EU stand aside". While there is opposition to the planned construction of a 1,443km pipeline from Uganda through Tanzania and Tilenga and Kingfisher upstream oil projects in Uganda, Kisembo told IPS that he has, over the last 16 years, patiently waited to see oil flow from this formerly sleepy and remote part of Uganda. "I have not seen that oil with my eyes, but I'm already seeing the benefits. The roads are very good now, there were grass-thatched huts all over my village, but those have been replaced with iron-roofed (ones) thanks to oil that was discovered in Bunyoro," Kisembo told IPS. "So when I heard that the Europeans want the government to stop the projects, I said that we, the young Banyoro, should stand up against that nonsense just like our forefathers fought the British colonialists." TotalEnergies and its partner China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in February decided to invest more than $10 billion into Lake Albert Development Project. The landscape in Buliisa and Hoima districts has drastically changed with a number of needed infrastructures like the Central Processing Facility, an international airport, and well pads under construction. "Everyone is going to gain. Anytime I'm sure that everybody is going to enjoy this oil and the developments which are coming in," said Peter Mayanja, a real estate dealer and owner of Farm Bridge Investments, told IPS The EU parliament in mid-September adopted a resolution denouncing the Tilenga and EACOP projects by TotalEnergies, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or CNOOC Group, backed by the governments of Uganda and Tanzania. "Put an end to the extractive activities in protected and sensitive ecosystems, including the shores of Lake Albert," reads part of the resolution. They suggested that to have a chance to limit global warming to 1,5\'b0C, no new oil extraction project should be developed. The resolution has since attracted criticism from Uganda, Tanzania, and from some of the advocates in Africa who believe that Africa should be allowed to harness their oil and gas discoveries to develop their economies as they transition to renewable energy sources. Uganda's Vice President, Jessica Alupo, took the matter to the just concluded UN General Assembly in New York. She said it is hypocritical for countries that have been at the center of polluting the environment to preach to countries that have borne the impact of those environmental violations how to act responsibly. "Our view is that development should be environmentally friendly, inclusive, and provide benefits for all; it should leave no one behind," Alupo said While Uganda's International Relations Minister, Henry Okello Oryem, told IPS, "So the European don't want Africa to develop its natural resources? And yet it is the only way to solve our problems. Our people continue to cut trees as the cheapest source of fuel. So if we don't avail them with alternatives like gas, who will?" asked Oryem. On the other hand, Proscovia Nabbanja, the chief executive of the Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC), which has stakes in EACOP, told IPS that the suggestion by the wealthier nations to Africa and other developing countries to leave their oil and gas underground was unfair. "While I understand the concerns related to climate change, I don't want to ignore the value that the projects bring to alleviate energy poverty, which is a critical issue in Uganda, improving the economy, and also propelling our country to industrialization," said Nabbanja. Uganda expects 160,000 jobs to be created by the projects located in Uganda's Albertine Graben, bordering DRC. The East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) is expected to create five thousand jobs during its construction. Ayuk told IPS that some of the campaigns are being funded by groups from the west to civil society organizations based in countries that have vast oil and gas resources. Sizeable deposits of oil and gas have been discovered in Uganda, Namibia, C\'f4te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Ghana, Angola, DRC, and South Sudan, among others. "I want the civil society to fiercely advocate for the environment so that we don't have any kind of environmental risks. But it is important that they don't put out misinformation," said Ayuk. "It is really important because that misinformation comes to the detriment of young people who need jobs. It comes to the detriment of a country that needs investment, that wants to grow. That wants to survive on its resources without going for aid." He said the drive against investment in fossil fuel in Africa is an ideological position from the western countries against Africa's oil and gas discoveries. "Africans are asking themselves why should we pay the price and punishment for western countries that have taken our resources, have invested and developed their economies, and now that it is our time, you tell us that we cannot because it is going to hurt the environment. When you were doing it, didn't you think it was going to hurt the environment?" asked Ayuk. Modestus Martin Lumato, Director General Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA), who recently visited Uganda, told IPS that 70% of Tanzania's power generation is from natural gas and that abandoning it that fast would negatively impact the country. "Sixty of our industries are powered by natural gas. In 2010 we discovered a huge deposit of natural gas in the deep sea; Tanzania is looking forward to exporting it. We expect oil and gas companies to invest over $30 billion in a project planned to produce 10 million tons per annum," said Lumato. Tanzania's natural gas reserves are said to be equivalent to US$150 billion- or 6-times Tanzania's current GDP. COP 27 Africa to Talk Tough A number of meetings have been held in Africa in preparation for the 27th UN Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) will be held in Egypt from November 7 to 18, 2022. In mid-July, a technical committee of the African Union adopted "The African Common Position on Energy Access and Just Transition". It stipulates that Africa will continue to deploy all forms of its abundant energy resources, including non-renewable and renewable, to address the energy crisis in the continent. This position was discussed at the 4th Africa Climate talks at the University Eduardo Mondlane in Maputo, Mozambique, as well as African Climate Week in Togo. Linus Mafor, a Senior Environmental Affairs Officer leading work on energy, infrastructure, and climate change at the African Climate Policy, said the Africa position was aimed at attaining sustainable energy for Africa. He told IPS that Africa accounts for 17% of the global population and contributes to less than 4% of emissions, and it is the least energized region in the world. "Africa is home to 78% of people who don't have electricity; at the same time, it needs to industrialize, it needs to close the development gap to meet the SDG. So there should be a win-win situation. Let Africa use its natural gas as a transition fuel to renewable energy," said Mafor. According to Mafor, energy poverty is holding Africa from development. "Africa has got a rich source of energy, whether fossils or renewables. The demand is there, but the supply is not there; we can't progress on SDGs or Africa Union Agenda 2063 if there is a huge energy access problem that is not addressed," he said The African Union, through UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), has indicated that over the past ten years, less than two percent of the public clean energy investment globally went to Africa. That finding was buttressed by the International Energy Agency's Cost of Capital Dashboard launched this month. It observed that emerging and developing economies, excluding China, account for less than one-fifth of global investment in clean energy. One of the key barriers, according to IEA, is a high cost of capital, reflecting some real and perceived risks about investment in these economies The COP26 in Glasgow noted with regret that developed country parties had not met the $100 billion goal annually. At COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, the African Group wants developed country parties to agree to honor the $100 billion in climate finance promise. The Special Representative of COP27 , President-Designate Wael Aboulmagd, has indicated the developed countries have fallen short of delivering the $100 billion. "It has never been delivered ... But what people don't talk about is if we had the $100 billion, would we be much better off? The $100 is an arbitrary figure that was put out of thin air that has no reality on the ground," observed Aboulmagd. "We as responsible global citizens said we will come along on the understanding that appropriate funding will be there. So this trust has been broken by failure to deliver year, after year," said Aboulmagd. According to Aboulmagd, at present, only 2% of renewable energy investment from the private sector goes to Africa. "With more than 600 million in Africa lacking access to basic electricity, universal access to energy is a priority," he said. Back in Uganda and Tanzania, Ayuk told IPS that citizens like Zephaniah and Mayanja, and Awadh should be worried about campaigns trying to block projects like Lake Albert Development and EACOP. "They should be worried because there is a very strong movement saying the money should not come into African oil and gas. I think we need to rally African financing for projects."

His Excellency Mr Ant\'f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, President of COP 27 , Dr Sameh Shoukry, Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government, We are gathered here for COP 27 on an African continent that is experiencing the worsening effects of climate change. Like other vulnerable regions, Africa needs to build adaptive capacity, foster resilience and address loss and damage, as we all agreed at Paris COP 21. To achieve this, our continent will need a predictable, appropriate and at-scale funding stream and technological support. This must support our right to development, international equity and transitions that are just and inclusive. This places a great responsibility on developed economies to honour their commitments to those countries with the greatest need and that confront the greatest environmental, social and economic effects of climate change. The multilateral development banks need to be reformed to meet the needs of developing economies for sustainable development and climate resilience. At present, multilateral support is out of reach of the majority of the world's population due to lending policies that are risk averse and carry onerous costs and conditionalities. We need a clear roadmap to deliver on the Glasgow decision to double adaptation financing by 2025. Our emphasis must be on the health, well-being and food and water security of the most vulnerable. At a national level, South Africa is fully committed to achieving the most ambitious end of the mitigation range in our updated Nationally Determined Contribution. As a country, we are guided by a Just Transition Framework and an Investment Plan that outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve our decarbonisation goals over the next five years. We are already scaling up investment in renewable energy, and are on course to retire several of our ageing coal-fired power plants by the end of 2030. At COP 26 in Glasgow last year, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union offered support in the form of a Just Energy Transition Partnership. It is our hope that this partnership will offer a ground-breaking approach to funding by developed countries for the ambitious but necessary mitigation and adaptation goals of developing countries. South Africa reiterates its support for the Egyptian Presidency and its confidence in the successful outcomes of COP 27 . \</doc>

ACTIVISTS and analysts have expressed growing concern about South Africa\' s increasing loans to fund its Just Energy Transition Programme (JETP) following more than R10 billion in loans from European countries. France and Germany have signed loan agreements for the two European nations to each extend \€ 300 million, or a combined least R10.7bn, in concessional financing to South Africa to support the country\' s efforts to reduce its reliance on coal through a just transition to cleaner energy sources. The announcement was made yesterday amid the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference, or COP27 , in Egypt. The loans are provided by the French and German public development banks, AFD and KfW, directly to the South African government via the National Treasury. They are part of investment plans to the International Partners Group (IPG), which has pledged $8.5bn to facilitate South Africa\' s just energy transition. But the Fair Finance Coalition of Southern Africa yesterday said that it had been frustrated by the lack of publicly available information on the JETP since its announcement last year at COP26. The coalition is made up of civil society organisations including 350Africa.org, the African Climate Reality Project (ACRP) and the Centre for Environmental Rights. The coalition said it was concerned about the additional debt burden occasioned by the $8.5bn offer, which primarily takes the form of loans. Alia Kajee, public finance campaigner for 350Africa.org, said civil society was not adequately included and consulted.  Civil society continues to demand that climate finance for South Africa does not result in additional debt, Kajee said.  Civil society can support the JETP process if it is transparent, inclusive and committed to ensuring that the people are at the centre of the just transition. Amy Giliam Thorp, branch manager for ACRP, said they were calling for climate finance that was fair, transparent, and inclusive, without locking the country into further debt.  Given their developmental mandates, PFIs have an important role and obligation to finance a just and equitable society. As the findings from our policy assessment show, PFIs in southern Africa, like the African Development Bank, have much work to do to ensure transparent public finance that helps address the climate crisis, Thorp said. Through the Integrated Resource Plans of 2010 and 2019, South Africa has a clear path to decarbonisation through a new technology mix and the decommissioning of Eskom\' s plants. President Cyril Ramaphosa this week told delegates at COP27 that South Africa will need R1.5 trillion in investment to support its just transition over the next five years. In a statement yesterday, the Treasury\' s acting director-general Ismail Momoniat said funding from France and Germany would assist in addressing the challenge of financing the critical adaptation and mitigation programmes and supporting a resilient, sustainable and inclusive growth.  These loans are concessional and contribute to the government\' s efforts to mitigate rising government debt costs, he said. However, independent energy analyst Lungile Mashele yesterday questioned how much of this funding was concessional and how much was commercial funding. \</doc>

COMMODITIES DIPLOMACY Here's a game in which SA can win big if it builds ties Going into COP27 Commodities markets are set to become the prime currency of diplomacy. Oil has been an oft-used tool, but what this year has shown is that globally, minerals, fuels and metals are all fair game. If SA learns to play the game effectively, it has substantial scope for growth. After all, excluding petroleum, it is the world's wealthiest mining jurisdiction, with a non-energy mineral reserve value of $2.4-trillion. But, while market and macro fundamentals remain important, supply and demand considerations are being surpassed by geopolitical factors, by both firms and governments alike. Canada is investing up to C$220m ($162m) in Rio Tinto's projects to position its mining operations in Quebec as a centre of excellence for critical minerals processing. The partnership will reduce reliance on China and strengthen the security of supply for critical minerals, particularly titanium and scandium, and provide for US and Canadian manufacturers. Up to now China has produced 75% of finished titanium products and 61% of scandium. QUADRUPLE OUTPUT Rio Tinto became the first North American producer of scandium, a key mineral in fuel cells and aluminium alloys. With the investment from the Canadian government, the company will quadruple its production capacity to 12 tonnes a year. Canada's innovation, science & industry minister announced that his government is "committed to the sustainable development of critical minerals resources, creating good jobs and building strong global supply chains, while strengthening trade relationships with Canada's closest allies". These include Germany and South Korea. Earlier this year companies from these countries visited Canada to secure supplies of commodities, including cobalt and nickel, for electric cars produced by VW and Mercedes-Benz, as well as battery producer LG Energy Solution. These would be offtake contracts for Rio Tinto given that sales to China generated 57% of its Canadian revenues in 2021, and trade restrictions in the event of China invading Taiwan would hobble its Canadian operations. The move by the Canadian government and Rio Tinto will therefore support the firm's profitability and Canada's energy and national security. In the UK, the London Metals Exchange, the largest market for standardised forward contracts, futures contracts and options on base metals, is under pressure to stop holding Russian metals. Russia produces 7% of the world's nickel, 6% of aluminium and 5% of copper. Further restrictions on Russia could trigger a stockpile of Russian metals, which would trigger global price distortions for copper and aluminium. Government restrictions are also under consideration. The US is weighing sanctions on Russian aluminium, which could include tariffs or bans and would have implications for the global metals market. With Opec having cut production by 2-million barrels a day ahead of the US midterm election next month, the Biden administration could leverage anti-cartel legislation against the oil cartel, release additional supply from the strategic petroleum reserve, limit US firms' exports, or loosen sanctions on imports from Iran and Venezuela. BE STRATEGIC But what do these geopolitical dynamics mean for SA commodities? Be strategic. Going into COP27 SA needs to think not just about donor funding for mitigation efforts but also what it can bring to global markets and how to leverage it to strengthen trade ties. For example, SA is the number one palladium producer, followed by Russia. Palladium prices skyrocketed after the Ukraine invasion to levels not seen since 1984. SA also has platinum and manganese deposits that can be leveraged. By building ties with partners that are pursuing diversification, as the US has done with Australia for rare earths, and Canada is doing with Germany and South Korea, SA has the scope to bring in considerable - and much needed - long-term revenues. SA has long had the market fundamentals and favourable macro environments for these clean energy commodities. But prioritising trade relations with pariah states will threaten SA producers and limit what could be substantial windfalls that could be used to contain debt and finance strategic development objectives. Going into COP27 Dr Baskaran is a bye-fellow in economics at the University of Cambridge. \</doc>

Falling Walls Science Summit Since climate literacy is associated with individuals with higher news consumption, education and specialist occupations, communities are experiencing a brain drain at a time they can afford it least. This is according to a study published in the science journal Climatic Change. Speaking to TimesLIVE at the Falling Walls Science Summit in Berlin this week, co-author Daniel Meierriks, from WZB Berlin Social Science, said between the 1970s and 2000s, temperatures had risen far quicker than at any other time, creating direct and indirect effects on communities. But on average in their large-scale study, he and co-authors found that "only 44% of respondents are climate literate". The study sought to ascertain if people had even heard of the climate crisis and if they could pinpoint how it made things worse, directly and indirectly. They explored the migration intentions of more than 37,000 individuals in 30 African countries. What emerged is that the "correlates of climate literacy were news consumption, education, urban living and specialist occupations". Because of this, communities are losing parts of their population that they really should not want to lose. While temperatures have increased by 0.2% a year between 1960 and 2016, urbanisation has roughly doubled, increasing from 35% to 60% by the end of the observation period. Global warming can lead to increased urbanisation, but it's not that simple. It can be a slow and long-term effect. For example, global warming might cause a loss in agricultural production and in the context of cities already looking attractive to rural dwellers, many of the latter may make the move once they perceive the agricultural impact. "Sometimes the effects of global warming only emerge in the long-run when you see the cumulative effects," explains Meierriks, "and also remember that warming matters the most for developing countries that lack the resources to adapt". He said the climate crisis was bringing on " internal and external migration" and that the effect on developed and developing countries often differed. However, micro-evidence is important to understand migration at the level of individuals, and this is one of the first studies to do so. They found that climate change leads to stronger migration intentions only among the climate literate, and that there is only a migratory response when long-term increases in local temperatures become apparent, rather than an actual event like a heatwave or drought. So what can be done? According to experts at COP27 , it is likely too late to prevent climate change and "is crucial to soften the blow by helping the most vulnerable people prepare and adapt". "It is very important that COP27 , a COP for implementation, does not exclude the voice of humanity: the most vulnerable communities," said Yasmine Fouad, Egypt's minister of environment. Ko Barrett, vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said, "Whether it's transport, energy, food production, buildings or manufacturing - all of them must be fundamentally transformed." - TimesLIVE \</doc>

The devastation that Cyclone Idai caused in Mozambique in 2019 galvanised the world to take action against climate change, much as the deadly floods in Pakistan did this summer. Yet, three years later, Mozambique has given up waiting for help from abroad and is focused on developing its massive natural gas resources to fund recovery and growth. One of the world\' s poorest nations, Mozambique, joined the club of gas- exporting countries earlier this month when it flagged off its first shipment of liquefied natural gas to Europe. Funds obtained from selling fossil fuels will help fund the country\' s green transition, said Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi in an interview with Bloomberg Green.  We need to allow an opportunity for these fossil fuels to be exploited so that we can generate resources for renewable energies, Nyusi said earlier this month, speaking on the sidelines of the COP27 climate meeting in the Egyptian town of Sharm el-Sheikh.  We need to be given opportunities \- other developed countries had this opportunity. The energy crisis sparked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine has sent European nations on a quest for alternative gas sources. In recent months, countries such as Germany and Italy have been looking to secure supplies from African nations while at the same time discouraging the use of gas and other fossil fuels in international forums, including COP27 . COP27 that he believed renewable energy needed to play a key role in the world\' s efforts to decarbonise and fight climate change, but that gas could play  a transitional role . About 70% of Mozambique\' s grid is supplied with hydroelectric power, but electricity reaches only around a third of the country\' s people. The government is now seeking developers for a $4.5 billion (about R78bn) hydro-power dam and a transmission project in the centre of the country. Selling some of its ample gas reserves could provide enough funds to bring electricity to more people, Nyusi said. Getting payments for leaving fossil fuels in the ground \- a solution considered as part of a potential Just Energy Transition Partnership for Senegal \- wouldn\' t make sense either because it wouldn\' t change the fact that there was a shortage of gas, he said.  It\' s not just money we need; we need to think about the human beings who will suffer in the end when they are not supplied with enough power because gas is in high demand, Nyusi said in reference to the current global shortfall.  Money is good, of course, but we need to take into account the needs of the people to whom I\' m denying the opportunity to get access to energy. COP27 brought a breakthrough in developing countries\' fight to be compensated for loss and damage related to climate change, with an agreement to establish a fund paid into by rich nations. But how the fund will work is still unclear, and wealthy countries have fallen short on past pledges to commit billions of dollars to climate finance. As Mozambique\' s example shows, international help that comes too slowly or in half measures may not incentivise countries to move away from fossil fuels. Dealings with international organisations in the past have also made Mozambique\' s president sceptical of relying on foreign funds to fix issues at home. In March 2019, cyclone Idai made landfall in the country\' s second- largest city, Beira, and was followed by cyclone Kenneth a month later. The storms led to about 1 000 deaths and flooded large swaths of central Mozambique, destroying infrastructure and resulting in a humanitarian crisis. It was one of the worst natural disasters to strike southern Africa in decades. Back then, Nyusi\' s administration worked around the clock with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank to come up with an estimate of the amount of money the nation would need for the recovery \- $3.2bn to $3.5bn. Then the country held a conference in which donors made pledges to contribute.  We knew what we needed and how, and we communicated that, Nyusi said.  But only 30% of that money was disbursed. Mozambique has waited for a decade to be able to monetise its offshore gas reserves, Africa\' s third largest after Nigeria\' s and Algeria\' s. The gas fields off the country\' s northern coast were previously expected to attract investment of $120bn. Production facilities planned by TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil would have cost about $20bn each, more than Mozambique\' s gross domestic product, but both stalled because of an Islamic State-linked insurgency. The Coral-Sul Floating offshore facility, operated by Eni, started producing the super-chilled fuel that allowed for the first gas export to Europe. The production platform has a capacity of 3.4 million tons per year of LNG \- equal to about one-third of the UK\' s imports last year.  We are trying to solve the problem that forced those companies to interrupt works, Nyusi said, referring to the insurgency in the country\' s north.  We are focusing on bringing back stability \- any day, without a specific date, works could start again. Still, because of instability, it\' s uncertain to what extent Mozambique\' s projects will succeed and provide the income the government is banking on to transform the nation\' s economy. The insurgency that began in the region in 2017 has left more than 4 400 people dead and displaced nearly a million, and prompted TotalEnergies to suspend its project. Nyusi said his administration had come a long way in fighting the militants but wasn\' t in a position to say when normality would be restored. Nyusi won presidential elections in 2014 and 2019 as the candidate for Frelimo, which has dominated Mozambique\' s Assembly of the Republic in every election since 1994. He didn\' t say whether he will be running for a third term in the next elections, scheduled for 2023.  I don\' t believe this is a question for now, he said.  Questions, for now, are food for the people, power, hospitals, schools. Much like other African countries looking to tap into gas reserves, Mozambique risks its assets becoming stranded in just a few years, several non-profit groups warned. That could happen before the end of this decade when the short-term energy crunch eases and Europe drastically reduces demand for fossil fuels as part of an effort to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.  All these assets in countries that have bet their long-term strategy on this relationship with Europe will become stranded in the long term, said Kofi Mbuk, a senior clean-tech analyst at Carbon Tracker. African countries should instead leapfrog fossil fuels and bet on renewable energy, Mbuk said. The cost of solar in the continent has fallen by more than 50% in the past decade and could nearly halve again by 2030, making it cheaper to generate power by building new solar than continuing to run existing coal and gas plants, according to research by Carbon Tracker. Most of Africa\' s largest gas projects are led by companies headquartered outside of the continent, according to research by several non-profit organisations, including the German environmental and human rights organisation Urgewald. Its report questioned whether African countries and their populations would benefit from extracting and selling gas.  It\' s the old story of Africa: the global North, especially Europe, using Africa\' s resources for its own purposes and to feed its own fossil fuel addiction, said Urgewald director and report lead author Heffa Schuecking.  It has nothing to do with serving Africa\' s energy interest. This article was first published in Bloomberg. Borges Nhamirre contributed to this report \</doc>

Plan for new assembly to meet twice annually and provide alternative platform at COP South African human rights and climate activists are pushing humanity to support a new global climate justice bloc. They want a people- and worker-led Earth assembly driven by a desire to create an "Earth democracy" to meet twice annually. Led by SA Climate Justice Charter Movement (CJCM), activists are cleverly drawing on our apartheid past to accuse the seemingly unstoppable fossil fuel corporations and their rich governments of again fostering the reviled system of race and class oppression and exploitation, which they call "climate apartheid". Activists are also saying the UN's COP27 process is compromised and that humanity is being forced into an unthinkable age of "ecocide". They say the "human-nature relationship" has been "colonised". SA global activist Kumi Naidoo, who is the former secretary-general of both Greenpeace and Amnesty International, and leading SA anti-poverty and Climate Justice Charter Movement activist Prof Vishwas Satgar, were among 100 of the world's front-line climate activists from organisations in 20 countries who attended the assembly of peoples. Held in Durban over two weekends, the assembly had a festive air, with 21 "actions", including movies, and a march which attracted 600 supporters. But the core of the discussion, Satgar said in an interview on Tuesday, was how to punch through the frustrating political smog created by COP27 to create a climate justice movement which involved people from across the world. The assembly had "supported a call for Earth assemblies to start convening conversations, for people to talk about our interconnected way of life with planet Earth. "Everything we do is linked: our harmful ecological practices are harming Earth," Satgar said. The assembly included Pablo Sol& xF3;n Romero, the former Bolivian UN ambassador and director of Focus on the Global South, who is a leading proponent of the Earth assembly movement, and acclaimed Nigerian climate activist and civil rights leader Nnimmo Bassey. Satgar said the goal was to "decentre power" away from the COP process, which had not worked for human and non-human life. Science had shown that emissions were pushing the Earth to overheat by much more than 1.5& xB0;C amid a "lack of commitment from historical polluters to provide climate reparations for loss and damages. "The multilateral process is just not working and we are nowhere near to reaching a solution to prevent a runaway 1.5& xB0;C overshoot. "This means more climate apartheid for the world and more injustice for poorer countries - who did not cause the problem - for vulnerable island states facing extinction, and more suffering for human and non-human life. "It is important to build an alternative platform to rally the power of vulnerable governments, island states, poor countries devastated by climate shocks, countries and regions heating at twice the global average like our own, people frustrated by the crisis of leadership, workers facing serious climate risks around the just transition, and movements. "We need to rally to confront climate apartheid and a system that is ecocidal, which is bringing mass destruction to human and non-human life." He said the gathering was also committed to bringing about a new, just, world peace and a climate justice deal for Africa. "The response was overwhelmingly positive, from indigenous people fighting the tar sands mining of Canada, the Indigenous People's caucus, SA indigenous leaders, Earth Assembly leaders, representatives of progressive internationalists and international eco-socialists. "Our call for a just world peace means the disarming of Nato, withdrawal of Russia from Ukraine, and the demilitarisation and denuclearisation of the world. "Does humanity want to spend trillions on arms and bombs and nuclear weapons or use the money to to save humanity and deepen the just transition? "We want military forces, including all African armies, to be converted to emergency climate public services, and for a halt to all arms sales to Africa." Satgar said the assembly believed that war and armies could not be separated from the climate emergency. "They are major contributors to carbon emissions." He said activists excluded SA from the call for a climate justice deal for Africa since it was a major polluter and was different to the rest of Africa which was an innocent victim of climate disasters. Satgar said major polluting nations should give Africa money, and not try further entrap poor African states in interest-bearing loans. The polluters were the one's carrying the climate debt, not Africa, he said. He said 22 African countries were saddled with extreme debt to the IMF and SA was effectively telling the world these countries should stay in debt if they were to get more loans. Africa was heating at twice the world average and 200-million people faced "climate apartheid" displacement. The gathering was angered by the SA government's "narrow, self-interested" position.

Last November, the 26th UN climate summit was held in Glasgow: the annual Conference of the Parties, or COP (Durban had hosted the COP17 in 2011). Among the highest-profile of activists, Swedish youth leader Greta Thunberg was furious, pronouncing:  The COP26 is over. Here\' s a brief summary: Blah, Blah, Blah. But the real work continues outside these halls. And we will never give up, ever. Now that COP27 The Cairo regime of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi \- who in 2013 led a military coup against an Islamic government (after the 2011 Arab Spring mass movement had tossed out the pro-West Mubarak dictatorship during the inspiring Tahrir Square popular uprising) \- remains close to neo-colonial European powers, and retains especially tight military relationships with Washington. The US supplies $3 billion (R51bn) in annual  aid and weaponry, and its main objectives in the Middle East remain the protection of Israeli apartheid and control of Middle Eastern oil and gas flows. In January, Cairo gave Italian multi- national Eni five new exploration licences covering 8 400km\'b2 of potential oil blocks. But to make matters more confusing, Egypt\' s rulers are also applying for membership in the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa BRICS bloc, while remaining  neutral on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. With no civil society counter-event possible in Sharm El-Sheikh due to political repression, the only ways to apply pressure on COP27 delegates may be protests at Western and BRICS super-polluter embassies elsewhere in the world. There were more optimistic days, for example in 2010 at the COP16 in Mexico, when one of the greatest efforts at inside-UN reform was made by then Bolivian ambassador to the UN, Pablo Solon. But the system was obviously broken then, as his efforts to inject  Climate Justice criteria failed. Since then, in spite of how quickly the terminology has gone from  climate change to  crisis to  catastrophe , grassroots climate activists\' demands are not taken seriously by the network of major polluters who control the UN processes, or by most national government delegates \- including South Africa\' s Presidential Climate Commission, whose leaders promote South Africa\' s coming methane-gas addiction as a  transition fuel. As Solon reminds us,  Egyptian trade unions are denouncing the event as \' green-washing\' . Moreover, he continues,  What happens at COP27 will be repeated at COP28 in the United Arab Emirates \- which is also one of the world\' s most reactionary petro-oligarchies. Solon observes:  The situation has been made even worse by the war in Ukraine. The return to fossil fuels and the treatment of gas and nuclear as green energy are a setback, and the EU is particularly to blame for the latter. In June, the German meeting to prepare for COP27 witnessed rich country delegations simply dismissing African calls for \' Loss & Damage\' recognition and financing support. Yet Europe\' s two main leaders \- French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz \- have compelled African elites to commit to massive oil, gas and even coal infrastructure. That includes South Africa, thanks to the unholy Scholz-Ramaphosa alliance for increased coal exports, and Macron\' s request to Ramaphosa that 1000+ SA soldiers defend a $20bn Total  Blood Methane gas plant in northern Mozambique. Solon concludes,  We must build an alternative process to the COPs in coming years and not limit ourselves to actions during the COPs. In the same way the UN replaced the League of Nations because of its failure in World War II, the worsening climate crisis and other issues like the war can lead to the discussion of a radical reform of the UN and its climate negotiation process. Solon helped Bolivia host the April 2010 climate justice alternative summit in Cochabamba, Bolivia. With more progressive governments now in power at the tip and bottom of the Andes Mountains, in Colombia and Chile, perhaps there will be a new pole of opposition to work with. In contrast, in Glasgow, the main textual sabotage came from the three largest emitters, all of which stubbornly held onto their coal-fired power: China, the US and India. They teamed up, no matter various ideological and geopolitical differences, to retain coal as long as possible, rejecting  phase out language. This year, the  African COP will be a site where governments go to the mat to defend more fossil fuel extraction. Ramaphosa makes no bones about that, promoting more oil and gas extraction across the continent instead of using a different model: rich countries paying poorer ones to decarbonise, as Ramaphosa himself has rhetorically encouraged, what with the \' Just Energy Transition Partnership\' and its promised $8.5bn in Western concessional finance. South Africa\' s largest emitters also owe a massive climate debt, so should be part of paying Africans not to extract, especially in sites like Mozambique where nearly one million people have been displaced in the process. And as activists have been arguing since last November, on the beaches and in courtrooms, ending our own gas exploration on the Indian and Atlantic coastlines is a vital first step. Indeed, with no prospects for success in Egypt, an alternative, activist- centric process looks ever more urgent.

PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa called yesterday for better and cheaper ways of funding the Just Transition to a greener economy from developed nations, speaking at the COP27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.  A one-size-fits-all approach to financing the transition that disregards African realities is neither just nor equitable and will not work, he said. He said the use of non-debt instruments would ensure that developing economies did not have to shoulder an even greater debt burden. In an echo of the country\' s climate change plan he launched on Friday, Ramaphosa said yesterday that the reality was that developing economies had not received the required multilateral support to face the climate challenge, including for loss and damage. Ramaphosa told an online sitting of the Presidential Climate Commission on Friday that South Africa needed about R1.5 trillion over the next five years to effect the just energy transition, saying the country needed much greater funding than what had been put on the table. South Africa\' s investment plan presented in Egypt sets out a vision for electricity production from renewables, a switch to electric vehicles on our roads and a major new green hydrogen industry, all requiring R1.5trln of new investment until 2027. At a COP27  Their business models must be modernised so that they can efficiently mobilise financing at scale and deploy a full suite of instruments from grants to guarantees, across the entire range of countries they work with, he said. He said commercial financial institutions must do more to support these efforts by structuring project financing instruments that take into account the specific needs and circumstances of developing economies. In a veiled reference to unfulfilled promises of a $100 billion per year commitment to help developing countries. The imperative of a low-carbon transition that was just and inclusive was particularly important for developing economies, which are the worst affected by climate change. Although Africa carried the least responsibility for climate change, the continent experiences much of its harshest effects, he said. Meanwhile, South Africa and other developing countries might face a bigger hurdle after Reuters reported that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the price of carbon needs to average at least $75 a ton globally by the end of the decade for global climate goals to succeed. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the pace of change in the real economy was still  way too slow . Recent analysis by the World Bank-affiliated group suggests the sum total of global national commitments on reducing climate-damaging emissions would see them fall just 11% by mid-century.  Unless we price carbon predictably on a trajectory that gets us at least to $75 average price per ton of carbon in 2030, we simply don\' t create the incentive for businesses and consumers to shift, she said. \</doc>

Brazil runs the risk of losing control over its vast Amazon rainforest region to organised crime and traffickers who use the lawless region to smuggle drugs, a Supreme Court judge warned yesterday. Justice Luis Roberto Barroso proposed that environmental experts, investors and local authorities come together to brainstorm on how to foster sustainable development that would preserve the Amazon rainforest, the world\' s largest, and help the livelihood of the 25 million people who live there. The Amazon absorbs vast amounts of greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. Under Brazil\' s outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro, illegal activities have surged in the Amazon, encouraged by the easing of environmental protections and reduced funding for enforcement agencies. Barroso, who attended COP27 UN climate talks in Egypt in November, proposed that Brazil gather  the best minds in the world to discuss how to develop a  bio-economy for the Amazon to stop the degradation of the region. The fund will restart when President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva takes office in January. | Reuters \</doc>

The country could be producing 13 million tons annually of the clean fuel and its derivatives by 2050 President Cyril Ramaphosa believes the potential for SA to emerge as a significant player in the green hydrogen value chain is immense. "Globally the demand for green hydrogen and green hydrogen-based products, such as ammonia and synthetic jet fuels, is rising significantly. "This presents a unique opportunity for SA and the continent to link its mineral endowment with its renewable energy endowment to drive industrialisation," Ramaphosa said at the inaugural SA Green Hydrogen summit in Cape Town on Tuesday. He said the summit, which comes after the COP27 in Egypt, builds on a foundation laid by the sustainable infrastructure development symposium held in 2021, which highlighted the country's potential as a global exporter of green energy. "South Africa used the platform of COP27 to elaborate on our just green transition. "We recently released for public comment a just energy transition investment plan as the basis for our pathway towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient society. "The plan has been well received across our country and the world." Ramaphosa said the plan outlined that SA needs approximately $98bn (about R1.6 trillion) over the next five years "to enable a just transition and achieve our ambitious emissions reduction targets". He said green hydrogen is identified in the plan as one of the four "big frontiers" of a just energy transition, as it has huge growth and investment potential. It could create jobs, attract investment, bring development to rural provinces and support a just transition from fossil fuels. SA and Zimbabwe hold more than 90% of the world's known platinum group metal reserves. "Since 30% to 40% of the supply goes into the production of catalytic converters for internal combustion vehicles, the initial focus of the research was on hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles as an alternative market to the internal combustion engine vehicle." He said SA was estimated to have the potential to produce 6 million to 13 million tons of green hydrogen and derivatives a year by 2050. "To do so would require between 140 and 300 gigawatts of renewable energy. "The focus would be on green hydrogen exports, electrolyser and fuel cell production, and the manufacture of green steel, sustainable aviation fuel, ammonia, fertilisers and renewable energy components." SA is ideal for investors. "This country is favourable, reliable and a stable place to conduct business. "We are driving regulatory and legislative reform to make our economy more competitive and attract more investment so we can create more jobs. "SA has a supportive legislative environment and experience in the deployment of renewable energy, with the largest installed capacity of wind and solar power projects on the African continent." He said companies such as Sasol and PetroSA have expertise in the production of synthetic fuels including diesel, petrol and kerosene, and a range of chemical products. SA produces 2.4 million tons of grey hydrogen for domestic consumption. Sasol and the Northern Cape provincial government have made significant progress on the master plan for a green hydrogen special economic zone which aims to support 40 gigawatts of electrolyser capacity by 2050. "This would require approximately 80 gigawatts of renewable energy, which is almost double South Africa's current installed electricity generation capacity." Ramaphosa said Transnet has issued a request for proposals for the development of additional port and rail infrastructure. He said he looked forward to welcoming more firms in the sector. "We hope to see international firms partnering with South African firms as we increase our renewable energy footprint, green hydrogen manufacturing capability and local production of value added products."

Africa's climate experts advise countries to opt for cleaner energy sources Africa's climate experts urge the continent to look beyond COP27 's faux arguments for fossil fuels and adopt cleaner energy sources. A significant number of environmental disasters have occurred across communities in Africa this year. In the lead-up to the "African COP", there was a huge expectation that the world would notice these communities and develop a solid plan for climate change alleviation measures. However, in a manner characteristic of recent conferences, negotiations dragged on for days before the bleary-eyed delegates reached an agreement to establish the landmark loss and damage fund, but talks about eliminating fossil fuels - the root cause of the climate crisis - fell through. Even though 80 member states had called for the phasing out of all fossil fuels, the final policy text featured vague language on just energy transitions. Both "low-emission and renewable energy" were highlighted in this regard, leaving it open to misinterpretation by countries reluctant to make the transition to clean energy. The surprise inclusion of "low emission energy" as an energy source for the future fails to build on COP26 progress towards eliminating all forms of fossil fuels and permits the continued exploration of dirty fuels such as gas, which has long been touted as a transition fuel by fossil fuel lobbyists. The fossil fuel industries sent a record 636 delegates to this year's climate change conference in Egypt - this number is almost five times the average number of registered party delegates from across Africa - and there is a strong suspicion that their presence may have influenced the outcome of negotiations. These lobbyists base their arguments for fossil fuels on three things: the energy poverty experienced by about 600-million people in Africa, the perceived need to attain development similar to western nations and the hypocrisy of these developed nations who continue to explore oil within their borders. "Oil-rich countries are making a significant amount of money from fossil fuels, so we cannot blame African countries for wanting to benefit as well, but what we cannot have are new investments in a declining market because those will be stranded in the future," Wanjira Mathai, vice-president and regional director for Africa at the World Resources Institute, warned. However, countries such as Nigeria have produced oil for more than five decades yet have low human and capital development. This is partly because a large share of the profit is remitted to the multinationals funding the projects, and little is directed to public funds. There is also enough evidence to show that Africa exports a large percentage of its oil to sponsoring countries. On the other hand, local communities are left to bear the consequence of a degraded environment. A report by Oil Change International (OCI) found that if the fossil fuel industry proceeds with its plans for Africa in the next 30 years, it will lead to the emission of an additional 62-billion tonnes of CO& xB2;, which is not compatible with the 1.5& xB0;C target of the Paris Agreement. The rapid adoption of clean energy resources such as renewables is crucial to stay on the path to 1.5& xB0;C, which is believed would facilitate long-term socioeconomic development. A report by the International Renewable Energy Agency shows that the 1.5& xB0;C pathway can increase Africa's GDP and net jobs by 6.4% and 3.5% respectively, by 2050. Economics favour renewables as a better energy alternative, but there needs to be more political will to harness the sector. Investments in fossil fuels exceed renewable energy. Annually, the African fossil fuel industry receives $33bn (R560bn) in investment, more than six times greater than the $5bn (R84bn) invested in renewables. Barely a week after COP27 , Nigeria announced a grand investment of more than $3bn (R50bn) to explore a new oil and gas project in its northern region, while Uganda is not backing down on the East African Crude Oil Pipeline project alongside Tanzania. "Africa has the opportunity not to repeat the same trajectory of development that western nations have taken and part of that would involve retreating from fossil fuel exploration," South African Climate Action Network national node co-ordinator Tandolwethu Lukuko said. According to Mathai, the continent has one of the highest renewable energy potentials in the world - hydroelectricity, wind and solar. "It's a huge one for us," she said. Africa houses 60% of the best solar resources globally and could emerge as one of the leading producers of hydrogen made from renewables. However, Africans need more finance to explore their renewable energy sector. "At the current cost of capital, it is not viable for us to look at expanding grids for renewables," she said. Still, this presents a solution to Africa's energy crisis, and as a rapidly growing market, it holds much potential for the economy. Climate experts believe that coal, oil and gas are a distraction for Africa, considering that it is a declining market - though lately, the energy crisis in Europe has left many countries in the region scampering after gas producers, and fossil-fuel-producing countries have recorded groundbreaking profits due to the rise in demand for their products. "There is demand for gas, but that is only for the present," Mathai said. European countries and the US are doubling efforts to develop their renewable energy sector; by 2021, the CO& xB2; emissions in the two regions had dropped by 10% and 9%, respectively. "For countries in Africa without a large energy infrastructure, they should look to clean energy. They don't need to go back to fossil fuels," Climate Change Mitigation SA city adviser Khodani Mulaudzi said. Africa secured a handful of these deals, including the launch of the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative, an all-Africa inclusive project to increase the "share of renewable electricity generation by 25 percentage points by 2027 and obtain a power sector based on renewables by 2063". The global climate conference may have failed to deliver on a significant area. However, much of the power rests on individual African nations to explore their abundant renewable energy supply to foster a just energy transition. - bird story agency SPARKING DEBATE: Wanjira Mathai, vice president and regional director for Africa at the World Resources Institute, speaking at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.

SA signs just energy transition loan agreements for R10bn President says 2.7% of $8.5bn committed will be grants Energy WriterSA, France and Germany have signed loan agreements for the two European countries to each extend \€ 300m concessional financing (about R10bn in total) to SA to support the country's efforts to reduce its reliance on coal in the energy sector. The loans are provided by the French and German public development banks, AFD and KfW directly to the SA government via the Treasury. The financing agreements were welcomed by President Cyril Ramaphosa, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at a ceremony held at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. This is one of the first steps towards implementation of the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) announced at COP26 in November 2021, a partnership between SA, France, Germany, the UK, the US and the EU to support SA's transition to a low-carbon economy. Funding partners pledged to mobilise an initial $8.5bn over the next three to five years. The loans from France and Germany form part of the $8.5bn funding committed by the partner countries. Ramaphosa told reporters at a media conference at COP27 that only about 2.7% of the $8.5bn would be provided by the partners in the form of grants. The rest will be loans and concessional loans from development and commercial finance institutions. It is estimated that SA's climate investment plan, which provides a finance road map for the implementation of the just transition plan, will need about $98bn over the next five years for SA to meet its climate goals, Ramaphosa said. This plan has three major development pillars: transforming the energy sector away from coal, establishing a green hydrogen economy, and developing electric vehicle capabilities for local use and manufacturing of these vehicles. He appealed to developed countries, including the JETP funding partners, to make more grant funding available as SA seeks to raise the $98bn funding requirement. Because of SA's "already sizeable loan burden" the country would need to secure more grant funding to finance its just transition projects, he said. "Financing mechanisms from public and commercial institutions need to provide good concessional loans as well as nondebt instruments - [funding provided] must be upweighted towards grants," said Ramaphosa. Audrey Rojkoff, AFD regional director for Southern Africa and country director for SA, said in a statement that the AFD loan would be accompanied by grant financing from France to support several key SA actors "involved in the production of knowledge and further policy development related to the just energy transition". Ismail Momoniat, acting director-general of the Treasury, said the loans being provided by Germany and France would assist in "addressing the challenge of financing the critical adaptation and mitigation programmes" that SA hopes to implement. "These loans are concessional and contribute to government's efforts to mitigate rising government debt costs," Momoniat said. SA is also in the process of concluding another financing arrangement that could raise about R17bn to R18bn to pay for the decommissioning of coal plants. Earlier in November, the World Bank approved a $497m (about R9bn) in financing to help SA lower its greenhouse gas emissions by decommissioning and repurposing the Komati coal-fired power plant in Mpumalanga using renewables and batteries. A document published recently by the Climate Investment Funds, a multilateral climate finance mechanism, and the department of forestry, fisheries & environment, indicated that the institution will, through its Accelerating Coal Transition initiative, grant SA a loan of $500m, also for the decommissioning and repurposing of coal plants. erasmusd@businesslive.co.za More grants please: President Cyril Ramaphosa says SA needs more grant funding for just transition projects. 123RF/Andriy Popov \</doc>

Climate change is happening; it is no longer an argument, it is a fact. There was some progress made at the recent COP27 held in Egypt - the 2022 Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - but unfortunately, not enough. All of us, from governments to the private sector to individuals, have to start thinking about adapting to climate change, in everything we do, and change our actions accordingly.\~ This emerged in a webinar discussion, on making strides in climate resilience and shifting from fossil fuel-based energy to cleaner energy, hosted by the Mail & Guardian . The winners of Greening the Future were also announced later in the webinar. Ozayr Patel, the Mail & Guardian 's Climate and Environment editor, kicked off the discussion by asking Catherine Constantinides, founder of the global youth network Generation Earth, and Professor Mark New, director of the African Climate and Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town, about their impressions of Cop27 . Economic loss and damage may include damage to crops, homes or infrastructure. Non-economic loss and damage may include harm to human health and mobility; loss of access to territory, of cultural heritage and of indigenous and local knowledge; and loss of and damage to biodiversity and habitats. New added that true change requires everyone to participate, not just governments. Constantinides agreed: "It's the small things that we can do as consumers that are crucially important - where we shop, what we buy, etcetera - our daily choices do have an impact." She added that there needs to be a "massive drive" in education so that people start to make better choices regarding the environment. Have we actually made progress since COP17 was held in Durban in 2011, Constantinides asked? The voice of civil society has definitely grown, and it was really loud at Cop27 . She said for anyone who still doubts it, we are definitely in a climate crisis. "I have worked in communities in Africa that no longer exist where they were, because there is no water there for them any longer." She pointed out: "It's amazing how the narrative has changed in my 15 years as an activist. Finally, corporations are starting to get the message about climate change!" She also said that the youth must make climate change "the foundation of everything they do and think about".\~ New said that the sixth edition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which advances scientific knowledge about climate change caused by human activities,\~ has just been published, under the auspices of the UN. He said that the argument about whether the climate is changing is over; "we have ample evidence that the climate is changing, not just in the future but right now, and we are starting to feel its impact".\~ Asked what "climate resilience" entails, New said that it involves adapting as much as is feasible to reduce your vulnerability; it's the ability to recover from climate crises as fast as possible. The impact of the 2021 and 2022 KwaZulu-Natal floods could have been far less if there had been better responses, for instance. "The most vulnerable people [to climate change] are usually the poorest folk, and in a resilient society they are not left behind," said New. Constantinides agreed, saying that many lessons can be learnt from the floods, and that inequality plays a huge role in climate resilience. Patel asked, in the South African context, if it is a difficult balancing act moving from coal to green energy, as so many people presently rely on coal for employment. New replied: "I think some of the narrative about moving away from coal threatening livelihoods is created by those with vested interests in those industries. A lot of research has shown that green energy creates jobs, so the real issue is how the [just] transition is managed, from a social as well as economic perspective."\~ Sometimes we have to jump in the deep end and learn to swim from there, said Constantinides. There are many opportunities to create jobs in the green economy. We have to invest in renewable energy for a sustainable future, but unfortunately, most people will only change tack "when climate change starts to hit them in the pocket". Waste management is one of the many ways that we can manage climate change, and it is also a means of generating renewable energy.\~ She said that our biggest crisis in South Africa is our shortage of water. As many people still don't understand the impact of climate change, for instance, regarding food security, the biggest imperative right now is education. In this regard, the media has a huge role to play; publications like Greening the Future remind us that we are living in a climate crisis.\~ South Africa has an adaptation deficit, said New; it is very poorly adapted to the current climate risks. It has always been a drought-prone country, but "coupled with poor service delivery, this means we are really vulnerable to climate change". So, we need to fix the country up in a general sense, particularly structurally,\~ to increase capability and make our adaptation easier.\~ "Secondly, we have to embed adapting to climate change in everything we do, which is what I call mainstreaming. You cannot invest millions into a project that will only last for 20 years because of climate change." For example, you can't mine for coal if you need a lot of water to run that operation, and that water won't be available in the future because of climate change. "It's all about incorporating climate change principles into our strategic decision making. This has to take place both in the private and public sectors," said New.\~ - Derek Davey Watch the webinar here: The post HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/special-reports/2022-12-02-making-strides-in-climate-resilience/ Making strides in climate resilience HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za The Mail & Guardian \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa will participate in the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit scheduled from today until tomorrow in the Arab Republic of Egypt. President Ramaphosa is at the summit on the invitation of the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. 'President Ramaphosa will on 07 November 2022 Co-Chair the High Level Roundtable on Just Transition, which will allow discussions on innovative approaches to address climate change in the context of Just Transition, inspired by the South African Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP),' the Presidency said in a statement. On Sunday during the special sitting of the Presidential Climate Change Commission(PCC), President Ramaphosa unveiled government's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) outlining government's comprehensive priority investment and financing interventions required to achieve decarbonisation commitments and ensure an equitable and just transition. The 2022 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP27 , is held from 06 to 18 November 2022, at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Conference Centre. WATCH | President Ramaphosa arrives in Egypt With COP27 Recognition of Africa's special needs and circumstances; Raising the ambitions on mitigation, adaptation and support to developing countries. Advance financing arrangements for loss and damage. Build on progress made in Glasgow on the importance of Just Transitions. Advance discussions on the special needs and circumstance of Africa. Climate summits provide a platform to make announcements of new climate ambition, political direction and momentum for the UNFCCC negotiations, as well as to address broader issues related to climate change mainly to guide climate change negotiators (beyond the mandate and scope of the UNFCCC negotiations). The programme for the participation of Heads of State and Government (HOSG) will include an official opening ceremony, high-level round tables, delivery of national statements and high-level side events organised by World Leaders. During the summit, the Government of Egypt will convene 6 high-level Round Tables on Just Transition; Food Security; Innovative Finance and Climate Development; Investing in Future of Energy; Climate Change and Sustainability of Vulnerable Communities and Water Security. These roundtables will be attended by the HOSG, Heads of observer organisations and specially invited guests. On Tuesday, President Ramaphosa will deliver a national statement during the high-level segment of the summit. The summit further provides a platform for discussing how climate actions can be supportive of broader Just Transitions imperatives, highlighting the need for the COP to agree on a Just Transition Financing Framework under the mitigation work programme as a potential model for supporting energy transition in middle income countries. 'The high-level segment for Heads of State and Government during the summit signifies the importance for World Leaders to implement and transform key climate related decisions into concrete actions and credible plans, continue raising ambition, building up from previous Conference of the Parties, including the Glasgow COP 26 outcomes. 'The segment also keeps the high level commitment on climate change issues, with an aim to fight back climate emergency and promoting coordinated action to tackle climate change,' the Presidency said. South Africa's UNFCCC negotiating positions on climate change, are fully aligned to the African common position, as adopted by the African Union's Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) and the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN). The President will be supported by the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Ms Naledi Pandor; Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Ms Barbara Creecy. -SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

SA, speaking at COP27 alongside its Basic group allies, among them China, has reiterated its commitment to its national framework containing the just transition and investment plan. In the statement, forestry, fisheries and environment minister Barbara Creecy, who chairs the Basic group committee, said her government's framework "outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve [SA's] decarbonisation goals over the next five years". "SA has submitted a climate change bill before its parliament and commenced implementation of its national adaptation strategy," Creecy said. SA is a population lightweight with 60-million people, compared to Brazil's 218-million, India's 1,393-million and China's 1,412-million. At the meeting were Brazil's environment minister, Joaquim Leite, his Indian counterpart, Bhupender Yadav, China's special envoy for climate change, Xie Zhenhua, and its vice-minister of ecology and environment, Zhao Yingmin. The Basic ministers called on COP27 to "deliver an ambitious, equitable and balanced outcome, including substantial progress towards the establishment of a finance mechanism for loss and damage, the new collective quantified finance goal and operationalisation of the global goal on adaptation, as well as completion of the work programme on mitigation". They welcomed the inclusion of a "dedicated agenda item on a funding arrangement for loss and damage, at the initiative of developing counties". They applauded the good work done by their countries, saying "despite the enormous developmental challenges and pressures of poverty eradication at a time of global economic downturn and economic recovery, the Basic countries continued to lead from the front on climate change actions, in the context of their overarching sustainable development imperatives. "The ambitious nationally determined contributions goals announced by Basic at COP26 last year are already being implemented, attesting to the sense of urgency and seriousness with which Basic countries tackle climate change." Brazil said it would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, there would be "zero illegal deforestation by 2028" and by 2030 18-million hectares of destroyed forest would be restored and reforested. China said that in 2020 it had updated its nationally determined contribution targets set by the Paris Agreement five years before in 2015. China's new emission-reduction targets "reflected its highest possible ambition" and punted its "utmost effort" to avert climate change through its programmes. Its comprehensive green transformation of economy and society with carbon dioxide peaking and carbon neutrality programme, had caused a substantial drop of "carbon intensity" (emissions) by 3.8%, while 16.6% - 1,120 gigawatts - of energy came from non-fossil sources. China said it provided 50% of global wind power equipment and 80% of global solar power equipment. It said it had built 10-million new-energy vehicles, accounting for more than 50% of these vehicles globally. India also submitted its "updated and enhanced" contributions, saying it hit its target for non-fossil power generating capacity "nine years ahead of schedule". It vowed that by 2030, 50% of its electricity for its 1.4-billion people would be non-fossil sourced. India has opted for a national hydrogen mission, electric passenger vehicles, "ethanol blending in petrol" and 100% electrification of a net-zero rail network. The state is offering production-linked incentives for high-efficiency solar PV modules and advanced storage technologies. It has also started issuing sovereign green bonds and blended finance. In their statement, the Basic group urged developed nations to start giving promised climate finance to developing countries and to support access to technology and markets. They accused global banks of an attitude of risk aversion towards developing countries and called for "a fundamental transformation and modernisation of the global financial architecture, including a systematic reform of the multilateral development banks to make them fit-for-purpose in supporting sustainable development and just and equitable transitions". They called for grants and low-cost loans for poorer countries. \</doc>

POSITIVE OUTLOOK S& P affirms ratings, but warns of Eskom's rising debt risks Editor at LargeRatings agency S& P Global has warned that it could remove its positive outlook on SA's sovereign rating if the planned debt relief for Eskom weakens the government's debt trajectory without addressing the failings in the power utility's operations and finances. In a ratings update on Friday night, S& P affirmed its rating and made it clear that if SA could keep improving its economic growth and its public finances, the positive outlook might lead to an upgrade of the rating itself. But it cautioned that a sharper than expected global downturn, particularly from China, could subdue SA's growth - and that pressures to increase spending on wages, grants and state-owned enterprises could worsen fiscal imbalances. While the prospect that the government will implement some structural reforms is one of the reasons for the positive outlook, the agency cautioned that the outcomes of the ANC's December conference could determine the pace of reform implementation, including on corruption. It expects the ANC may lose its majority vote in the 2024 general election. S& P has incorporated R250bn of Eskom debt into its government debt assumptions for 2023 and is expecting that the government will offset the higher debt servicing costs by reducing transfers to Eskom. "However, there is a risk that Eskom could continue to require additional government support to meet its maintenance and investment plans and immediate liquidity gaps," said the agency. And though the government has said it will take a harder line on bailouts to state-owned entities, S& P expects the fiscal drain to SOEs to continue. S& P is unusual in that it splits its foreign and local currency ratings on SA, with a foreign currency rating that is three notches below investment grade - in line with rival Fitch - and a local currency rating that is just two notches below, in line with Moody's ratings on SA. S& P switched its outlook from stable to positive in May, making it the only one of the three agencies with a positive outlook, but the other two have stable outlooks, which means that SA is for now not threatened by further ratings downgrades. Like S& P, Moody's had pencilled in a ratings update on Friday night but did not release one. It did, however, issue a response last month to the government's medium-term budget policy statement, in which it said it expected slightly slower fiscal consolidation than the government had projected, because of higher spending pressures and constrained growth. Moody's expects SA's eco-nomy to grow at just 1%-1.5% over the next few years. S& P is somewhat more optimistic, with a forecast of 1.9% for 2022 tapering to average 1.7% over 2023-2025 - though this could be much lower in a downside global scenario. It noted too that SA's real per capita GDP "has fallen over the past decade and will remain below that of several emerging market peers". Fitch does not follow a ratings update calendar, but it did issue a recent note responding to the launch of SA's $8.5bn Just Energy Transition Plan (JETP) deal with an international partner group that was launched at COP27 recently. Indonesia and its 12-country international partner group also launched a $10bn JETP deal at COP27 last week, with a further $10bn promised by private sector global financial institutions. Fitch said JETPs could push up sovereign debt for the emerging markets involved, but "we believe spending under such plans will remain subject to governments' broader public finance goals. "JETP funding for SA will mostly finance investments in the electricity sector that could help to alleviate serious power shortages", the agency said. joffeh@businesslive.co.za S& P Global's offices in the financial district in New York, US.

Since our leaders are too weak to stand up for us, we the people must do so Since our leaders are too weak to stand up to Western leaders, we the people must do so Africa no longer has bold leaders who speak truth to power, leaders who love this continent and defended it against imperialism on every platform. The kind of leaders who understood that the essence of independence is to own and control the resources of this land for the preservation of humanity. Burkina Faso's revolutionary leader Thomas Sankara understood this responsibility with distinction. He prioritised the securitisation of land and nature as primary bases of life and food production. He spoke out in defence of the savannah and the Amazon to safeguard life. He hated deforestation and the pollution of the atmosphere by the industrialising West in the name of profit. For Sankara, modernity was the means to uplift life, improve living standards and develop communities. He opposed the modernity of imperialism that involved the destabilisation of the environment, exploitation of labour and the colonial acceleration of poverty, unemployment, diseases and mortality. To him, disasters were not natural phenomena as we are made to believe by Western think tanks like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Disasters are consequences of the deliberate and systematic destruction of the environment by industries belonging to billionaires. Sankara understood that the environment and the land are fragile and vulnerable, yet all the more valuable in sustaining everything we have and do as human beings. From the land, we eat. On land, we build. From land, we create. On the land, our children get to play. From land, we clothe ourselves. From land, we raise and connect with our families and clan histories. From land, we reproduce ourselves for many generations and we self-actualise ourselves. From land, we surface our dignity and we become ourselves. From land, we become Africa. These knowledges were shared by all African leaders who led the liberation of the continent and harnessed our collective imagination to become an independent people who are self-reliant. For Africa, the land and agricultural produce was the primary base of its economy. The concept of a "people's economy" was derived from this basis. In others words, African leaders realised that human beings don't eat growth. Human beings eat food. The human race cannot survive alongside exploitation, pollution, imperialism and deforestation. The COP27 Britain and the US and all the G7 and G20 countries boasted about their commitments to clean energy and how much they are willing to pay developing countries for the damage they have done to their lands . African leaders sat there and listened to these empty talks by Western leaders without holding them accountable for what they have done - they did not do what Sankara would have done. Climate change has destroyed the global south. It has killed people. It has destroyed communities and families. It has displaced millions of people and children. It has caused disasters. Climate change has destroyed the planet. Western countries have destroyed humanity. The scale of this destruction cannot be compensated. It has no price. No amount of money will recreate the oceans, trees, fish, wildlife and human life. African leaders should be demanding reparations. They should be demanding punishment of the West. They should be demanding that the West leave Africa alone to rebuild itself. They should be demanding the end of imperialism, neocolonialism and capitalism. The people of Africa must take this fight into their own hands because clearly their leaders are pleasers of white European leaders. We will have nothing left to eat and survive on unless we fight for capitalism to be destroyed.

Government\' s decision to accept billions of rand in international loans for the energy transition investment plan have raised fears that it will push the country to the edge of a debt cliff. This week, the International Partners Group (IPG), which includes the UK, US, Germany, France and the EU, at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, pledged $8.5 billion (R148.3bn) to assist South Africa shift from coal to renewable energy and there are also plans to make an additional R10 billion available. The IPG loan comes on the back of multibillion-rand loans taken in the past two-and-a-half years to respond to the socio-economic crisis created by the Covid-19 pandemic. These include a January World Bank R11.4bn low-interest development policy loan to South Africa to help the government widen its social protection net. In July 2020, South Africa secured a R70bn loan from the International Monetary Fund; R5bn from the African Development Bank in the same month and R14.5bn from the New Development Bank in April last year. It is estimated that government debt is sitting at R4.7 trillion. IFP spokesperson on finance Inkosi Mzamo Buthelezi said the ANC-run government had failed the country and were not prioritising the interests of its citizens.  Our problems are not financial and the terms of all these loans are not clear.  As it stands, we are paying more than R370bn a year to service the debt and our focus is on debt and inflation, instead of economic growth and job creation, he said. Buthelezi said government was failing in its management of collapsing state-owned enterprises and on investing in infrastructure so that businesses could thrive and jobs could be created.  These grants are unsustainable and government is not creating a stable environment for businesses to invest, he said. Buthelezi warned that there was no sign that the state was dealing with corruption and there were concerns about further loans being seen as an opportunity to pilfer. Chief economist at Makwe Fund Managers Makwe Masilela said while the country had not defaulted on its debt, rising interest rates meant the amount that was owing continued to rise.  Ideally, government, business and individuals should be reducing debt at this time because debt levels at this rate cannot be sustained. If interest rates continue to rise, it will be too expensive to service, especially if the economy is not growing, he said. Masilela said government\' s reliance on loans would have to stop soon.  If the better part of our budget is going to service debt, then service delivery, health and education will suffer. It has to stop at some stage because the economy is not growing enough to match the repayments that are needed, he said. The DA said the country was over- indebted.  Government tells us we are R4.7 trillion in debt and our annual repayments, plus interest, are growing, it said. Dalli Weyers, of the Institute for Economic Justice, said they had issues with the $8.5bn grant, as only 4% of this was an actual grant.  The global north countries should shoulder more of the blame for contributing to climate change and we wanted to see a higher percentage of the loan being in the form of grants and loan guarantees, he said. Weyers said they were disappointed that stakeholders were first informed about the loan when it was announced at COP27 .  One of the conditions of the loan is that $1.5bn must go to the private sector, Independent Power Producers and Power Provision Agreements, and we have not been able to access those deals, he said. Weyers said only a select few had been kept in the loop on the deal and there was no detail on how much South Africans will pay for energy as a result of the agreement.  Private sector companies can fold after two or three years but the country is a guarantor for this debt and the SA government and its people will carry the risk, he said. \</doc>

DEVELOPMENT Finance Institutions (DFIs) in southern Africa are pouring significant amounts of money into fossil fuels exploration more than they are financing renewable energy. This goes against the Paris Agreement as climate change requires financial institutions to stop funding fossil fuels and to fund a swift, just transition to renewable energy. These are the findings contained in a report released by the Fair Finance Coalition of Southern Africa (FFCSA) yesterday on the sidelines of the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP27 , in Egypt. COP27 has already been marred by controversy as activists said that there were more fossil fuel lobbyists at the gathering than representatives of the 10 countries most impacted by climate change. The FFCSA assessed the policies of six DFIs in Africa focusing on transparency, power generation and climate change. The DFIs assessed were the African Development Bank (AfDB), Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), Export Credit Insurance Corporation (ECIC), Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), and New Development Bank (NDB). The  Financing Fairly 2022 report found that there were 782 fossil fuel projects in operation or under construction in Africa between 2016 and 2021. African Climate Reality Project\' s Amy Giliam Thorp said that of those 782 fossil fuel projects, 418 were situ- ated in southern Africa and 212 in South Africa. Thorp said that climate change and extreme weather events had already killed more than 4 000 people and affected 19 million others in Africa alone since the beginning of 2022.  There is a huge dependency on fossil fuels in Africa. But the continuing investment in fossil fuel is unacceptable, and transition has never been more urgent, Thorp said. The FFCSA research also showed that the AfDB, Africa's biggest public finance institution with $253 billion (R4.5 trillion) capitalisation, scored low on climate change because they needed a clear strategy that details how and when they will phase out fossil fuel financing.  The AfDB has zero limits on financing new coal, oil and gas projects despite pledging in 2019 that it would get out of coal, said Zahra Omar, environmental justice attorney at the Centre for Environmental Rights.  Without a clear strategy on how or when it will phase out fossil fuel financing, the AfDB continues to provide the highest amount of project finance for fossil fuel projects in Africa. Omar said the AfDB was not alone as the IDC had a total shareholding of $1.5bn in two coal companies as of November 2021.  The IDC is the worst-performing public finance institution in Africa, with poor scores on climate response, transparency and accountability, and energy generation, she said.  Export Credit Insurance Corporation's recent loan agreement with Total Energies is worth $800 million and is intended to export gas from Mozambique to Europe. Meanwhile, communities in Mozambique have exceptionally limited access to electricity. The report also found that South Africa was the largest carbon emitter in Southern Africa as the country\' s coal-power plants made up 83.5% of the country\' s energy mix in 2020. It said the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) was the third largest South African institution investing in the coal industry. The coalition said it required that those most affected by climate impacts be included in making the rules for climate finance. Community activist Lucy Duba spoke about living in the polluted shadow of the Medupi coal power station in Limpopo which is funded by AfDB and the World Bank. When AfDB came to Lephalale to build the Medupi coal station we were happy because we were jobless and poor, Duba said.  Later on we realised that AfDB did not come to make our lives better. We inhale dirty air and no one is doing anything about it. Our lives matter. The report made six recommendations to the DFIs, including establishing a fossil exclusion plan/policy, aligning policies with the 1.5-degree Paris Agreement, improving the level of disclosure and using the Fair Finance Guide Metho- dology for better sustainable practices. \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for bolder and innovative ways to finance Just Transition projects in developing countries, saying a 'one-size-fits-all approach' will not work. 'We need to be bolder and more innovative in reducing project risk and crowd in private sector finance for climate and just transition projects. 'A one-size-fits-all approach to financing the transition that disregards African realties is neither just nor equitable and will not work,' President Ramaphosa said. The President was speaking during the high-level roundtable on Just Transition at the COP27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The President called on commercial financial institutions to do more to support these efforts by structuring project financing instruments that take into account the specific needs and circumstances of developing economy countries. President Ramaphosa said that there is a need to promote the use of non-debt instruments to ensure that developing economy countries do not have to shoulder an even greater debt burden. The President further called on a just transition financing framework or pooled financing mechanism to support transition pathways. He said that this entity could play the role of facilitator between the various funding sources and separate funds to ensure there is coherence in just transition financing. 'The fact that the global community was able to mobilise fiscal measures worth an estimated US$ 17 trillion within two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, indicates that the resources to meet climate finance commitments exist, provided there is political will. 'It is our task at this COP27 to harness the political will and mobilise the resources for the just transition. The scale of climate finance must reflect the level of ambition. 'This is critical if we are to effectively reduce emissions, respond meaningfully to the effects of climate change on the vulnerable and ensure that no person, no community and no country is left behind,' the President said. Inclusive low carbon transition vital for developing economy countries The President told the roundtable that the imperative of a low-carbon transition that is just and inclusive is particularly important for developing economy countries, which are the worst affected by climate change. Although Africa carries the least responsibility for climate change, he said that the continent experiences much of its harshest effects. 'The same is true for vulnerable countries and communities in other parts of the world, including small island states. 'Extreme weather like floods and droughts are driving food insecurity, displacing populations, causing damage to infrastructure and leading to the loss of livelihoods,' he said. He highlighted that African economies are losing between 3% and 5% of their GDP due to the effects of climate change. 'Our common starting point is that all parties should honour their undertakings and commitments in line with the guiding principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities. 'For transitions to be just, vulnerable workers and communities need to be included in designing solutions. These same constituencies must share the benefits and not just the risks of transitions,' the President said. Because climate transitions are whole-of-society transitions, President Ramaphosa said that it is important for countries to establish institutions that enable government, business, civil society and organised labour to jointly identify vulnerable sectors and plan together for their transition. 'In our country, this has taken the form of the Presidential Climate Commission, which represents all key stakeholders. 'Equally important is a regulatory framework that harnesses the energies and resources of all aspects of government towards a common climate goal,' he said. The President added that the reality is that developing economy countries have not received the required multilateral support to face the climate challenge, including for loss and damage. 'We need to acknowledge that the multilateral development banks and international financing institutions need to be reformed to meet the climate financing needs of developing economies.

ANC chose road to loot Alexander Parker makes the point in his column that at COP27 SA is asking for assistance to do for energy what in large part a functional government should have done years ago ("The demoralising scale of SA's nasty coal habit," November 7). The ANC should not be allowed to use the just transition to clothe its failings or hide its purposeless incompetence. In 1994, there was another transition, which has proved anything but just. Eskom's turbines were built in service of an apartheid state, but were ready and available to be put to use by the ANC to the greater good. Like white skills themselves, they were there at the ANC's hand to be repurposed for something better. Instead, at a time when leadership within democracy was possible, the ANC chose another road, the road to short-term loot over long-term prosperity, the road where the milk cow is slaughtered for this weekend's braai and the children's milk left unprovided. It is a road that is difficult to leave; one that ends at the cliff edge. We must set ourselves on the path of the separation of the executive from the legislative arms of government. We need an elected parliament that makes policy but leaves execution to a more professional public service. If President Cyril Ramaphosa wishes to leave a lasting legacy, I pray he goes in that direction. Barry Hay Parktown North \</doc>

RENEWABLE ENERGY Coal can handicap exports - Creecy SA's just energy transition plans do not suggest a rapid phasing out of coal as the country's primary fuel source for energy generation. However, without a gradual transition to low-carbon energy, which would include a move away from coal towards renewable sources of energy, the country will struggle to export goods and services that have a large carbon footprint, according to forestry, fisheries & environment minister Barbara Creecy. In an interview with Business Day, Creecy said that she had already been told by India and Italy, who consume most of SA's forestry fibre, that unless the carbon footprint of forestry fibre was reduced by half by 2030, "we will have to find somebody else". The same applies to the country's car industry, which contributes 3%-5% to GDP. "The EU has said that from 2035, they will no longer accept imports of internal combustion engine vehicles. This means that if we want to protect our vehicle industry in the long term, we've got to be able to switch to the production of electric vehicles," said Creecy. In addition, implementation of regulations by the EU that will penalise exporters from high-emission countries through the introduction of carbon border taxes could soon pose a barrier to trade for SA businesses that rely on coal-fired electricity. As part of the European Green Deal, the EU will phase in the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism 2023 and 2026. This will present a risk for SA exports to the EU that are now valued at about R300bn a year. According to Creecy, as these regulations start taking effect, goods and services produced under a high carbon footprint will no longer be competitive in international trade. SA produces about 87% of its electricity from coal and it has the most emissions-intensive power sector among G20 countries, according to the 2022 Climate Transparency Report. "We can ... say, we have coal, we love coal, and we're sticking with [it]. [But] the consequence of that is going to be that by the mid-2030s, we are going to struggle to export our goods and services." Developing the capability to manufacture electric vehicles is one of the main pillars of SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) that was launched at the UN climate conference COP27 in Egypt in early November. The JET-IP, developed by the Presidential Climate Task Team under the leadership of Daniel Mminele, focuses on three priority sectors - electricity, electric vehicles and green hydrogen. An estimated R1.5-trillion will be needed to implement the plan over the next five years. But, Creecy said not all of the money will have to come from grant financing. The funds can also be raised through concessional loans and private investment because "a lot of that work (detailed in the plan) is going to happen in the private sector". During a media briefing at COP27 , President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed the country's disappointment that, according to initial proposals, only about 2.7% of the $8.5bn pledged by SA's partner countries in the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) would be provided in the form of grants. The rest will be loans and concessional loans from development and commercial finance institutions, Ramaphosa said. PARTNERSHIP The JETP, announced at COP26 in November 2021, is a partnership between SA, France, Germany, the UK, US and the EU to support SA's transition to a low-carbon economy and specifically the decarbonisation of SA's coal-reliant energy sector. Funding partners have pledged to mobilise an initial $8.5bn over the next three to five years. SA's revised nationally determined contribution (NDC) submitted at COP26 committed the country to reduce domestic carbon emissions within a target range of 350Mt to 420Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. That would be a reduction of about 20%-33% from present emissions by 2030. The more international support SA receives, the closer the country can get to reaching the more ambitious target to cut about 33% of emissions by 2030, but with limited support the country is likely only to reach a less ambitious target closer to a 20% reduction in emissions, said Creecy. "If we have to rely on our own resources, we will also get within our NDC range, but we want to get to the best place in the range." erasmusd@businesslive.co.za Picture: 123RF/ARTUR NYK \</doc>

Constance Okollet Achom, a Ugandan woman from Tororo, a rural village located in Eastern Uganda, has helped several dozens of her peers affected by domestic violence to address the issue by equipping victims with skillsets to manufacture eco-friendly biofuels from agro-forestry waste. "There have been a growing number of women in my village who experienced intimate partner violence. But they have always accepted to continue bearing the brunt of suffering because of their inability to deal with their finances," Okollet, who is the chair and founder of Osukuru United Women Network, told IPS. With the increasing levels of domestic violence in rural Uganda, Okollet is now championing using climate change solutions to curb its occurrence in this East African nation. The latest estimates by the World Bank indicate that 51% of African women report that being beaten by their husbands is justified if they burn or refuse to prepare food. Yet acceptance is not uniform across countries. The report shows that the phenomenon appears deeply ingrained in some societies, with a 77% acceptance rate in Uganda. Okollet's organization currently empowers and educates women on how climate change affects their village resources. Most importantly, it provides resources for entrepreneurship and counseling to women affected by domestic violence and advocates for their emancipation by empowering them to be self-reliant by becoming green entrepreneurs. With 2,000 members engaged in various climate solutions, including carbon farming, clean energies, and tree planting, the tradition of abuse has slowly started to fade in rural Uganda as many women who used to depend financially on their husbands have taken bold steps in investing in green projects. "It has traditionally been regarded as shameful for the male members of a family if a female member works outside of the home and earns a living," Okollet told IPS on the sidelines of the just concluded global climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. To amplify support for women to build climate resilience, the African Development Bank organized the session held during COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh under the theme, "Gender-sensitive and climate just finance mechanisms." The panelists said facilities tailored to supporting women, who are helping to build climate resilience, must be visible, simple, and easily accessible. During the session, the former Irish president and an influential figure in global climate diplomacy, Mary Robinson, pointed out there is not currently an appropriately dedicated climate fund or a permanent climate fund to support women entrepreneurs in combating climate change. Robinson gave the example of some women-led projects in Uganda which could do ten times more if they had access to targeted climate resources. "They had no prospects of getting the money that could be available for their sector - they didn't even know who was getting the money or where it was going," she told delegates. So far, the bank has earmarked funding for ten capacity-building projects focusing on gender and climate through the Africa Climate Change Fund. According to Kevin Kariuki, the bank's Vice President Vice for Power, Energy, Climate, and Green Growth, the new funding mechanism has committed $100 million in loans to public and private sector projects to address gender and climate issues across the continent. Apart from the new funding scheme launched on the sidelines of COP27 , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), and the French Development Agency (AFD) in partnership with the Egyptian government also launched the Gender Equality in Climate Action Accelerator. It is expected that the accelerator will support private sector companies improve the gender responsiveness of their corporate climate governance. According to the officials, the initiative will help African governments promote gender-sensitive climate sector policies, thereby accelerating their green transition to meet Paris Agreement targets, the UNFCCC's gender action plan, and key Sustainable Development Goals. In the meanwhile, Okollet also said that in collaboration with local administrative authorities in her remote rural village in Uganda, she has already trained several hundred women on how to develop green projects so that they become financially independent and confident to face whatever difficulties they may face in life - including domestic violence. According to her, most rural women in Uganda must wait for their husbands to decide on land management and access, leaving many women underemployed and without any control over productive resources and services.

CLIMATE CONFERENCE SA with its begging bowl ignores ways it can help itself Barbara Creecy fails to mention anything being done that might incentivise the finance we need Last week forestry, fisheries & the environment minister Barbara Creecy and the presidential climate commission hosted a national stakeholder consultation before next week's COP27 climate change negotiations in Egypt. As usual, statements about the need to protect coal mining communities from possible job losses through a just transition featured prominently. That's something I always find quaint given the state's blithe disregard for the more than 1-million jobs the late economist Mike Schussler estimated the economy has shed due to years of coal-induced load-shedding. Creecy gave a rousing address about how SA would lead the charge, begging bowl in hand, to plead for more grant finance from the developed world. Don't get me wrong, I agree with the minister that the developed world should honour previous commitments to mobilise $100bn of climate finance per year between 2020 and 2025. However, given that the IMF's World Economic Outlook released in October, projects that countries representing a third of world economic output (including the US, the eurozone and China) could be in recession next year, perhaps a slightly more compelling pitch than "please sir, can I have some more" would not go amiss. The minister's speech emphasised the need for additional finance, particularly for adaptation, which has always drawn scant attention relative to highly investable mitigation finance options. She stated that support must be provided for climate-resilient infrastructure development and the built environment, as well as for food and water security. Yes indeed. Important issues. But nowhere in her 25-minute speech did she mention anything being done in SA that might incentivise this elusive finance. On infrastructure, we have known for several years that the development of climate-resilient infrastructure is on net balance cheaper than conventional infrastructure. Studies such as Aurecon's 2016 report on "the feasibility of alternative and sustainable infrastructure solutions for human settlements" for the Western Cape government have credibly shown how "the sustainable settlement option is better for the province, the municipality, the household, the economy and the environment". Yet this approach is still largely ignored. On water and food security, we have known since the Western Cape drought in 2017 that increasing soil carbon from below 1.7% to more than 2.3% decreases agricultural irrigation requirements - by far our largest user of water - by more than 20%, while improving yields and decreasing inputs. Has the state developed even a half-credible strategy to deal with this? No. Agri SA calculates that cultivated soils in SA have lost 45%-65% of their carbon due to conventional agricultural practices. The minister stressed the importance of securing enabling finance for the Global Goal on Adaptation, which must support resilience in African countries. The presidential climate commission recognises that this finance "will be primarily from the private sector", and Global Centre on Adaptation co-chair Feike Sijbesma went so far as to state that "80% of the funding for adaptation needs to come from the private sector" at the centre's summit in Rotterdam last month. So one would assume the minister or the presidential climate commission would have had a lot to say about market-driven approaches to adaptation finance (one of the hot-button topics at this year's negotiations) and the development of rules for the article 6 global carbon market, which can unlock significant finance for adaptation. Yet there was not a word from her on the subject or so much as a mention in the commission's "Key Messages for COP27 " outlining Creecy's position ahead of the negotiations. Yes, we need finance and support to effectively navigate climate change's challenges, but it's little wonder that the developed world's purse strings are so tight when we ignore readily available and financially sound actions we can take ourselves, in favour of running to mommy and daddy with a begging bowl.

Frankly speaking West must subscribe to policy that polluter must pay SA's role in pushing for the inclusion of the issue of loss and damage caused by global warming must be applauded. The global south has won a small battle by bringing this issue to the fore at COP27 . At issue here is a principle all human beings should easily understand, that any party that causes damage must pay for it. Of course, bullies understand this principle and many other principles that govern and guide the coexistence of mankind, but they often want to be exempted from such principles. This seems to be the stance of the global north, often also referred to as the western world or the developed world. It goes without saying that developed countries have contributed far more to global warming than developing countries and as such should bear the bulk of the cost to repair the damage caused by climate change. COP27 "That it is finally on the agenda is a step forward, but it is far too early at this stage to know if we are going to be making any relevant progress on the matter," SA environmental affairs, forestry, and fisheries minister Barbara Creecy said. The issue of global warming is one of the few that have gained global consensus. This is a rare moment in history and, in my humble opinion, it should be milked for all it's worth. By this I mean human beings have an opportunity to unite on one issue and solve it in a just and amicable manner. The longstanding but abhorrent tendency of nations that are strong militarily and economically doing as they please can be discarded to the annals of history. It has never been an admirable or honourable thing to start with. While western nations seem hell-bent on avoiding this issue, perhaps partly because of the global energy crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine, it would be a historic moment for them to take responsibility now. If western nations could recognise the principle of taking responsibility for damage caused, this could open up an entirely new age of progress, peace and civility. "These countries are trying to avoid being held liable at all costs. They do not subscribe to the policy that the polluter must pay," Centre for Environmental Rights climate advocacy lawyer Brandon Abdinor said. It is not only climate change that resulted from the western world's march towards global domination; there is a lot that the west has to answer for and they know it. However, what is unique about the situation we find ourselves in, is that global warming and indeed many other global issues require the contribution of every human being. They require that we pull together despite the wide-ranging areas of responsibility we must take. For instance, developing countries have a huge responsibility to weed out corruption and the mentality of entitlement that forms its bedrock. The financial contribution of the western countries must not only deal with the damage caused by global warming in an efficient manner but must assist developing countries to switch to renewable energy. This is all well understood, yet the greatest challenge for developing countries or the global south will be the efficient and productive disbursement of those funds for their stated purpose. In this way, global warming challenges both the global north and global south. If these sections of the globe each take their responsibility, we might be entering a new era that will unleash human potential and restore the natural balance in a big way. The barbaric idea that global economic progress and global environmental health cannot occur at the same time must be banished to the distant past. It has taken the united voice of African nations to raise the important issue of loss and damage caused by global warming. It reminds me of a time when SA punched far above its weight on issues of the moral conduct of nations. We need to return to that place where our history imbues us with moral authority rather than greed and entitlement. \</doc>

Ruling SA hasn't changed We have a president who stores millions of dollars in his furniture and a Financial Action Task Force (based in Paris) that is threatening to greylist our country because we do not monitor every purchase of its citizens and every large cash transaction. We have carbon taxes, but we have to drive to work since our public transport infrastructure is in a shambles. COP27 wants to impose more taxes on us - no, wait, philanthropic organisations are going to give us billions of dollars for a "just energy transition" to renewables. Or perhaps they are going to give us the gift of billions of dollars of debt to transition to a very expensive, unreliable form of energy. We also have state-owned enterprises that siphon money into unseen pockets and that require annual bailouts of our money, but the solution is to make things bigger, centralise more and create more debt to solve a bigger problem. National Health Insurance, anyone? And we have environmental, social and governance (ESG) requirements because certain businesses are "uninvestable", according to a woke cabal of people who have already profited from all these detestable practices. The very same European ESG proponents now want to import coal since renewables have failed them and a very unwoke nation (Russia) has shut off the taps. One only has to look at the recent Dis-Chem debacle to have sympathy with people who actually want to run a company. The answer is always, "Give us your money, your sovereignty and we will solve the problem." This sounds like 46 years of National Party rule, followed by 28 years of ANC rule.

From crop-wilting drought to the creeping devastation of rising seas, climate change is already bringing death, destruction and hefty costs to vulnerable nations, spurring growing calls for richer countries to help them cope in a warming world. The contentious issue of  loss and damage had been a major focus at the UN climate talks in Germany, which is tasked with laying the groundwork for the COP27 summit later this year.  The impacts of climate change are borderless, outgoing UN climate change chief Patricia Espinosa told delegates last week.  They continue to particularly affect the most vulnerable people, communities and countries disproportionately. While climate negotiators met in Germany, the Horn of Africa was facing a record drought, raising fears of famine for tens of millions of people.  These kinds of impacts make the clear case for loss and damage funding, said Mohamed Adow, of the think tank Power Shift Africa.  Those rich countries blocking progress on loss and damage will increasingly have the blood of these climate victims on their hands. Developing nations want a specific funding  facility to help poorer nations least responsible for climate change to cope with its impacts. But that call has been rejected by wealthy nations, particularly the US, which have said funding can be channelled through a network of existing humanitarian, development and climate organisations. As a compromise, the UN\' s COP26 conference in Glasgow set up a formal dialogue, which is set to run until 2024. It has no target outcome, leading to fears that it could become just a  talk shop .  We wanted a facility, but we were given a process that has no clear focus or vision, said Michai Robertson, a representative for the Alliance of Small Island States. After several days of discussion on the topic wrapped up in Bonn, developing countries are now calling for the official inclusion of loss and damage on the agenda at the COP27 summit in Egypt, set for November. Nearly 1.2\'b0C of warming since the mid-19th century has been enough to unleash a torrent of disasters across the planet. A landmark report on the impacts by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this year \- dubbed an  atlas of human suffering \- said that effects would continue to escalate with every fraction of a degree of warming. Science is now able to trace the fingerprints of climate change on a given extreme weather event. The crippling heatwave in India and Pakistan in March and April was made 30 times more likely by climate change, according to scientists at the World Weather Attribution. Campaigners say the current system puts the economic burden on the shoulders of the most vulnerable. Increasing climate risks are compounded by a shortfall in separate funding from rich polluters to help nations prepare for future warming, with a promise of $100 billion a year from 2020 still not met. | AFP \</doc>

What a sigh of relief, the incidents of the deadly Covid-19 are slowly but surely going down. In their midst a good lesson was learnt that inequality is the biggest global threat to humanity. Now is the time to deal decisively with it. The resources, time, effort and urgency thrown into the pandemic was amazing. And the reason was due to the fact that it started from and largely affected the rich countries in a big way. Climate change is next to be tackled with the same vigour and enthusiasm if we are to survive. It is estimated that three-quarter of global carbon emissions are from industrialised, rich nations such as G20 countries. COP27 summit in Egypt in November must pragmatically arrest this adverse situation. Furthermore, we must not be oblivious of the twin killer diseases, TB and Malaria. According to the non-profit TB Alliance, 4,109 people are killed per day by the disease of the poor - TB. In terms of an efficacy vaccine, the Big Brothers are dragging their feet. The president of TB Alliance said TB could be rooted out completely if the same resources were put in place as those that were used to fight Covid. It's sad, and the World Health Organisation is mute. This confirms that if the general populace has money in their pockets, the world would work better. Thami Zwane, Edenvale, Ekurhuleni \</doc>

significant food shortages in the country if these factories need to close. Young said exported South African coal was generally of high quality and compared favourably to Russian, Colombian, US, and Australian coal.  SA coal also enjoys a freight advantage over most of the others. Make no mistake, though, Europe is buying coal wherever it can get it. Energy expert Chris Yelland predicted the  windfall profits would continue for as long as the Ukraine-Russia conflict lasted, but described the surge as a  short-term benefit. He said the high price of coal seemed to be diverting coal away from local markets towards the export market  for the time being , with negative effects on Eskom.  South Africa will be left with the worst quality coal and the best quality coal that will fetch the highest price will be exported. But there are limits to what SA can export due to poor rail and ports infrastructure. South Africa is therefore not able to capitalise on these international high prices fully. The poor infrastructure is holding the mining and coal industries back, said Yelland. Europe\' s coal demand has shifted the conversation among African countries heading to the COP27 The Department of Environmental Affairs and the Presidential Climate Commission will host a joint national stakeholder consultation tomorrow to consolidate South Africa\' s position for the COP27 conference taking place in Egypt next month. Counted among the world\' s biggest greenhouse gas emitters, South Africa, is expected to unveil its Just Energy Transition Partnership Investment plan on reducing emissions at the conference. Mantashe said while these commitments were made, the country also had an obligation to ensure access for millions of people to electricity and clean cooking technologies.  Developed countries want to use our countries as guinea-pigs for experiments. As a smaller economy you then are forced to take the ideas of others. For example, South Africa has a partnership with the US, the EU of about $8.5 billion. It\' s not a gift but a loan. Part of it is a concessional loan and a little portion is a grant. The funding is to help South Africa transition from fossil fuels to green energy and the first tranche of R131bn had been received, said Mantashe.  But when we looked at the turn-over of the coal industry in 2021, it was R130bn. We are actually told to leave coal for the R1bn difference. We support funding, but it must be aligned to our programme. Political analyst Ronald Renwood said the increase in exports was good for the industry but did not necessitate an increase in the use of coal.  We can have all the coal in the world, but it\' s not worth anything to us. Eskom is a mess, it can\' t burn it to generate electricity to meet our own needs, said Renwood. Renwood said the country needed to take a position on whether we go for a green energy solution or get stuck in coal.  We\' ve seen contradicting messages on energy. We need a principled position and the different role players developing policies in response to that position, he said. The surge in the demand for coal is expected to strengthen Africa\' s call to continue to explore its natural resources to boost its socio-economic growth at the climate change conference. African oil and gas producers at an energy conference in Cape Town this week reaffirmed their commitment to ending energy poverty by 2030 and to transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, but on their own terms. The consensus among the African countries was summed up by the CEO of African Energy Chamber, NJ Ayuk, who said:  Drill, baby, drill, that should be Africa\' s message to the world. Europe wants to call gas green \- it has always been green. If it is green gas for Europe, why is it not green gas for Africa? .  We should not be apologising for our energy sector, he said. \</doc>

While the COP27 climate conference has ended, expectations are mounting for the COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference taking place in Montreal, Canada, next week. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) urged leaders to secure an ambitious agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by the end of the decade. Despite ongoing efforts, biodiversity loss and food insecurity were growing worldwide, and this decline was projected to worsen unless a new set of goals for nature could be established at COP15, taking place from December 7 to 19. WWF International director-general Marco Lambertini said:  We are losing biodiversity at an alarming rate. We have lost half of the world\' s warm water corals, and forests the size of roughly one football field vanish every two seconds.  Wildlife populations have suffered a two-thirds decline globally in less than 50 years.  The future of the natural world is on a knife\' s edge. But nature is resilient \- and with a strong global agreement driving urgent action, it can bounce-back. WWF will be pressing governments in Montreal to adopt a Paris-style agreement. Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said:  The Western Cape Province has been anticipating the outcome of the up-and-coming COP15, which will decide a new Global Biodiversity Framework. This includes some incredible stretch targets that could see the nations across the globe unite to secure the protection of the earth\' s biosphere.  A critical part of these agreements is Access and Benefit Sharing. Yesterday, Bredell announced the commencement of the Western Cape Biodiversity Act to promote the protection of biodiversity while also allowing for development, economic growth, and job creation in a sustainable and manner. WWF senior director of global policy and advocacy, Lin Li, said leaders needed to send the message that the existential nature crisis could be addressed at the same time as current socio-economic needs. \</doc>

NAIROBI: Elizabeth Wathuti channelled her frustration and sadness over the damage to natural habitats, including Kenyan forests close to her childhood home, into a life of activism, founding the Green Generation Initiative to raise awareness through tree growing. Six years after starting the environmental advocacy group, Wathuti is one of Kenya\' s most ardent voices in the struggle against climate change, a voice she is hoping will be heard by world leaders gathered in Egypt for the COP27 climate summit. Wathuti was one of the young people calling for urgent action as the UN climate conference marked its traditional Young and Future Generations Day yesterday.

President Cyril Ramaphosa has itchy feet. He can\' t stay in South Africa for long, even when there are serious issues to attend to at home. From COP27 And while he wined and dined with royalty under the bright lights of the palace, all thoughts of home, where millions sit in darkness, unable to cook their food and study for their exams, were forgotten. On the other hand, does it really matter whether he\' s at home or globe-trotting? It makes no difference. Nothing has been done by his government about the myriad problems facing the country, among them high crime levels, the energy crisis and the dire economic mess. Should a man who is such a failure as a leader be rewarded with a second term? We think not. It would be such a travesty of justice. But the ANC will, in all probability, think otherwise. Known for rewarding its comrades for incompetence, it would probably reward him with another term. \</doc>

Our ambitious climate goals must be backed up by action Countries will recommit and renegotiate their own climate goals and the contributions they can make to helping other countries achieve theirs at COP27 , which will get under way in one week's time in Egypt. African governments, business leaders and climate (and fossil fuel) activists hope the event's location will amplify Africa's demands. SA and many other developing nations hope that serious consideration will finally be given to "loss and damage". This was a concept established at COP19 to address losses associated with the consequences of climate change in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to its adverse effects. Air pollution kills about 29,800 people in SA every year, and extreme heat cost workers R3.8bn in lost wages in 2021. This is according to a report released last week by Climate Transparency International, which offers a comprehensive review of climate action and emissions by Group of 20 (G20) countries. Forestry, fisheries & environment minister Barbara Creecy said recently that loss and damage costs for Africa will range from $289bn to $440bn up to 2030. SA and other developing nations want an agreement on the governance of loss and damage to be finalised at COP27 , including the scale of financing arrangements. The focus, according to Creecy, should be on grant-based funding, including from developed countries' public finance and multilateral development banks, to be paid via direct budget support to governments. The continent's financing needs require special consideration, given the high levels of indebtedness of many African countries. But the continent also wants special conditions to apply, given that it has contributed less than 4% to the build-up of global emissions but is the continent affected most heavily. SA and its negotiating partners will urge developed countries to do more to mitigate carbon emissions and backtrack less. SA, which is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in Africa and the 12th-largest globally, committed to having greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2025 at 510-million tonnes. And at COP26 in Scotland last year, the country committed to reduce domestic carbon emissions to within a target range of 350-million tonnes to 420-million tonnes by 2030. SA is also a signatory to the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit global average temperature increases to below 2?C by reducing fossil fuel emissions. But these ambitions are yet to translate into the sort of action that would make these goals achievable. Earlier this year, the Treasury decided to extend the first phase of the carbon tax, introduced in June 2019, by three years to 2025. This first phase makes provision for polluting companies to receive 60%-95% tax allowances such as rebates or exemptions. Extending these provisions places a question mark over the feasibility of meeting SA's climate commitments. Stubborn short-sightedness by people such as mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe, which pits energy security and economic reform against energy transition, will also not help. The Climate Transparency report notes that fossil fuels still account for 92% of the country's energy mix. Renewable energy accounts for only 9% of electricity generated, which makes the country a poor performer on renewables among its G20 peers, where the average is 29%. According to the report, SA's policies will result in emissions reductions only in line with 3% warming. Few other countries have the natural advantages SA has to be a global leader in clean energy. We have ample sun and wind resources, we have the space required to generate energy from these resources, and we have the largest endowment of platinum - a key transition metal - in the world. Combined, this poses an opportunity for SA to become one of the largest producers of renewables, green hydrogen and green steel. This is the sort of development that can unlock benefits akin to those experienced by rich oil-producing nations. It can transform our country, breathe life into a critically ailing economy and help reverse the devastating unemployment trend - not to mention tackle our immediate energy crisis. SA's ambitious climate goals must be backed up by solid action. Perhaps, if we do this, by COP28 or COP29 the country will have a more solid platform from which to issue demands. \</doc>

The South Durban Community Environmental Alliance has called on leaders at this year's COP27 summit in Egypt to block any plans to "gas Africa". The group held a protest in Durban on Friday in conjunction with the 27th UN Climate Change Conference which runs from November 6-18. At Suncoast Beach promenade, more than 200 people carried placards as they protested against oil and gas exploration along South Africa's coast. Alliance leader Desmond D'Sa said there was a need to protect the ocean and limit climate change. He said many people had been affected by changes, especially in KwaZulu-Natal, citing the more than 400 deaths and displacement of several thousand to relief camps after their houses were flooded in April this year. D'Sa also lambasted the South African government after it signed loan agreements with France and Germany worth about R10bn to facilitate its transition from coal. "They shouldn't have signed any loan agreement and we don't want any loan agreements about coming to export oil and gas. We don't want anyone to take coal and come in and take our land. They haven't spoken to us or communities about what deal they're going to cut. We are prepared to fight," he said. Mfolozi Community Environmental Justice Organisation member, Israel Nkosi, said oil and gas exploration has serious implications for nature. Nkosi said the ocean was of vital importance as it is used for different purposes, including for spiritual worship,, and is an economic hub for many cities, including Durban and Cape Town. Nkosi said the international community was interested in Africa's wealth - gas and oil in the ocean - and were using local leaders for economic gain. \</doc>

The COP President Alok Sharma and a delegation of Ministers from the South African government has welcomed the progress made thus far in advancing the long-term Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). Following an engagement between the Conference of the Parties (COP26) President and the Head of the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team, Daniel Mminele, a meeting was held on Tuesday in Pretoria between Sharma and a delegation of seven cabinet members. Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele; the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr Naledi Pandor; the Minister of Finance, Enoch Godongwana; the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, Barbara Creecy; the Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan; the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe; and the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition, Ebrahim Patel met with Sharma. In a joint statement, Sharma and the Ministers said the meeting reflected on the progress made since COP26 in advancing the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) as a groundbreaking initiative to enable South Africa's transition to a low carbon economy and a climate resilient society. Through the Political Declaration issued in November 2021 to establish this partnership, the United Kingdom together with the European Union, France, Germany, and the United States undertook to mobilise an initial amount of $8.5 billion over the next 3-5 years to support the achievement of South Africa's ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). 'The COP President and Ministers welcomed the progress made thus far in advancing this long-term partnership. They continued discussions on the financing instruments to be provided, with a view to ensuring that the partnership meets the country's investment needs and aligns with its fiscal framework. 'They discussed ongoing work on a South African-led Investment Plan, which will guide the use of funds. In this context, they noted that as momentum grows and enabling conditions are created, there will be considerable interest from wider sources of finance,' the statement read. The meeting also underlined their shared commitment to a just transition that protects affected workers and communities as a key priority of the partnership, and to supporting opportunities for innovation and quality jobs including in the green hydrogen and electric vehicle sectors. Progress has been made towards the creation of an enabling policy environment to support South Africa's NDC, including the tabling of a Climate Change Bill in Parliament; reforms underway in the electricity sector; the finalisation of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap and the Renewable Energy Masterplan; and the development of a just transition framework through the Presidential Climate Commission. It further details the steps that have been taken to establish governance and implementation structures for the partnership, including the appointment of an independent technical secretariat led by Joanne Yawitch and the imminent establishment of working groups focusing on the electricity, green hydrogen and transport sectors as well as finance and implementation modalities. 'Finally, it confirms the commitment of the partners to finalise a comprehensive Investment Plan as well as to continue discussions regarding the financing package to enable meaningful progress by COP27 ,' the statement said. As committed to in the Political Declaration, the South African Presidential Climate Finance Task Team (PCFTT) and the International Partners Group (IPG) on Tuesday released a detailed six-month update to leaders on the advancement of the Partnership. The progress update provides an overview of the work currently underway to take forward the partnership as well as key interim milestones leading to COP27 in November 2022. \</doc>

POWER GENERATION Head of Eskom's energy transition resigns Head of Eskom's energy transition quits Hajra Omarjee, Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Linda EnsorThe head of Eskom's energy transition department has resigned, leaving the utility in the middle of scrutinising the terms of a R150bn-plus package pledged by some of the world's richest nations to finance a quicker transition from coal. A more than 20-year energy industry veteran, the departure of Mandy Rambharos at the end of October is likely to leave SA's delegation to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change one person short at the 27th annual meeting ( COP27 ) in the first week of November. At the previous meeting in Glasgow last year, the EU, Britain, France, the US and Germany promised $8.5bn (R153bn) to help Eskom expedite the transition to green energy. In exchange, SA has to come up with a plan for how it will shut down coal-fired power stations and repurpose those locations for renewable energy farms. Negotiations with the partners about the investment plan are meant to end before the start of COP27 Eskom is unfazed by the exit of Rambharos - who is joining the Environmental Defense Fund, a US non-profit - with spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha saying that the energy transition programme will proceed as planned. The announcement of Rambharos's departure came a day after public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan named a new Eskom board that combines a mix of legal, engineering and financial skills. The board of directors, which began work at the weekend, is led by Mpho Makwana, a bachelor of arts graduate who returns to the utility after serving in the same capacity in 2010. He is currently the chair of Nedbank and also holds a number of other corporate positions. He served for nine months as Eskom CEO. The new board includes Busisiwe Vilakazi (an engineer); Lwazi Goqwana (a member of the ministerial task team looking into improvements at Eskom); Clive le Roux (a retiree with experience at Koeberg as Eskom's chief nuclear officer); Leslie Mkhabela (an attorney with experience in the restructuring of state-owned assets); Mteto Nyati (a chemical engineer and former Altron CEO); Fathima Gany (a chartered accountant); Ayanda Mafuleka (a chartered accountant); Tsakani Mthombeni (an engineer who has been involved in improving Eskom's performance and a former chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group); Claudelle von Eck (a change management expert); Tryphosa Ramano (a chartered accountant); and trade unionist Bheki Ntshalintshali. Existing board member Rod Crompton will be retained to ensure continuity. The new board members have taken oversight of a state-owned company that faces an energy supply crisis, which has damped business sentiment, undermined economic growth prospects and left millions of South Africans frustrated. They will also have to assess the performance of Eskom's executive management team led by CEO Andr\'e9 de Ruyter, who took the reins at the start of 2020. first task Makwana said the board would meet the executives on Monday as SA continues to grapple with severe load-shedding, which has continued for weeks. Makwana said the new board would within days be able to speak more openly about the way forward amid calls from the EFF and the Black Business Council (BBC) for De Ruyter and COO Jan Oberholzer to be shown the door. "The BBC would like to advise the new board that their first responsibility and task is to release the incompetent CEO and COO as they have plunged the country into darkness that has paralysed the country and its economy," said BBC CEO Kganki Matabane as the lobby group joined a chorus of commentators welcoming the new board. Business Unity SA (Busa) said it believed the right people had been appointed to chart the way forward. "The board has an appropriate mix of expertise and we expect the new board to provide strategic guidance to the Eskom executive and to take responsibility for the executive's performance," Busa CEO Cas Coovadia said. "We also expect the new board to engage robustly with the shareholder to get the shareholder to play its role in ameliorating and managing the ongoing load-shedding crisis." \</doc>

Cop27 is on. Get ready for a blowout of political methane. Now methane is mos methane, whether it's from cows or political BS, it's 85 times more destructive to our oxygen film around the Earth, which keeps us alive, than CO& xB2;. On the motorcycle for 12 days you get time to have thoughts in your helmet. Some profound, some profane. You come off your line and now the big bike is running itself and you are hanging on to the bars wondering why your brain drifted off and your happy existence has turned to terror. I remember as a kid living in a white East London bubble how everything would go along all hunky dory, just fun and so exciting, filled with trips to the sea, social visits for big braais where there was lots of sexy banter - this was the 60s n& xE9;, all bikinis, hot pants, miniskirts and knee-high white boots. Men grew sideburns and their hair began to curl at the back. But not for me. My dad had an oddly 40s and 50s approach to men's and boys' hair styles. I would be ordered off to the barber in "Queen's Street", our mini-Mecca in staid suburban Cambridge. Damn, we lived in King Edward Road - who was the UK traditional chief-loving street-namer in the municipality back in the day? Anyway, little naughty sht me, the only one with an elastic band clamped around his upper arm in the black and white family portrait, would be sent, aged eight or nine years old, on the long trek to the place with the big red and white barber's pole. Short back and sides, my dad Scotty would order. That place was pungent with unguents Brylcreem and Trugel. My dad insisted on the Arctic white Brylcreem but I loved the pulsing radium-blue of Trugel. That's how it was in those days kids. Our parents, themselves products of the World War 2 generation where the violence unleashed by autocrats, fascists and Nazis, sent 60-million people to a premature end, believed in a good klap now and then. I suspect my mom was practising her odd underhand tennis backhand on me. I watched in fascination how my friend, that private schoolteacher, never, ever used his hand on his children, and I was quick to abandon the "one, two, three" system of a paddywhack on the butt when it literally made me cry. I also realised that violence, no matter how constrained or light, had absolutely no effect on the children. If I have one regret, it was that. My girls don't agree. In mitigation, I guess we were one of the last generation of apartheid whites, and surprise, surprise, we too were raised in a system of violent punishment, and where has that taken us? Wokus pokus types who love to whine on about white privilege in a sea of black minority privilege, are missing the point: it is the continuation of the violence which corrodes our now corrupted and unfree society. I remember how press photographer Paul Weinberg used a martial art to counter the sjambok of a charging riot cop in the 80s with a counter step. If the cause is just, well then? It's such a tricky issue, and one which sees our courts settling it if you get it wrong. The issue of violence should require maximum revs for our magnificent brains to sort out before we rush back into the primordial instinct of moer. That is how far the scar reaches, it burns us right back to the primeval start somewhere in the ether of our time. And it obviously moves forward in us our current survivalist fight which reaches up through nation states into the oligarchical corporate dominance. And that is what Cop27 is all about: the rich not prepared to change a good thing, even if it puts the rest of society at risk of ecocide. I get it. As a kid, I was so addicted to petrol I accidentally set my leg on fire in the backyard, and now, according to UJ sociology prof Patrick Bond, fossil-fuel addicted politicians are wanting to move on to "meth" addiction. Methane gas. Darkly funny. If Cop27 is worth anything, it is the fun of unpicking the lies and puffery; the greenwash, the brownwash. If I was smart I would turn it into game of dice; take a Cop statement, roll the numbers, have a quirky set of answers like a six would be worth a spot in a guarded final enclave while the rest of Earth burns. A kind of climate Monopoly, with my favourite move: Politicians and executive climate criminals go straight to jail for crimes against life. I was at Cop17 in Durban. The UN sets up base and comes close to body searching everyone, and when it got testy in there, those big world cops in blue feel nothing about telling journalists to stop recording. Yes, Cop is a cop-out with fossil fuel companies sending the biggest delegation to try and break up, dissipate, muddy, water-down, obfuscate, cavil, weasel - anything, whatever it takes to get them to those gas and oil deposits under the Wild Coast ocean which drives Shell - and Gweezy - mad with desire. My enduring memory of that jamboree was what happened outside of the wheeling and dealing in the ring, in the spectator seats was row upon row of organisations who filled the tents, open areas and lecture halls of Durban. I was particularly moved by young global activists who spoke eloquently and fluently about the climate crisis and wished that our SA youth could reach this level of sophistication and commitment, to finally fly above the ideological bog of parochial, party-infected diatribe. I want them to look down and see Earth for what it is in the era of the sixth extinction; chopped, invaded, polluted, burned, flooded. Roiling with destruction and corruption. As actor-activist Leo DiCaprio said from the oil company's chopper flying over tar sands: "It looks like Mordor." Back in the day, a trip to that barber's red and white pole (the US added blue) in Cambridge, East London, included bloodletting, teeth pulling and setting broken bones administered by monks. I can relate, since there was some blood-curdling reactions from my dear mother when I returned shorn with a lakka stiff little kaif, or correctly stated m'lud, a mooi coiffeur. You wonder why, after being properly barbered as a roofie (new) troep (conscripted soldier) in the SADF in 1978, and further attrocities of war, I refused to cut my hair in my first year of journalism at Rhodes. Thesadays, I am back to wearing it short because, well, that is all I have left. I wish I could blame it on climate change, but time is the culprit. I remember our favourite complaint in the 60s was that family was "ganging up" on perceived victims, and I guess we are all to some extent, simply gangstas. Nonetheless, I pray for young people of Mordor. Don't go down without a just fight. .TOUGH LOVE: The little wildcat Baron of Avonleigh, since renamed Squigg, enjoys a hug from his owner Ben Carver.

With climate change bringing about increasing numbers of human deaths and untold suffering, and rising economic, social, and environmental consequences worldwide, it's time for governments to take bold action to address the climate change emergency. Climate scientists have warned that there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 Celsius. Beyond that level, even half a degree, will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat, and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. In November the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention to Climate Change is scheduled to take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Government representatives from some 200 countries and other parties will focus on securing the 1.5\'b0C goal and adapting to the negative impacts of climate change through the implementation of the Paris Agreement provisions. At the time of COP27 , world population is expected to reach 8,000,000,000. That figure is an increase of more than 2 billion humans on the planet since the first COP conference held in Berlin, Germany, in 1995. The 8 billion milestone is double the size of world population in 1974 and quadruple its size in 1927. With the growth of the world's population, annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry have grown enormously over the past century, increasing more than nine-fold since 1927 and doubling since 1974 (Figure 1). The growth of world population has slowed down from its peak levels in the second half of the 20th century. It continues to increase, currently at about 70 million annually and projected to reach 9 billion by 2037 and 10 billion by 2058. If annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry continue to increase as they have during the past several decades, their annual level of emissions in 2058 when the world's population is expected to reach 10 billion would be more than 50 percent higher than it is today, or approximately 60 billion tonnes. Up until relatively recently, warnings of a climate change emergency by thousands of scientists have been downplayed by most governments. Frustrated by government responses, many scientists are increasingly feeling like climate change Cassandras. Warnings that rising carbon emissions are dangerously heating the Earth have been clearly conveyed to governments. In particular, scientists have emphasized that the burning of fossil fuels is already heating up the planet faster than anything the world has seen in 2,000 years. In 2020 five countries produced approximately 60 percent of the world's annual CO2 emissions. In first place was China with nearly one-third of the annual CO2 emissions. China also has the greatest number of coal-fired power stations of any country in 2022, or approximately 1,110 operational stations (Figure 2). The United States is in second place accounting for 14 percent of the annual CO2 emissions in 2020. The percentages for the other three countries, India, Russia, and Japan, were 7, 5 and 3 percent, respectively Those likely consequences include warmer temperatures with increased frequency, intensity, and duration, impacting oceans, seas levels, coral reefs, fish levels, glaciers and ice and snow cover. Also, changes in patterns and amount of rainfall are expected to result in increased droughts and desertification as well as flooding. Climate change's worsening of air and water quality is expected to contribute to the spread of certain diseases and human illnesses accompanied by increased malnourishment, hunger, and mortality, as well as the deteriorating ecosystems impacting numerous plant and animal species. Climate change will also likely contribute to the increased displacement of people as well as illegal migration as millions of men, women, and children seek to escape the consequences of global warming and environmental degradation. Due to the increasingly visible consequences of climate change, governments are finding it difficult to downplay the warnings of scientists. Among the weather consequences of the climate change emergency are worldwide record-breaking high temperatures as well as droughts, floods, wildfires, storms, and hurricanes. Global surveys also report that the majority of the world's population is worried about climate change. In January 2021, for example, the global climate survey by the United Nations Development Programme across 50 countries found that nearly two-thirds of the respondents consider climate change as an emergency and represents a clear call for governments to take the needed action to address it. Various measures have been recommended to address the climate change emergency. Among those measures are stabilizing or reducing the size of human populations, eliminating the use of fossil fuels, moving to renewable energies, reducing air pollutants, restoring ecosystems, shifting from meat to mainly plant based diets, and transitioning to sustainable GDP growth (Table 2). The upcoming November COP27 conference in Egypt is expected to follow the usual pattern of previous sessions with an adoption of a negotiated final report. However, that outcome is unlikely to be sufficient to achieve the internationally established goal of limiting the increase in global warming to a maximum of 1.5 Celsius. Despite more than two dozen annual COP sessions, various international agreements, and enumerated goals, a binding international agreement to address the climate change emergency is lacking. In addition, an authority that would impose climate change policies is not likely to be established, particularly given the supremacy of national sovereignty. Nevertheless, progress to address climate change has been achieved over the past several decades. The international community of nations adopted the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, and the Paris Agreement in 2015. Also, governments have agreed on the science behind climate change, acknowledged the likely consequences of inaction, and have set emission reduction pledges to slow down CO2 emissions. Recently adopted policies have enhanced energy efficiency, slowed deforestation rates, and accelerated the use of renewable energy. In addition, scores of governments are adopting additional commitments to address climate change. The United States, for example, recently passed historic legislation aimed at addressing climate change and clean energy that includes a budget of U.S. $369 billion. As stated above, climate scientists have warned that there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 Celsius. Given that 12-year window to address the global warming goal, there is little time to waste. It is time for governments, especially the major contributors to global warming, to implement bold actions to address the climate change emergency.

It's the largest ever EIB investment for local private sector green energy programmes Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and CEO Patrick Dlamini of the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) formally agreed on 11 November at COP27 , Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to EIB financing in South Africa that will back a new targeted financing programme to unlock (EURO)400 million for private sector renewable energy investment across South Africa. The (EURO)400 million initiative (7.2 billion ZAR equivalent) will be backed by (EURO)200 million from the EIB and provide financing for a range of new renewable energy projects across South Africa. The scheme will help to increase clean energy power generation and contribute to DBSA's Embedded Generation Investment Programme (EGIP), which is co-financed by the Green Climate Fund. The new initiative is expected to generate an additional 1200MW of generating capacity and avoid 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions once all the supported projects are operational. The projects it will finance are expected to create hundreds of new jobs during construction and operation, and support local companies. Dlamini commented: "The DBSA has a clear goal to increase investment in renewable energy and improve energy security, not only in South Africa but across the African continent. South Africa, like many African countries, is already suffering [from] the effects of climate change. This new investment from the EIB in our Embedded Generation Investment Programme is an important contribution to South Africa's resilient and sustainable growth." Fayolle added: "As the EU Climate Bank, the EIB is committed to supporting South Africa's efforts to decarbonise and today's agreement of the largest ever EIB investment in South Africa follows past support for renewable energy and climate adaptation projects across the country. EIB Global is pleased to build on three decades of partnership with DBSA to boost renewable energy generation which will contribute to energy security and a just transition in South Africa.\~ "The EIB is stepping up its efforts to support green energy projects globally, with a special focus on Africa and economies dependent on carbon-intensive activities that are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change." DBSA's Embedded Generation Investment Programme (EGIP) supports the development and upscaling of solar photovoltaic and wind renewable energy embedded generation projects, developed by independent power producers operating in South Africa. Embedded generation is the production of electricity from smaller-scale power stations and is usually defined as projects that are planned for their own use. EGIP offers a credit support mechanism through the provision of risk capital. Watch the DBSA and EIB signing ceremony at the EIB-Benelux Pavilion at COP27 here: Cheaper solar, onshore wind and energy efficiency The financing will be available for renewable energy projects - solar photovoltaic and onshore wind energy generation - and potentially to energy-efficiency projects promoted by the private sector in South Africa. These projects are expected to provide a reliable source of energy for South Africans at a lower cost than fossil fuel alternatives.

Eskom expects a final decision on a new $476m World Bank loan to repurpose its Komati coal-fired power plant into a renewable station before November's COP27 climate summit, chief executive Andre de Ruyter said on Friday, 16 September. The money will be used for three packages, which includes decommissioning certain parts of the 1,000 megawatt (MW) Komati power plant that is currently only using one unit to despatch 125MW of power when needed, as Eskom battles its worst period of power cuts since it started more than a decade ago.The World Bank loan is separate from the $8.5bn financial package to help South Africa, one of the world's biggest polluters, move away from its reliance on coal-fired power plants that supply the bulk of its electricity needs."The second one (package) is for the repurposing, which includes 100MW of solar, 150MW of battery storage and 40-70MW of wind all around Komati. The benefit, of course, is we can use existing transmission infrastructure," De Ruyter told journalists on the sidelines of an oil and gas conference.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/231556.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/693/231556.html :EMBED-->Addressing the just transitionThe final package is about addressing the "just component" and helping ensure that the impact for employees and contractors in the coal value chain was minimised, he said.Situated in Mpumalanga halfway between Middelburg and Bethel, Komati was first fired up in 1961 and was mothballed for almost two decades before a decision was taken in 2004 to reinstate the station to help alleviate power outages."We were in Washington last week, really productive and positive meetings," De Ruyter said, adding that he expected a final decision on the loan before the end of November. \</doc>

As world leaders enter the second half of the UN climate change conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt, it\' s hard to be optimistic the talks will generate any radical departure from the inexorable rise in global carbon emissions over the past two centuries. After all, before last year\' s Glasgow talks, experts warned the summit was the world\' s last chance to limit global warming to 1.5\'baC this century. And yet, a UN report last week found even if all nations met their climate goals this decade, the planet would still heat by a catastrophic 2.5\'baC. There were hopes the global pandemic might have shifted the world\' s economies from fossil fuel dependence as lockdowns reduced energy consumption, and progressive politicians proposed alternative policy agendas. How is it that a technologically advanced society could choose to destroy itself by failing to act to avert a climate catastrophe? It\' s like watching a slow-motion train crash; the world\' s leading climate scientists have for decades warned of the dangers of ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Political and corporate leaders knew of the threat more than a decade before it was key public knowledge. In 1977, US president Jimmy Carter was briefed on the possibility of catastrophic climate change. That year, internal memos at one of the world\' s largest oil companies made it clear that continued burning of fossil fuels would dramatically heat the planet. So why, in the 45 years since, has there been so little action in response? Why do we condemn today\' s children and future generations to live on a dangerous and hostile planet? We\' ve sought to answer this question in our research into business and climate change over the years. The answer, we argue, rests on a prevailing assumption organised by corporate and political elites: that endless economic growth fuelled by fossil energy is so fundamental and commonsensical it cannot be questioned. The concept of  hegemony was developed by the Italian intellectual Antonio Gramsci. In the 1920s, he sought to explain how dominant classes maintained their power beyond the use of force and coercion. He argued hegemony involved a continuous process of winning the consent of key actors in society such as industrialists, the media, and religious and educational institutions, to form a ruling bloc. Civil society would thus accept the prevailing order, dampening any threat of revolution. Gramsci\' s ideas help us understand the lack of action in response to the climate crisis. In particular, it helps explain the business sector\' s inordinate influence on global climate policy. For instance, a range of recent studies have explored the  fossil fuel hegemony in countries such as Australia, Canada and the US. These studies argue such hegemony comprises a coalition of corporate and political actors with interests aligned around carbon-dependent economic growth. This leads to limited progress on legislation to reduce carbon emissions. The hegemony extended to corporate-political activity, seeding doubt about climate science, lobbying against emissions reduction and renewable energy, and the capture of political parties by interests aligned with fossil fuels. This helps explain why environmentalists advocate keeping fossil fuels in the ground are attacked by conservative politicians and right-wing media. They are presented not only as a threat to  our way of life , but as deluded and dangerous radicals, or even terrorists. Of course, there are alternatives to the fossil fuel hegemony. It involves immediate and dramatic decarbonisation of the global economy, as COP27 in Egypt aspires to achieve. But it also requires alternative economic models of  degrowth . Degrowth involves a planned and equitable contraction of rich economies, until it operates steadily and within the capacity of the planet\' s resources. This includes carbon trading systems with a rapidly lowering cap, fossil fuel extraction limits, worker autonomy and shorter working hours, and job guarantees with living wages. These types of policies rest on tax reforms to limit resource use and reduce carbon emissions, while promoting work sharing and limiting production and consumption. This also requires far more democratic politics than the current hegemony allows \- one that challenges the illusion that economic growth can continue even as Earth\' s life-support systems begin to fail. Because as more people acknowledge the reality of the climate crisis, those seeking to maintain the fossil fuel hegemony will need to work harder to maintain their grip on climate politics. | The Conversation Wright is professor of organisational studies, University of Sydney.

Food insecurity is a global problem with hyperlocal ramifications, and the world is far off target to resolve it Food insecurity is a global problem with hyperlocal ramifications, and the world is far off target to resolve it TANYA FARBERWith the 8-billionth person just born, many countries are in the path of a "hurricane of hunger" and are looking at food systems already creaking under the weight of population growth. SA is no exception, albeit the country was just ranked the most food-secure nation on the continent. A recent announcement by The Economist's Global Food Security Index puts SA at 59 out of 113 countries, up from 70th position last year. But this comes as little comfort to those who go to bed hungry every night - about 6.5-million, according toStats SAA. Other African countries are faring far worse: South Sudan, for example, with 75% of its population mired in severe food insecurity, is the worst off it has been since independence in 2011. President Cyril Ramaphosa this week called for more support from high-income countries. At the G20 Leaders' Summit in Bali, Indonesia, he said: "In Africa, as in many other parts of the developing world, millions of people are going hungry. Global food insecurity is getting worse. "There are several reasons for this. The recovery from the pandemic has been uneven and inadequate. "Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of droughts, floods and wildfires, disrupting agricultural production and supply ... Low and middle income economies are most affected by the resultant food shortages and need substantial financial support to ensure food security and to tackle the effects of climate change." He said that with this support, such countries can invest in climate-smart agriculture, sustainable food production systems and climate-related early warning systems. Food insecurity is a global problem with hyperlocal ramifications, and the world is far off target to resolve it. Deutsche Welle's Melinda Crane, speaking at the recent Falling Walls Science Summit in Berlin, said: "Some 830-million people are struggling with food insecurity, and we are further away from the SDG goal of 2015 now than we were then." She added: "We are sitting in the path of the hunger hurricane. World hunger has never been more urgent. "We're seeing a spike in wheat and corn prices after Russia announced it would be leaving the UN deal [to allow grain and fertiliser to leave Ukraine via the Black Sea]. That sent prices soaring." Though Russia has now said it would rejoin the deal, "it was a stark reminder that the world's food supply is volatile". She said agriculture is the "most affected" by the climate crisis but is also a strong driver of it. Food insecurity plays into an existing poly-crisis of rising cost of living and fallout from the pandemic, resulting in 2022 seeing "unprecedented hunger". "How can we avert famine that threatens the lives of 50-million people, and how can we sustainably expand food security for all?" asked Crane. Food Systems for the Future head Ertharin Cousin said: "We are going backwards, and beforeCovid-19d, the challenge we faced was climate and conflict. Those were the two primary drivers of food insecurity. ThenCovid-19d strikes and lockdowns showed that our food system is efficient but not agile, and food became inaccessible to so many." She describes the conflict in Ukraine as the "tipping point for the perfect storm". Alex Assanvo, the executive secretary of the Initiative Cacao Ivory Coast-Ghana (ICCIG), works with cocoa farmers. He provides a glimpse into the whole food chain: "What we're seeing on the ground makes it impossible not to admit that it is extremely difficult to live in Ghana. Inflation is more than 40%, and that makes everything expensive. Even the best farmer I know has to choose between buying fertiliser or putting his kids through school." He said farmers are constantly scared of losing a competitive advantage but are struggling while global corporations continue to turn record profits. So where to from here? For Assanvo, the solution lies in transparency. "Everyone has a responsibility. We are facing a lack of transparency. Everyone is buying cocoa, but nobody is mapping the whole chain. We need to incentivise people. For example, those protecting the forests should be rewarded." Cousin said if COP27 is the adaptation COP, "it is also the one where governments must meet their financial commitments to the developing world". With a strong focus on food security at COP27 , head of food system coalition 50by40 Lasse Bruun called for a more holistic approach to food systems. He said: "The food systems approach differs from conventional or intensive farming in that it takes a holistic view of feeding people. The focus is on nutrition and food security, while including all stakeholders in the supply chain, including farmers, smallholder farmers, traders and consumers. The food systems approach also addresses the socioeconomic and financial aspects of the system." - TimesLIVE Premium PRESSURE ON FOOD SUPPLY: With the 8-billionth person born this week, many countries are in the path of a 'hurricane of hunger' and are looking at food systems already creaking under the weight of population growth.

When Haq read a tweet by Marianne Karlsen, the co-chair of the UN's adaptation committee, which HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/LossandDamage/status/1537434616809725953 said that "[m]ore time is needed to reach an agreement", referring to the negotiations on loss and damage finance, he HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/SaleemulHuq/status/1537437290263216128 tweeted : "The one thing we have run out of is time. Climate change impacts are already happening, and poor people are suffering losses and damages due to the emissions of the rich. Talk is no longer an acceptable substitute for action (money)." Karlsen's comment came in light of the treacle-slow process of HYPERLINK https://time.com/6188699/loss-damages-blocked-from-cop27-agenda/ agreement on the "loss and damage" agenda for the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) meeting to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November 2022. In 2009, at COP15, developed countries had agreed to a HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-does-cop26-mean-adaptation $100- billion annual adaptation assistance fund, which was to be paid by 2020. This fund was intended to assist countries of the Global South to shift their reliance on carbon to renewable sources of energy and to adapt to the realities of the climate catastrophe. At the time of the Glasgow COP26 meeting in November last year, developed countries were unable to meet this commitment. The $100-billion may seem like a modest fund but is far less than what the UN says is the " HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/06/1094762 trillion dollar climate finance challenge (and opportunities)" that will be required to ensure comprehensive climate action. The richer states, led by the West, have not only refused to seriously fund adaptation but they have also reneged on the original agreements, such as the HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol Kyoto Protocol (1997). The US congress has HYPERLINK https://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/26/world/kyoto-protocol-fast-facts/index.html refused to ratify this important step toward mitigating the climate crisis. It has shifted the goalposts for reducing its methane emissions and has refused to account for the HYPERLINK https://watson.brown.edu/research/2019/pentagon-fuel-use-climate-change-and-costs-war huge output of carbon emissions by the US military. Germany's money goes to war not climate Germany hosts the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In June, as a prelude to COP27 , the UN held a HYPERLINK conference in Bonn on climate change. The talks ended in acrimony over "loss and damage" finance. The European Union consistently blocked all discussions on compensation. Eddy P\'e9rez of the Climate Action Network, Canada, HYPERLINK https://climatenetwork.org/2022/06/16/eu-hypocrisy-as-a-climate-champion-exposed-at-bonn-climate-conference%EF%BF%BC/ said : "Consumed by their narrow interests, rich nations and in particular countries in the European Union, came to the Bonn Climate Conference to block, delay and undermine efforts from people and communities on the frontlines addressing the losses and damage caused by fossil fuels." On the table is the hypocrisy of countries such as Germany, which claims to lead on these issues, but has been sourcing fossil fuels overseas and has been spending increasing funds on its military.\~ At the same time, these countries have denied support to developing countries facing devastation from climate-induced superstorms and rising seas. After the recent German elections, hopes were raised that the new coalition of the Social Democrats with the Green Party would lift up the green agenda. But German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has HYPERLINK https://www.ft.com/content/a9045654-f378-4f42-a012-e35f9e43b135 promised (EURO)100- billion for the military, "the biggest increase in the country's military expenditure since the end of the Cold War". He has also committed to "[spending] more than 2% of the country's gross domestic product on the military". This means more money for the military and less money for climate mitigation and green transformation. The military and climate catastrophe The money being swallowed into the Western military establishments does not only drift away from any climate spending but also promotes greater climate catastrophe. The US military is the largest institutional polluter on the planet. The maintenance of its more than 800 military bases around the world, for instance, means that the US military HYPERLINK https://worldbeyondwar.org/climate-collapse-and-the-responsibility-of-the-military/ consumes about 1.5 million litres of oil daily. In 2021, the world's governments HYPERLINK https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2022/world-military-expenditure-passes-2-trillion-first-time#:~:text=(Stockholm%2C%2025%20April%202022),2021%2C%20to%20reach%20%242113%20billion. spent $2-trillion on weapons, with the leading countries being those who are the richest (as well as the most sanctimonious on the climate debate). Money is available for war but not to deal with the climate catastrophe. The way weapons have poured into the Ukraine conflict gives many of us pause. The prolongation of that war has https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/06/13/climate-disasters-collide-with-ukraine-war-deepen-hunger-crisis/ placed 49 million more people at risk of famine in 46 countries, HYPERLINK https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cc0364en/ according to the Hunger Hotspots report by the United Nations agencies, as a result of the extreme weather conditions and conflicts.\~ Conflict and organised violence were the main sources of food insecurity in Africa and the Middle East, specifically in northern Nigeria, central Sahel, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, Yemen and Syria.\~ The war in Ukraine has exacerbated the food crisis by driving up the price of agricultural commodities. Russia and Ukraine together account for about 30% of the global wheat trade. So, the longer the Ukraine war continues, the more hunger hotspots will grow, taking food insecurity beyond just Africa and the Middle East. One COP meeting has already taken place on the African continent and another will take place later this year. Abidjan (C\'f4te d'Ivoire) hosted the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in May and Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt) will host the UN Climate Change Conference from 6 to 18 November. These are major forums for African states to put on the table the great damage done to parts of the continent by the climate catastrophe. When the representatives of the countries of the world gather at Sharm el-Sheikh for COP27 , they will hear Western representatives talk about climate change, make pledges and then do everything possible to continue to exacerbate the catastrophe. What we saw in Bonn is a prelude to what will be a fiasco in Sharm el-Sheikh.

More rich nations keen to support just transition The government is confident it will be able to secure more funding from developed countries to support its R1.5-trillion development plans linked to climate change. Forestry, fisheries & environmental affairs minister Barbara Creecy briefed the media on Tuesday on some of the important outcomes for SA and other African countries at the UN's COP27 climate conference. Creecy said she had some bilateral meetings with developed countries that were interested in supporting SA's just transition.

WHILE the government appears to be making strides to deal with the unfolding climate crisis, environmental groups believe it is deceptive because fossil fuel companies have released a stream of oil and gas application documents for public comment in South Africa after the conclusion of COP27 . The groups said they hoped to raise the alarm and create widespread public awareness that the government and the oil and gas industry were not taking the climate crisis seriously, as efforts to further explore for and extract offshore oil and gas were ramped up. Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe said that in June this year, the International Energy Agency published the Africa Energy Outlook report which projected an increase in energy demand for Africa, and which acknowledged gas as critical primary energy source for South Africa to meet this demand while on the just transition journey.  The report further projects Africa\' s domestic demand for oil and gas to account for around two thirds of the continent\' s production between now and 2030, Mantashe said. Participants protesting at a Total petrol station in Paarden Eiland said there were other ways to develop energy and create job opportunities than relying on the same old destructive methods of 60 years ago. Greenpeace member Jeanne-Marie Klopper said:  We are supposed to be progressing as a society. There are other, better, safer and more cost-effective ways to go about this. We are here to protect the ocean not only for ourselves and the dolphins, whales and other marine life, but also for future generations. Extinction Rebellion (XR) Cape Town member Jacqui Tooke said they joined the campaign to oppose the exploration of oil and gas in South Africa, and believed it was going to lead to the destruction of oceans and livelihoods of coastal communities. Green Connection community outreach co-ordinator Neville van Rooy said:  The world is in a climate crisis, which means we should be making moves to cancel all fossil fuels. We believe that all applications for new projects should be stopped and that companies like TotalEnergies should instead invest their huge profits to transition away from fossil fuels. \</doc>

THICK END OF THE WEDGE Let's not kid ourselves. SA is no emissions babe in the woods Environment minister Barbara Creecy has become the latest in a string of voices calling on the industrialised West to fund the decarbonisation of the developing world. President Cyril Ramaphosa did much the same at and before COP27 last week in Sharm el-Sheikh. The SA left generally blames the West for causing global warming in the first place. Therefore, it is something the West should pay to fix. What could be more obvious? Creecy, also at COP27 , suggested not only that the West should provide climate change aid through a loss/damage mechanism, but also that multilateral development banks - I presume she meant the World Bank, the IMF and a range of sovereign and regional development banks - ought to be recapitalised to provide more finance to the developing world, what used to be called the Third World. She said India and China should be exempt from these new obligations as they are still developing countries. I have a little sympathy for her view, but also some questions. In SA, for instance, the sixth biggest carbon polluter in the world, the General Electric Power Company, built the first coal-fired power station in Germiston in 1898, 124 years ago. Eskom built its first coal-fired power stations, Congella in Durban and Salt River in Cape Town, in 1928. Even then the world was aware of the damage carbon pollution would do. Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish scientist, predicted that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could raise earth surface temperatures dramatically. In 1938 Guy Callendar, an English steam engineer, calculated that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would warm the planet but thought it might be a good thing as it would melt glaciers in northern Europe and make more land available for farming. So, though we have been using coal power in SA for well over a century and commissioned nearly 10GW of coal power just over a decade ago (it doesn't work properly, but that doesn't count) the West should still pay? Obviously, that long ago SA was burning coal mainly to power the mining industry, and the big beneficiaries were mine owners. But the inescapable fact is that when this country became a democracy its industrial economy, which the ANC is now scrambling, ineffectively, to recreate, had been built entirely on coal-fired power and was largely intact. There were no complaints then. The ANC took over control of arguably the most sophisticated energy system in the southern hemisphere. By 1994, Eskom had not borrowed a single cent from the state. It had been entirely self-financed, mainly through the issuance of its own bonds, which were wildly popular in fixed interest markets around the world. Since then the ANC has broken virtually the entire industrial edifice it inherited, Eskom included. Had it taken more care it would today be more than capable of financing its own decarbonisation. I remember being asked to speak at a KwaZulu-Natal government investment conference in about 2004 in Pietermaritzburg, and I clearly remember saying: "Please take care of what you already have." People applauded, but no-one listened. I guess few revolutions take their prizes intact. The ANC did, and then it destroyed them. Is the West really to blame for the grand-scale stupidity we present in SA? The hypocrisy in Creecy's remarks extends to China. Before any ANC elective conference, such as we look forward to in December, the ANC holds a policy conference. At that meeting the party prepares various policy papers and the ones on foreign policy are almost always carbon copies of each other. I remember one in particular congratulating China for lifting so many millions of its people out of poverty. But that achievement was driven solely by Chinese coal-fired energy. China is not only the second most powerful economy on earth. It builds its own sophisticated fighter jets, its own high-speed trains. If this is a developing economy then black is white. More than any big polluter, the Chinese have polluted the most, most recently. Between 1750 - roughly the start of the industrial revolution in the UK - and 2017, the US emitted 457-billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, the combined EU 353-billion tonnes, Russia 101-billion tonnes, China (which only started industrialising 70 years ago) 200-billion tonnes, India 48-billion tonnes and SA 20-billion tonnes, more than South Korea, Australia, Brazil and Mexico, all bigger economies than ours. The need to decarbonise now falls on all emitters, us included, and it is way too late to turn this too into a battle between rich and poor countries. In African countries that never used coal and have suffered from poor electricity availability for a very long time, the solution is thankfully new and relatively cheap renewable energy. They don't have to shut down power plants and change power grids like we do. And the West will be falling over itself to finance the introduction of that new power. No-one is going to give SA free money though. We will have to borrow. Ramaphosa reckons we will need R1.5-trillion to meet our climate-change goals. That's actually not a lot, and plenty of money will be available at soft rates. We're a sophisticated economy with an incapable government. We need to get capable, and before we start playing the victim and blame game, we should take responsibility for what we have done to ourselves.

COP27 Now let\' s move to what\' s happening at the conference just across the Peninsula and check out exactly what it is pursuing. Mother Earth used to have a great balance. It had a habit of cooling down during the night after an exhausting hot day and returning all that heat back to outer space. Everybody was very happy for billions of years, including penguins and polar bears. But man suddenly appeared and discovered oxygen, fire, Sikh-Kabab, Ford motor cars, General Electric fridges and a whole Massmart of other appliances that emitted excessive amounts of the evil carbon dioxide. What then is this meeting all about? In between a grand spread of a buffet breakfast till 10am. Tea at 11.30am, lunch at 2pm, the closing of shop at 4.30pm (3pm on Fridays) and free weekends to fly \- fully paid \- to ride camels and gape at the olden-day assault on the atmosphere \- the hundred years building \- and plan for the awesome pyramids. In between, some discussions will be seen to be done. And on the last day, a grim-faced chairperson will sum up:  Yes, folks, things are really bad. The waters are really rising, far worse than Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner\' s days. We have got to do something. Just use less coal. Manufacture fewer petrol-driven cars. More battery driven. These batteries don\' t need charging. They use solar power and windmills. Don\' t slaughter cows. Use their dung as fertiliser. Tell the wife to set the dinner table on the floor. No more chopping trees for oak furniture. Stop using air conditioners. Use Harem girls waving palm leaves as fans. Far sexier. Have a safe journey home. All the best. Till next time. \</doc>

Russia sticks to its commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, but sanctions are holding Moscow back from faster implementation and more ambitious goals, Ruslan Edelgeriyev, Russian special presidential envoy for climate, said yesterday.  At present, we stand by the commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060. However, Russia could achieve carbon neutrality at a faster pace if there were no double standards and discrimination, Edelgeriyev said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 broadcaster on the sidelines of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). Under the agreement, countries agreed to contribute to keeping average global temperature rise below 2\'b0C and as close as possible to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial level by the end of the century. The EU, the US and Japan pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, Russia and China by 2060 and India by 2070. Yesterday, EU member states reached an agreement with MEPs on how to share out the effort of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The union plans to cut emissions from road transport, building heating, farming, light industry and waste management by 40% by 2030, compared to their level in 1990. But not all member states will face the same targets. These targets vary depending on a member state\' s GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of the cuts it is proposing. The lowest goal is a 10% reduction in the targeted sectors for Bulgaria, while Denmark, Germany, Finland and Sweden must bring their emissions down by half. There will also be a system for trading emissions allowances between member states and countries that exceed annual targets can save unused allowances for later years.  The new rules for national emission cuts ensure that all member states contribute and that existing loopholes are closed, said MEP Jessica Polfjard. The EU climate plan aims to slash all emissions, across all sectors, by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990. More than 44 000 people are attending the climate conference which runs until November 18. | \</doc>

Cabinet says the deliberations at the G20 Leaders' Summit underpin the country's own national priorities of reducing poverty, unemployment and inequality. The summit brought together world leaders in a collective effort to find solutions to a wide range of global challenges. 'The envisaged solutions include increasing multilateral cooperation for the recovery of the global economy, to bring stability to the global financial system, to promote long-term sustainable growth and to strengthen global economic governance,' Minister in The Presidency, Mondli Gungubele, said during a media briefing on Friday on the outcomes of this week's Cabinet meeting. The theme of the summit held under the G20 Presidency of Indonesia was 'Recover Together, Recover Stronger'. President Ramaphosa participated in the working sessions on health, food and energy security as well as held several bilateral meetings with key trade partners. Support for 1.5 degree Celsius target Meanwhile, Cabinet has voiced its support for the calls made at the COP27 currently underway in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, for countries to remain on track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 'Our support for the 1.5 degree Celsius target is of utmost importance to South Africa as an African and developing country that is highly vulnerable to environmental, social and economic effects of climate change,' Gungubele said. Cabinet further endorsed the Africa group position to call on developed countries to honour their pledges and commitments made under both the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement. Exercise caution during rainy conditions Meanwhile, Cabinet has called on the public to exercise caution during unfavourable weather conditions, particularly thunderstorms. Gungubele said government and the South African Weather Service will continue to provide information on severe weather based on current observations and predictions. 'People are advised not to walk, swim or drive through fast-moving flood water. Do not try to cross a flooded area because you could be swept away by the strong currents. 'Always ensure that your children are safe and they are able to travel safely,' Gungubele said. -SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

COP27 may take place against a different news background this year given the conflict in the Ukraine and the fuel crisis in Europe, but the agenda has not changed. With global temperatures rising to record-breaking levels, the need for meaningful progress at this year's UN climate conference has never been greater.\~ Across Africa, the accelerating climate emergency is jeopardising food security, driving more people into hunger and starvation. As the Horn of Africa continues to battle a four-year long drought, one person dies of hunger every 36 seconds. Although the African continent contributes the least to climate change, it will be disproportionately affected by its effects. By 2021, the HYPERLINK https://www.fao.org/home/en Food and Agriculture Organization A recent survey, conducted by Savanta Comres and commissioned by Vodafone, estimates that 94% of farmers in Africa surveyed across Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania and Egypt said that recent droughts had impacted the viability of their farming. In Egypt and Kenya, this figure rose to almost 100%. Despite these challenges, the survey found that pockets of farmers in Africa were optimistic about the future. To a large extent, this optimism is rooted in the potential offered by digital farming technology. From reducing the use of fertiliser to increasing profit margins, technology can play a central role in boosting the resilience, productivity and sustainability of our food systems.\~ Many of these farmers said that digital technology could help farming succeed in the future and they intended to invest more. The research also found that some of these farmers are already employing digital tools to help reduce their water usage and to improve soil health, among other uses. This kind of technology adoption is key to both economic development and the mitigation of climate change for farmers in Africa. Connected Farmer - developed by Mezzanine, a tech start-up, with support and scale provided by Vodacom - serves as a prime example of this. The digital platform allows smallholder farmers to engage with a broader customer base, seek advice, access important information and even secure credit.\~ Meanwhile in South Africa, Vodacom's Women Farmers Programme is making agriculture more accessible and profitable for women by teaching them how to use apps to connect to potential customers and unlock enormous economic opportunity.\~ In Kenya, DigiFarm leverages mobile and digital technology to offer farmers one-stop access to a suite of products, including financial and credit services, quality farm products and customised information on farming best practices, all from the most basic phone. Vodacom Tanzania's M-Kulima platform provides a digital marketplace where farmers can list their produce, enabling them to connect directly with buyers without any need for an intermediary. And in Egypt, the venue for this year's iteration of COP27 , Vodafone is empowering local communities through agricultural guidance services via mobile.\~ However, despite the clear benefits of technology in Africa's farming sector - and farmers' enthusiasm for it - they face significant barriers. The cost and availability of devices, poor mobile coverage or fixed connectivity, and the lack of digital skills impede adoption. Farmers in Africa want help and support from the government. However, it's not just about money. Farmers in Africa are also calling for training on how to use digital solutions, and for better mobile and fixed internet connectivity.\~ We all have a responsibility to ensure that farmers in Africa are supported to adopt digital technology. How can we go about it? We need to ensure access to digital devices and smartphones to drive innovative, resilient and climate-proof farming in Africa. In 2022, over 2.3 million of Vodacom's low-cost smart feature phones were sold - testament to the demand and need for more affordable handsets. With this in mind, policymakers should consider reducing or removing import duties and taxes to accelerate smartphone adoption in Africa, which would support the economic inclusion of many, including farming communities. At the same time, policy and regulatory reforms must incentivise investment in critical digital infrastructure to ensure that farmers receive the connectivity they so desperately need. Governments should also prioritise reliable network coverage and ubiquitous digital infrastructure to allow for efficient data transmission. Finally, we must transform restrictive regulatory policies and practices around digital, cloud and data services. These hamper the growth of Africa's digital economy. By creating an enabling regulatory environment that supports the secure flow of data between countries through innovations such as cloud computing, farmers will have the opportunity to access the critical agricultural insights they need to farm more effectively.\~ The war in the Ukraine and disruption caused by Covid-19 have exacerbated an already dire food security picture. But the underlying and long-term threat remains climate change. It is critical that we get technology into the hands of farmers in Africa to ensure they are well placed to face this existential threat. A coherent policy platform implemented by governments and industry can help farmers adopt and create an innovative, climate-proof farming sector in Africa. If we do that, we can help ensure long-term food security across the African continent.\~ - Shameel Joosub is CEO of Vodacom The post HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/special-reports/2022-11-15-empowering-farmers-in-africa-to-farm-smarter/ Empowering farmers in Africa to farm smarter appeared first on HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za The Mail & Guardian \</doc>

Government - together with its international partners - is focusing on developing a comprehensive South African-led investment plan that maps out investments required to achieve a just energy transition and help guide the use of funds. This is according to the Head of the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team, Daniel Mminele, who - together with the United Kingdom's COP26 Envoy and Chair of the International Partners Group, John Murton - hosted a joint media briefing in Pretoria to provide an update on the work underway to finalise the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). 'We are also focused on reaching an agreement on the financing package that both meets our investment needs and aligns with our fiscal framework. Intensive work is currently underway on both these areas and our aim is to finalise an investment plan in time for COP27 in November 2022 as a target,' Mminele said on Wednesday. Through the Political Declaration issued in November 2021 to establish this partnership, the United Kingdom - together with the European Union, France, Germany, and the United States -undertook to mobilise an initial amount of $8.5 billion over the next three to five years to support the achievement of South Africa's ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). PHOTOS | 'In the engagements that we have had with the international partners thus far... there is a shared recognition of the need to ensure that the financing packages approved are appropriately structured to support South Africa's climate ambitions and priorities. 'We have made it clear that the financing instruments should reflect South Africa's unique needs, fiscal challenges and incorporate appropriate and equitable risk sharing arrangements,' Mminele said. This includes ensuring that the terms of any loan finance should be significantly more attractive than could be secured in the capital markets. 'It is also crucial that we prioritise job creation and ensure that no person is left behind in this process. The investment plan will identify critical projects that will be initiated before COP27 as well a longer-term portfolio of projects, both of which will foreground the need for a just transition and support for affected workers and communities,' Mminele said. In addition, the partnership recognises the need for long-term cooperation to mobilise an initial amount of $8.5 billion over the next three to five years to support the achievement of South Africa's ambitious NDC. The meeting held on Tuesday reflected on the progress made since COP26 in advancing the JETP as a ground-breaking initiative to enable South Africa's transition to a low carbon economy and a climate resilient society. The COP President and Ministers underlined their shared commitment to a just transition that protects affected workers and communities as a key priority of the partnership, and to supporting opportunities for innovation and quality jobs including in the green hydrogen and electric vehicle sectors. As committed to in the Political Declaration, the South African Presidential Climate Finance Task Team (PCFTT) and the International Partners Group (IPG) outlined the progress made towards the creation of an enabling policy environment to support South Africa's NDC, including the tabling of a Climate Change Bill in Parliament and reforms underway in the electricity sector. In addition progress was outlined on the finalisation of the Hydrogen Economy Roadmap, the Renewable Energy Masterplan and the development of a just transition framework through the Presidential Climate Commission. \</doc>

FORMER US president Donald Trump has lambasted his country\' s government for adopting questionable global reforms on energy, which he said threatened the economic stability of their nation insofar as energy security was concerned. He was addressing his Republican Party supporters at the launch of his campaign to run for president in 2024. Once elected, his first mission, he said, was to reverse energy deals that his successor President Joe Biden made to align with what has been termed the Just Energy Transition Partnership involving a number of countries, including South Africa. Countries like France, Germany, the UK, US and EU have promised to pump billions of dollars into South Africa\' s energy move from coal. South Africa has so far receieved a R10.7 billion loan from France and Germany. According to AfricaNews.com, seven European countries recently increased their import of South African coal.  The Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Denmark, France, Italy and Ukraine are among European countries importing growing quantities of coal from South Africa.  In the first five months of this year, European countries imported more than 3 million tons of coal from South Africa. This is over 40% more than the total volume in 2021. The figures from South Africa\' s Richards Bay Coal Terminal showed it delivered 3 240 752 tons of coal to European countries by end-May, said the site. On Wednesday, Trump told his supporters that America should not allow politics to render it poor.  Just as I promised in 2016, I am your voice. The Washington establishment wants to silence us, but we will not let them do that  Trump emphasised that the US had turned into a beggar when it is blessed with natural resources that are not being used.  There are lots of nations that hate us gravely, and that\' s the problem when they look at us in disarray like we are right now. When we go to them begging for oil and we have more liquid gold under our feet than they have, or any other nation has, and we don\' t use it because we are going to them? The EFF recently criticised President Cyril Ramaphosa for making commitments to transition South Africa from its coal use to renewable energy while the rest of the world still largely relied on coal. Last week, Ramaphosa committed South Africa to transitioning from coal at the 2022 Conference of Parties, or COP27 summit, held at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. \</doc>

MAWANDE AMASHABALALAThe cabinet has come out in full support of talks between countries to reduce carbon emissions and go green. This two days after energy minister Gwede Mantashe warned in parliament that South Africa must not be "pressured" to move towards renewable energy and abandon coal. President Cyril Ramaphosa recently attended the COP27 climate change conference in Egypt. Minister in the presidency Mondli Gungubele on Friday said the cabinet was calling for "countries to remain on track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the global temperature rise". "Cabinet also endorsed the Africa group position to call on developed countries to honour their pledges and commitments made under both the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement. These include a call for developed countries to take the lead on reducing emissions and providing developing countries with financial resources for their own climate action." The cabinet position is in stark contrast to Mantashe's determination to continue with coal as the baseload energy producer in the country. The minister believes South Africa can draw lessons from developed countries where attempts to venture into renewable energy have stumbled. He particularly mentioned Germany, which is among those funding and advocating for South Africa to abandon fossil fuels while they have gone back to coal. Mantashe told a National Assembly plenary on Wednesday: "My view is that if there is confusion of an entity [Eskom] about what it should do because it is under pressure to go green, then we are going to be in darkness. Mantashe said it was unfair to expect South Africa to abandon coal. "I am one of the people who say we can have a transition but that coal is not just about numbers, it is about human beings. So if you just talk recklessly about that, you are going to leave many people in darkness and starving." -TimesLIVE Mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe believes South Africa can draw lessons from developed countries where attempts to venture into renewable energy have stumbled.& xA0;File photo.ESA ALEXANDER / SUNDAY TIMES \</doc>

According to a new report from the US-based Health Effects Institute (HEI), several African countries experience some of the highest levels of air pollution in the world. The State of Air Quality and Health Impacts in Africa report provides an analysis of major air pollution sources and related health impacts on the continent. Released just before the UN s upcoming COP27 Climate Change Conference in Egypt, the report finds that air pollution is the second leading risk factor for death across the continent. Africa is home to five of the top ten most heavily polluted countries worldwide in terms of outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5).Outdoor PM2.5 is the most consistent predictor of deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, and other diseases in studies of long-term exposure to air pollution. In 2019, air pollution contributed to an estimated 1.1 million deaths in Africa, with 63% linked to exposure to household air pollution (HAP).<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/628/228020.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/628/228020.html :EMBED-->Impacts of air pollution on childrenAccess to clean energy across Africa is not equitably distributed, leading to larger disease burdens in certain areas. Across East, West, Central, and Southern Africa, an estimated 75% of the population relies on burning solid fuels such as coal, wood, and charcoal for cooking, exposing residents to high concentrations of harmful pollutants at home every day.Newborns and children under five years old in these regions are at a particularly high risk from household air pollution linked to use of solid fuels for cooking. About 236,000 newborns die within the first month of life from air pollution exposure, with 80% of those coming from HAP. In 2019, 14% of all deaths in children under five across Africa were linked to air pollution. The impacts on newborns and infants also have long-term consequences for overall health, including issues with lung development and increased susceptibility to communicable diseases such as lower respiratory infections in young children.Caradee Wright, chief specialist scientist with the South African Medical Research Council, said, This report gives evidence of the substantial threat air pollution poses to the health, and even life, of babies and children under the age of 5 years. This vulnerable group needs special attention to mitigate their exposures, for example, through policy and intensive awareness campaigns with practical solutions for mothers and caregivers. Air pollution sources across the continentIn Africa, PM2.5 comes from many of the same sources found elsewhere in the world, including use of solid fuels for cooking, fossil fuel use (coal, oil, and gas) for energy production, vehicles, industrial and semi-industrial activities like artisanal mining, agriculture, forest fires, and open waste fire pits. In parts of Africa, windblown dust, a natural source of air pollution, is also a major contributor to PM2.5 levels.Air pollution sources and related health impacts can vary widely across the continent. By region, Western Africa experiences the highest PM2.5 pollution with an average concentration of 64.1 g/m3, while Southern Africa has the lowest at 26.5 g/m3. In Southern Africa, use of fossil fuels contributes as much as 41% of the total outdoor PM2.5 levels, whereas in Eastern Africa, the contribution is only 11%.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/220/703/228297.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/220/703/228297.html :EMBED-->Targeted actions are beginning, more neededWhile air pollution levels are high, countries across Africa are implementing a wide range of programmes to lower the impacts of air pollution. So far, 17 countries in Africa have established some national air quality policies, and many have included action on air pollution sources, especially household air pollution, as part of their country s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).In 2019, Africa had one of the lowest energy access rates in the world, with fewer than one in 20 people living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Niger, Uganda, and Tanzania having access to clean fuels for cooking. At the same time, a scarcity of ground-level air quality monitoring stations means countries are not able to accurately track their progress towards meeting air quality objectives and standards.Dr Patrick de Marie Katoto of the Catholic University of Bukavu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, said, Air pollution greatly contributes to the rising frequency of chronic noncommunicable diseases in Africa, putting further strain on a health system already stretched by chronic infectious diseases and, more recently, Covid-19."These findings call for the African Union and member states to promote, plan, and fund air quality interventions to prevent unnecessary disabilities and deaths throughout the continent. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/628/226206.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/628/226206.html :EMBED-->Key connections between air pollution and climateAs the world s nations convene next month in Egypt for the COP27 climate meetings, Africa will consider how energy transitions can be designed to be efficient, economically feasible, sustainable, and environmentally friendly a complex challenge that requires a nuanced conversation at the nexus of energy, climate, air quality, and health.Countries in the African Union have also adopted the Agenda 2063, a continent-wide programme that lays out a strategic framework designed to deliver on its goal for inclusive and sustainable development for all residents by the year 2063. Meeting these challenges head-on will bring dual benefits of public health improvements and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across Africa.This report is released in coordination with a new report from the Clean Air Fund that examines how action on air pollution could free up billions of dollars, prevent thousands of deaths, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% by 2040.Read the full report here. \</doc>

Africa is getting just 12% of the finance it needs to manage the impact of climate change, a report on Thursday, 11 August, said, raising pressure on rich nations to do more in the run-up to global climate talks in November. Around $250bn is needed annually to help African countries move to greener technologies and adapt to the effects of climate change, yet funding in 2020 was just $29.5bn, according to a report by the Climate Policy Initiative.Wealthy countries have faced growing criticism for failing to meet a pledge made in 2009 to provide $100bn annually to help poorer countries and the issue is likely to be central to discussions at the COP27 climate talks in Egypt.Africa has about a fifth of the world's population, but produces less than 3% of its carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency."Harnessing climate investment opportunities in Africa will require innovation in financing structures and strategic deployment of public capital to 'crowd-in' private investment at levels not yet seen," the CPI report said.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/410/702/229937.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/410/702/229937.html :EMBED-->Barriers to climate investmentIt cited a lack of skills, infrastructure, data and financial markets depth, governance issues and currency risks as holding back climate investment to varying degrees in African countries.The barriers were most numerous in central African countries where infrastructure and access to credit is lacking and there are high risks of political and regulatory issues hampering investment, the report said."While these barriers are real, the perception of risk linked to investments in the African continent is often aggravated by a limited understanding of national contexts by private investors," it said."(This) may end up steering their capital toward other markets perceived as safer hence missing potentially profitable investments opportunities." \</doc>

The right of African countries to use their natural gas reserves should be reflected in any deal at the COP27 climate talks, the president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) told Reuters, even as some nations push to see use of the fuel curtailed. Agreeing a deal on fossil fuels is among the key sticking points at the talks, with some countries including India keen to phase down the use of all such fuels, including gas, sources said.A preliminary document from the conference hosts arrived late on Monday and made no mention of fossil fuels. While it forms the basis of any agreement, the all-important final wording has yet to be hammered out."Africa must have natural gas to complement its renewable energy," AfDB president Akinwumi Adesina said Friday on the sidelines of the UN conference, being held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.Even if Africa were to triple its production of natural gas from current levels, its contribution to global emissions would only rise by 0.67%, he said.With the world currently on course to miss its climate goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0 Celsius above the pre-industrial average by mid-century, one focus at the conference has been on countries accelerating their shift to renewable energy.The AfDB is seeking to raise $25bn through the African Adaptation Acceleration Programme - the biggest created by any comparable lender, Adesina said. It has also put 85% of its investments between 2016-2021 into renewable energy.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/647/232929.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/647/232929.html :EMBED-->Balancing out the electricity supplyStill, natural gas is needed to balance out the electricity supply given the intermittent nature of renewables, he said."We must recognise the special nature of Africa. Africa has the highest level of energy poverty in the world," Adesina said."My interest is how Africa uses natural gas as part of its energy mix to provide electricity for 600 million people today that don't have access to electricity."Since the industrial revolution, developed countries have emitted around 2,400 gigatonnes of climate-damaging carbon emissions, leaving only around 400 gigatonnes left if the world wants to hit its temperature goal, Adesina said."And so Africa, that did not really emit, should not now be penalised for not even being able to use a little bit of gas to complement its natural resources." \</doc>

In the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, leaders from across the world are gathering to negotiate over carbon emissions \- for the 27th consecutive time. Although this year\' s UN Climate Change Conference \- known as COP27 \- will be in a new setting, in many other ways the conference will probably feel like deja vu. For almost three decades, governments have met to discuss the problem of climate change and tried to work toward a solution that will keep global warming from topping 2\'b0C. They have negotiated, signed treaties, reneged on the treaties and signed new ones. And almost every year, carbon emissions have continued to climb. In 1995, when the first UN climate conference was held in Berlin, the countries of the world released approximately 23 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning coal, oil and natural gas. This year, that number is expected to be about 34 billion tons. Roughly half of all CO2 emitted since 1751, just before the start of the Industrial Revolution, was released in just the past 30 years. It\' s hard to look at those numbers and see the international climate response as anything less than a failure. As global emissions climb, is the system working? David Victor, a professor of public policy at the University of California at San Diego, says the answer depends.  If by \' working,\' you mean that the global negotiations themselves are producing the change, the answer is no, he said. But, he argues, that was never the right way to judge the effectiveness of international policymaking on climate. Part of that is because the Paris agreement \- the landmark accord reached in 2015 to try to limit global warming to  well below 2\'b0C and to aim for 1.5\'b0C \- has always been a strange sort of treaty. Before the agreement, most people thought the best way to combat climate change on the world stage was to get everyone to sign on to binding emissions reductions. But that never caught on: Many countries, including the US, refused to agree to mandatory emissions reductions. For decades, global climate diplomacy was essentially stalled. At the conference in Paris in 2015, countries tried a different approach. They agreed to voluntarily lower their emissions, by making regular pledges known tongue-twistingly as  nationally determined contributions . There would be no universal mandates for everyone to cut emissions by a particular date \- countries could choose their adventure for how and when to stop spewing CO2 into the atmosphere. If leaders didn\' t bring more-ambitious pledges, meanwhile, they would be  named and shamed by others. In the seven years since the summit in Paris, many pledges have indeed become more ambitious. More than 70 countries, including China, the US and the EU, have set targets to slash their emissions to zero by 2050. If all the pledges are followed through on \- a humongous  if \- the world will warm by approximately 2.1\'b0C by 2100. (That\' s if countries follow through on their long-term goals; if they follow through on only the short-term goals for 2030, a recent UN report found the world would warm by 2.4\'b0C.) Both the estimates are a far cry from 1.5\'b0C \- the  stretch goal set out in the Paris agreement \- but they\' re also much better than previous projections, which predicted warming of 3\'b0C or even 4\'b0C. Victor says the benefit of the Paris framework is that it allows more flexibility; countries can be as ambitious as they want to be, while also experimenting and forming smaller agreements to tackle specific aspects of the problem. For example, world leaders can join in a vow to decrease emissions of methane, a strong greenhouse gas, in the short term, or collaborate on a promise to push forward electric vehicle adoption. The downside, of course, is that none of the targets is binding. Beyond setting up the pledges, COP27 There is also another issue that has yet to be worked out. When almost 200 nations agreed to the Paris framework in 2015, they did so under the promise that rich, developed countries would send money to poorer, developing countries \- to help them build clean energy and to adapt to rising sea levels and climate-supercharged weather events. But so far, much of the money \- including $100 billion every year that was promised by rich countries \- has not materialised. Countries such as Pakistan, which recently faced devastating floods that scientists say were exacerbated by climate change, have also begun to push developed countries to provide compensation for damage caused by warming temperatures. However, rich countries have refused to play ball. That battle is poised to be one of the biggest issues at the upcoming meeting in Egypt. For years, negotiations over this part of the agreement have been shunted to the side in favour of carbon-cutting pledges. But developing countries are getting frustrated and impatient. That discussion will be top-of-mind for many negotiators in Egypt. Even if the ambitious pledges part of the Paris agreement is working, the process could unravel if cash doesn\' t come through as promised. Developing countries  will always want to bring the spotlight back to this issue, Oppenheimer said.  It\' ll clog up the works \- and then there won\' t be international progress.

The climate crisis is a story of rich countries polluting and everyone on Earth paying the price. Because of self-interest and corrupt political systems, the pollution has not decreased, despite half a century of scientists' warnings of catastrophe - and 28 years of international climate negotiations.\~ In Paris, in 2015, about 200 countries agreed to do what they could to keep global heating to under 2\'b0C. It has already warmed by 1.1\'b0C, with devastating consequences for places like Pakistan, where recent floods killed 1 700 people and did $40-billion of damage.\~ Large parts of HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-01-over-100-dead-in-nigeria-floods/ Nigeria flooded last month, while Somalia is experiencing near-famine conditions.\~ Paris was the product of rich countries demanding that the world's focus be on reducing emissions. HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/opinion/2022-10-03-africa-is-the-recipient-of-collateral-damage-in-the-politics-of-climate-change-wrangling/ Developing countries, which pollute very little , want equal focus to be on the damage being done as the world heats - and on adapting to this heating world. This argument is labelled as "loss and damage" in climate negotiations.\~ For the next two weeks, African countries and their peers working together in the G77 group of countries, plan to put pressure on rich countries to pay up. The Egyptian official who heads this round of COP has talked of restoring the "grand bargain" in which rich countries pay for the damage they have done. In Libreville, Gabon, and Dakar, Senegal, earlier this year, African climate ministers agreed to be far more assertive in their demands. At COP27 , they will demand that, at the very least, rich countries hand over the $100-billion a year they promised over a decade ago. What they're up against is that any demands for money to help adapt to climate change are met with accusations that this will water down efforts to reduce emissions and so ensure a more deadly future. Last month, the United Nations warned that the world's combined effort on reducing emissions is "woefully insufficient" and heating will reach 2.4\'b0C.

Programme Director, Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Ms Patricia De Lille, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, Premier of the Western Cape, Mr Alan Winde, Premier of the Northern Cape, Dr Zamani Saul, Mr Till Mansmann, the Innovation Commissioner for Green Hydrogen at the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany, Executive Mayor of Cape Town, Geordin Hill-Lewis, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the inaugural South Africa Green Hydrogen Summit. This summit builds on a foundation laid by the Sustainable Infrastructure Development Symposium of 2021, which highlighted South Africa's potential as a global exporter of green energy. This Green Hydrogen Summit is taking place soon after the conclusion of the UN Climate Change Conference - or COP 27 - at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. These gatherings of world leaders are becoming ever more important and urgent given the devastation caused by the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather occurrences. Low- and middle-income countries are most affected by these weather events, but are least equipped to adapt to the effects of climate change. We therefore welcome the commitment at COP 27 to establish a fund to address climate damage suffered by developing economies. South Africa used the platform of COP 27 to elaborate on our just green transition. We recently released for public comment a Just Energy Transition Investment Plan as the basis for our pathway towards a low-carbon and climate resilient society. According to the Plan, South Africa will need approximately $98 billion over the next five years to enable a just transition and achieve our ambitious emissions reduction targets. Green hydrogen is identified in the Investment Plan as one of the four 'big frontiers' of a just energy transition, indicating that it has huge growth and investment potential. Globally, the demand for green hydrogen and green hydrogen-based products, such as ammonia and synthetic jet fuels, is rising significantly. This presents a unique opportunity for South Africa to link its mineral endowment with its renewable energy endowment to drive industrialisation. At the same, it will create jobs, attract investment, bring development to rural provinces and support a just transition from fossil fuels. This Summit is an opportunity to tell the South African story in this rapidly growing sector. South Africa is not new to the green hydrogen conversation. The Department of Science and Innovation has been leading research and innovation in green hydrogen in South Africa since 2007 through Hydrogen South Africa. This was motivated in part by the potential impact that the transition away from the internal combustion engine to battery electric vehicles would have on the country's platinum mining industry. Together, South Africa and Zimbabwe hold over 90 per cent of the world's known platinum group metal reserves. Since 30 to 40 per cent of the supply goes into the production of catalytic converters for internal combustion vehicles, the initial focus of the research was on hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles as an alternative market to the internal combustion engine vehicle. South Africa has existing and future potential to produce green hydrogen. It is estimated that South Africa has the potential to produce 6 to 13 million tons of green hydrogen and derivatives a year by 2050. To do so would require between 140 and 300 gigawatts of renewable energy. The focus would be on green hydrogen exports, electrolyser and fuel cell production, and the manufacture of green steel, sustainable aviation fuel, ammonia, fertilizers and renewable energy components. South Africa is an investment destination of choice. The country has proven itself as a gateway to a dynamic continent with great prospects. Africa is growing its output, is rapidly urbanising and has a young population. South Africa leads the continent in advanced manufacturing, science and technology. This country is a favourable, reliable and stable place to conduct business. We are driving regulatory and legislative reform to make our economy more competitive, to attract more investment and to create more jobs. South Africa has many inherent advantages that make it internationally competitive in the production of green hydrogen. These include a world class endowment of both onshore wind and solar irradiation. South Africa has a supportive legislative environment and experience in the deployment of renewable energy with the largest installed capacity of wind and solar power projects on the African continent. Companies like Sasol and PetroSA have expertise in the production of syn\£cthetic fuels like diesel, petrol and kerosene, as well as a range of chemical products. South Africa already produces 2.4 million tons of grey hydrogen for domestic consumption. Last year at the Sustainable Infrastructure Development Symposium, we began to profile the remarkable work that a number of large and emerging South African companies were doing in the green hydrogen sector. These include the Boegoebaai Port and Rail project. Sasol and the Northern Cape provincial government have made significant progress on the master plan for a green hydrogen special economic zone, which aims to support 40 gigawatts of electrolyser capacity by 2050. This would require approximately 80 gigawatts of renewable energy, which is almost double South Africa's current installed electricity generation capacity. Transnet has issued a request for proposals for the development of the port and rail project, which could see the port developed by 2028. The Prieska Power Reserve Project, which is being led by Mahlako a Phala, a black women owned renewable energy developer, has made major progress over the last year. It has received most of the required environmental approvals and its water use licence and has brought in the Industrial Development Corporation as an equity partner. Another initiative is the development of a Hydrogen Valley that would link the three hydrogen hubs of Mogalakwena in Limpopo, Johannesburg and the Durban - Richards Bay hub. This initiative is being led by the Department of Science and Innovation and supported by Anglo American, Bambili Energy and Engie. Nine catalytic projects have been identified as part of this initiative, including the successful demonstration by Anglo American in May 2022 of the world's first, largest mine haul truck to run on hydrogen and fuel cells. The potential for South Africa to emerge as a significant player in the green hydrogen value chain is immense. We look forward to welcoming more of the firms in the green hydrogen value chain and associated technologies into our market. We hope to see these international firms partnering with South African firms as we increase our renewable energy footprint, green hydrogen manufacturing capability and local production of value added products. We are determined to make full use of our substantial endowments to meet the challenges of climate change and to achieve a just transition that benefits all our people. I wish you well in your deliberations. I thank you. \</doc>

For decades, there have been non-conclusive deliberations regarding how the international community could support poor and vulnerable countries in their efforts to cope with and recover from the havoc wreaked on their territory by the ill-effects of global warming such as severe droughts, floods, storms, or rising sea levels. At the COP27 A "transitional committee" is to be created to examine possible funding options and report to COP28, which could then, eventually, decide on the LDF's operationalization. Remembering the many press photos showing the despair written into the faces of people, whose houses and fields were destroyed by floods, or the blank stares of those sitting next to the cadavers of their cattle killed by severe drought conditions, I feel that business as usual--namely, taking it easy in delivering on funding promises (as we have seen it in the case of the $ 100 billion annual climate-finance promise) -- would be an extremely immoral and unethical behavior in the present case. Therefore, let's waste no time and start to explore where one could find money fit for the purpose of loss and damage support. In the following, I argue that only one - still to be established - source will generate on a relatively reliable and predictable manner the longer-term stream of public finance required, as a minimum, for creating a solid basis of LDF core funding. The funding source to be agreed and established as a matter of highest urgency are UN assessed contributions for climate security. Money fit for the purpose of loss and damage support Disaster may strike countries haphazardly, irrespective of whether they are poor or rich, vulnerable or not. All countries may need or, at least, somehow benefit from immediate and fast-disbursing, short-term humanitarian assistance in cash or kind. How best to organize such short-term humanitarian assistance is also an important issue that deserves more attention. However, it is an issue beyond the scope of this article. Therefore, let's now turn to the specific issue of what type of external support could be most useful for "climate victims", notably poor and vulnerable countries struggling to rebuild their communities and economies. An entity such as the newly established LDF and the money that, one day, it might have at its disposal, are governance tools. Like any other tools they should be fit for the purpose at hand. Considering for now mainly the core funding that the LDF needs to have, it should perhaps have three key characteristics, namely be: (1) public finance; (2) patient, that is, designed for the longer-term; and (3) relatively predictable in its availability. The reasons are that, typically, a country's vulnerability to severe climate events is a complex multi-dimensional phenomenon to which both structural factors (e.g., the countries geographic position and size) and non-structural factors (such as its development level) contribute. Thus, by implication, meaningful loss-and-damage support is likely to be required for several years, maybe, even for a decade or more. This should not come as a surprise, because even in developed countries rebuilding efforts have often been a lengthy process. Moreover, in the case of small-island developing countries, it could even be that parts of the population need to be resettled to start their life anew. Initially, patient, predictable public finance may constitute the most important source of funding. As the rebuilding process advances, the public funds could also play an important role in helping to mobilize other resource inflows, including private investments. Or, they could be twinned with adaptation finance and other types of climate finance, as well as official development assistance. Making the case for UN assessed contributions for climate-security, including loss and damage support By now, there exists broad-based agreement that our security today depends on more than the security of our countries' external borders and on more than the control of within-country conflicts and violence. As US President Joe Biden, noted in his statement to COP27 , military security today is only one dimension of our security, next to climate and food security; and, as COVID-19 taught us, next to global health security. The security threats we are facing are global in their reach; they tie us together in a web of manifold interdependencies. They require all hands-on deck, or no one will be secure. The United Nations Secretary-General (UNSG) is, therefore, correct in pushing for a "Climate Solidarity Pact." Thus, it is timely to ask: Why do we have, within the UN, only an established system of assessed contributions to support efforts aimed at keeping and restoring military security? Why not also assessed contributions - a solidarity-based pact - to climate security? Among the reasons that strongly speak for this financing option are several. First, such contributions could be introduced for, say, an initial period of 20 years, subject, of course, to regular monitoring of their functioning and impact. Evidently, they would provide the type of reliable and predictable long-term public finance that the LDF needs. Second, agreement on a UN funding scale for climate security would help end the present continuous tussle among countries over who should contribute how much. The UN assessment scale for determining individual countries' contributions to climate security would be based on a joint decision by member states. Besides income (capacity to pay) one would, in the present case, certainly also consider past and current per-capita emission levels and other relevant factors. Many aspects of the proposed funding source still need further \'e9laboration and consultations. However, let's start at the beginning and encourage a world-wide dialogue on the pros and cons of the following issues. Should we: (1) consider climate security, notably that of vulnerable countries, as a global security issue; and (2) grant climate security the same financing privilege that military security enjoys, namely, to benefit from assessed contributions paid by all UN member states according to a formula that aims at promoting climate security and justice?

SA's private sector is ready to fund up to R500bn of the almost R1.5-trillion just energy transition (JET) plan President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled on Friday ahead of COP27 . It was approved by the cabinet last week and endorsed by the international partner group, and is due to be launched formally in Egypt this week. It outlines total investment needed over five years - in electricity, green hydrogen and new-energy vehicles - to enable SA to achieve its ambitious climate targets in a just way. "Based on the scale of need, the $8.5bn is a small part, but it is a catalytic contribution to this process in the first five years," presidential climate finance team head Daniel Mminele said on Saturday. The JET sets out the scale of need into which the international partners may contribute. "SA is providing global leadership here. We've been involved in a process that was the first of its kind in the world. Many other countries in similar situations are looking to SA as a benchmark," Mminele said. Now that the plan is out, SA can advance discussions with funders, international and domestic, he said. The money includes grants, loans and guarantees and will go mainly to decommissioning Eskom's coal plants and supporting coal mining areas, as well as to expanding SA's transmission and distribution infrastructure to enable renewable energy to come on to the grid. Separately, the World Bank announced on Friday that it had approved $497m to finance the shutdown and repurposing of Eskom's 62-year-old Komati coal power station, switched off last week. The funding, which will create new opportunities for workers and local communities, is almost double what the World Bank indicated earlier this year and it will see the installation of new solar and wind plants as well as battery storage. The 216-page JET document released on Friday shows SA's private sector can make R500bn available over five years. Global and domestic public sector development finance institutions can contribute R150bn to add to the R128bn from the international partner group.

Poorer counties are spearheading a movement to make the world's most affluent countries pay reparations to the Global South for "loss and damage" caused by the climate crisis. This contentious topic is brewing ahead of the world's largest and most important climate change think-tank.& xA0; The 2022 UN Climate Change Conference, more commonly referred to as the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC or COP27 , will be the 27th gathering, and will be held from November 6-18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. All countries are being affected by climate change to a lesser or greater degree, but some of the most affected countries have done very little to cause it in the first place; such countries are also often the very ones that most lack the resources needed to deal with these disasters. Climate change impacts are most seen in a steep increase in extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, floods, droughts, wildfires and heatwaves. Unfortunately, the poorest countries of the globe are becoming more prone to such events. These governments blame the heavily polluting counties for altering the atmosphere's chemistry through uncontrolled carbon emission, with resultant warming and a concomitant increase in the severity of storms and droughts. On the African continent, SA is by far the largest emitter of carbon. The& xA0;heavy reliance on coal-based energy and other fossil fuels, comprising 91% of the country's energy mix, is a major source of ambient particle pollution. Eleven out of the top 15 most polluted African cities are in SA. This is pretty shocking. The crux of the matter is whether poorer counties have a right to compensation and whether heavy polluters have a moral obligation to make reparation. At COP 26, Scotland put its foot forward when it offered & xA3;2m (about R42m) for loss and damage, making it the first developed country to ever put forward this kind of finance.& xA0; In truth, we all have a responsibility for mitigating the results of climate change, but the effort must be led by the nations that reaped so many of the benefits of economic development and increased wealth through industrialisation for so long (Los Angeles Times, 2019). Perhaps some of our older readers will be prompted to trade in their ancient two-stroke, coughing and smoke-belching lawn mowers for a more efficient and less polluting electric or battery version. At least it is a start. \</doc>

The cabinet has come out in full support of talks between countries to reduce carbon emissions and go green. This is two days after energy minister Gwede Mantashe warned in parliament that SA must not be "pressured" to move towards renewable energy and abandon coal. President Cyril Ramaphosa recently attended the COP27 climate change conference in Egypt. Minister in the presidency Mondli Gungubele said yesterday the cabinet was calling for "countries to remain on track to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the global temperature rise". "Our support for the 1.5& xBA;C target is of utmost importance to SA as an African and developing country that is highly vulnerable to environmental, social and economic effects of climate change," he said. "The cabinet also endorsed the Africa group position to call on developed countries to honour their pledges and commitments made under both the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement. The cabinet position is in stark contrast to Mantashe's determination to continue with coal as the baseload energy producer in the country. The minister says SA can draw lessons from developed countries where attempts to venture into renewable energy have failed dismally. He particularly mentioned Germany, which is among those funding and advocating for SA to abandon fossil fuels while they have gone back to coal. Mantashe told a National Assembly plenary on Wednesday: "My view is that if there is confusion of an entity [Eskom] about what it should do because it is under pressure to go green, then we are going to be in darkness. "Germany is dismantling a wind farm to expand operations of a coal mine. "Coal miners in the US are putting pressure on President [Joe] Biden to invest more in coal production." Mantashe said it was unfair to expect SA to abandon coal. "I am one of the people who say we can have a transition but that coal is not just about numbers, it is about human beings.

Integrated reporting winners a cut above Awards encourage excellence, writes Nedbank is the overall winner of the 2022 Chartered Governance Institute of Southern Africa (CGISA) Integrated Reporting Awards, which recognises and celebrates excellence in integrated reporting. This has been Nedbank's year on the integrated reporting front with the bank named the number one company among all JSE-listed companies in various prestigious reporting awards in Southern Africa. The bank also achieved first place at the 2022 EY Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards and, on the international stage, it was named the global winner for best sustainability reporting in the banking category and runner-up in the best climate-related reporting (large cap) at the 2022 ESG Investing Reporting Awards. "These awards demonstrate our ongoing commitment to transparent and high-quality standards of corporate reporting," says Mike Davis, CFO at Nedbank Group. "Our intention is to inspire the highest quality of corporate reporting industry-wide. In the process we will be playing our part through reporting on delivering our purpose." Stephen Sadie, CEO of CGISA, says congratulations must go to Nedbank Group as overall winner. "They have won various categories, such as overall winner, Top 40 and banking sector, 11 times since the inception of these awards in 1956 and have consistently led the pack in integrated reporting." Impala Platinum won the Top 40 category. The business is making strides in terms of its ESG performance and has managed to retain and, in some cases, improve several important external rankings by leading international agencies. The objective of the CGISA's Integrated Reporting Awards is to encourage innovation and excellence in integrated reporting across the board and not only in the top-JSE listed companies as more and more organisations adopt an integrated approach to their financial and nonfinancial reporting in order to provide a clearer perspective of their business performance, prospects and impact on stakeholders. Interest in the awards has grown in recent years as more organisations realise that their integrated report is an important and valuable communication tool to key stakeholders. Property companies are upping their game when it comes to integrated reporting. This year Redefine Properties took top honours in the mid-cap category, while Attacq won the small-cap category. Pan African Resources won the merit award in the small-cap category. AfroCentric Investments won the fledgling AltX category with Sea Harvest Group winning the merit award. Vodacom and Transaction Capital were awarded merit awards in the Top 40 and mid- cap categories respectively. The Development Bank of Southern Africa wins the state-owned companies category while the Industrial Development Corporation wins the merit award. The Auditor General SA wins the public sector category and GEMS receives a merit award. In the unlisted company category, Fidelity Services takes top honours. The Institute of Directors wins the NPO category while Cotlands receives a merit award. The National Social Security Fund of Uganda wins the Regional category while Safaricom wins a merit award. Established 66 years ago, the awards aim to encourage solid financial and nonfinancial reporting and full disclosure of information to all stakeholders. They allow organisations to be measured against their peers and offers entities the opportunity to develop and instil sound reporting practices through the valuable feedback provided by a panel of experienced judges. Sadie says the awards have come a long way since 1956 when they first started. "The name changed from the Annual Report Awards to the Integrated Reporting Awards in 2012, which reflected the new focus of integrated reporting at the time. We are in the midst of another major upheaval as a host of reporting frameworks are consolidating and merging so that we may have one final reporting set of standards. This range of range of reporting standards and bodies has become known as the alphabet soup," he says. South African companies were early movers globally in integrated reporting largely thanks to the drive and perseverance of Mervyn King. However, Sadie says we need to work hard to retain our position, which is why these reporting awards are so important. Exactly why are the integrated reports of companies so important? "One only has to look at the integrated reports of Steinhoff and Tongaat Hulett, to mention two examples, when these companies crashed and lost billions in value. The issues came to a head in the nonrelease of their integrated reports," says Sadie. Integrated reporting and corporate governance, he adds, go hand in hand. "That is why for 66 years our institute, as a corporate governance professional body, has been running these reporting awards. At the same time our global body, The Chartered Governance Institute, also serves on the Value Reporting Foundation so we are also involved at a global level." He points out these integrated reporting awards took place against the backdrop of COP27 , which recently met in Egypt. Speaking at COP27 The Integrated Reporting Awards gala dinner was held at the Wanderers Club in Johannesburg. CGISA President Sonia Giuricich welcomed guests to the gala evening and requested companies to take heed of the findings of the Zondo Commission so that the country would never again return to that dark place. Cas Coovadia, Busa CEO, was the keynote speaker at the gala dinner. Coovadia stressed that companies should claim their space not only because it was morally correct, and not only because the current political architecture was failing to deliver, but because uplifting the society around which business operates was also good for business. Business was engaging with government to ensure the right steps are taken to solve the current crises that exist in SA, said Coovadia. He pleaded with all South Africans to continue to be vigilant and to hold the structures in power to account so that the changes that citizens would like to see in income inequality, service delivery and growth in the economy are affected. He added that it was incumbent on business to get involved, because while people say that business should stay out of politics, in reality, politics is coming into business. Acknowledging the partners who have joined CGISA along the way, Sadie says the JSE has co-hosted the awards for the past 25 years while PwC has been the convener of judges for the past 10 years.

Dear African Leaders, Ending hunger has been one of the greatest challenges of our times and the devastating events from the past two years have intensified food insecurity.In 2021, a staggering 278 million Africans 1 in 5 people were affected by malnutrition. The invasion of Ukraine has further increased these conditions.Back-to-back emergencies aggravated by climate change, conflict, and a pandemic are affecting people across our continent. Many now face starvation, children are not getting the nutrients they need to grow to their full potential, and year-on-year droughts have caused failed harvests, making it hard for African farmers to grow food and for the continent to become self-sufficient.The good news is that immediate action by you can make a difference.In 2014, African leaders developed a framework the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) to enhance agricultural production and bring about food security on the continent. This was a critical step in recognising how important the sector is for economic growth and to reduce poverty.However, right now, we desperately need you to meet your commitments for the future of the continent. The G20 Summit and COP27 are taking place in a few weeks and achieving global cooperation on food security would be a major win.Ahead of them, we are calling on you to urgently act to: - Increase the share of domestic agriculture expenditure on adaptation to be in line with CAADP commitments, such as improving social safety nets, investing in more dietary diverse food systems, and securing access to irrigated land. - Expand the African Emergency Food Production Facility to reach a total of 30 million farmers to boost their access to agricultural fertilizers, and allow them to produce food urgently. - Pledge to stop rising food prices by keeping them and agricultural markets open and guard against unjustified restrictive measures on food and agriculture exports. - Reduce reliance on food imports by investing in domestic production, agricultural adaptation, and increasing agricultural output in a sustainable manner. Act now so that everyone across our beautiful continent can have enough food to live and thrive now and in the future.With hope,Nomzamo Mbatha Ameyaw Debrah Esther Chungu Thandi Vundamina Natasha Vandermaas Darkovibes Berla Mundi Sarkodie Slap Dee Gyakie Sabrina Dhowre Elba \</doc>

DD111122 p12 letters One elephant It's ironic that Coca-Cola, that purveyor of carbonated fizzy drinks in polluting plastic bottles, is a sponsor of this year's COP27 in Egypt. The secretary-general of the UN's attempted rendition of Chris Rea's "This is the Road to Hell" was just awful, while Boris Johnson scampered around in a pathetic bid to upstage the UK's latest prime minister, regurgitating his wife's latest dire eco predictions. Greta Thunberg has boycotted, calling it a "greenwash". What is this Davos in the Desert likely to achieve, apart from terrifying us mere mortals and encouraging borderline neurotics to stick themselves to London's motorways? COPs 1-26 didn't result in any meaningful carbon reductions, so why should the 27th edition be any different? Here is at least one elephant in the room: China's "developing" economy is in such dire need of expansion that coal use is being actively encouraged. Because doing otherwise could seriously endanger the career of the second "helmsman," Xi Jinping, there is a net zero chance of any change. Europe and New Zealand can adopt sackcloth and ashes and attempt to terminate cow farts, but nothing any other country does will make even a measurable difference. - James Cunningham, via email Nonpayment disaster Gauteng premier Panyaza Lesufi is in a merry Christmas mood. He is doing away with Sanral's e-toll system and wants to write off Soweto's power debt, after R8bn of it was already written off in 2020. In contrast, President Cyril Ramaphosa reprimands municipalities and state departments about their bills to Eskom, which total more than R50bn. Nonpayment of service fees is a disaster, and it was the brainchild of the ANC. It was introduced as a means of passive resistance to the then apartheid government. It was so successful that a special task force led by Roelf Meyer and Gen Joffel van der Westhuizen was deployed in the early 1990s to try to find a counter to it. But once you've taught someone not to pay, you don't reverse the habit easily. It has spilled over into the new SA and it grows from crisis to crisis. The e-toll money is lost. Who in Soweto is going to pay their service fees? And if Soweto's debt is written off, why would any other municipality not demand the same treatment? The nonpayment of service fees was a political move. Writing off any service delivery debt is too. The ANC is urgently looking for votes. Therefore, irresponsible statements and promises abound. - Joe Kleinhans, via email \</doc>

ANC NEC member and presidential hopeful Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma has criticised Western countries for  bullying South Africa to dump coal in favour of renewable energy. This comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa\' s utterances in Egypt at the COP27 conference where he said South Africa was planning to close a number of ageing coal-fired power stations as part of the country\' s energy transition process. Ramaphosa had also announced that a number of European countries would be investing sizeable sums of money in the process. Dlamini Zuma said it was ironic how some of these Western countries were pushing for South Africa to dump the use of coal in favour of renewable energy while their economies were built on the use of coal.  Why do we think that those trucks on the N3 and N2 are full of coal going to the port? Are those people going to eat that coal? They are going to burn it and make energy, then they say we must stop it, no, she said Dlamini Zuma stressed the importance of using innovative cleaner ways of producing energy through coal.  In Japan they have coal power stations which are very clean, so we must be doing that. We had this technology Pebble Bed Modular Reactor, we abandoned it and other countries took it. They are using it now to generate energy. I disagree that your grid can be solar and wind, I completely disagree. Does it make sense? It will not make sense, said Dlamini Zuma. She spoke about the need to have more nuclear power stations, especially because of the abundance in uranium the country is blessed with.  We do have a nuclear station so we need to just add to that. She said it was possible to have nuclear, coal and hydro, which would be reliable, with wind and solar energy adding support to the electricity grid.  It can\' t be the base for your grid. Let\' s say we use solar, where are (we) going to store the batteries that are going to be enough for the grid? Then when you have to dispose of them, what is the environmental issue? As we increase nuclear, maybe we can replace those coal stations, but we can\' t just get rid of coal, added Dlamini Zuma. Yesterday in a parliamentary debate on just energy transition, Minerals and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe said there ought to be a guaranteed base-load energy supply through a combination of gas, nuclear, coal and hydro.  A pendulum swing from coal-powered energy generation to renewable energy does not guarantee base-load stability. \</doc>

Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, has called on businesses leaders in Southern Africa and Europe to strengthen investment, and support industrialisation and the development of sustainable and resilient value and supply chains in the two regions. The Minister made the remarks while opening the 9th Southern Africa/Europe CEO Dialogue in Johannesburg on Thursday. For its part, Godongwana said the South African government is implementing a series of interventions aimed at untangling several challenges stifling the country's economic growth prospects. In response to present day challenges, Godongwana said government's focus has been on the implementation of structural reforms to improve competitiveness, industrial policy to boost manufacturing and measures to strengthen the capacity of the State. 'We are doing this within a clear and stable macroeconomic framework, including a stable and flexible exchange rate, low and stable inflation, and sustainable fiscal policy. 'On structural reforms, we are creating a competitive energy market, dealing with inefficiencies in our ports and rail network, addressing our visa regime to attract skills and investments and are reforming our water and telecommunications sectors. Work continues to build a capable and developmental State, which is a necessary precondition for inclusive growth,' he said. Government, the Minister said, is also intervening to reverse the decline in fixed investment, including through ensuring policy certainty and addressing the cost and ease of doing business. 'The capacity of our State-owned enterprises to invest in the economy, to unlock growth and job creation is being enhanced. 'Infrastructure budgets across government are being increased, while capacity for project planning, preparation and execution is being enhanced. Spending on capital assets is the fastest growing expenditure item on our budget. Action is being taken to modernise procurement and improve contract management,' he said. The Minister said government's investment in fighting crime and corruption is 'being strengthened as part of removing impediments to investment and growth'. 'The African continent is devastated the most by the worsening effects of climate change, which pose an existential threat to humanity. We are committed to the goal of a just transition. 'Our approach envisions accelerating investment in new generation capacity, while preserving the livelihoods of communities adversely affected by the transition from coal and other fossil fuels,' he said. Reiterating President Ramaphosa's call at COP27 in Egypt earlier this week, Godongwana said Africa needs to build adaptive capacity, foster resilience and address the loss and damage due to climate change. For this to happen, the continent needs a predictable, appropriate and at-scale funding stream, and technological support. 'This places a responsibility on developed nations to honour their commitments to those countries with the greatest need and that confront the greatest environmental, social and economic effects of climate change,' he said. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

JUST ENERGY TRANSITION The lack of political consensus endures with ANC tied up to coal Equally stubborn is the gap between what institutions must do and what they can do As the dust settles on COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, SA has emerged as a canary in one of global climate politics' deepest coal mines: climate finance. With the UN estimating that developing countries will require $340bn every year by 2030, questions of how the richer nations that gave rise to climate collapse will help fund poorer nations to transition away from coal could not be more pressing. SA is the world's 13th biggest carbon emitter and has one of the most coal-dependent economies. The vast amount of coal the country burns also results in anaemic growth and job creation, making it one of the least efficient emitters. One of the crucial announcements leading up to COP27 set out a way to fund SA's transition from that coal. President Cyril Ramaphosa's R1.5-trillion investment plan to decarbonise the economy included a breakdown of the $8.5bn committed by the EU, France, Germany, UK and US under the auspices of the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). The partnership's financing provisions suggest that wealthy nations' funding of green transitions may come predominantly in the form of debt. More than 60% of the $8.5bn will be paid as concessional loans, while 33% will come as commercial loans and guarantees. It appears only 4% of the package will be grants. The JETP's deliberations, which reportedly barely included inputs from the Presidential Climate Commission, went on with little public engagement. In that sense they mirrored much of SA's energy sector, where a lot of work is done, but most without taking the public into confidence. In the words of one senior official: "If you get ahead of yourself, you get klapped." This gap between what is being done in SA's energy sector and what people know about it is a reminder of the lack of political consensus around energy, and that even the best-laid plans go awry in the SA political cauldron. It is a consensus gap that continues to ring with unanswered but pressing questions. What will the role of the state be in a newly liberalised energy sector? Will it be able to intervene when markets fail? Maybe most importantly, is SA's energy transition about a more sustainable future, or is it about solving the country's industrialisation? Some of these debates are technical, but the outstanding consensus remains political. As SA turns its back on ageing coal plants, so workers' anxiety will deepen. More than 100,000 jobs might be at risk by 2050. On the other hand, there is a huge trade and economic impetus at the heart of business's response to the climate crisis. The more countries outlaw carbon-intensive production at home the less they will accept SA's carbon-intensive products, and the stronger business anxiety for a huge renewable energy rollout will become. Dealing with SA's energy consensus gap will mean dealing with the more stubbornly lodged gap in the state's capabilities - the gap between what state institutions are able to do and what they should be doing. But, while the current Eskom leadership team has done well to improve the utility's financial stability, its operational components - maintenance and delivery - have suffered. Energy supply is a struggle that had been long in the making. The 1998 white paper on energy policy was clear on the need to build greater energy capacity. A year later, in an abortive effort to open the energy sector up to the private sector, the government refused Eskom permission to build greater generating capacity. By 2006 we were load-shedding. Calls to procure more energy were ignored in 2015 and again in 2019. Since 2008, and up to the middle of October 2022, SA has been through about 253 days of load-shedding, according to Joshua Budlender, a researcher at the Southern African Labour and Development Research Unit. In that time, a typical SA household had been without power for 927 hours, nearly 39 straight days. However, while SA's most immediate challenge is increasing its energy availability factor, it will mean taking existing plants offline. To do so requires getting right transmission, and praying that new private generation projects are able to cover the shortfall. Even then it remains a mystery just how many years SA's transmission infrastructure is behind. To catch up Eskom will probably have to beat its best yet connectivity achievement every year for the next decade. The utility is planning to build 1,500km of grid a year. That's encouraging. But it has never managed anything near that since the 1970s and 1980s, when it was building about 1,200km a year. Although they have come late, the right decisions are starting to be made. It is a necessary first step for the huge challenges ahead, the crux of which will be mobilising funds internally - some experts estimate $250bn will be needed over the next three decades - to fund labour-intensive, green industrialisation. Perhaps the biggest threat to the urgent need for a renewable energy system is a transition that leaves workers behind. But until there is more meaningful agreement on what the problem is that SA needs to solve, these efforts will be hampered at best, and stillborn at worst. Energy will therefore be on the ballot as much as anything else when the ANC goes to conference in December. The party remains joined at the hip to coal companies and syndicates that are resisting renewable energy, and to the corruption politics that hamstrings the licensing of new providers. There is a developing strategic consensus among energy experts and across government departments, but it is under severe risk of running up against unresolved politics that would undermine it, and a state without the capability to implement it. SA cannot afford to politicise energy. But it is probably unavoidable. Webster is a freelance writer commissioned by the Public Affairs Research Institute. \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa's intention is to become a world leader in green hydrogen. 'We are determined to make full use of our substantial endowments to meet the challenges of climate change and to achieve a just transition that benefits all our people,' the President said. President Ramaphosa was delivering a keynote address at the opening of the inaugural South Africa Green Hydrogen Summit, held in Cape Town, on Tuesday. The summit showcases the country's offering as a large-scale, low cost, world-class green hydrogen production hub and total value chain investment destination. It builds on the opportunities identified during the Sustainable Infrastructure Development Symposium South Africa (SIDSSA) of 2021. The President told delegates at the summit that the potential for South Africa to emerge as a significant player in the green hydrogen value chain is immense. The country looks forward to welcoming more of the firms in the green hydrogen value chain and associated technologies into the market. 'We hope to see these international firms partnering with South African firms as we increase our renewable energy footprint, green hydrogen manufacturing capability and local production of value added products,' he said. The Green Hydrogen Summit is taking place soon after the conclusion of the UN Climate Change Conference, also known as COP 27 , in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. President Ramaphosa said South Africa used the platform of COP 27 to elaborate on its just green transition. Government recently released for public comment a Just Energy Transition Investment Plan as the basis for the country's pathway towards a low-carbon and climate resilient society. According to the plan, South Africa will need approximately $98 billion over the next five years to enable a just transition and achieve its ambitious emissions reduction targets. Green hydrogen was identified as a 'Big Frontier' in the Country Investment Strategy, indicating that it represents both current and future growth and investment potential for South Africa. The President highlighted that globally, the demand for green hydrogen and green hydrogen-based products, such as ammonia and synthetic jet fuels, is rising significantly. 'This presents a unique opportunity for South Africa to link its mineral endowment with its renewable energy endowment to drive industrialisation. 'At the same, it will create jobs, attract investment, bring development to rural provinces and support a just transition from fossil fuels. This Summit is an opportunity to tell the South African story in this rapidly growing sector,' President Ramaphosa said. SA an investment destination of choice President Ramaphosa emphasised that South Africa has existing and future potential to produce green hydrogen. It is estimated that South Africa has the potential to produce 6 to 13 million tons of green hydrogen and derivatives a year by 2050. This would require between 140 and 300 gigawatts of renewable energy. The President explained that the focus would be on green hydrogen exports, electrolyser and fuel cell production, and the manufacture of green steel, sustainable aviation fuel, ammonia, fertilizers and renewable energy components. 'South Africa is an investment destination of choice. The country has proven itself as a gateway to a dynamic continent with great prospects. Africa is growing its output, is rapidly urbanising and has a young population. 'South Africa leads the continent in advanced manufacturing, science and technology. This country is a favourable, reliable and stable place to conduct business,' the President said. President Ramaphosa reiterated that government is driving regulatory and legislative reform to make the economy more competitive, to attract more investment and to create more jobs. 'South Africa has many inherent advantages that make it internationally competitive in the production of green hydrogen. These include a world class endowment of both onshore wind and solar irradiation,' the President said. The country has a supportive legislative environment and experience in the deployment of renewable energy with the largest installed capacity of wind and solar power projects on the African continent. Companies like Sasol and PetroSA have expertise in the production of synthetic fuels like diesel, petrol and kerosene, as well as a range of chemical products. South Africa already produces 2.4 million tons of grey hydrogen for domestic consumption. The President highlighted that a number of large and emerging South African companies have started doing work in the green hydrogen sector including the Boegoebaai Port and Rail project, among others. The project has been under development for over two decades and was gazetted as a Strategic Integrated Project in 2020. Sasol and the Northern Cape provincial government have also made significant progress on the master plan for a green hydrogen special economic zone, which aims to support 40 gigawatts of electrolyser capacity by 2050. The President said this would require approximately 80 gigawatts of renewable energy, which is almost double South Africa's current installed electricity generation capacity. \</doc>

More and more of the world's people are feeling the impacts of climate change. As United Nations secretary-general Ant\'f3nio Guterres said when COP27 opened this week: "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator." Much of the weight on the accelerator is coming from the construction and building sector. Accounting for 37% of global carbon dioxide emissions, the built environment is a major part of the climate change problem. That also means it can and must be a key part of the solution.The United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) has just released its 2022 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction at COP27 . Its findings are alarming.The sector s energy consumption and emissions have rebounded from the Covid pandemic to an all-time high. Emissions are 2% higher than the previous peak in 2019.The report says the reasons include revival of construction activity suppressed during lockdowns, and more intensive use of existing buildings.In 2021, buildings accounted for more than 34% of the world s total energy demand. This figure includes embodied energy that goes into construction materials and processes, and operational energy that goes into running buildings. The sector produced about 37% of CO emissions.The gap between the sector s performance and what needs to be done to achieve decarbonisation by 2050 is widening despite a 16% increase in investments in building energy efficiency from 2020 to 2021.How do we measure progress?The Paris Agreement seeks to avoid catastrophic climate change by limiting global warming to 1.5 and no more than 2 . The Human Settlements Pathway of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action identifies two objectives which are building momentum across the sector: - by 2030, halve built environment emissions, with 100% of new buildings to be net-zero carbon in operation - by 2050, all new and existing built assets must be net zero across their whole life cycle, including both embodied and operational emissions. To track the decarbonisation progress, the Global Buildings Climate Tracker has mapped a direct reference path to a target of zero-carbon building stock in 2050. The tracker has seven components:Three impact elements: - CO emissions, - share of renewables in buildings energy use. Four action elements: - investing in energy efficiency, - green building certification, - nationally determined contributions to include building sector action, So why is the sector going backwards?At first glance, the report offers some good news when comparing the 2021 trends to the 2015 baseline data. However, the overriding change is gross floor area, which has increased by 11% 24 billion square metres since 2015. This growth in construction, which is predicted to continue beyond 2050, is outweighing progress in other areas.In addition, energy intensity has stagnated, falling by only 0.7%. Three-quarters of countries still do not have mandatory energy-efficiency standards for all building types. While an increasing number mention buildings in their nationally determined contributions, many still don t have detailed plans for achieving net-zero emissions from the sector by 2050.Global buildings and construction trends, 2015 and 2021What does this mean for efforts to limit climate change?Overall, the report shows we have made less than half the progress we should have made on decarbonising the sector at this stage.The gap has increased this year, meaning the situation is getting worse, not better. Urgent action is needed to get the sector back on track to zero net emissions by 2050.Building sector performance compared to pathway to zero carbon by 2050The report highlights the need to consider whole lifecycle approaches to emissions. That means taking into account emissions from the manufacture of materials and construction activity, through to the operation of buildings and then end-of-life demolition and waste.For example, research in 2020 found total lifecycle emissions from the new homes required for Australia s growing population greatly exceeded our emissions targets. Federal government projections potentially underestimated emissions by 96%.What can be done to get emissions on track?The report s recommendations focus on strengthening: - policies, targets and regulations, - materials, with a focus on the construction supply chain, life cycle and circular economy. Growth in energy demand and floor area under scenario of net zero by 2050Priorities in Australia are to urgently update our building regulations; shift business models and investment to prioritise net-zero buildings and construction; and secure the electricity grid s transition to renewable energy generation.While the 2022 National Construction Code update increased energy-efficiency standards, further changes are needed to meet 2050 goals. Revisions to the code are notoriously slow, but the need for more action is urgent.Australia is also yet to consider embodied carbon emissions in the construction, refurbishment and retrofitting of buildings, or the ongoing embodied emissions due to tenancy changes or home improvements.We have seen improvements as a result of the Commercial Building Disclosure Program requiring commercial buildings to display their environmental rating under the NABERS standards. While no minimum requirements have yet been set, this programme has helped to cut operational emissions.However, unlike Europe, the NABERS rating generally only measures the base building operational emissions (as required under the Commercial Building Disclosure Program). It s missing a big piece of the puzzle, tenancy emissions.Despite the level of construction activity, most of the building stock has already been built and will not be replaced for decades. This means a retrofit programme is needed.It s a huge challenge. For example, the City of Melbourne s target of zero-carbon buildings by 2040 requires about 77 buildings to be retrofitted every year.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/640/233249.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/640/233249.html :EMBED-->We have the know-how but need political willWe need political will and broadscale investment to bring about the scale of changes required to achieve net-zero buildings. Impetus is building, but it needs to translate into big structural changes in policy, finance, materials supply chains and energy systems.The good news is we already have the capacity and know-how we need to steer our buildings sector onto a net-zero trajectory and off the highway to climate hell.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

South Africans' confidence that a climate crisis will be averted in their lifetime has declined, according to a new survey. The survey, conducted annually by global technology company Epson, measures the opinions and experiences of more than 520 South Africans as part of an international study of climate change. Confidence levels fell from 58.9% in 2021 to 56.6% in 2022, according to the Epson Climate Reality Barometer. "The 2021 survey explored the various contributing factors to climate change and humanity's ability to deal with it effectively, from scientific and government interventions to a slow uptake of renewable energy," said Epson country manager Timothy Thomas. "This year's survey focused on the actions that individuals have taken, or intend to take, to help tackle climate change, from less international business and leisure travel to switching to an electric vehicle, walking or cycling more, switching to renewable energy and using more sustainable brands." Globally, climate change is on average ranked third as a priority issue that governments, companies and individuals should be focused on. But in South Africa, according to Epson, it is ranked fourth at 9.4%, behind fixing the economy (40%), tackling poverty (19.9%) and managing inflation (14%). Findings also suggest that age is a factor, with the oldest age group (55+) most concerned about climate change and those in the 45-54 and 16-24 age groups the least concerned. This is despite the recent impact of climate change, including intense rains affecting the eastern coast of South Africa, resulting in devastating flooding and landslides across KwaZulu-Natal, and widespread droughts in the Eastern and Western Cape. This, the survey noted, suggests a "reality deficit" in people potentially misunderstanding the full future effects of climate change. Despite the varying issues South Africans believe the government, companies and individuals should be prioritising, many are already playing their part by adopting sustainable habits. About 32.5% of South Africans have volunteered to travel less internationally, with a further 31.4% planning to do so in future and while only 8% have switched to an electric vehicle, 63% are looking to make the change in future. More than 60% are already walking and cycling more, reducing their plastic use, improving recycling habits and using reusable goods. "While individual actions are ramping up, and as the world prepares for COP27 in Egypt this year, it's clear that much more needs to be done if the world is to avert a climate disaster," said Thomas. - TimesLIVE TIME RUNNING OUT: Floods in KwaZulu-Natal wreaked havoc in many parts of the province earlier this year.

CLIMATE JUSTICEThorny questions for Just Energy Transition Partnership negotiators No-one should oppose the decarbonisation project if these reasonable questions are answeredPatrick Bond and Desmond D'SaIn SA the worlds of high finance and climate justice are colliding, with unfortunate results expected to manifest at the UN's COP27 climate summit taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, next month. At COP26 in Glasgow a year ago Western firms promised $8.5bn (R155bn) for a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) that would serve as the world's decarbonisation model. But persistent delays and nontransparent processes mean crucial details have been hidden from view ever since. That leaves us with a number of critical questions. Specifically, two fragile coal-fired power stations - Medupi and Kusile - cost not the original R163bn estimate, but closer to R450bn. Then Eskom chair Valli Moosa awarded the main boiler procurement contracts to Hitachi in 2007, just after the Tokyo firm had gifted 25% of Hitachi Power Africa to the governing party's funding arm, Chancellor House. That act was termed "outrageous" by Corruption Watch, because at the time Moosa was also an ANC finance committee member, resulting in Hitachi's 2015 successful bribery prosecution (and R340m fine) under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Should new JETP loans enable repayment of interest on such odious debt, instead of challenging these lenders to take a haircut for funding these fraud-filled, skorokoro, ultra-polluting power plants? Why give the World Bank a central role in JETP management? A protest at the bank's Illovo office two weeks ago drew scores of community and environmental activists insisting on the cancellation of odious debt, since a 2010 Medupi credit of $3.75bn was the lender's largest project loan. Protesters against the World Bank also demanded an end to its financing of a Richards Bay liquefied natural gas terminal. Last month, former US vice-president and environmentalist Al Gore called for the World Bank's president, David Malpass, (a Donald Trump appointee) to be fired due to his "ridiculous" climate change denialism, and the problem is evident when other staff push methane gas projects or demand Medupi debt repayment. Will the JETP allow De Ruyter to use 44% of incoming funding for methane gas-fired power plant construction, even though it is expected to be up to 85 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over the next 20 years? Given that JETP funding for Eskom is "fungible", finance needed for De Ruyter's two preferred methane gas power plants - 3,000MW at Richards Bay and 1,000MW at Komati, together costing R85bn - will be freed up as it comes from the same pool to be used for solar and wind generation. Will JETP partners permit Eskom's meth addiction because they believe - as does the EU's "sustainable finance taxonomy" - that gas (and nuclear energy) can be considered "green"? Does the JETP turn a blind eye to - thus rewarding - De Ruyter's many unjust energy policies, such as "load reduction" energy racism, which disconnects black townships more frequently than the suburbs? Or his requested 32% increase in 2023 tariffs, plus his phase-out of residual pro-poor cross-subsidies to black homeowners? Or Eskom power plants' violations of Air Quality Act regulations (by a factor 3,200 times accepted levels), which kill 2,200 Mpumalanga residents annually and produce the world's worst sulphur dioxide pollution? Indeed, what hard-currency spending is truly required for core just transition mandates, such as re-employment opportunities and climate adaptation? That is, climate-proofing infrastructure and housing to withstand rain bombs or irrigation to beat the droughts, when workers are paid in rand and most materials are acquired locally, not imported? Did Western JETP negotiators conduct any genuine consultation with the most vigorous community, labour and environmental critics of Eskom? Will JETP funding partly aim to kick-start an elite electric vehicle market, for subsidised auto exports to wealthy customers abroad, as is desired by trade, industry & competition minister Ebrahim Patel (on top of R30bn worth of existing subsidies for petrol and diesel cars? In advance of the UN's COP27 climate summit, will the long-delayed conclusion of the JETP artificially boost the (generally fake) green credentials of the main Western polluters - as happened in Glasgow in November 2021 - at a time when Germany is importing millions of tonnes of SA coal for its rebooted power plants due to Russian sanctions, and the UK is going back to fracking methane gas? Speaking of hypocrisy, is Pretoria's not glaring in deploying 1,200 SA National Defence Force troops in northern Mozambique to defend Paris-based Total, Houston-based ExxonMobil and other multinationals drilling to tap into 125-trillion cubic feet of gas, in a war zone that has left 1-million people displaced and thousands dead, just as climate-fuelled cyclones on the coast become more intense? Given these contradictions, should South Africans committed to climate justice consider endorsing a February call by the Climate Justice Charter Movement to support sanctions against financing the JETP? No-one should oppose a JETP if these questions are resolved, especially if the Western super-polluters concede the $8.5bn is simply its down payment on long overdue "climate reparations" to Africa. The polluters should compensate poorer countries for leaving fossil fuels underground, as well as covering growing climate-proofing adaptation costs and extreme weather loss and damage expenses. Given the balance of forces, we realise these reasonable questions will not even be considered by establishment negotiators, much less answered satisfactorily.

PRAVIN Gordhan, the Minister of Public Enterprises, appointed a new board of directors for Eskom last Friday. The minister said the board would bring broad experience, expertise and skills that would provide stability and strategic direction, and reposition Eskom to play a key role in the energy sector. Gordhan said he would like the board to deal immediately with current load shedding issues, procurement, elimination of corruption, and ensuring the reliability of energy supply in the medium- to long-term. The Department of Public Enterprises said Dr Rod Crompton would be retained on the Eskom board of directors to ensure continuity. The executive directors will be Andre de Ruyter, the CEO, and Calib Cassim, the CFO. Following the announcement, Mandy Rambharos, the general manager of Just Energy Transition at Eskom, resigned. She was expected to spearhead a move to secure more than R150 billion from wealthier nations so the power utility could fund the closure of some of its older coal stations. This aimed to facilitate new green energy projects which focus on cleaner, renewable energy. Rambharos is also currently a commissioner for the Presidential Climate Commission (South Africa), and has more than 20 years of experience in the energy sector. At the end of the month, she will join the Environmental Defence Fund, based in the US. In a Twitter post on Saturday, Rambharos said:  This is an exciting and strategic next step for me and will provide an even larger platform for me to continue to work on climate change and influence the global energy transition. I remain confident that my colleagues (at Eskom) will continue the important work we have started together. Her resignation comes ahead of the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt from November 6 to 18. Darryl Hunt, an energy expert from Dynamic Energy, said Rambharos\' move was a career progression opportunity for her personal development.  One can be conspiratorial and say she was figuratively pushed but I believe she jumped. I\' d like to think she simply saw an opportunity and went for it to further her career on an international platform, which anyone in her position, or any other position, could do. He said the new Eskom board members would not be able to fix the energy crisis overnight.  Having a board is a procedural imperative but the war won\' t be won in boardrooms and strategic meetings. It is great to see a diversified skill set in this new board but we would be foolish to think that a board can simply turn things around.  Eskom is facing many challenges. Besides the energy crisis, corrupt activities within the utility are also problematic.  Our government has made a commitment to the environment through their participation in previous climate change conferences. We will have to see with COP27 how and when they plan to properly introduce an inclusive, socially just energy transition. We need all hands on deck when it comes to getting as much technology as possible to store different forms of energy. David Hallows, an energy expert from GroundWork, said a new board would not make a difference to the country\' s energy crisis.  Why is there even an energy crisis to begin with? We need more transparency from Eskom with regards to this matter and the processes that take place behind the scenes. He said the resignation of Rambharos was a loss for the power utility.  She seemed to have been a person of integrity and the timing of this is certainly difficult for Eskom. Hallows said a just transition to renewable energy, which was part of Rambharos\' s job mandate, was imminently doable.  Hopefully, there will be a succession plan in place to replace her role in the energy transition department. Eskom\' s board members are: Mpho Makwana is the chairperson. He is currently the independent non-executive chairperson of JSE-listed ArcelorMittal SA Ltd as well as the lead independent director \- Nedbank Group Ltd, Nedbank Ltd. Makwana serves as chairperson of the Advisory Board of Investing in Africa Mining Indaba, Illovo SA (Pty) Ltd and Gibela Rail (RF) (Pty) Ltd. Dr Busisiwe Vilakazi has a DPhil in engineering science from the University of Oxford. Vilakazi is a former senior researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Lwazi Goqwana has worked for multiple organisations, including Unilever, Tiger Brands, Barclays Africa, Transnet and the Department of Public Enterprises. Clive le Roux is a chief nuclear officer at Eskom, and a power station manager at Matimba Power Station and Koeberg Nuclear Power Station. Le Roux spent the last 10 years in Eskom as a consultant. Leslie Mkhabela has an LLB and is the director and chairperson of Mkhabela Huntley Attorneys. Mkhabela is a member of the Black Lawyers Association with expertise in restructuring state-owned assets, legal practice, commercial and administrative law, and dispute resolution. Mteto Nyati is a former chief executive officer of MTN SA. Nyati has held senior leadership and executive roles in multinational IT companies such as IBM and Microsoft. He is currently the chief executive at Altron. Ayanda Mafuleka is a chartered accountant. Mafuleka is currently the CEO of Finance and Accounting Services Sector Education and Training Authority implementing the strategic direction of the Sector Education and Training Authority. Tsakani Mthombeni is an executive for sustainable development at Implats, where he is responsible for developing and implementing the group\' s sustainable development strategy. Dr Claudelle von Eck is an organisational development and change manager and the former CEO of the Institute of Internal Auditors of South Africa.

ENVIRONMENTAL activists across the country took to the streets yesterday in protest against the further exploration of fossil fuels, saying the government and the oil and gas industries were not taking the climate crisis seriously.  The world is in a climate crisis, which means we should be making moves to (eventually, but steadily) cancel all fossil fuels, not discover more fossil fuel reserves and increase production \- this contradicts the energy transition currently under way. We believe that all applications for new projects should be stopped and that companies like TotalEnergies should instead invest their huge profits to transition away from fossil fuels, said The Green Connection\' s community outreach co-ordinator, Neville van Rooy. The pickets formed part of civil society mobilising for a just energy transition, and was The Green Connection\' s collaboration with French NGO, Bloom. The campaign  OceanTotalDestruction calls out the French-based company, which the organisations say continues to reap significant profits (up 131%) from offshore oil and gas exploration and production,  at the expense of the climate . In a memorandum handed over to a Total representative in Johannesburg, several civil society groups including The Green Connection, Extinction Rebellion South Africa, Equal Education, V.E.J.A., Frack Free South Africa, Project90 By 2030, Bloom, Oceans Not Oil and others said:  We as environmental and social justice activists have marched today against the total destruction of our oceans on the coast of South Africa, in solidarity with small scale fishers within coastal communities whose livelihoods are most at risk from the potential negative impacts of offshore oil and gas exploration and production (such as major oil spills).  These proposed offshore oil and gas exploration and production projects are being pursued at a time when world leaders were urged at COP27 to stop any further use of fossil fuels and drastically reduce the use of current reserves. One of the protest participants, a fisherman from Port Nolloth, Walter Steenkamp, said:  Oil and gas are bad for our people and oceans and have many negative effects on the livelihoods of fishers who depend on the ocean. We do not need oil and gas when there are other alternatives - like wind, that will not harm the environment and people. TotalEnergies chairperson and chief executive officer Patrick Pouyann\'e9 said:  TotalEnergies E&P South Africa and its partners applied for a production licence on September 5, following which an environmental and societal impact assessment was initiated.  This assessment will provide a detailed description of the project's economic, social and environmental impacts, the measures planned to preserve the environment, and the related social and economic benefits. A survey has been launched to map the marine species, including, potentially, marine mammals, to model the potential impact of production activities (especially noise) and to define any measures to be taken.  I would also like to stress that TotalEnergies E&P South Africa has already voluntarily reduced the scope of the licence application by excluding the area currently classified by the South African authorities as a protected marine area. \</doc>

In a bid to spur innovation of insurance solutions for the underserved, Swiss Re Foundation has pledged a $500,000 grant to Africa's insurance sector. The funding, to be distributed through the FSD Africa's supported BimaLab insurance accelerator programme, will unlock and accelerate the transformation of Africa's insurance sector through innovative offerings for the sector's unique landscape.Recently, there has been increased attention to Africa's expanding and promising insurance sector. At the COP27 Summit, more than 85 African insurers pledged to create a financing facility to provide $14bn to support communities impacted by climate change.The cover will help the continent's most vulnerable communities deal with climate-disaster risks such as floods and droughts, cementing the insurance industry's position in driving the continent's economic expansion.Africa's low penetration rateDespite its massive potential, research by Brookings Institute indicates that Africa's insurance sector has a low penetration of 2.78% compared to the global average insurance penetration rate of 7.23%.Low awareness and low employment levels in the formal sectors, coupled with a lack of trust and experience with traditional insurance institutions, have been attributed to low penetration rates.To harness the opportunities presented by the insurance sector, FSD Africa, with its partners, launched the BimaLab accelerator programme in 2020. The programme provides resources needed by talented insurtech founders of early to mid-stage start-ups to leverage insurance technology and promote insurance penetration in the continent.The BimaLab programme now in Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria has enabled 40 insurtechs to gain visibility and push for resources to scale their innovations. So far, 43 unique products and services have reached more than 600,000 customers since the programme started in 2020.Plans to launch the BimaLab accelerator programme in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Egypt, and Morocco are underway.The support of the Swiss Re Foundation will further facilitate the growth of high-impact insurtechs through introducing and scaling innovative products and services to the underserved African market.Commenting on the new grant, Kelvin Massingham, director of risk and resilience, FSD Africa, said: "The importance of the insurance sector to alleviate the challenges of today cannot be understated.An innovator's paradise"While the African continent continues to report low insurance uptake, there are numerous opportunities for innovators in insurance. We are optimistic that through the grant, the underserved communities will soon start enjoying the safety net provided by insurance from many external threats like natural disasters, health threats, and economic disruptions."Elias Omondi, senior manager of risk regulations at FSD Africa, said: "The support of the Swiss Re Foundation is a significant step towards building an innovative and climate-focused insurance industry that will accommodate the evolving needs of the uninsured."Stefan Huber Fux, director of the Swiss Re Foundation said: "We acknowledge the role of the insurance sector in spurring the growth and development of the African continent."Through programmes such as BimaLab, the most vulnerable and low-income people will gain from innovative, affordable, and efficient insurance products and services." \</doc>

As the world edges towards the UN Conference of Parties on Climate Change ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in November, it is no surprise that the global narrative is resetting towards this trajectory, notwithstanding the entrenched impacts of a receding Covid-19 pandemic, the changing Ukraine conflict and dealing with the global shocks of rising inflation, food and fuel prices and a cost-of-living crisis. Last week Barbara Creecy, Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and Environmental Affairs, joined fellow ministers from Africa at the Egypt-International Co-operation Forum in Sharm El-Sheikh before COP27 in their clarion call for a sharp increase in climate financing for Africa in particular, while at the same time pushing back against any abrupt and arbitrary move away from fossil fuels, especially coal, oil and gas, on which many African countries as primary producers are dependent. According to the AU, the continent is faced with an annual climate financing gap of about $108 billion (R1.9 trillion). This is exacerbated by the fact that climate finance is biased against climate-vulnerable countries, which goes against the demand to  let the polluters pay . Never mind that climate change affects all sectors, including food insecurity. According to the IMF, sub-Saharan Africa is the world\' s most food insecure region. Africa benefited from less than 5.5% of global climate financing despite having a low carbon footprint and suffering disproportionately from climate change. Aminath Shauna, Maldives Minister of Environment, speaks for climate vulnerable states when she laments:  One of the main outcomes we wish to see out of the multilateral process is mitigation ambition in line with the 1.5\'b0C goal. COP made some progress in keeping this ambition alive, yet funding for the root causes of climate change is still exponentially greater than funding to the response to climate change. At least $1.6 trillion was spent on fossil fuel subsidies over the 5-year period since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. The Maldives is one of the small island states whose very existence is threatened by climate-related rising sea levels. Against a current global macroeconomic background, policy implementation of mitigating climate change by transition to clean and green energy governed by net zero targets and time lines set by the Paris Climate Agreement and subsequent COPs, and achieving the UN SDG agenda targets by 2030 are being delayed. Governments are recommissioning or extending the use of coal-fired power stations, nuclear plants and turning to increasing fossil fuel extraction and fracking to reduce dependency on Russian gas and oil imports, if only for the short to medium term. The reality is that the COP process and the climate action discourse is steeped in a fundamental dichotomy that has undermined the very exercise from the outset, straddling differences in ideology and science on climate change, on whether past polluters whose very economic success was based on pernicious pollution should bear most of the financial burden of mitigation, and whether there should be target expansions for major current polluters such as China and India in their push for industrialisation. It\' s disheartening that we are still far from the goal to mobilise $100bn annually by 2020 towards climate finance as promised by the rich countries. It seems that promises are made only to be broken. The truth is that climate action, mitigation and adaptation costs money \- lots of it. Inaction today will only result in a much bigger spend tomorrow. Climate action cannot be achieved by governments alone. Partnerships with multilaterals to deploy innovative de-risking solutions are critical to create bankable projects in high-risk markets. Multi-stakeholder collaboration is vital to unlock institutional and private investor assets. In July the IMF published a detailed note on mobilising domestic and foreign private sector capital in developing economies in support of climate projects by overcoming existing constraints. Estimates of global investments needed to achieve the Paris Agreement\' s temperature and adaptation goals range between $3 trillion and $6 trillion per year until 2050. The variation is because of the large data gaps in the tracking of climate finance data and underdeveloped disclosure. Global climate finance currently totals about $630bn annually, with debt being the main source of funding for investments. Green bonds/Sukuk represent less than 3% of global bond/Sukuk markets. The African Development Bank estimates that South Africa would require $30bn to finance a just energy transition alone. At the GEPF Conference 2022 in Cape Town last week, Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana reminded pension funds and private sector investors of their  enormous responsibility to ensure that capital flows towards not only economic returns, but also social impact , adding:  This presents opportunities that climate change presents to the industries and risks \- a role that investors can play in enabling the African continent to transition to more resilient and sustainable economies and prepare for climate-driven events and catastrophes. Pension funds and financial services, he adds, have major roles to play in helping reach net-zero emissions and by influencing other investors to align towards investing for impact in social, climate and environmentally friendly projects. This is in line with the Presidency\' s South Africa Country Investment Strategy, which sees gross fixed capital formation reach 30% of GDP by 2030, as outlined in the NDP, and a greater role for public private partnerships (PPPs) to fill capacity constraints and mobilise investment funding. Pretoria is banking on PPPs in infrastructure and climate action to drive an elusive GDP growth. This is easier said than done! Climate Action \- finance, mitigation and adaptation, concluded a forum last Thursday organised by the independent central banking think tank OMFIF, is hampered by a cornucopia of constraints. These include  unnecessary bureaucracy , risk aversion, lack of harmonisation of disclosure standards for sustainable finance, proliferation of worldwide fragmented green taxonomies for guiding sustainable investments, and the need to achieve an appropriate framework for public and private investors and financial institutions to channel private investments into the vast opportunities for sustainable and green finance.

We're delighted to share that Sun Exchange is launching its new Brighter Business initiative today. Over the last seven years, we ve built a global community of more than 40,000 individuals across 180 countries using our platform to drive energy transformation and earn with purpose.While people-powered solar remains core to our business, we re now expanding our community into the business world. Brighter Business is an initiative to inspire the private sector to take action addressing the energy and climate crises by driving and supporting adoption of solar power.Did you know that if the top 10 South African companies invested just 1% of their profits into supplying solar power with battery backup for schools, by 2025, every school in South Africa could be solar powered and protected from ongoing and frequent outages? This would alleviate significant strain on the grid, eliminate outage-related disruptions to children s education and set a powerful example for the country s future leaders.<!>Increasingly, Sun Exchange is partnering with companies that recognise the opportunity goes beyond installing solar power on their own roofs. These sustainability-minded businesses are using our platform to buy into solar projects, making a positive impact while generating an alternative income stream.However, Brighter Business is about much more than Sun Exchange.The goal of Brighter Business is to unite business leaders, foster conversation about the private sector s role and immense potential to tackle the energy and climate crises, and most importantly, catalyse action. The focus of the initiative will be on network building, knowledge sharing, events and promoting collaboration across industries.As the global COP27 climate conference takes place in Egypt, we re launching Brighter Business by hand-delivering a powerful call to action to the top business leaders across South Africa. This message will also be promoted across major South African digital platforms, social channels and at Sun Exchange-hosted events.If your company would like to learn more about Brighter Business, email HYPERLINK mailto:brighterbusiness@sunexchange.com brighterbusiness@sunexchange.com HYPERLINK http://www.brighterbusiness.co.za www.brighterbusiness.co.za \</doc>

Terms of transition loans generous, says Treasury To help achieve a low-carbon economy, French charge 3.6% and Germany's KFW charges 3% Energy WriterThe terms of the two \€ 300m loans provided by German and French public development banks to support SA's transition to a low-carbon economy are "highly concessional" and offer "more generous" terms than the government could have found in capital markets. The Treasury said on Thursday that the French development bank (AFD) and Germany's KFW loans each has a maturity of 20 years, including a five-year grace period. The AFD loan will have to be paid back at an interest rate of 3.6% (equal to the six-month Euro interbank offered rate [Euribor] plus 129 basis points) and the KFW loan has an interest rate of 3% (six-month Euribor plus 69 basis points). "The estimated cost for the government of SA to raise an equivalent loan today in the market would be around 8.9%. "This estimate is based on a fair value estimation of SA's foreign currency bonds relative to the risk-free rate, secondary market activity and historical issue spreads," the Treasury said. These loans form part of an international funding package of $8.5bn, known as the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), pledged to SA by France, Germany, the UK, the US and EU at COP26 in November 2021. It took almost a year for clear details of the funding package to emerge. President Cyril Ramaphosa told reporters at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt that only about 2.7% of the $8.5bn will be provided by the partners in the form of grants. The rest of the money will be loans and concessional loans from development and commercial finance institutions. At the time of publication, the Treasury had not responded to questions from Business Day to confirm whether the money flowing to SA from these loans had already been allocated to just transition projects. It did say in the statement that both loans are sovereign loans that take the form of nonearmarked budget financing that is transferred directly into the National Revenue Fund of SA. "These loans are in support of the policy and institutional reforms undertaken by the government of SA in support of its just energy transition," the Treasury said. SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, which was published last week, prioritises SA's move away from coal for electricity generation and the development of new economic sectors for green hydrogen and electric vehicles. According to the Treasury, the loans from France and Germany are already reflected in SA's gross borrowing requirement, and the burden they place on the country's finances is "well within SA's risk benchmark of foreign debt as percentage of total debt". erasmusd@businesslive.co.za Picture: 123RF/SERGEY FEDOSKIN \</doc>

The Conference of Parties is slowly becoming nothing more than amateurisation of climate science. For 12 days signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held their annual meeting, otherwise known as the Conference of Parties (COP), in Egypt's Sharm El Sheik. The basis for the annual meetings was the realisation - as reported by scientists in the first climate conference in 1988 - that planet Earth was becoming warmer, with global average temperatures recording a 1.5 to 2 degree rises than pre-industrial era. It was conclusively found that the rise was as a result of human activities, that continues unabated to this day. The Kyoto Conference in 1992 identified the gases, that science characterised as greenhouse gases, for their effect in trapping heat within the atmosphere, leading among them was carbon dioxide emitted mostly through fossil fuels into the atmosphere. At this point it was still science; led by scientists. Without any deviation into the physics of greenhouse gases, their effect is that they trap within the atmosphere, unneeded energy that is supposed to be radiated back into deep space, and therefore resulting in rise of surface air temperatures on earth. Over a period of time, this atmospheric happening resulted in a climatic phenomenon that became known in the 90s as global warming - only to be countered through mitigation measures. Lack of action on global warming back then, led into climate change - a very disruptive phenomenon that no one can do anything about, but adapt to. The 27th meeting in Sharm El Sheik, was a continuation of trying to find solutions to this problem of gigantic proportions our world faces. It seemed from social media bits that COP27 was nothing more than a blame game, characterised by mega egos and irrelevant discussions on liability from parties. Climate change is not a platform for flowery speeches and catchy phrases. It certainly is not a platform to defer hard decision into sometime into the future. Climate change is a science and should be approached as thus. While global warming necessitates that mitigation be now and mandatory; climate change necessitates that adaptation happens even faster, and from yesterday. This necessitates that liability is allocated to developed nations. Discussion can happen on what would constitute equitable funding for the challenges ahead for poorer and the most affected as happened in Pakistan and South Africa and Nigeria this year. This surely is a peripheral issue. The heatwaves that were experienced across Europe this summer, and the Pakistan floods, are a window into tomorrow's reality; devastation is too much to contemplate. We have a habitat but soon we will be without it. A day will come where life will virtually be impossible on planet earth. When that day comes, we will better remember that instead of acting on scientific advice, world leaders amateurised climate change science, and opted to defer solutions to sometime into the future. They opted for gala events graced by irrelevant attendees - a wrong solution to a burning world problem. Maputi is a former journalist and an author \</doc>

THE world\' s focus may be centred on climate change and its devastating effects on the environment, health, economy and society. But in the shadow of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, old enemies keep resurfacing which pose an equally existential threat, especially to those afflicted by them. The latest WHO 2022 Global Tuberculosis (TB) Report, released just before the start of the COP27 jamboree, reveals a disturbing regression which some gatekeepers of global health euphemistically spin as  stalling progress given that 26.3 million people were treated for the disease between 2018 and 2021, albeit still far short of the 40 million target set for 2018\- 2022 at the UN High-Level Meeting on TB. The data of disease management dysfunction and reality is that an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with TB in 2021, up 4.5% from 2020; and 1.6 million people died from TB (including 187 000 among HIV-positive people). Here\' s the catch: though the WHO End TB Strategy 2025 Milestones envisage a 75% reduction in the number of TB deaths in the world between 2015-2025, in the period 2015-2021 a reduction of a mere 5.9% was achieved. Similarly, the burden of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) also increased by 3% between 2020 and 2021, with 450 000 new cases of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) in 2021. This, says WHO, is the first time in many years an increase has been reported in the number of people falling ill with TB and drug-resistant TB. This  stalling in progress towards achieving WHO and UN tuberculosis targets is attributed to the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021 and ongoing conflicts across Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East which exacerbated the situation for vulnerable populations and severely impacted the response to TB through the reallocation of resources away from the  other pandemics such as TB to containing Covid-19. The impression may be that fighting the  other pandemics in tandem with Covid-19 is a zero sum game. That couldn\' t be further from the truth in a world of multiple pathogens and vectors, some still unknown to us. If climate mitigation targets are not met in the near-to-medium term, as the proceedings and bickering trajectory in Sharm el-Sheikh seem to point to, it can only further impede the progress towards the 2025 WHO End TB Strategy and eradicating such diseases because destructive climate change could result in a perfect storm of creating the ideal climatic conditions for pathogens such as the mycobacterium tuberculosis to thrive in vulnerable communities already stressed by the impacts of the above disruptions. TB most often affects the lungs. It is the second-deadliest infectious killer after Covid-19. In 2021, men accounted for 56.5% of the TB burden, women for 32.5% and children for 11%. Many new cases, says the WHO, are attributable to five risk factors: undernutrition, HIV infection, alcohol use disorders, smoking and diabetes. All these risk metrics are prevalent in South Africa in addition to economic, financial and social barriers, and stigmas that affect access to health care for TB diagnosis and completion of treatment. Disturbingly, over half of patients and their households in South Africa face catastrophic total costs due to TB. The failure to bring the disease under control underlines the perversities and fragility of humanity\' s response and inability to contain if not eradicate a disease that various stakeholders persistently tell us is  preventable and curable . If we can\' t do this for historical pandemics such as TB, malaria and polio, what hope is there of achieving the much-vaunted and complex rubrics of climate action \- mitigation, adaptation and finance? In 2021, while India, China, Indonesia, Philippines and Myanmar accounted for 90% of the global reduction in case notifications of people newly diagnosed with TB compared with 2019, South Africa did not feature. The severity of national TB epidemics, in terms of the number of incident TB cases per 100 000 population per year, also shows that in 2021, South Africa is in the higher tensile of 500 cases per 100 000 population. South Africa is also one of 10 countries with the largest gaps between notifications of new and relapse (incident) TB cases and the best estimates of TB incidence in 2021; and that account for about 70% of the global gap between the estimated global incidence of MDR/RR-TB each year and the number of people enrolled in treatment in 2021.  Continued challenges with providing and accessing essential TB services, notes the WHO,  have meant that many people with TB were not diagnosed and treated. The reported number of people newly diagnosed with TB fell from 7.1m in 2019 to 5.8m in 2020. There was a partial recovery to 6.4m in 2021, but this was still well below pre-pandemic levels.  These reductions suggest that the number of people with undiagnosed and untreated TB has grown, resulting in increased TB deaths, more community transmission of infection and after some lag-time, increased numbers of people developing TB. The number of people provided with treatment for RR-TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) also declined between 2019 and 2020. The reported number of people started on treatment for RR-TB in 2021 was 161 746, only about one in three of those in need. On the positive side, South Africa, is also one of seven high TB burden countries that reached or passed the first milestone of a 20% reduction in the TB incidence rate compared with 2015, and collectively accounted for 82% of those started on preventive treatment in 2021. To their credit, some 79% of TB funding in 2021 was from domestic sources, as in the previous 10 years. But there was a decline in global spending on essential TB services from $6 billion (R103bn) in 2019 to $5.4bn in 2021, which is less than half of the global target of $13bn annually by 2022. As elsewhere, climate adaptation finance and international donor funding for TB response, while crucial, remains immorally inadequate. Whether the 2022 World TB Report  urgently redoubles efforts to get the TB response back-on-track to reach TB targets, save lives, and put a stop to this long-time killer , as Dr Tereza Kasaeva, director of WHO\' s Global TB Programme, hopes for, leading up to the second UN High Level Meeting on TB next year, only time will tell!

Janse Rabie, the legal and policy executive at Agri SA has been appointed to the Presidential Climate Commission by President Ramaphosa. The announcement comes as the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - COP27 - gets underway in Egypt this week. The body has a central role to play as South Africa works to adapt to and mitigate the effects and causes of climate change.With the agricultural sector amongst the most affected by this phenomenon, the appointment to the commission of a representative for the sector is an important step in building the consensus the sector needs to effectively address the challenges before it, said Agri SA statement.South Africa is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement, and the Presidential Climate Commission was established to coordinate and oversee the just transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy, as envisioned under this convention and international agreement.Agri sector and climate changeThe agricultural sector both affects and is affected by climate change. Work is currently taking place to address the causes and effects of climate change, including the Climate Change Bill which is currently moving through parliament, and the agricultural sector must play an integral role as South Africa formulates a coherent and effective response to the growing threat.While climate change poses risks for South Africa, it also presents great opportunities for innovation and homegrown solutions in the agricultural sector and beyond. Agri SA, in its statement, said tat it has been steadfast in its appeal for the inclusion of more representatives from the agricultural sector, a necessity if South Africa is going to develop a holistic approach to the just transition that creates new opportunities for young South Africans across all sectors of the economy.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/233265.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/233265.html :EMBED-->In addition to his role as legal and policy executive at Agri SA, Rabie is also the organisation s head of natural resources. An attorney by training, he holds a Master of Laws degree in marine and environmental law from the University of Cape Town. Since joining Agri SA in 2017, he has been instrumental in elevating the importance of the agricultural sector s vital relationship with, and reliance on, the natural environment."No one lives closer to, relies more upon, or is more affected by the climate and our natural environment than our farmers. I look forward to bringing the perspectives and experience of Agri SA and the agricultural sector to the important work currently being performed by the Presidential Climate Commission," said Rabie."South Africa s food security in coming years will depend on our ability to maintain a sustainable environment for farming. We, therefore, look forward to working with other sections of the economy and of society to ensure that we make progress towards the goal of creating a resilient and prosperous country for generations to come." \</doc>

While rolling blackouts and increasing fuel costs continue to cripple South Africa, delegates at the first Green Hydrogen Summit in Cape Town this week were told it was time to move in a new direction. The summit was attended by ministers and delegates all eager to see the country\' s potential as a large-scale, low-cost, green hydrogen production hub and investment destination. Green hydrogen (GH2) is created when water is split into oxygen and hydrogen using wind or solar energy, and can be used as an alternative fuel to power industrial processes. Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, head of Infrastructure and Investment in the Presidency, said South Africa was regarded as one of the main future suppliers of green hydrogen products to the world due to the  outstanding potential of renewable energy sources and existing hydrogen production facilities . Kaashifah Beukes, CEO of the Freeport Saldanha Industrial Development Zone, which is establishing a green hydrogen hub in Saldanha, said green hydrogen could be used as a lever for electricity availability and the strengthening of the grid as the country tackled critical energy challenges. GH2 has been forecast to play a significant role not only in South Africa, but in global transitions to net zero energy systems as well as decarbonisation in heavy industry, long haul freight, shipping and aviation. Beukes said:  We can use green hydrogen to leverage a more resilient electricity grid and availability. You need a lot of renewable energy in a production system in order to make green hydrogen, but the efficiencies of these systems are not 100%, so there is excess electricity that can be released on to our grid from these projects. The Western Cape and Northern Cape provinces announced plans to build a green hydrogen corridor. Premier Alan Winde and Northern Cape Premier Zamani Saul signed a landmark memorandum of understanding as the two provinces were identified as potential GH2 hubs. President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered the keynote address and said the sector presented a unique opportunity for South Africa to link its mineral endowment with its renewable energy endowment to drive industrialisation. With the summit coming just after COP27 , Ramaphosa highlighted that these gatherings of world leaders were becoming ever more urgent given the devastation caused by the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather occurrences. Ramaphosa recently released for public comment a Just Energy Transition Investment Plan as the basis for South Africa\' s pathway towards a low-carbon and climate-resilient society in which green hydrogen was identified as one of four  big frontiers . Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille said there were already a number of green hydrogen projects under way in the country. \</doc>

LOW-CARBON TRANSITIONStrategic role of PGMs in creation of a viable hydrogen economy in SA Implementing strategies in hydrogen society road map will ensure the country becomes a global participantSA's transition to a low-carbon economy is well under way. And we possess the world's largest reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs), which are essential to this transition. We can expect demand for PGMs to increase given how critical they are for the hydrogen economy, one of the gateways to global net-zero targets. But is SA gearing itself to leverage off this endowment? Green hydrogen is one of the three priority sectors identified by SA in the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) that was unveiled by President Cyril Ramaphosa as part of SA's preparation for the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). The plan was approved by the cabinet and is being presented to our partners at COP27 . This is an opportune time to investigate how best to leverage our mineral endowment for economic development underpinning the transition to a low-carbon economy. SA is the top platinum producer globally, and its PGM reserves include platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium. These are used in the production of industrial chemicals such as ammonia, fine chemicals, electronics, medical devices and jewellery. But the major application is in the automotive sector as catalysts. The transition towards electric vehicles in the near future will alter PGM demand. However, as hydrogen technologies such as electrolysers and fuel cells for stationary and transport applications become widely used for clean energy, the demand for PGMs is expected to further increase. PGMs are used as catalysts in electrolysers and fuel cells. The former are used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, while fuel cells are used to produce clean energy by the chemical reaction of reductant (hydrogen or other hydrocarbons) and oxygen. Electrolysers are needed to produce green hydrogen, which can ultimately decarbonise sectors such as chemicals, agriculture (green ammonia), aviation (power fuels) and steel (green steel). Fuel cells are needed to provide "clean" electricity that can be used to power buildings and vehicles. Therefore, both electrolysers and fuel cells will play a major role in decarbonisation strategies to reach net-zero emissions. The ultimate challenge for achieving a hydrogen economy is producing cost-competitive green hydrogen in large quantities. Hydrogen is now produced cheaply from fossil fuels. Hydrogen technologies will not be fully implemented until green hydrogen can be produced at equally competitive prices. There are encouraging signs in this regard: renewable energy is needed to produce green hydrogen, and the cost of renewables is already beginning to fall. However, it will be important to accelerate procurement of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, and to develop infrastructure for these technologies to lower their cost. In addition, the infrastructure for hydrogen storage and distribution must be developed if green hydrogen is to be competitively priced. SA has produced a hydrogen society road map to support the establishment of the hydrogen economy. It is based on the government's strategies and policy direction for bringing together stakeholders and institutions around a common vision for how to use hydrogen and hydrogen-related technologies to promote economic development and greening objectives. As SA moves to implement the strategies contained in the road map it has the potential to become an important player, participant and scientific thought leader in the emerging global hydrogen system. SA will need to accelerate the pace of development of its hydrogen economy if it is to derive benefits when it comes to exports of green hydrogen products. This is because the country will be competing for the same markets with other countries in the Southern African Development Community that have similar renewable energy resources. A consistent supply of critical metals is needed to produce green energy, sustainable transport and storage technologies to achieve the goal of a net climate-neutral energy system by 2050. Energy transition measures focus on support and affordability, while overlooking the availability of materials, an equally critical factor. A coherent and long-term approach, where the availability and use of materials also become a consideration, is fundamental for success. Policies on both the renewable energy transition and the circular economy do not adequately factor in the availability of materials. SA has a long history of minerals being mined in the country and exported to other regions where value addition occurs. To realise the ambitions outlined in the JET-IP regarding green hydrogen we need to break away from this cycle and build mineral beneficiation value chains that meet the requirements of the hydrogen economy. This highlights the centrality of SA and Africa in the transition to a low-carbon future globally. African mineral endowments are central to such a future, and this fact should be used as a lever at COP negotiations. SA should ensure that it retains its competitiveness in the PGM sector globally, for its economic sustenance and for its low-carbon transition strategies. This can be done through the creation of a thriving hydrogen economy. Mechanisms to achieve this already exist in the country, but they need to be reinforced. First, PGM beneficiation through catalyst development for fuel-cell and electrolyser applications will ensure mineral value addition occurs in SA. This beneficiation strategy will create markets and new applications for PGMs and facilitate the scaling up and deployment of fuel cell technologies to support critical infrastructure. Second, support from industry and the private sector is critical: it will enable SA's research & development efforts to be channelled towards product commercialisation, which is often a challenge in the country's system of innovation. Third, the government must create an enabling environment for a thriving hydrogen economy. This includes putting in place the necessary policies. SA has made progress with the approval of the presidential climate commission's framework for a just transition in SA, and with the hydrogen society road map. Both documents set out steps for implementation. In addition, SA's mineral beneficiation strategy provides a framework seeking to use the mineral endowments to support the overall competitiveness of the economy and promotes the green or low-carbon economy. Also, the strategies contained in the SA PGM industry road map and SA's hydrogen commercialisation strategy are being drafted to support the hydrogen economy. The creation of an enabling environment must include funding support for R& D, and skills development programmes to ensure there will be a capable workforce for the hydrogen economy. It must also include science diplomacy initiatives that ensure engagement with international partners and facilitate the deployment of hydrogen technology demonstration prototypes (fuel cells and electrolysers for energy needs). These need to be rolled out across the country to support service delivery and to encourage public awareness of and engagement with the new technologies. Connecting all these requirements should be a strong partnership between the government, research institutions, the private sector and civil society. These partnerships are critical in ensuring that projects succeed, a common vision is maintained, and SA's hydrogen economy is guided by the just transition framework.

Mauto, a leading electric two-wheeler in Africa, has announced the first closing of a $5m transaction in the voluntary carbon offset market. The funding agreement with Aera, one of Africa's leading carbon credit traders, and myclimate, a Swiss nonprofit climate protection organisation committed to transparency in carbon footprint measurement, will be spread over the next three years. "There are effective ways to finance the ecological transition in Africa and to make it affordable and sustainable. No population will accept this without strong support. That s the whole point of this operation," insists Shegun Adjadi Bakari, CEO of Mauto.With COP27 taking place in Egypt, the signing of this $5m deal - one of the largest in Africa in terms of carbon credits for electric mobility - will help to immediately meet the continent's commitments to a sustainable energy transition."This agreement is proof that Africa is in an offensive position on energy transition and that industrial players are ready for innovative partnerships ", explains the director.The contract covers the reduction of emissions generated by Mauto, which plans to deploy over 2 million electric motorbikes in Africa by 2030.The company has been present in Benin and Togo for four months now with 2,700 electric motorbikes on the road. The brand will be rolled out before the end of the year in Rwanda. By 2030, the aim is to be operational in over ten countries across Africa.Addressing the challenge of electrificationThe closing of the transaction, while accelerating the deployment of electric two-wheelers in Africa, will also address the challenge of electrification.Approximately 80% of the electricity that will be used to charge the electric vehicles will come from photovoltaic charging stations that will be installed as the roll-out progresses.Since its launch, the company has been dedicated to urban, ecological and affordable mobility and is working towards building its own carbon-neutral assembly plants to be ready by 2024. In order to certify the achievement of its environmental and social commitments, the company intends to obtain the Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta) label issued by Verra.Shegun Adjadi Bakari, chief executive officer of Mauto and partner at the African Fund for Transformation and Industrialization Fund (ATIF), says: "There are effective ways to finance the ecological transition in Africa and to make it affordable and sustainable. No population will accept this without strong support. That s the whole point of this operation.""With this transaction, Mauto hopes to demonstrate its ability to rapidly execute its global green transition strategy in Africa and its power to change everyday life in African cities by reducing traffic pollution, a major public health concern for urban populations.""It is a great pleasure and honour to be the carbon finance pioneer for Africa's largest electric motorbike programme. We are pleased to generate revenue from carbon credits to reduce the cost of leasing electric motorbikes and to help Mauto raise additional funds to accelerate its rollout in Africa," says Fabrice Le Sach\'e9, president of Aera Group. \</doc>

Nestl\'e9 East & Southern Africa Region (ESAR) has ramped up renewable energy investment at its Babelegi manufacturing plant in Hammanskraal, which produces Nestl\'e9 Cremora and Maggi 2-minute Noodles. The food and beverage giant has installed a solar plant at the site, comprising a ground-mounted system, with a capacity of 966kW. The 1 806 solar PV panels are expected to deliver some 2 128 149 kWh of energy per annum, equating to 15.6% of the total electrical energy requirement of the factory for the full year.This move is in line with Nestle s 2030 ambition to achieve zero environmental impact in its operations and net zero emissions by 2050.This is Nestl\'e9's second significant renewable energy project at a factory in the region, with its Harrismith manufacturing plant having been completed in August 2022 and sized with a capacity of 1 189kW, including a ground-mounted system and additional solar PV capacity on the roofs of the new carport structures.In Harrismith, the 1 946 solar PV panels are expected to deliver some 1 714 191 kWh of energy per annum - 10% of the total electrical energy requirement of the factory for the full year. The system will generate approximately 45% of the factory s demand during daylight hours.Towards a 100% renewable energy procurement goal One of the key messages coming out of the COP27 climate conference was the importance of action and implementation to advance climate action. As a business, we firmly believe that taking action however big or small throughout our value chain, is how we will begin to make an impact on the climate crisis. We also believe that there is an opportunity to decrease GHG emissions through an increase in low-emission and renewable energy. Nestl\'e9 commits to having a strategy to procure 100% of electricity from renewable sources within the shortest practical timescale. The first phase of the renewable projects pegged to deliver just over 3% of Nestl\'e9 ESAR's power requirements has gone online, says Xolile White, technical director at Nestl\'e9 ESAR.The second phase of the renewable energy projects is set to add five additional development sites; extending Babelegi s second phase expansion to 1 500 000kWh, or 11% of annual electricity requirement for the factory. Additional sites are East London, Estcourt, Potchefstroom, and the Nestl\'e9 Quality Assurance Centre in Johannesburg. These are expected to deliver a total combined capacity of 5.7GW, which is 5% of Nestl\'e9 ESAR s energy requirements.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/348/232931.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/348/232931.html :EMBED-->Critical moment for our planetWhite adds, In this critical moment for our planet, we are committed to finding solutions that deliver tangible results to the business.

South Africa\' s $8.5 billion (about R146bn) climate deal is being used as a blueprint as wealthy nations extend similar offers to Indonesia, Vietnam and other emerging markets that are heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The COP27 Among the contentious issues is the need for a new fund to help countries deal with the immediate impacts of climate change, the phasing out of fossil fuels and the means to decrease dangerous levels of global warming. The biggest sticking point by far is the need for a new fund to help countries deal with the immediate impacts of climate change. However, South Africa\' s Cabinet recently approved an investment plan for a $8.5bn package to accelerate the country\' s transition away from coal towards clean energy, which has been heralded as a step in the right direction for other developing nations to follow. The plan outlines the investments required to achieve the decarbonisation commitments made by the government, while promoting sustainable development and ensuring a just transition for affected workers and communities. The package stipulates that Indonesia commits to capping carbon dioxide emissions from its electricity sector at 290 megatons by 2030 \- an peak that will apply not just to its conventional grid, but also to power suppliers for industrial facilities. South Africa, according to industry players, can also learn from Vietnam. Climate expert Nick Hedley said:  In 2020, Vietnam added 9GW of rooftop solar power in only a few months, to avert an energy crisis. All it needed was some incentives from government. Why can\' t we do the same? BlackRock, the world\' s biggest asset manager, said rich countries should be giving developing nations $100bn a year in grants alone. Hedley said this would save them money down the line by averting a full-blown climate catastrophe.  Year after year, wealthy nations have fallen well short of their promise to provide $100bn annually in climate finance to the global south.  It\' s encouraging that the momentum is picking up, and countries like India will probably be next in line after South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam.  It\' s important, however, that these transactions are as fair as possible. The proportion of grants in the funding mix needs to improve, and the interest rates on concessional loans need to be as low as possible. So far, the loans South Africa has received are priced at 3.3% on average. There\' s room for improvement, he said. South Africa\' s funding deal, backed by the US, UK and EU, was unveiled at last year\' s UN-led climate talks in Glasgow. Leo Roberts of think tank E3G\' s coal transition team, said it was imperative that correct protocol was followed.  The whole world is watching to see if the money is actually mobilised in South Africa. It\' s extremely important that donors follow through with their commitments, said Roberts. \</doc>

PUTTING SA ON MAP President defends his UK visit amid power crisis President Cyril Ramaphosa has hit back at those who accuse him of "gallivanting" while SA battles an electricity crisis. "Much as I want to be present in the country all the time to address the challenges, there are times when we have to let those who are supposed to do the work do their job," Ramaphosa said on Thursday at the end of his two-day visit to the UK. When he arrived in London on Monday, load-shedding was bumped up to stage 5. He was criticised and accused of "having tea" with King Charles while South Africans were in the dark. Speaking from South Africa House in London, Ramaphosa said he was aware South Africans felt "abandoned", but ministers and executives must be allowed to do their jobs without interference. "I then do other work, which is to put SA on the global map and advocate for increasing investments in our country - that is the job the head of state must do, supported by ministers. I brought four minister here [to the UK] who have been involved in a variety of actions and interventions to promote investment," he said. Ramaphosa's s recent trips to attend the Group of 20 and COP27 were "well announced and publicised" in advance. "I have done that on two occasions, and I have been heavily criticised for coming home - why do I abandon visits that could benefit SA? And this time around this visit to the UK was well known and announced. Even as I left, we had the challenge of increased load-shedding, and it had to do with the diesel shortage, financial challenges which I am attending to with ministers. "I have ministers whose job is to address these issues, and once we have the framework such as the one we have in place to address our energy challenges, [the] minister as well as the executives of those entities are meant to address that, and I remain in constant contact, up to three to four times a day, being informed of what's happening and putting forward proposals and taking decisions. "The UK represents the biggest foreign direct investors in SA so we have to talk to them to invest more and participate in our transformation. This was also an opportunity to tell UK business of the just energy transition and inform them SA needs more funding from more developed countries, that they must live up to the commitments they made in Paris and COP26 and there should be compensation for damage to the climate," said Ramaphosa. President Cyril Ramaphosa has explained why he did not cancel his working visit to the UK despite criticism for leaving at the height of load-shedding. Picture: AARON CHOWN/POOL VIA REUTERS \</doc>

At Cop27 in Sharm El Sheikh, vice-president Ambroise Fayolle of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and chief executive officer, Patrick Dlamini of the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) formally agreed EIB financing in South Africa that will back a new targeted financing programme to unlock (EURO)400m for private sector renewable energy investment across South Africa. The 400m initiative (R7.2bn equivalent) will be backed by 200m from the EIB and provide financing for a range of new renewable energy projects across South Africa.The scheme will help to increase clean energy power generation and contribute to DBSA s embedded generation investment programme (EGIP). The new initiative is expected to generate an additional 1200 MW of generating capacity and avoid 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions once all the supported projects are operational.The projects it will finance are expected to create hundreds of new jobs during construction and operation and support local companies.DBSA chief executive officer, Patrick Dlamini commented: The Development Bank of Southern Africa has a clear goal to increase investment in renewable energy and improve energy security, not only in South Africa but across the African continent."South Africa, like many African countries, is already suffering the effects of climate change. This new investment from the EIB in our embedded generation investment programme is an important contribution to South Africa s resilient and sustainable growth. <!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/233314.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/233314.html :EMBED-->EIB vice-president, Ambroise Fayolle added: As the EU climate bank, the EIB is committed to supporting South Africa s efforts to decarbonise and this agreement of the largest ever EIB investment in South Africa follows past support for renewable energy and climate-adaptation projects across the country."EIB Global is pleased to build on three decades of partnership with DBSA to boost renewable energy generation which will contribute to energy security and a just transition in South Africa."The EIB is stepping up our efforts to support green energy projects globally, with a special focus on Africa and economies dependent on carbon-intensive activities that are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Embedded generation investment programmeDBSA s embedded generation investment programme supports the development and upscaling of solar photovoltaic and wind renewable energy embedded generation projects, developed by independent power producers operating in South Africa.Embedded generation is the production of electricity from smaller-scale power stations and is usually defined as projects that are planned for their own use.EGIP offers a credit support mechanism through the provision of risk capital.Less expensive, onshore wind and energy efficiencyThe financing will be available for renewable energy projects solar photovoltaic and onshore wind energy generation and potentially also energy efficiency projects promoted by the private sector in South Africa.These projects are expected to provide a reliable source of energy for South Africans at a lower cost than fossil fuel alternatives. The EIB facility complements the just energy transition partnership with South Africa, which focuses on support to the public sector.EIB-DBSA partnershipThis new operation builds on a longstanding successful partnership between EIB and DBSA going back to 1995, when the EIB first started working in South Africa.Since then, the EIB and DBSA have worked together on 11 projects, including a climate action facility that is currently being implemented, but also supporting municipal infrastructure such as for water, sanitation and education. \</doc>

POWER SUPPLY Transnet seeks renewable energy to shift freight Transnet seeks renewable energy to shift freight The company on Monday issued a notice calling for private sector players to submit project proposals for a renewable energy programme to supply power to its five main corridors. The request for information will mainly be used to gauge market appetite, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The move indicates the company's ambition to eventually move away from Eskom-supplied power, which is prone to frequent disruptions due to the power utility's old and unreliable power stations. The request coincides with the global climate conference, COP27 , at which global leaders are meeting to discuss ways to cut global emissions and move away from fossil fuels in favour of clean energy sources. The freight division's infrastructure is used to transport crucial commodities such as coal and iron ore to port in SA and its neighbours and is therefore energy intensive. During the 2021/2022 financial year, TFR says it consumed in excess of 1,800GWh on traction energy. "TFR seeks to understand how affordable renewable electric energy can be integrated in its traction power supplies to improve energy security and efficiency and reduce its operational impact on the environment," the company said. "Primarily the loads which TFR aims to supply on its vast rail network are traction loads, which are intermittent in nature with high peak and short duration demand periods." The division maintains a rail network of about 31,000 track kilometres (20,900 route kilometres). The move to electrify its main corridors with renewable energy follows the lead of Transnet's ports division. TFR's main corridors are its ore-line corridor (Sishen to Saldanha), the north corridor (for coal export from Lephalale to Richards Bay), the northeast corridor (Polokwane, Nelspruit, Phalaborwa, Komatipoort), central corridor (Botswana, Krugersdorp, Johannesburg), the container corridor (Johannesburg to Durban) and the Cape corridor (Hotazel to Kimberley, Bloemfontein, De Aar to Gqeberha and Cape Town). It intends to introduce an energy mix that includes solar, wind and hybrids of hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal. The request for information "objective is to establish the existing and envisioned renewable energy projects, to assess the potential for electricity wheeling and for joint venture development partnership[s] with [the] private sector for self-generation", TFR said. Responses to the request for information may be localised and need not cover the whole country, corridor or region. Documents can be accessed at the National Treasury's e-tender publication portal. The Minerals Council SA welcomed the news, saying any steps to decarbonise the broader economy were to be welcomed. Securing renewable energy for the rail and ports infrastructure is a step in the right direction if it ensures more reliable and cost-efficient transport logistics. The council said there were, however, issues such as security, locomotive spares, maintenance problems and productivity issues within Transnet that needed to be dealt with urgently so the country could fully realise its export potential. maekot@businesslive.co.za \</doc>

KATE OKARIIn 2016, during a visit to the oil-rich Niger Delta, Kelo Uchendu witnessed the impact of acid rain for the first time. As the rain came down, people hurriedly closed drums used for storing water. He was told this was done because the rain was so acidic that it contaminated drinking water and made people sick. "I asked why people were not talking about this," Uchendo said. He learnt that acidic aerosols from gas flaring and refinery operations were falling to Earth when it rained, causing deforestation and affecting farming and even infrastructure. He also learnt that above-average levels of carbon dioxide in the air were turning the oceans acid. "There is no direct connection between climate change and acidic rainfall, but the study exposed me to the other issue of ocean acidification," he said. He decided to do something to draw attention to these issues. Two years later, while still a mechanical engineering student at the University of Nigeria, Uchendu launched the Gray2Green Movement. Today, at 26, Uchendu is the policy lead for YOUNGO, which is the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) children and youth constituency. He is responsible for ensuring the voices of young people are heard at COP27 , and he and his colleagues have been developing a "Global Youth Statement" for the event. Despite resistance to his calls for a louder youth "voice", in 2020 he joined forces with more than 330 young climate activists to organise a "Mock COP26". Afterwards, Uchendu contacted Nigerian lawmaker Samuel Onuigbo, who was preparing to propose the Climate Action Bill for the second time. "We worked with him to push for the inclusion of the conference's demands in the bill," Uchendu said. The bill - passed into law as the Climate Change Act, 2021 - reflected a commitment by the Nigerian government to achieve net zero (reducing carbon emissions to the lowest amount) by 2060 - not easy for a country that relies so heavily on oil exports. While the country has moved to limit gas flaring and decarbonise gas operations, oil is expected to play a key role in the economy for years. In the Niger Delta, residents continue to complain about acidic rainfall and their degrading environment. With the region's mangrove forests, creeks and farmlands heavily contaminated by oil, much still need to be done to reverse the effect of harmful human activities on the environment. "We have to commit to decarbonising our major energy sectors," Uchendu said. - bird story agency MAKING MOVES: Kelo Uchendu, the policy lead of YOUNGO, at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change children and youth constituency.

Finance minister Enoch Godongwana has promised details on the size, timing and conditions of the Eskom debt relief package when he tables his medium-term budget policy statement on October 26. "We will be saying what is the quantum over what period, and what are the conditions to be attached, because if Eskom does not make efficiency improvements we are likely to come back ... moving forward, Eskom must be able to invest in productive infrastructure," he said. As the strike at ailing Transnet continues to cripple exports and the economy, Godongwana also said he will say something about Transnet in the budget statement. "It presented a facade of an efficient institution, but now things begin to burst out into the open ... If we don't make an intervention we are going to have another Eskom on our hands," he said, adding any intervention is likely to include financial and operational aspects. Markets are eagerly awaiting the details of an Eskom debt solution after President Cyril Ramaphosa promised this in July when he announced his energy emergency plan and said the debt would be addressed in the medium-term budget. Eskom's operations do not generate enough cash to meet the interest and capital payments on its almost R400bn of debt, much of which is guaranteed by the government. It depends on large annual cash infusions from the government. Godongwana and Treasury officials said in July that the government would take over a portion of the Eskom debt and promised "broad brush" details at budget time. RMB Morgan Stanley economist Andrea Masia calculates that if the government were to take over R250bn of Eskom's guaranteed debt in 2023/2024 this would lift the government's debt ratio to 72%, from the 68.5% it would otherwise have been. He argued this is an "opportune time to address the Eskom overhang", with the fiscal deficit likely to come in far lower than February's budget estimate thanks to the revenue windfall and well-contained spending growth. SA has since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic borrowed more than $8bn from multilateral institutions including the IMF and World Bank. Godongwana said he spent a lot of his time in Washington in talks on climate financing for SA, including on the $8.5bn just energy transition investment plan due to be announced at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt next month. The IMF now expects SA's economy to grow 2.1% in 2022, with a strong recovery in the services sector, particularly tourism, helping to offset the effect of load-shedding and floods. But it expects growth to fall to 1.1% in 2023, with external conditions deteriorating and commodity prices correcting.

Greta Thunberg says teenagers have been  betrayed by those in power. The 19-year-old, who became known around the world when she staged regular school strikes outside the Swedish parliament in 2018 to protest against climate change and has gone on to become a figurehead of the movement, recently announced her decision to avoid COP27 this month in Egypt, having accused the UN of  green-washing its annual summit. But when asked how she felt about UK prime minister Rishi Sunak also choosing to skip the event, she said it was a sign of government failure.  All these individual cases have many different reasons why they made these decisions, so of course we shouldn\' t be focussing ourselves blindly to just one example.  The people in power do not really prioritise the climate crisis and have proven time and time again their priorities are somewhere else entirely; they would rather stay in power and serve the forces of greed. Thunberg said people needed to keep  demanding this change .  The change is going to come from the outside when enough people are demanding this change, because they are most likely going to do what they can, as long as they can get away with it. So we have to make sure that they do not get away with it. To deal with the idea of being a frontrunner in the campaign, she said:  I usually go for very, very long walks, to try to clear my head. It shouldn\' t have to be like this, this responsibility shouldn\' t have to fall on teenagers at all. The fact that there are young people, mostly, who have to take up this fight is a sign of betrayal and failure from those in power. Thuunberg said there had been a  difference in activism since her rise to fame because  millions have joined her in protest, but claimed that the action taken had been  not nearly enough and  we need everyone to play a part in managing the crisis. Speaking on UK TV show This Morning on ITV, she said:  You could look at it in a way that emissions are still on the rise and we are speeding in the wrong direction. We are still expanding fossil fuels for infrastructure and so on. There is no sense of urgency whatsoever. No one is acting if we are in a crisis.  But on the other hand, of course, we have had millions of people flooding the streets and demanding action.  So, it depends on how you see it. Of course, there has been a difference but not nearly enough. It\' s very difficult to describe. We never thought that it would be possible to do anything like that. In the beginning, it was just me, and then it was a handful of others \- schoolchildren.  We just thought that since we had the opportunity to do something, it was our moral duty to go out and act. Someone needed to take action so we just did it. We didn\' t count on any consequences or so on, we just did it. | Bang Showbiz \</doc>

Africa's climate has warmed more than the global average since pre-industrial times. Similarly, sea level rise along the continent's coastlines is quicker than the global average, contributing to increased frequency and severity of coastal flooding and erosion in low-lying areas.\~ The increase in temperature has led to intense and frequent heatwaves, extensive floods, tropical cyclones and prolonged droughts, which have undermined human life, had a negative effect on food and water security and hampered socioeconomic development on the continent.\~ Extreme weather patterns have caused significant damage to homes and infrastructure and displaced millions of people.

But there are differing opinions on what a loss and damage fund should be or contain, including whether loss and damage constitute a type of accountability and whether compensation or even reparations need to be paid.\~ One-time payments from developed nations are unrealistic because climate consequences are projected to worsen in the future, inflicting much greater damage. A facility such as a solidarity fund is an appropriate option because it does not transfer liabilities. But it will not push wealthier nations to mobilise funds (as demonstrated by the $100 billion a year promise made by developed countries).

German boost for green hydrogen Addition to R5bn concessional loans to the Treasury Grant funding from KfW to be managed by the PIC are Energy WriterGermany's KfW Development Bank will provide about R400m in grant funding to support the development of SA's green hydrogen economy and bolster its transition to renewable energy. The funds will be managed by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and are in addition to the \€ 300m (about R5bn) concessional loan agreement that KfW recently concluded with National Treasury to support SA's efforts to reduce its reliance on coal in the energy sector via the Just Energy Transition Partnership. The announcement was made at the start of the SA Green Hydrogen Summit in Cape Town this week and coincided with a separate statement from the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) that it will provide early-stage capital for the development of SA's hydrogen value chain. The state-owned PIC is Africa's biggest asset manager, administering the pension funds of most government workers. SA has abundant supplies of platinum and sun and wind energy needed to establish a green hydrogen value chain and become an exporter of the green energy source. Infrastructure SA, a programme in the department of public works, has already identified a pipeline of 19 green hydrogen projects valued at more than R300bn. OFFTAKE However, to get the projects off the ground, SA will first have to secure offtake agreements and the necessary finance. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into its hydrogen and oxygen components via electrolysis using renewable energy such as solar or wind power. Public works minister Patricia de Lille told the summit on Tuesday that SA is competing against countries such as Chile and Australia, and several countries in the Middle East to capture a share of the global export market for green hydrogen. The demand for hydrogen reached an estimated 87-million tonnes in 2020 and is expected to grow to between 500-million and 680-million tonnes by 2050. Of this, the export market will account for 100Mt-180Mt. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who gave the opening address at the summit, said SA has the potential to produce between 6-million and 13-million tonnes of green hydrogen and derivatives a year by 2050. Green hydrogen, he said, has been identified as "one of the big four frontiers" in SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan launched earlier this month at the COP27 climate summit at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. "According to the plan SA will need $98bn [about R1.6-trillion] over the next five years to enable a just transition and achieve our ambitious emissions reduction targets," Ramaphosa said. Reaching the green hydrogen production volumes mentioned by Ramaphosa would require the installation of between 140GW and 300GW of renewable energy - about four to seven times more than SA's total installed generation capacity. "The potential for green hydrogen to become a thriving sector for SA is huge. The government will work with the sector to create an enabling environment for investors ... to create much needed jobs," De Lille said. The first phase of the project could create more than 10,500 jobs over the course of its construction and operation, the public works minister said. erasmusd@businesslive.co.za \</doc>

How does one remain hopeful in a time of deep and dark crisis? https://mg.co.za/environment/2021-09-23-adaptation-should-be-central-to-climate-crisis-talks-heres-why/ Amina Mohammed has been an advocate of "stubborn optimism" long before it became fashionable. The United Nations deputy secretary general, a former environment minister in the Nigerian government, was in Cape Town last Friday to deliver the annual Archbishop Desmond Tutu lecture.\~ She told a packed city hall that even though "our world is in crisis with Africa left behind, yet again" that "inspired and humbled by his legacy I am here as a servant of the global townhall, to our global village, the United Nations, calling for global transformation, shepherded by Archbishop Tutu's steadfast commitment to hope and healing." Given what HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-05-27-africa-can-build-back-better-after-covid-19/ Mohammed calls the "multitude of cascading and compounding crises" - from the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-change/ climate crisis to increasing levels of poverty and inequality caused by the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/economic-recovery/ Covid-19 pandemic , to geopolitical insecurity arising from the HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/russia-ukraine-war/ Russian invasion of HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/ukraine/ Ukraine and the knock-on effect on global energy prices and, consequently, the cost of food - it is often hard to remain hopeful.\~ The rational response to the facts is to be pessimistic about the future. But, to give up hope would be to accept a Hobbesian hell in which human life on Earth is increasing "nasty, brutish and short", thereby reversing the human development gains of the past 70 years. The case for "stubborn optimism" is made in a book co-authored by Christiana Figueres, The Future We Choose HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/paris-agreement/ Paris agreement reached at the annual climate change negotiations (COP) in the French capital in HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/paris-climate-agreement/ 2015 . On the morning after her Tutu lecture, Mohammed says that seven years after Paris the promise of a 1.5\'baC world - the pivotal target agreed upon in Paris - was "on a lifeline" last year. COP26, in Glasgow in late 2021, was about "saving Paris". COP27 will be hosted by Egypt next month.\~ I ask Mohammed what the idea of an "African COP" means to her. It has to be the "implementation COP", she says, building on the progress made in Glasgow. This response is in keeping with her non-flashy reputation for granularity and practical solutions ahead of slogans. "If it doesn't happen in Africa then where is it going to happen?" Quick as a flash, and before I can ask the obvious follow-up, she puts it to herself: "What does that mean? It is a focus on two of the main five pillars that we see - adaptation [to the negative effects of climate change] and the money for adaptation; can we double what we are getting and can we disburse it, can we put it into the pipelines and programmes and transitions that we say are needed for the 1.5degrees world?\~ "What does that look like on the ground - is it part of the energy transition that we say must be 'just' and what does that look like? Or is it part of the food systems transformation? Is it about connecting everyone so that you can get on with these transitions?" All good questions. Mohammed accepts that the energy crisis, which is a "big shock to Europe", is having a negative effect on food security in Africa and is complicating things greatly. Does this mean that COP27 will have to discuss issues of peace and security for the first time if the conflict in Ukraine is not to knock the world off of its urgent quest for a radically more sustainable relationship between people and planet, and between the economy and natural capital?\~\~ Mohammed is an experienced diplomat, adept at providing neat answers to difficult questions, which balance the need for a punchy enough soundbite with the need for credibility through substance.\~ "There is always the context in which we have the COP, right!", she replies, with the "right" crisply accentuated with an exclamation mark. " COP27 in Egypt will be about the geopolitical crisis that we have - Ukraine, Russia and the West. It will also be about that other shadow crisis between the US and its relations with China.\~ "It does complicate things. This is about supply chains, about finance, about whether there is a conducive environment to put the people who are needed around the table in the room. You saw how difficult it was to get the US, China and Europe around the table in Paris, which got us a remarkable outcome."\~ "Could we do that today?" Mohammed asks rhetorically. "Unlikely," she says with a wry laugh. "There are many exigencies that would not put the same people around the table." Hence, she admits, Egypt is as much about getting the right people in the room as it is about implementation.\~ This, after all, is what the UN does; this is its soft power. Given understandable cynicism about the pace of change and the ability of the UN to be more than a talk shop, I ask Mohammed what power the UN has to put pressure on powerful actors.\~ The UN "is not a person or a country", Mohammed explains. "It is a very complex family of 193. It is the convening and the forging of consensus, and spotlighting of what must be done, and talking through it. And bringing strange bedfellows together. So if we can't get the G20 around the table in a normal G20, then we must do so in other spaces - such as the roundtables that the UN secretary general convenes. A lot of it is shuttle diplomacy, behind the scenes. That is the power of the UN."\~ A concern about who it can get into the room is what keeps Mohammed awake at night, because "if you don't succeed then the trust that has already started to erode will leave us not in a good place" for the next COP in 2023, which is supposed to be a mid-term "stock-take" of progress on Paris.\~ Mohammed notes that Indonesia has this year "done a remarkable job keeping the G20 alive. Functioning? Question mark. But £live' is a huge dividend from a really complex space. So if we can see G20 countries in the room speaking to the solutions, to where they can unblock resources, then we can start to rebuild the trust." As a G20 country South Africa has an important role to play, not least because it is Africa's biggest economy. Since Cyril Ramaphosa ousted Jacob Zuma from power in 2018, the country has once again been viewed by international partners as an adult in the room. My words, not Mohammed's. She is a diplomat. But she has high hopes, based on what she calls the "remarkable leadership in Glasgow; they really kick-started our just energy transitions to put an end to coal. That has been a difficult journey, but has added another three, four countries." She refers to "the JETP", a new piece of jargon to add to a sector that is already jam-packed with acronyms. The world is watching HYPERLINK South Africa's Just Energy Transition Programme very closely. It could be a blueprint for many other places, including Indonesia, which is putting in place its own "country platform" to attract international climate finance and private investment to fund its own transition away from coal.\~ Two countries out of almost two hundred. This kind of transition needs to happen everywhere, and fast, if the world is to stand any chance of following a different economic development pathway in time to avoid the climate catastrophe that climate science is foretelling.\~ In Egypt, she wants South Africa to "speak to truth to power" in relation to climate finance - the resources that must necessarily come from developed countries to developing countries and emerging economies. In Glasgow a "political declaration" was signed and presented with great fanfare as the biggest pledge of climate finance ever - $8.5-billion - a positive outcome that might justify greater optimism.\~ The details of that deal are still being negotiated, led by former Absa chief executive Daniel Mminele based out of the presidency. Given what Mohammed calls the "unfulfilled commitments" made in Paris, she expresses candid concern about on-going resourcing. What will be the guarantees that the pledges made to South Africa, which is "putting its political neck on the line in its own country and the real lives of people in communities in a transition", will be honoured as the transition unfolds? Developed countries are "going to have to do a lot more than they have ever done before if they want the JETPs to work".\~ After all, the original climate finance commitment made as the Copenhagen COP collapsed in 2009, of $100-billion a year by 2020, has still not been reached. Mohammed regards that commitment as the "handshake, it's not the resources we need for real climate action", given the need to move from billions to trillions, and "if we can't even do the handshake what hope do we have of getting the rest on the table? So now we must do the two together: push for a firm handshake and then leverage existing mechanisms in the financial community."\~ In this regard, the UN wants the multilateral development banks (MDBs) to step up. There are calls for radical reform of the Bretton Woods institutions from numerous credible sources; led by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Motley, many leaders called for an overhaul of the IFIs. The role of IFIs is coming under considerable scrutiny in part because of the controversy about World Bank President David Malpass's commitment to the climate agenda.\~ "The MDBs are not disbursing funds, for reasons of their own, and it's important that they now step up," Mohammed says. "The shareholders somehow hang back when they need to lean forward to help the MDBs." Returning to the theme of hope and healing from the previous evening, and the delightful celebration of the life and legacy of "the Arch", Mohammed uses the word "dread" when she is reminded that the climate science clearly says that the world needs to follow a very different economic trajectory by 2030, just seven years away.\~ "I have to remain hopeful about the possibilities. Humanity's quite incredible. Look at the way we responded to Covid-19, to turn things around, and deploy resources, and to actually produce the vaccines faster than ever before. We did it. I have not given up because we can turn things around on a sixpence when there is a will. Right?"\~ There's that use of "right" again, expressing a firmness of intention and, yes, a stubborn optimism.\~ And, if she could channel Tutu, and put his voice into the decision-making rooms around the world, what truth would she have him speak to power? "Do it now or pay for it in a very personal way tomorrow. It's no longer about future generations, it's about now. Leaders are coming to the water but just not drinking the Kool-Aid. If the Arch was in the room the case he would make very strongly would be about ubuntu, right? It is about what is happening to me will happen to you. It's just a matter of time."

The dire consequences of climate change are revealing themselves every day across the world. The 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sixth assessment report has reinforced that, unless urgent action is taken, our collective futures are under threat. In addition to myriad other risks, the impact of climate change on food security emerges strongly throughout the report. It is imperative that the global agricultural sector takes action to help address the impending crisis, yet the scale of the problem is itself an impediment to effective action. Agriculture, like all other economic sectors, has to navigate complex global guidelines, national laws and industry and sector-specific constraints. This is a challenge that the recently signed Agriculture and Agro-processing Master Plan must address so there can be clear and consistent action to combat climate change - with urgency. To its credit, the plan does acknowledge the magnitude of climate change impacts on agriculture in South Africa and its strategic objectives specifically speak to enhancing resilience to the effects of climate change, promoting sustainable management of natural resources, and a commitment to a just energy transition.\~ However, the master plan does not elaborate on how this will be achieved. Rather, it leaves the responsibility with the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, and commodity organisations, to promote climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Time might prove this approach to be unwise. A challenge of this magnitude cannot be managed in silos; the plethora of existing policies at multiple levels requires a more holistic approach. Prior to the master plan, a number of sector bodies had already begun working on climate initiatives. Agri SA, for example, has been proactive in adopting a mandated position on climate change last year and is aiming to develop a climate change strategy for the sector. But these various frameworks will need to be harmonised to create a coherent, sectoral approach. This is true too of the policy and research mandated under the master plan. It isn't enough to say we need public-private partnerships to conduct research; we need to put the structures in place to facilitate collaboration of this work, and sooner rather than later. The challenge of coordination extends far beyond our sector and our national borders. National climate policy and legislation are mostly formed in line with international best practices through the UN Conference on Climate Change and the related Conference of the Parties (Cop) meetings held annually. The Paris Agreement is the most ambitious agreement since the international climate change commitments began in 1992. The Conference on Climate Change set the foundation for South African climate change law and policy development, while the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Cop meeting last year put obligations on South Africa to implement a just transition strategy towards a greener economy. It is, therefore, imperative that the agricultural sector's climate change strategy aligns with these commitments. In the short term, we also need a new approach to disaster management. Natural disasters as a consequence of extreme weather occurrences are indisputably on the rise. Weak and unsustainable infrastructure, poverty, insufficient developmental funding, weak public policy, lack of information, corruption and uncoordinated management efforts aggravate the devastating consequences of natural disasters. Yet, while the Agriculture and Agro-processing Master Plan recognises the necessity of developing a comprehensive disaster support strategy, it takes a narrow view of disaster management. We need an approach that includes numerous interventions, such as early-warning systems, resilience building, education and awareness campaigns and improving insurance coverage with a focus on financial support for the aftermath of disasters. On the legislative front, the Climate Change Bill currently under consideration by the National Assembly will, once enacted, become the primary source of climate change law in South Africa. It will, together with other laws, policies and plans already in place to address climate change, promote adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Under the bill, all sectors will need to develop adaptation plans. Resources will need to be devoted to the integration of the sector's plan, the master plan and the work of other government entities, including the departments of the environment, forestry and fisheries; water and sanitation and mineral resources; the National Disaster Management Centre and the national treasury. South Africa has a rapidly growing population, which will put it at greater risk of food insecurity unless we take urgent, well-coordinated action to combat climate change. Indeed, we have already experienced a number of serious occurrences over the past year with devastating consequences for entire industries and far too many households. We have no time to waste in taking the necessary steps to mitigate the impact of climate change on the daily lives of South Africans. Finally, the strategy must align with reality. The master plan participants will need to ensure the steps implemented pursuant to our international and sectoral ambitions do not hurt the sector's growth and employment creation potential, nor its central role in guaranteeing food security. We need to remember that the success of the sector depends on global competitiveness even as we work to shield our nation from the worst effects of climate change. Having a plan is good but it's not enough; effective implementation is what matters most. If we are going to prevent disruptions to food production that would dwarf the devastation of the recent past, we must work together to ensure effective, well-coordinated action to address the existential threat that climate change-related disasters pose to our nation's food security.

South Africa, June 22 -- AdNet Zero is the advertising industry's drive to reduce the carbon impact of developing, producing and running advertising to real net zero by 2030. The AdNet Zero programme was launched in the UK in November 2020 by the Advertising Association, ISBA and the IPA and counts over 100 advertisers, agencies, commercial media owners and production companies in its membership. Focus on US and EU The global advertising industry, as measured by advertising media investment, was worth $594,322bn in 2020. The top 20 advertising markets account for 89.3% of this spend and these markets, the US and EU that will be the immediate focus of the programme's rollout. The next update will be presented at the Ad Net Zero Global Summit which will take place online on 9 and 10 November, alongside COP27 . Going forward, progress will be shared and discussed at Cannes Lions each summer and the Global Summit each November, in line with the COP event, to maintain momentum during this critical decade. Supported by Cannes Lions Ascential, owner of Lions, has played a major role in convening this international action to tackle the climate emergency. The group invited more organisations with international reach to join and help support the roll-out plans. The world's major advertising agency holding companies, dentsu international, Havas, Interpublic Group, Omnicom, Publicis Groupe and WPP, along with Unilever - one of the world's largest advertisers, global tech companies, Google and Meta, plus European media company Sky, will be supported by US trade bodies, ANA, 4A's and the IAB, European and global agency associations, EACA and Voxcomm, the WFA representing global advertisers and the IAA to extend the Ad Net Zero programme from the UK to other major advertising markets. 5-point plan "Our 5-point action plan pledges to reduce carbon emissions from UK advertising operations to net zero by 2030, with businesses committing to robust, verified plans to reduce their emissions," says Stephen Woodford, chief executive, Advertising Association. It also pledges to use advertising's power to accelerate the switch to more sustainable products and services for consumers. "We are excited to be working now on a roadmap for development internationally, with the flexibility to adapt and develop market-specific solutions and share best practices in sustainable ad operations. We welcome all organisations interested in this to contact us to find out more," he says.

Rich countries must do far more to make energy transition just Rich nations polluted the world as they industrialised over the centuries, unleashing a global warming the cataclysmic effects of which are now felt most severely by poorer countries. It is also clear that the effects of the use of fossil fuels - unpredictable weather patterns, droughts and floods that have displaced millions - are too destructive to live with. Through efforts led by the UN Conference of the Parties, COP27 , there is consensus, too, that the world must transition to cleaner, green energy sources. Given that those most affected contributed least to emissions, the question that arises is: who should carry the costs of this transition? At COP26 in Glasgow last year, France, Germany, the UK, the US and EU offered South Africa $8.5bn (R146bn) as part of what became the Just Energy Transition Partnerships. South Africa, it was announced this week, is to receive R10.7bn in concessional financing through the French and German public development banks to help reduce reliance on coal. At this year's summit President Cyril Ramaphosa told delegates South Africa will need R1.5-trillion in investment to support its just transition. The question is how much of the funding will be concessional and how much commercial? Transparency is crucial as whatever new debt is incurred will ultimately have to be repaid by South African taxpayers. Concessional or not, these are, at the end of the day, still loans. As a country, we are duty-bound to contribute to the global goal of net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases by the middle of this century. The issue has divided the country into supporters of fossil fuels on the one hand, and green energy campaigners on the other. This division plays into the hands of powerful global forces pursuing their own interests. Clean, renewable energy is the ideal that all nations, rich and poor, must work towards. There can be no debate about the need to transition. In South Africa, Eskom is the behemoth most responsible for emissions, but it is also a strategic asset that keeps our economy chugging along. In our rush to transition, we must not create more challenges for our already struggling source of power. Our government would do well to scrutinise the terms of the proposed financing to ensure we don't burden future generations with crippling debt, which may constrain funding for our developmental needs. In any case, much of our high-quality coal is in high demand in developed countries, some of which are encouraging us to dispense with coal. Mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe said this week demand for South African coal rose by 700% after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It would be futile to export our coal while starving South Africa's economy of the energy necessary for growth and job creation. We must not decommission our power plants in a manner that would sabotage our industrialisation, which is dependent on security of energy supply. The ever-present reality of load-shedding adds emphasis to this priority. The richer countries must help the developing world - not with loans, but donations to finance the transition. This would make the transition just. Those who polluted the globe must take the most responsibility in sponsoring the transition. To the extent that loans are necessary, we should not simply accept what is on offer. The terms must be far better and easier than those offered by commercial banks and development financing institutions. Our country's priority ought to be to stabilise the grid - and then transform it to become cleaner. Future generations should not be left with a polluted world, nor with poorly negotiated debt. We should bequeath them a world and economy better than we inherited. \</doc>

The Actuarial Society of SA has created a climate change practice area to help the industry quantify risks and financial impacts of long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. Society president Tjaart Esterhuyse, who also heads RGA EMEA Explore, announced the new climate change committee to more than 1,700 actuaries at Assa's 2022 convention on Thursday. "Climate change is happening all around us, and we are going to see more and more unpredictable weather patterns and potentially catastrophic events," said Esterhuyse. "So put your thinking hats on and wonder how we, as actuaries, can help improve our future." As financial services companies ranging from banks to asset managers come under increasing pressure to curb financing for carbon-intensive business practices key corporate decision makers are increasingly turning to actuaries to quantify the risks associated with climate change and how it might affect their industries. "Until now, our focus on climate change has been at working group level within the Assa financial and enterprise risk management committee, which is driven by actuaries working mainly in the climate change space," said Esterhuyse. "By dedicating a practice area committee to climate change, we acknowledge that the risks are multifaceted and that we need to widen the scope of our efforts to include all practice areas as well as actuaries working for key stakeholders such as the regulator." Ronald Richman, the current chair of Assa's financial and enterprise risk management committee and chief actuary at Old Mutual Insure, has been tasked with setting up the Assa Climate Change Committee. The move comes after Assa's financial and enterprise risk management committee identified climate change as an emerging risk management area for actuaries about two years ago. "We set up a climate change working group to look at the role of SA actuaries in identifying and quantifying climate change risks and what tools and guidance they would need," said Richman. "On the back of this work, it became clear that climate change risks will be felt by all actuarial practice areas and beyond and we agreed that it was time to continue our work at committee level." Richman says climate change risks extend far beyond natural disasters such as the devastating flooding that occurred in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape earlier in 2022 as the phenomenon is emerging as systemic problem for the global economic system. By extension it has direct implications for the world's financial system. "We need to look beyond the obvious physical risks created by natural disasters and their immediate impact on short- and long-term insurers," he said. "We also have to consider transition risks such as the exposure of financial institutions to fossil fuel assets, the impact of a reluctance to invest in carbon-heavy industries such as traditional power producers, and the effect of rising sea levels and heat stress on buildings." Assa's climate change committee will continue to closely follow international trends through active participation in the climate risk task force appointed by the International Actuarial Association (IAA). To ensure the committee's effectiveness, at least one actuary from each major area of actuarial practice in SA will be required to participate in its functions while at least one Assa council member will be represented on the committee. An invitation will also be extended to the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) to place an actuary who is a staff member on the committee, which plans to hold its first meeting after the 27th UN Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ).

RISK ASSESSMENTActuarial Society sets up a climate-change committee The Actuarial Society of SA (Assa) has created a new climate-change practice area to enable the actuarial sector to quantify better the risks and financial impacts of long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns.

Like most countries, Zimbabwe is grappling with climate change, characterised by changes in rainfall patterns, perennial droughts, extreme weather temperatures and floods. The Southern African country experienced one of its worst climate disasters in March 2019 when Cyclone Idai hit eastern parts Zimbabwe. The cyclone left a trail of destruction, displacing 240 000 people, leaving 340 dead and hundreds others missing. This prompted authorities to revisit the country's climate change policies and redirect Zimbabwe towards a greener, more sustainable future. Ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, last year, the government pledged to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from current levels by 2030. Zimbabwe had previously committed to a 33% emissions reduction in its first nationally determined contribution to lowering global emissions in 2017. An expedited transition to climate-friendly electric vehicles (EVs) as a conduit towards reducing emissions was identified as one of the key mitigation measures Zimbabwe was to pursue. Growing appetite for EVs Indications are that the policy will introduce a raft of incentives for importation of EVs, establishment of EV assembly plants and related infrastructure. Some of the proposed incentives include a total waiver or drastic reduction of import duty on EVs and a preferential licensing system. The Transport and Infrastructural Development Secretary, Engineer Theodius Chinyanga, said the policy aims to promote innovation, technology and environmental conservation, and to encourage individuals to turn to clean fuel. "The policy is still at crafting stage and consultations are ongoing with other ministries such as industry and commerce, energy and power development, environment, and finance and economic development," he said. Environmental agencies have already started working on the feasibility of EVs in the country. A study titled HYPERLINK https://unepccc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/national-electric-mobility-policy-and-market-readiness-framework-for-zimbabwe.pdf National Electric Mobility Readiness Framework of Zimbabwe , published by the United Nations Environment Programme in April this year, highlights opportunities and challenges. Countries such as Norway - which according to the Global EV Outlook report published in May 2022 had the highest market share for new electric car sales in Europe in 2021 - have reinforced their successful transition to EVs via strong policy measures, including road tax exemptions, toll exemptions, purchase price reductions and 50% parking fees for citizens who drive EVs. In the United States President Joe Biden recently signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax credits to battery makers, bringing down battery costs by one-third. HYPERLINK https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2022 Global EV Outlook 2022 Embryonic transition While Zimbabwean authorities continue to grapple with the bureaucratic details of mounting a quick transition, some Zimbabweans are already turning to EVs in the absence of the envisaged incentives. Taurai Sewera, an automotive technician who specialises in hybrid and electric vehicles, says some motorists with deep pockets are already importing EVs into the country. Hybrid cars operate on a blend of petrol and electric power, whereas EVs run on battery power alone. "Technology has been evolving over the years and the automotive industry has not been left behind. It is important that the country joins the bandwagon of EVs," Sewera said. More people will turn to EVs because they cost less to maintain than internal combustion engines, he added: "One needs about $40 to charge a high-range EV for a 500km journey; for an internal combustion vehicle one needs to fork out $140 or more [for the same journey]." Tanaka Kutama, founder of ZimTourque, a local company specialising in EVs, says he is already planning to set up an EV assembly plant in the country: "Our aim is first to work on producing 1 000 electric bikes a month, and then 2 000 electric vehicles every three months. "This plant will create around 1,500 jobs at the beginning, with more jobs set to be created as production scales up. As we will be manufacturing locally, we hope the cars and bikes will be affordable to ordinary individuals." Kutama estimated the bikes will cost between $1 500 and $2 000 while EVs will cost between $15 000 and $20 000. The cost of buying an EV remains prohibitive for most Zimbabweans, however, and they turn to cheaper second-hand internal combustion vehicles imported from Japan. Prices in neighbouring South Africa - where combined electric and hybrid vehicles sales made up less than 1% of the car market in 2019 - range from around R599 945 ($34 000) for a 2020 mini copper SE, considered one of the most affordable EVs, while a 2015 Nissan leaf is going for R385 000 ($22 249). Because of the high prices, most EVs in the country are imported by businessmen and government officials, mainly for personal use. Experts say a mass switch to EVs will mainly depend on affordability and availability of infrastructure such as charging and servicing stations, as well as sufficient electricity for charging the batteries. Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (ZERA) chief executive officer Eddington Mazambani says there are only 30 EVs registered in the country, "although we expect the number to increase. There has, however, been an increase in second-hand hybrid vehicles, showing an interest to switching to greener vehicles, with about 1,000 registered in the country." The government has also begun adding EVs to its vehicle fleet to stimulate uptake. The Central Mechanical Equipment Department (CMED), the department responsible for government vehicle procurement and maintenance, has already added 14 EVs to its fleet. "We hope to continue growing our fleet by also including mini-buses," said CMED public relations officer Tarisai Mukombi. The new EVs are used at the CMED driving school and as shuttle cars at the Robert Mugabe International Airport. The local private sector is also gearing up in anticipation of an EV boom. Vaya, a ride-hailing service owned by Zimbabwe's largest telecommunication company Econet, was launched in 2020. The Vaya EV is part of a premium service offered for passenger and logistical services. Fuel shortages For years Zimbabwe has struggled with fuel shortages on account of its foreign currency problems. Long, winding queues at petrol stations are an often familiar sight in the country. A report released by ZERA in January 2022 says fuel consumption in the country rose to 1,2-billion litres between January and November last year, from a billion litres during the same period in 2020. The Central Vehicle Registry estimates that in 2020 the country had a vehicle tally of 1 041 852. Rising internal-combustion car numbers means the government has to fork out an increasing amount of foreign exchange to import fuel to sustain them. The transport sector contributed 12% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2017 report by the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association. About 97% of the sector's emissions emanate from the combustion of fossilised fuels, while diesel and petrol consumption contributes 744 000 tonnes and 543 120 tonnes of carbon dioxide respectively every year, the report states. Infrastructure setup Secretary for Energy and Power Development Gloria Magombo says authorities are optimistic that Zimbabwe's transition will be seamless once a proper framework has been put in place. "The country is slowly moving to clean energy in all sectors of the economy, and the automotive sector is not going to be left behind," she said. "We are still crafting policies that will guide us on issues such as planning, financing models, tax breaks and job creation." Work has already started on infrastructure sites, and a few are currently under development. The government is working with companies such as Agilitee, a Zimbabwe-owned EV assembly company based in Johannesburg, South Africa, that plans to set up a vehicle assembly plant in Zimbabwe next year, Magombo added. According to the national daily electricity generation statistics provided by the Zimbabwe Power Company, as of September 22 2022 the country was generating 1 036MW against daily consumption about 2 500MW, representing a shortfall of more than 1,000MW. This has seen the country resorting to load shedding which lasts for hours daily. The 2022 Population and Housing Census preliminary report on housing characteristics and living conditions published last month shows that 34% of households use grid electricity, 28% use off-grid or renewable energy, and 38% do not have any source of electricity. Of the households that use grid electricity, 84% are in urban areas; 78% of those that use off-grid energy are in rural areas. Despite the electricity shortages, authorities are optimistic that EVs will thrive. Magombo pointed out that the country will tap into renewable energy sources to power the EV charging stations. "Zimbabwe is increasing its power sources and in terms of the national development strategy, energy capacity generation is expected to reach 3,467MW by the year 2025. This will go a long way in sustaining EVs," she added. According to the US Energy Information Administration, by August 2022 hybrid and full electric cars made up less than 1% of the 1.3-billion vehicles on the road globally. The agency projects that by 2030 there will 672-million plug-in vehicles around the world, making up about one-third of the global vehicle fleet. In anticipation of an impending influx of EVs in Zimbabwe, local fuel companies have begun setting up charging stations at their garages. In May Zuva Petroleum, one of the largest privately owned fuel companies in the country, partnered with local startup Electric Vehicle Centre Africa to set up charging stations at its garages countrywide. There is a charging station in Bulawayo and another will be placed in Gweru later this year, according to the centre's general manager, Mufaro Mugumbate. A prototype charging station will soon be set up in the capital, Harare, followed by charging points at Zuva service stations along the highway in other cities. "We were encouraged by the national electric vehicle policy that is set to be published later this year," said Mufaro Mugumbate.

As Europe braces for an unusual winter due to a global energy crisis, Greece is embarking on one of Europe's most ambitious energy projects by connecting its electricity grid to Egypt's. An underwater cable will transport 3,000 MW of electricity to power up to 450,000 households from northern Egypt to Attica in Greece. In October, the two countries agreed to construct the Mediterranean's first undersea cable to transport electricity generated by solar and wind energy in North Africa to Europe. The project's total length is 1373 kilometres. The Copelouzos Group is in charge of the project, and its executives met with Egyptian leaders in October to speed up the process. The agreement comes at a time when Greece, Cyprus, and Israel want to invest $900 million in constructing a line connecting Europe and Asia that will be the longest and deepest energy cable across the Mediterranean. At a ceremony in Athens, Greek Energy Minister Costas Skrickas and his Egyptian counterpart Mohamed Shaker signed a memorandum of understanding on the project. "This connection benefits Greece, Egypt, and the European Union," Skrickas said. He explained that the project would help to build an energy hub in the eastern Mediterranean and improve the region's energy security. Besides boosting the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix and lowering greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector, the project is anticipated to enable the export of renewable energy from Egypt to Greece in periods of high renewable energy generation and vice versa. According to Dr Ayman Hamza, spokesman for the Ministry of Electricity, the Egyptian-Greek electrical connectivity project has significant technical, economic, environmental, and social benefits. The project aims to establish a robust interconnection network in the Eastern Mediterranean to increase the security and dependability of energy supplies, as well as to assist in the event of transmission network breakdowns, interruptions, and emergencies, and to raise the level of security of electrical supplies. The project, scheduled to start in 2028, is a significant component of the two nations' ongoing strategic relations and cooperation. It will speed up the development of the energy corridor by increasing the supply of electricity to Egypt and Greece while balancing energy demand, encouraging responses to the challenges of climate change, and reducing emissions, all of which will contribute to the corridor's continued growth, Hamza told IPS. "We have 16 memorandums of understanding related to green hydrogen," he explained, adding that "there is a great demand from investors to invest in renewable energy, whether the sun or wind." "On the margins of the COP27 climate conference, it is expected that extremely major agreements on the level of green hydrogen and others, with great experience, will be signed," Hamza elaborated. The possibility of Egypt increasing its reliance on renewable energy, he continued, is made possible by a large number of investors pouring money into solar and wind energy. He stated that Egypt would become a regional renewable energy hub. Egypt has electrical interconnection lines with Libya and Sudan, and we are collaborating with other African organizations to take significant steps to connect Africa and Europe through electrical interconnection. Because Africa is a major energy source, this will benefit both continents, the spokesperson continued. According to Dr Farouk Al-Hakim, Secretary-General of the Egyptian Society of Electrical Engineers, Egypt's export of electricity indicates a surplus, which generates a significant economic return, strengthens Egypt's political position, and transforms Egypt into a regional energy hub, in addition to the numerous job opportunities created in operation and maintenance. Al-Hakim told IPS that Egypt has a significant surplus due to the installation of three enormous power stations in the past several years in the administrative capital, Burullus, and Beni Suef, as well as solar plants, including the Benban facility, which is the biggest in Africa and the Middle East. The electrical connection currently offers many benefits, he continued, particularly given that Europe, like most other nations worldwide, is experiencing an energy crisis due to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Therefore, it is a good idea to start with two nations that have shared a history with Egypt, such as Greece and Cyprus, he added. IPS UN Bureau Report Follow @IPSNewsUNBureau \</doc>

Standard Bank has set aside a cumulative amount of between R250bn and R300bn for sustainable finance projects by the end of 2026. This target includes R50bn of financing for renewable energy and underwriting of a further R15bn for renewable energy by the end of 2024.This was the announcement made by Standard Bank Group chief executive of corporate and investment banking, Kenny Fihla.He was speaking at the second climate summit hosted by Standard Bank, in partnership with the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies this week."I am pleased to inform you that since the launch of our climate policy in March this year, we have already provided sustainable finance to the tune of almost R40bn and are tracking ahead of our timelines to surpass these targets, Fihla said. Energy supply is likely to become even more subject to geopolitical rivalry than it is at present."Regions and blocs will want to become increasingly self-reliant for energy or at least reliant on countries that are not their rivals. In this context, building Africa s capacity to supply our own energy needs becomes ever important," said chief executive officer of Standard Bank Group, Sim Tshabalala."Equally, there will be huge opportunities for African countries as exporters of transitional and renewable energy. Growing our sustainable and transitional energy capacity will increase African countries fiscal headroom which is essential for effective sovereignty. It will enable us to move deeper into global supply chains which is very helpful to broader industrialisation."This year s climate summit comes on the back of the release of Standard Bank Group s climate policy earlier this year, which commits to achieving a portfolio mix that reaches net zero by 2050.The one-day event built on last year's net zero theme, and looked at climate change within the context of energy access, and focused on the just energy transition in an endeavour to identify, unify and raise Africa's voices on this important topic.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/513/232618.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/513/232618.html :EMBED-->To this end, four in-depth panel discussions were hosted under the following topical themes: energy transition; opportunities and risks; green investing; and the role of government.South Africa's Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment, Barbara Creecy said: In reaching our net zero goals, we must remember to put our people and communities at the centre of a just transition that guarantees better and decent jobs, social protection, more training opportunities, and greater job security for all workers affected by global warming and climate change policies. This is extremely important in our establishment of a resilient South African green economy and is a cornerstone of our developmental agenda. Industry leaders, investors, government, civil society organisations and some of Africa s leading policymakers highlighted that, while Africa must join the global drive towards limiting greenhouse gas emissions, this action must be considered within the context of Africa s just transition towards a low-carbon economy.This should also be done in a manner that recognises and addresses the deep energy deficit across African economies where less than 43% of the population have access to a national grid, they said.As the world s attention turns to COP27 taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt next month, the platform promises to troubleshoot Africa's ability to raise sigificant capital to back the deployment of climate change mitigation solutions that, in turn, will position the continent as a key player in the low-carbon economy.The call to action now is that Africa needs to prioritise capacity-building support, while securing technology and finance as a matter of urgency. \</doc>

Eye on the news Zuma also hobnobbed with British royalty Since Cyril Ramaphosa swept through London in a gilded carriage, waving like a giddy kindergartener on a tour of a sweetie factory, South Africans have told me he is clearly in the pay of the British royal family, that he is "giving us the middle finger", that this is a great honour and reason to feel a surge of national pride. To our collective credit, the first, and most obviously stupid, claim has mostly been made by a vocal but small minority, led by public laughing stocks such as Mzwanele Manyi, the head baton-twirler of Nkandla's in-house cheerleading squad. On Sunday, the sentient muff tweeted news reports previewing Ramaphosa's state visit, adding: "The Head of the pseudo-sovereign state, South Africa, will be accounting to the master, the Head of the Commonwealth next week." The other two claims - that Ramaphosa's visit is a slap in the face of stressed South Africans, and that it's a big win for our tired little country - are much less cynical, and aren't actively trying to collapse the country, but I'm afraid they're not very much more grounded in reality. To be fair, we can't really blame ourselves. The institution of monarchy, like organised religion with which it has wrestled for thousands of years, is designed to make us lose perspective. When you shuffle into St Peter's in Rome, or stand respectfully aside as carriages rattle along flag-draped, soldier-lined streets in London, you are meant to feel extremely small and, by implication, believe the people you're watching up there in the pulpit or in the palace are extremely big. If the spectacle does its job and leaves you unmoored, it's very easy to believe what you're being told, or to push back to the opposite extreme, bitterly rejecting the whole thing as a cynical and insulting sham. I understand if you believe Ramaphosa has abandoned us to go and cosplay leadership in Feudal Disneyland. But under the silly clothes and the absurd carriages, this is just a meet-and-greet at a particularly famous corporate head office. It's no different to Davos, or COP27 , or, to be fair, any South African boardroom or golf course where politicians and businesspeople go to shake the right hands and pat the right backs. As for those who insist we should feel proud that Ramaphosa is pressing kingly flesh, well, I mean, if you want to believe that Mr Charles Mountbatten-Windsor is so special that simply being in the same room as him is such an achievement that an entire country can bask in reflected glory, I have some magic beans to sell you. No, Ramaphosa has gone to do what all heads of state do all over the place, all the time: go somewhere shiny, pose for pictures, ask for money, get promised money, say and say thank you knowing you'll never see a cent of it, commit entirely noncommittally to definite deals which will almost definitely not happen, eat some quails, drink some champagne and go home.

SAM Nujoma, the former president of Namibia, once told Namibians on national television that children did not come from the internet and encouraged Namibians to follow the prescripts to multiply and fill the world. After all, Namibia\' s almost 1 million population then was, and still remains, far from filling Namibia\' s vast lands, even at more than a million today. I was last in Namibia on the invitation of their Statistics Office and being a known quantity as a bean counter in the region, I am often asked the unfortunate question to which I have no answer, which is,  Why is our population so small? However, as a bean counter my job has only been to count the people and nothing more. In their musical career, Jeff Barry and The Archies released, Summer Praise for Peace, on the album Sunshine in 1970. The song was about the world reaching 2 billion people 52 years ago and how its planetary limits would be affected and the prayer was for mitigation and adaptation. A decade later, hot on the heels of Jeff Barry and The Archies, was The Year 2000 by the O\' Jays, released in 1980. It\' s lyrics were about how old do you think you will be in 2000. In 1980 the year 2000 for a 20-year-old looked very far, it was too hard to imagine it. The UN released a report on Tuesday that said the 8 billionth product of conception was expelled or extracted from its mother\' s womb and it showed signs of life on that day. The world is now four times what it was 52 years ago. Against this backdrop was COP27 , held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, this week. Our planet is burning. While the question of climate change and the threat it poses to world peace has received decibels no ear can contain, another major threat was announced in a study released on October 11. It was in a journal article by Hagai Levine et al titled,  Temporal Trends in Sperm Count: A systematic review and meta-regression analysis of samples collected globally in the 20th and 21st centuries . In about 50 years, the sperm count dropped by half,from 101 million per millilitre in 1973 to 49 million per millilitre in 2018. The rate of change is intensifying with a 2.64 deterioration rate per year in 2018, compared to 1.16 per year in 1972 globally. The decline in sperm count combined with use of contraception may imply that the decline in the rate of fertility is compounded by halving the chances of a successful contraception. This fact places the former Namibian president\' s wish to grow the country\' s population in jeopardy. So even if bedrooms in Namibia get warmed up, the bullets are too few to make it to the target. The study unfortunately does not say nor even speculate on why volumes have declined. But the correlation between accelerated drop in sperm count and deterioration in planetary resources may just be a helpful ally should the study show causality. This is particularly if the count of essentials to life showed that it was caused by climate change. Speedy changes in the behaviour of males towards mitigation and adaptation of climate change in order to immediately halt and reverse depleted volumes of essentials and preserve the human species from extinction by restoring sperm count to levels so required for populations to not only replenish itself but grow, may occur. If you want change to occur, act on self-interest and perhaps Jeff Barry and The Archies\' s Summer Praise for Peace and The Year 2000 by the O\' Jays may have a more receptive male audience, and that will make Nujoma happy again about Namibian men.

THERE SHALL BE WORK BY BY XHANTI PAYI A lot of thought has to go into the transition away from coal to ensure 'nobody is left behind' there shall be work Tabling South Africa's investment plan at COP27 in Egypt last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the country would need $98bn over five years to begin its 20-year energy transition. Following this, the International Partners Group (IPG) - France, Germany, the UK, US and EU - released a statement in which they said they "jointly welcome and endorse" South Africa's just energy transition investment plan. In the statement, the IPG reflected on its own $8.5bn contribution and said "funding will align to the investment plan and be geared towards: coal plant decommissioning; funding alternative employment in coal mining areas; investments which will facilitate accelerated deployment of renewable energy and investments in new sectors of the green economy". This is an important commitment, given the importance of the coal sector in South Africa. According to the Minerals Council South Africa, coal mining accounts for about 20% of all employment in the mining sector. Between 2004 and 2018, employment in coal mining rose from 50,327 to 86,919 - that's 73% growth in employment over a 14-year period. Total earnings for employees in the sector have grown by 372%, from R5.8bn in 2004 to R27.7bn in 2018. That's an average nominal growth rate of 27% a year. Of course, it is important to recognise, given South Africa's income inequalities, that this growth in earnings would not be uniform across all workers in the sector. Still, this information tells us we are transitioning out of an important, high-impact and growing industry. South Africa's energy transition means the country will not only need to replace the 86,000 direct jobs lost, but the new jobs that replace them will also have to fetch R27bn in growing incomes. An important commitment made by all the parties to South Africa's just energy transition investment plan was that the "partnership, with new investments, is how we help ensure that nobody is left behind". It's a sentiment repeated by all the heads of state involved in the investment partnership. What that means in practice is that South Africa doesn't only need investment in new jobs, but also job growth and income growth. So the investment and grants in the just transition programme have a tough task ahead. Lessons learnt The goal of "funding alternative employment in coal mining areas" won't be cheap or easy. Consider that, according to the National Treasury, the jobs fund had disbursed R5.85bn by the end of last year, leveraged R11.76bn in matched funds and created 287,441 jobs. This means each of these jobs, on average, cost R20,349. This is an outcome achieved over the decade the jobs fund has been in existence. If we were to translate this into coal mining, it would mean South Africa needs about R2bn for alternative employment, crudely speaking. Also important to recognise here is that the focus up to now has been only on the direct jobs in coal mining. But that doesn't take account of the small businesses that exist within and around coal mining communities, and the many other sectors supported by the industry, including transport and logistics, construction, retail and trade, and other local enterprises. So, in thinking about a "just" transition that doesn't leave anyone behind, more comprehensive and detailed work has to be done. If the jobs fund offers an example of how our efforts to invest in the creation of new jobs have been realised, we have to accept that a new and special effort is needed - particularly given the current emphasis on accelerating the transition out of coal. Our 10-year record with the jobs fund isn't particularly inspiring. But at least it provides a sense of what our realistic expectations around the just transition should be.

A new report - The growing role of forest products in climate change mitigation - launched at COP27 on 14 November, highlights that sustainable forestry operations and forestry policies vary across the globe and suggests that forestry and harvested wood products (HWPs) should not be overlooked as key drivers of a climate-resilient planet and green economic growth. "Policymakers seem to miss the boat when it comes to the role of the global forestry and forest products sector in climate change mitigation," says Jane Molony, executive director of Pamsa.Forestry critics assert that all types of trees should be kept in the ground, regardless of their type and purpose, and perpetuate the myth that wood production causes deforestation. This is not the case, says Molony. Many countries subscribe to certified and sustainable forestry practices to ensure that this doesn t happen."Without a thriving forestry sector, the climate change goals outlined in the Paris agreement will be tough to meet," says Molony. "Sustainable forest management sits at the root of a climate-positive sector, along with the production of harvested wood products, including paper, serving to prolong the duration for which carbon is stored."The 3S FrameworkThe report presents a 3S Framework of Sequestration, Storage and Substitution, highlighting the role of HWPs in the carbon cycle and climate regulation.Sequestration takes place during photosynthesis. Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) for growth, storing the carbon and releasing the oxygen. Carbon then accumulates in the form of biomass, deadwood, organic litter and soils.Storage is maintained when trees are harvested, and wood products become a pool of stored carbon. With half of the dry weight of timber as carbon, the carbon storage potential in long-life wood products and reductions of emissions from use of wood products is significant.Substitution occurs when wood-based products replace carbon-intensive materials. To keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C in play, countries need to use more timber in construction, more wood-based fibre in packaging, and more sustainably sourced cellulose in a vast range of products from biofuels to clothing to car parts and even pharmaceuticals. "We should even be printing more paper-based books for society," adds Molony.Locally, trees are planted, grown and harvested in line with international certification standards and local legislation. Only 6% of the country s total plantation area 1.2 million hectares is harvested annually. The same area is replanted with new saplings often at a ratio of two trees for each one harvested. This means there is a constant supply of carbon-capturing trees for productive purposes for years to come. It also supports employment and economic growth."It s the circular nature of forestry where the largest long-term mitigation benefit can be achieved," explains Molony. "By maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks trees through rotational growing, harvesting and planting, we generate a sustained yield of carbon-storing timber and fibre."Detractors contend that planted forests negatively affect biodiversity and land use. Molony adds that sustainable forest management cannot be adopted in isolation of the protection of ancient and old-growth forests, the restoration of indigenous species and afforestation (tree farming) in suitable areas."Borrowing from our peer association in Brazil, we believe that the right trees need to be planted in the right place, at the right scale and for the right purpose," notes Molony, alluding to the four R s promoted by the international forestry sector."We have and always will need forests and we need them more than ever before," concludes Molony. "Natural and indigenous forests as well as planted forests or commercial timber plantations serve as a source to fulfil many of humanity s needs and provide countless environmental services, most importantly carbon sequestration, storage and substitution."In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit." \</doc>

THE SA Reserve Bank (SARB) warns that climate change has emerged as a key threat to economic and financial stability in the country, following the devastating floods in KwaZulu-Natal. In April this year, flooding in KZN killed more than 400 people, destroyed houses, factories, roads and key economic infrastructure, and cost the economy more than R50 billion in subdued activity. Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago on Friday said the floods that wreaked havoc in KZN represented a tiny fraction of the climate-related destruction visited on the global economy in the year under review. Speaking at the central bank\' s 102nd annual general meeting, Kganyago said greater rainfall in the eastern parts of South Africa and less in the west were clear indications the economy will need to adjust because catastrophic weather events will occur more frequently and cause greater damage. Kyangago said in response to this, the Reserve Bank was looking at important projects on climate change and these were being implemented through various policy and support areas.  The economic research department is assessing the implications of climate- related shocks for monetary policy execution and implementation, he said.  Climate change and the transition to a greener economy have the potential to generate larger, longer and often more frequent economic and financial shocks, with disruptive effects for economic activity and high inflation. Climate change is already manifesting rapidly in the form of droughts, fires, floods, resource scarcity and species loss, among other impacts. In January, the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Risk Report 2022 flagged  climate action failure as the number one long-term threat to the world, and the risk with potentially the most severe impacts over the next decade. The WEF said short-term domestic pressures would make it harder for governments to focus on long-term priorities, adding that climate action failure would limit the political capital allocated to major global concerns. AfDB acting chief economist Kevin Urama called for policy co-ordination and a more holistic approach to tackling climate change.  One fundamental, existential issue for Africa is climate change. The countries that are receiving climate financing are the less vulnerable ones, Urama said.  We have been losing 5 to 15 percent of GDP per capita growth in Africa because of climate change, and that is in addition to other issues that climate change is driving on the continent.  As we prepare for COP27 , honouring the 2009 $100bn yearly climate finance commitment that high-income countries promised to developing countries would help to restore confidence that we are serious about climate change, Urama said. Meanwhile, Kganyago said additional headwinds to South Africa\' s economic growth included a sharp correction in commodity prices, rising inflation and increased strike activity. \</doc>

Polls opened yesterday in crucial US midterm elections that could decide the political future of both President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump \- who has all but announced he will seek the White House again in 2024. Biden\' s Democrats are facing a gargantuan struggle to hang on to Congress, after a race the president has cast as a  defining moment for US democracy \- while Trump\' s Republicans campaigned hard on kitchen- table issues like inflation and crime. Trump \- who has been heavily hinting at a new run \- grabbed the election eve spotlight to flag  a big announcement on November 15, while Biden made a final appeal to Democrats to turn out en masse at the polls.  The power\' s in your hands, Biden told a rally near the capital.  We know in our bones that our democracy is at risk and we know that this is your moment to defend it. With polls showing Republicans in line to seize the House of Representatives, the increasingly far-right party eyed snarling the rest of Biden\' s first term in aggressive investigations and opposition to spending plans. Returning to the White House on Monday night, Biden told reporters he believed Democrats would win the Senate \- though conceding  it\' s going to be tough to retain the House and that his life in Washington may become  more difficult . If both the House and Senate flip, Biden would be left as little more than a lame duck. With Congress out of Democrats\' hands, he would see his legislative agenda collapse. That would raise questions over everything from climate crisis policies, which the president will be laying out at the COP27 conference in Egypt this week, to Ukraine, where Republicans are reluctant to maintain the current rate of US financial and military support. An influx of far-right Trump backers in Congress would also accelerate the shift that has been taking place inside the Republican Party since the former real-estate tycoon stunned the world by defeating Hillary Clinton for the presidency in 2016. Despite facing criminal probes over taking top secret documents from the White House and trying to overturn the 2020 election, Trump has been using the midterms to cement his status as the de facto Republican leader and presumptive presidential nominee. In a typically dark, rambling speech to fans in Dayton, Ohio, Trump said,  if you support the decline and fall of America, then you must, you absolutely must vote for the radical left, crazy people . Across the country voters called on their fellow citizens to cast their ballot in the midterms, which historically have low turnout.  I would emphasise vote, vote, vote, 24-year-old student Luke Osuagwu said in Atlanta, Georgia.  If you\' re not voting, you can\' t really stand for society or anything like that, agreed Alethia McClenton, a 45-year-old Georgia Aquarium employee.  It\' s very important that everybody goes out to do their part. More than 40 million ballots were cast through early voting options, meaning the outcome had already begun to take shape before election day. Up for grabs are all 435 House seats, a third of the 100 Senate seats, and a slew of state-level posts. Four states are also holding referendums on abortion \- California, Vermont, Kentucky and Michigan. Senate races in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Ohio have narrowed to projected photo finishes, and any one of them could swing the balance of power. But final results may not be known until days \- or in some cases even weeks \- after election day, setting the stage for what promise to be acrimonious challenges. The outcome will likely determine whether Biden, who turns 80 this month and is the oldest president ever, will seek a second term in 2024 \- or step aside. | \</doc>

TANYA FARBER When COP27 kicks off in Egypt early next month, the face of human suffering in less developed countries such as South Africa should be brought to light. Developed nations that have so far pushed back against the loss and damage facility should be forced to be accountable and pay up because the greatest polluters have a greater responsibility to compensate. These were some of the views expressed this week by South African and other experts during a webinar hosted by the World Wildlife Fund SA and the South African Climate Action Network. So what is the loss and damage facility and what does it mean to South Africa? According to Lutfiyah Suliman from the Institute for Economic Justice, South Africa is particularly vulnerable to climate change. She said on the whole, the climate crisis is going to result in a whole host of "negative impacts". They include an increase in global temperature due to greenhouse gases, changes in weather patterns and extreme weather events. "But," she adds, "in SA specifically, what we can expect is an increase in water stress." "We are going to see a severe and negative impact on municipalities' ability to deliver on services and this will affect the most vulnerable who are least able to restore a basic sense of dignity," she said. The loss and damage facility is also not conventionally understood as the same thing by all, points out Suliman. While some relate it mainly to "severe climate impacts and the recovery phase", others see it also in terms of mitigation, recovery and adaptation simultaneously. Despite having its own article in the Paris Agreement, it does not yet have any dedicated financing stream and the least developed are reliant on humanitarian aid. According to Prabhat Upadhyaya, WWF SA senior policy analyst, the conversation about the loss and damage facility is "finally getting serious". It appeared for the first time in UN climate talks in 2007 but only in 2013 did it start gaining traction to avert, minimise and address loss and damage. Thandolwethu Lukoko, co-ordinator of the South African Climate Action Network, concurred that it was finally being taken seriously but said it was a "long-standing issue that hasn't been resolved". Citing the floods in KwaZulu-Natal as a case study of the multiple effects of an extreme weather event, he said: "Let's say you're living in KZN, what you would have experienced in a rural community was run-off water that wasn't able to seep into [the] ground because of drought. Maybe your home got washed away. There were also containers washed away in the ports, while bridges and infrastructure were torn down." These are all elements that need to be rebuilt, he said. "But where do the resources come from to rebuild and how does one get access to that funding?" Lukoko said the coffers had "already been depleted by Covid-19 and the riots", so a funding facility "brings some kind of solace". While efforts towards a "just transition" to mitigate the climate crisis were commendable, there were already impacts being felt the most intensely by those "least responsible for the climate crisis". "Developed nations are pushing back against loss and damage facilities, saying they will have to pay for poorer countries, but the latter are saying they owe it to society. -TimesLIVE UNDER WATER: Displaced people stand on a flooded highway after rains during the monsoon season in Sehwan, Pakistan, in September 2022.

From August 27-28, the 8th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (Ticad 8) was held in Tunis, Tunisia. Ticad is a multilateral platform held every three years to discuss and mobilise support for Africa\' s development, under the guiding principle of African ownership and international partnership, co-organised by the Japanese government, the UN, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank and the African Union Commission (AUC). Ticad was launched in 1993. Ticad 8 was attended by 48 African countries and about 100 business people from both Japan and Africa, respective economy ministers and development financial institutions. South Africa was represented by Honourable Dr Naledi Pandor, Minister of International Relations and Co-operation. With the crises caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as a backdrop, the focus of Ticad 8 was on how to realise (i) sustainable economic growth and social development, (ii) a resilient and sustainable society and (iii) sustainable peace and stability in Africa. Japan\' s Prime Minister Kishida Fumio reiterated in his opening remarks that Japan would strongly support development in Africa as  a partner growing together with Africa and announced Japan\' s investment of US$30 billion as the sum of public and private financial contributions over the next three years. This pledge is in line with the endorsed Ticad 8 Tunis Declaration, which will serve as a guidepost for future Japan-Africa relations and sustainable growth in post-Covid-19 Africa. Among 92 Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) concluded at the forum between Japanese companies and African partners, there are several MOUs related to South Africa, to name a few, as follows: u MOU for Green Hydrogen and Ammonia by Sasol: The need for accelerating private investment in hydrogen and ammonia, as alternative sources of energy for a just and fair transition, was stated in the Ticad 8 Tunis Declaration, given the backdrop of significant increases in oil and gas prices. The MOU was signed in collaboration with and witnessed by MUFG, one of the leading global financial institutions and a market leader in sustainable financing solutions. u MOU for Automotive Industry development towards carbon neutrality by Toyota: The initiative between Toyota and the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition aims to co-operate in promoting the automotive industry towards carbon neutrality. Such initiatives by the African and Japanese private sector provide important stepping stones for structural change towards low greenhouse gas emissions, which will also be a focus at COP27 to be held this coming November in Africa. Commitments made through Ticad have had a tangible effect throughout the African continent, including South Africa. Recent examples for South Africa are: u In October, 2021, the investment for the production line of the Corolla Cross by Toyota. u In April, 2022, the investment for the manufacturing of the new D-MAX by Isuzu. u In September, 2022, the investment for the new production line of wire harnesses by Hesto, the South African partner of Yazaki Corporation. These investments contribute to the growth of the automotive sector, which accounts for about 7% of the total GDP of South Africa. As indicated in the Tunis Declaration, Ticad 9 will be held in Japan in 2025. Japan will continue to work with South Africa to address our common challenges identified by Ticad 8.

A lack of progress in negotiations since COP 26 has been raised as cause for concern by South Africa at the 13th Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin, Germany. The dialogue, which ended yesterday, was aimed at addressing a range of issues including emissions reduction and adaptation. Speaking at the event, Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Minister Barbara Creecy said not enough progress has been made in multilateral negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on key areas since COP 26. The discussions on loss and damage, finance, adaptation and the just transition remained trapped in process-related discussions, she said.  Last year in Glasgow some developing countries were vilified for stressing their national circumstances in relation to some of the desired outcomes in the Glasgow Climate Pact.  Yet just over six months after Glasgow we\' re witnessing many developed countries reverting to coal in response to their negative national circumstances. Developed countries must continue taking the lead with ambitious action.  Climate change is currently costing African countries between 3% and 5% of their GDPs. Africa is experiencing extreme climate impacts which the continent had very little role in causing, Creecy said.  To put things in perspective: according to the UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance, developing countries need between 5 to 11 trillion US dollars to meet their climate objectives. And yet, according to the OECD only around US$80 billion was mobilised. This represents less than 2% of developing countries\' needs.  The only way we can re-establish credibility in financial provision is to set a realistic goal for developed countries to mobilise at least one trillion US dollars per annum to assist developing countries in meeting their climate change objectives.

On April 10, I received a frantic call from a colleague wanting to know if I was safe, as our attractive small Wild Coast town of Port St Johns and surrounding villages were experiencing floods. Coincidentally in 2020 extreme heat dried the natural water sources. Residents were forced to buy drinking water. Yet in April this year, water was gushing out of hill slopes, damaging private property and infrastructure. KwaNonyevu, Greens Farm, and Mthumbane villages were among those hardest hit and were full of panic-stricken residents. The dumping of solid waste and the proliferation of alien invasive plants have radically increased our vulnerability to climate change, both because of how they caused the water channels to recede and how they can overflow when the rains are heavy, worsening floods. Over the years, our arable land has become less productive, as drainage systems poisoned our soil with effluent and other contaminants, such as nappies dumped upstream. Climate change is the direct cause of this wealth deterioration: our polluted, drying, and eroding land cannot sustain as many animals as it used to. When this happens, local communities have fewer options on which plants to cultivate. Because of increasing crop failures during droughts and floods, there is food insecurity and increased reliance on government social grants. As I listened to the stories of other festival participants at the recent Rural Action for Climate Resilience learning festival in Cape Town, I realised that millions of people were already battling for survival. No society has been left unscathed by more frequent and intense droughts, wildfires, storms and floods resulting from three factors, all caused by humans. First, global warming has caused the seas to rise. The UN Climate Change Conference - to be held at Sharm elsheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18 - must develop an approach of mitigation and adaptation based on justice and equity, reflective of local community realities. COP27 represents a unique and timely opportunity for the world's citizens to come together, recognise our common interests and restore multilateral co-operation. Local communities call for meaningful engagement in climate change negotiations and decision-making of small-scale food producers and indigenous communities, including women and youth. We must be concerned about the South African government's seemingly wavering in its commitment to switch to green energy. Some examples are its retrogressive issuance of licences to mine in the Wild Coast and the West Coast and its repeated calls for investment in fossil fuel infrastructure. It is hard to believe politicians, who insist that their worrisome stopgap measures necessitated by immediate energy supply problems, should not be mistaken for long-term strategies. Yet their stubborn promotion of oil and gas mining along our coastal waters and their intention to enter into a 20-year agreement with Turkish company Karpowership, cast doubt on the sincerity of their commitment to embark on the greener road ahead. As citizens of the developing world, we are increasingly frustrated with rich countries' refusal to pay their fair share for a crisis for which they bear overwhelming responsibility. To date, a disproportionate share of climate finance has been directed toward mitigation, leaving us in developing countries largely to fend for ourselves in financing adaptation investment. I was surprised to learn that many of us at the festival had taken precautions before leaving our homes - we were in fear of what could happen should unpredictable heavy rains fall during our absence. This experience shows that we all struggle with the same forces, from Wild Coast to West Coast. My local community is connected to yours wherever you read these words. - Nozuko Noxaka, community activist and paralegal in the Port St Johns Advice Office \</doc>

Has there ever been a more surreal start to a World Cup than last night's peculiar opening ceremony and game?\~ Perfectly manicured lawns surrounding a stadium built with the hands, and blood, of thousands of immigrant workers - in the middle of a desert; with vast air-conditioning units necessarily cooling the air for players and fans, a section of whom were apparently complete fakes.\~ Earlier in the day, in Sharm El-Sheik in Egypt, world leaders had staggered and stuttered their way to a wholly inadequate new climate deal at COP27 , despite a marathon final negotiating session that went 40 hours past its original deadline.\~ Since all sport - and especially football - is an escape from reality, this World Cup is the ultimate suspension of all disbelief.\~ Qatar 2022 runs against the grain of human progress myriad ways: the excessive opulence and gross inequality, financed by the fossil fuels that have left humanity "our planet in the emergency room", as United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres yesterday; the strident refusal to accept the rights of workers and the LGBT+ community.\~ The hopeless Qatari national team provided a World Cup precedent: the first host country team to lose an opening match of the tournament. The team played like a pub team caught in the headlights of their own big moment; completely overwhelmed, they lost 2-0 to Ecuador.\~ The air-conditioning wasn't needed; the South American team barely broke into a sweat.\~ Money can't buy you love, they say. Nor, apparently, can it buy you a decent football team. Many of the Qatari elite started to leave at half-time, humiliated by the meek showing of their national side.\~ Usually your average football fan would be rooting for the host nation, especially if, as with South Africa in 2010, they are an underdog and representing a continent that has been subject to so much colonial injustice.\~ This was different. In my living room, there was an unending stream of sardonic commentary. When the video assistant referee turned over the first Ecuadorian "goal" in the third minute of the game, after an especially comic piece of play by the home team's goalkeeper, it was greeted with cynicism. Qatar, it is widely assumed, bought this World Cup with bribes to Fifa, an organisation that lacks any credibility, so of course the VAR would step in\~ The fact that the goal was offside and correctly overturned was irrelevant:;this is a World Cup that is deeply disliked and distrusted. This is a country where a small number of Qataris buy in everything that they don't like doing themselves, from cleaning toilets to building their own stadiums.\~ Singing for their own national team is also, apparently, below the Qatari elite. Hence, the bizarre optics of having a group of "ultras" flown in from Lebanon for the assignment - surely the biggest stretch in credibility for the "global game".\~ Qatar 2022 will be known forever as the Fake World Cup.\~ It feels as if the enormous investment in soft power influence and footprint has been wasted; that the tournament has damaged, rather than advanced, the global reputation and standing of the small Middle Eastern nation.\~\~ Is there any chance that the game can turn things around and create a set of memories to eclipse all of the gory nonsense and injustice that has so far been the hallmark of this World Cup?\~ Perhaps. But, more likely not. For players and fans alike, it seems like an inconvenience, disrupting the flow of the European leagues, such as the English Premier League - especially if you are an Arsenal fan.\~\~ These city-state leagues are where the power really lies now in the "beautiful game". The World Cup feels like a grotesque irrelevance. Today, England have to decide whether its captain, Harry Kane, will wear the "One Love" badge on his shirt and thereby risk a booking. Kane should do so; England should take a principled stand. But I doubt they will.\~ Either way, the real story - the real drama, even - would appear to be not on the field of play, but in the surrounding context.\~ Yes, the Fake World Cup is what this is.

African countries are gearing up for the energy transition by implementing policy and legislative frameworks that take into account the energy crisis and the need for a renewable, decarbonised, decentralised energy supply that addresses climate change and the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Ahead of COP27 in Egypt in November, lawyers across Africa have outlined the efforts taken by the governments in their countries to address this urgent need to harness renewable power. In part two, we hear from lawyers in Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. NigeriaOludare Senbore, Partner at Aluko & Oyebode in Nigeria:Following the decisions taken during COP26, the President of Nigeria announced the intention for Nigeria to achieve a net zero emission target by 2060.In order to achieve this objective, the Federal Government of Nigeria on 24 August 2022, launched its Energy Transition Plan (ETP). The ETP, which was launched by the Vice President on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria, has a double-pronged objective of achieving universal access to energy by 2030 and a net-zero emission target by 2060.The foregoing actions support Nigeria s energy transition drive, which includes an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement that was submitted in May 2021, and which highlights the country s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% unconditionally, and a conditional reduction target of 47% by 2030. This was followed up with the enactment of the Climate Change Act 2021 in November 2021, which provides a framework for achieving low greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), inclusive green growth and sustainable economic development in Nigeria.An additional legislative action by the Federal Government of Nigeria is the Petroleum Industry Act of 2021, that empowers the Nigerian National Petroleum Limited (a state-owned oil company) to engage in the business of renewables. This further confirms the country s drive for energy transition, as do proposed amendments to the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, which provide that distribution companies must ensure that a portion of the electric power that they purchase must be from renewable sources. This is supposed to provide support for the growth of renewable power projects.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/516/233185.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/516/233185.html :EMBED-->South AfricaKieran Whyte, Partner and Head of the Energy, Mining & Infrastructure Industry Group at Baker McKenzie in Johannesburg:South Africa is in dire need of a clean, reliable and secure energy supply to get out of its negative growth spiral. As a result, the country is moving forward towards just energy transition and the increased utilisation of renewable energy.At COP26 in November 2021, it was announced that the governments of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union had pledged $8.5bn in first round financing to assist South Africa with energy transition projects. On 20 October 2022, the South African cabinet approved an investment plan for the $8.5bn package, the details of which are expected to be announced at COP27 HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/233155.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/1/702/233155.html :EMBED-->Further policies such as the National Energy Efficiency Strategy and the Green Transport Strategy also have a role to play in ensuring the country meets its climate change targets and reduces its carbon emissions. Trading in carbon offsets in the carbon market, where companies can pay other entities to offset their emissions for them, is growing in popularity in emerging markets. In August 2022, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange announced that it was investigating the possibility of introducing a carbon trading market in South Africa.As part of a diversified energy mix strategy, Eskom recently identified eighteen independent power producer bids in terms of an auction relating to the use of vacant land it owned in Mpumalanga, situated in proximity to its coal-fired power stations, with direct access to the national transmission network and the enabling of wheeling. The projects will add approximately 1,800MW of renewable power to the South African grid.The Department of Minerals Resources and Energy (DMRE) is proposing a number of amendments to the Electricity Regulation Act, which came into effect in 2006. The amendments are likely to address, inter alia, the electricity supply deficit, the vertical structure of the market and the lack of competition, the introduction of a multi-market including independent power producers (IPPs) and the formation of a central purchasing agency. The amendments will also address the introduction of a day-ahead market to accommodate hourly supply and demand, the direct procurement of power by municipalities, the increase in the threshold pertaining to self-generation, the need to accommodate low carbon-emitting generation technologies, the timing of licensing applications, changes in transmission system operation including power trading ,and the creation of additional regulatory capability.The lack of access to power has had a significant impact on the private sector in South Africa for some time, and the country's energy policy developments, which are aligned with the global energy transition towards a clean and decentralised energy system, have been welcomed as a means to improve access to decarbonised, affordable renewable energy that takes into account the country's carbon reduction commitments and economic growth requirements.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/638/232940.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/638/232940.html :EMBED-->TanzaniaShemane Amin, Partner at A&K Tanzania:Tanzania has refocused its attention on the energy future, with the Ministry of Energy actively pursuing investment opportunities in renewables to improve the country s energy mix. This is specifically in relation to solar, wind and geothermal opportunities - and to add more renewable energy sources to the national grid to meet the country s growing demand for power.The Government of Tanzania is targeting an electrification rate for the entire country of 75% by 2035 and in the next six to seven years is striving to add 2 GW of renewables to the grid. In order to attract these investments, the government is striving to create a more conducive business environment in which such power projects can be sustainable, this includes providing investment incentives. In the 2022 budget speech, the Ministry of Energy highlighted, among other things, the establishment of the Renewable Energy Strategy and Roadmap. In a nutshell, the refocus on the energy future and the momentum behind renewables in Tanzania make this a key area to watch for investors.UgandaArnold Lule Sekiwano, Partner at Engoru, Mutebi Advocates in Uganda:There are a number of policy initiatives which have been passed purposely to facilitate energy transition in Uganda. Such policies include the Climate Change Policy 2015, which focuses on the use of alternative renewable energy sources such as solar, biomass, mini-hydro, geothermal and wind; and the Renewable Energy Policy (2007), which forms the basis of the underlying framework for renewable energy.Furthermore, Uganda s Vision 2040 has also emphasised clean sources of energy to avert climate change. These policy initiatives have culminated into the recent enactment of the Climate Change Act, 2021. The Act governs the national response to climate change. One of the stated purposes of the Act is to give effect to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. Generally, there is an increased focus on the utilisation of renewable energy resources and technologies in Uganda and a regulatory focus that supports energy transition.Read Part 1 of this article here. \</doc>

MELANIE Murcott\' s parents fled from South Africa because her mother grew up in a black household in Merebank, and her father was white. Both were anti-apartheid activists and the associate professor in administrative and environmental law at the University of Pretoria credits them for her ongoing passion for social and environmental justice. Murcott has dedicated her new book, Transformative Environmental Constitutionalism, to her mother and father, Jean and Charles Murcott, who married when their union was a crime in South Africa. They went into exile in the UK.  Coming from a single-parent household in Merebank, Jean wanted to elevate her community, change the mindset of apartheid, and pursue social justice. She was actively anti-racist. She was one of the first black women to become a minister of the Methodist Church, and a trail-blazer until the end of her life in November 2020. I was born in the UK in exile. Were we in South Africa, I would have been born a crime. My mother\' s passion for social justice inspired me to write this book along with the fact that we are in a planetary emergency that is causing grave injustice, said Murcott. Murcott, a lawyer, and her family returned to the country of their birth when Nelson Mandela was freed from prison.  The idea for Transformative Environmental Constitutionalism is drawn from my upbringing and wanting to advance social justice, which cannot be achieved without a functioning environment, said Murcott. Her book aims to help fulfil South Africa\' s constitutionally protected environmental rights. Murcott said that although the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment and Department of Mineral Resources and Energy had developed some good regulatory frameworks, there were major implementation failures, often giving way to unsustainable economic development. Courts have an important role to play in holding government actors to account.  For example, the Department of Mineral Resources is approving fossil fuel developments that are set to cause social and environmental injustices in the country, such as the proposed oil and gas exploration along the Wild Coast, which would be devastating for the climate system, marine life, and indigenous communities that rely on the fish in that area, said Murcott. President Cyril Ramaphosa argued at COP27 that the country needs finance to protect the climate system, yet the minister of mineral resources is pushing a fossil fuel agenda. These mixed messages from the government are confusing and troubling, she said. She said broader change was needed, including a transition to renewable energy and better sewerage systems, to protect the vulnerable. Murcott said everyone had a role to play in taking care of their environment. Most people know about environmental degradation but do not necessarily know what to do. She said people also faced other challenges and social ills, making it difficult to prioritise environmental issues.  It is not easy to tackle these problems, but there are many impactful grassroots social, environmental, and climate justice movements and organisations that are doing incredible work, such as the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance, said Murcott. Her recommendations for people who want to play a part in actively advancing social, environmental and climate justice include eating responsibly, supporting sustainable farming and small-scale fishers, reducing waste, supporting the efforts of waste pickers, using less water, influencing markets through buying locally and sustainably produced food, and empowering local communities to pursue ecologically sustainable food and energy. Murcott is also working on an animal law with Amy Willson, executive director of Animal Law Reform South Africa.  We hope to establish animal law as a new field in SA by reflecting on human-animal relationships in various contexts such as food systems, biodiversity conservation, and animals as pets, and how the law needs to evolve to better protect animals, said Murcott. Transformative Environmental Constitutionalism was published by Brill in October 2022, and is available as an ebook, at ( https://brill.com/display/title/61787 https://brill.com/display/title/61787 ). \</doc>

Climate funding draft due in July Task team pencils in date for draft of investment plan Energy WriterFor now, the particulars of the climate finance deal in which the US and countries in Europe will make available $8.5bn towards the funding of energy reform in SA remain a bit of a mystery. However, the presidential climate finance task team said it expected to publish a draft of an investment plan for SA's transition to a low-carbon economy by the end of July. The final investment plan, which will identify the projects and activities required to achieve a just transition and guide the use of $8.5bn in funding offered under the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), is scheduled to be approved by the government and published by the end of October in time for the COP27 conference in November. These details are contained in a progress report on SA's JETP, an initiative between SA and global partners. The report was published on Tuesday after meetings between government ministers and COP president Alok Sharma, as well as engagements with the climate finance task team led by former Absa boss Daniel Mminele. The JETP was launched at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in November last year when the UK, the US and EU members undertook to mobilise an initial $8.5bn over the next three to five years to support SA's commitments, or nationally determined contribution (NDC), to the Paris Agreement on climate change. According to the revised NDC submitted in Glasgow, SA has pledged to reduce domestic carbon emissions within a target range of between 350-million tonnes and 420-million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030. That is a reduction of about 20%-33% from current emissions. According to the finance task team, the investment plan will further outline the JETP's priorities, which include decarbonising SA's energy sector and protecting vulnerable workers and communities affected by the move away from fossil fuels. It will also outline how the partnership will support the rehabilitation and repurposing of coal mines, and the creation of "green and quality jobs" through the development of the green hydrogen and electric vehicle sectors. Mminele's team and the Treasury are analysing financing instruments that may be offered to ensure they "meet SA's investment needs and fiscal realities". He told Business Day that the funding mix was still under discussion and he could not comment on how much of the money would be in the form of grants, loans, guarantees and other financial instruments. "Our key focus at the moment is on two priorities. First, to develop a comprehensive SA-led investment plan that maps out investments required to achieve a just transition and help guide the use of funds. Second, to reach agreement on the financing package that both meets our investment needs and that is SA's fiscal framework," Mminele said at a media briefing in Pretoria on Wednesday. The nature of the funding being offered and possible conditions attached have been a major concern about the JETP. At previous meetings of the presidential climate commission, public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan and mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe have expressed doubts about whether the funds on offer were worth it and have said SA needs to better understand the cost implications before accepting any offers. erasmusd@businesslive.co.za $8.5bn will be made available towards the funding of energy reform 20% minimum reduction from current emissions pledged at COP26 \</doc>

'Global south must design own future' "I am calling for moral strategic leadership in what will become not just the battle of our lifetime but the battle of planet earth." These were the impassioned words of Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley which rang out at the Albert Luthuli Convention Centre in Durban yesterday afternoon as she delivered the 20th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture to a jam-packed house. An attorney at law, Mottley has been active in the political life of Barbados for almost three decades and is the first female leader of that island country. She recently won the United Nations 2022 Champion for Global Change Award to add to her many accolades. Invoking the spirit of Madiba, she said that in any great battle, "each of us runs our leg of the relay" and in the battle against the climate crisis too, "the example of Madiba is the one I would want us to hold onto ... as the values he exhibited and the moral compass he provides give both the strength and capacity to run this race, which is the greatest race humanity will require in any generation." While her focus was on the theme: "Social Bonding and Decolonisation in the Context of the Climate Crisis: Perspectives from the Global South", she described the climate crisis as being embedded in a polycrisis also characterized by the fallout of "the awful pandemic", and a global financial crisis, which she described as a cancer. "We were still recovering from the financial crisis and the cancer of inflation and the cost of living when the pandemic came. I say cancer because you keep trying to run after it but you can't catch up with it ... We also found ourselves fighting for vaccine equity in the midst of these multiple crises." Again invoking the spirit of Mandela, she said the battle against the climate crisis will require some uncomfortable partnerships. "Today I want us to recognise that what is required of us will mean developing partnerships in places we may never have dreamt of going." she said, but added that "while it is the collective action that has led the world to be where it is today," there is "no doubt that those responsible are G20 nations - they are 80% responsible." She said that within that context, the "traditional colonial powers that benefited from the industrial revolutions and our blood and sweat and tears, are the ones that have effectively put the world in the position it is today". However, it is also up to "ordinary people to place pressure and participate in the advocacy that is going to make a difference" in a crisis that has consequences which are "multidimensional" and which include the loss of "life, livelihoods, dignity, shelter, family, and culture". She said we are going to keep seeing an increased number of climate migrants moving across the earth. "This is real and it is already with us," she said. Referencing COP27 currently underway in Egypt, she said it is "not simply the commitments made on stage that matter but the capacity to deliver on those commitments." She said that the global south has "for too long been the place from which wealth is extracted while there is no drive to put back in." She also spoke out strongly against the disparity of terms on which global north countries can draw loans, compared to those in the global south. "This disparity in treatment is one of the remaining consequences of the colonial order. Will we continue to be victims of a process that was supposed to be dismantled in the post war era, and we have to change the discourse not just about the climate crisis but the financial crisis that is preventing us from being architects of our own destiny rather than simply awaiting handouts from the global north," she said, pointing out that "Greece could borrow at fraction of Ghana because one is in Europe and one is in Africa". She made a strong call to recognise that "ours is now the moment for the reconstruction of a new global deal and social compact". She ended off by saying that today it is up to us to recognise simply that if we don't move now, there may not be much left of our planet. \</doc>

Calls for more investment in auto industry as Chinese manufacturer rolls out 10,000th vehicle Eight years after starting operations in Gqeberha, Chinese vehicle brand FAW Trucks reached a milestone this month, rolling out the 10,000th vehicle assembled at its plant in Coega. With fireworks that lit up the night sky on Thursday, the company's officials, along with local and provincial dignitaries, attended a black-tie event at the factory to toast the achievement, while looking forward to more investments from the heavy vehicle producer. FAW SA chief executive Li Yongjun, who flew in from the company's headquarters in China, said the success of the company was a result of due diligence in understanding the local market and support from the government and Coega. He said the first truck was brought into SA 28 years ago. In 2012, the company invested R600m in a 30,000m& xB2; facility, which includes a training facility, body shop and paint shop. "But before that we did enough market research to modify our product to be suitable for the local climate and road conditions, and also the driving habits of the prospective users," Yongjun said. "In the past few years we have had joint ventures with famous OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and, frankly speaking, we learnt a lot and adapted their technology to ours." In the first quarter of last year, FAW took the top spot in the heavy commercial segment of the SA market. Yongjun said they were looking to build on those gains by increasing their existing ranges, with a new energy vehicle (NEV) on the cards. They will be aiming for a third-place ranking within the commercial truck market by the end of this year. "In today's world we encourage our companies to reduce carbon emissions and improve clean energy vehicles, and we are planning to introduce some electrical vehicles," he said. "As part of the long-term vision for this plant and NEVs, further investment will have to be considered for the plant to be compliant and compatible for the assembly of such units." The JH6 28.500FT truck tractor roared into the marquee to the applause of mayor Retief Odendaal, finance MEC Mlungisi Mvoko and acting consul general of the Chinese consulate Changan Tang. Mvoko, who also oversees the economic development and environmental affairs department, said while it was commendable that FAW had employed 361 direct employees, with only eight of Chinese origin, he challenged the company to look at how it could localise components for its vehicles. "We also do want to encourage FAW SA to explore opportunities to localise some of their component manufacturing to enable the creation of more local jobs," Mvoko said. "We also encourage a closer collaboration between FAW SA and the province, through the AIDC-EC, to enable future localisation of some components in our province." FAW said more than 2,000 people had benefited from its capacity building initiatives, while also indirectly driving the number of local labour and employment to about 1,500 from local suppliers. It works with more than 350 local suppliers, of which 50 are black-owned, supplying a range of products, including parts, tyres and truck accessories. Trade, industry and competition minister Ebrahim Patel, who joined via Zoom, said the FAW investment made a strong case for further investment in the Eastern Cape auto industry, particularly in the Coega Industrial Development Zone. "For Gqebehra and the province at large, this investment indicates what we can do in partnership with investors," Patel said. "As we transition to new energy vehicles we want FAW to be a strong partner on this journey. "This journey includes electric vehicles and new fuel cell technologies. "As part of SA strategy at COP27 by President Cyril Ramaphosa, we are looking at the feasibility and capital costs associated with hydrogen mobility applications with some scope for commercial vehicles as well. "Green hydrogen represents enormous opportunities for the future. "It is a transition that our industry and the people who serve in it are readying themselves for and which will require strong partnership and collaboration to manage the risks and to get the benefits of this transition."

The R9 billion concessional loan the World Bank granted to Eskom last week for the repurposing of the Komati Power Station will go a long way to ensure that government moves towards decarbonisation, says Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana. Godongwana and Public Enterprises Minister, Pravin Gordhan, on behalf of the South African government, on Sunday met the President of the World Bank, David Malpass, at the power plant in Mpumalanga. The visit came after the loan approval for the power plant, which is set to become the country's flagship Just Energy Transition (JET) project. Malpass was on a short visit to South Africa while en route to the COP27 Summit in Egypt. Gordhan and Malpass were welcomed in Mpumalanga by Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane and received at the Komati Power Station by the Eskom Board chairperson, Mpho Makwana and Eskom CEO, Andre de Ruyter. Godongwana, who met with Malpass on Saturday evening, said government is in partnership with a range of social partners to ensure a just energy transition. 'The financing Eskom is receiving from the World Bank will go a long way in assisting us to meet the ambitious targets relating to decarbonisation and the just energy transition that we have set for ourselves. 'We will continue to mobilise capital, internationally and domestically, to finance the transition, in the interest of the lives and livelihoods of our people,' said Godongwana after the meeting. Komati is set to be converted into a site for renewable energy generation, as the country gradually transitions from fossil fuels to clean energy resources. It seeks to make a major contribution to mitigating climate change and ensuring energy security while supporting a range of economic initiatives for local communities in the Komati area. Announcing the loan facility, Malpass expressed his confidence in South Africa embarking on the JET. 'Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a difficult challenge worldwide, particularly in South Africa, given the high carbon intensity of the energy sector. Decommissioning the Komati plant this week is a good first step toward low carbon development. We are cognizant of the social challenges of the transition, and we are partnering with government, civil society, and unions to create economic opportunities for affected workers and communities,' said Malpass. Gordhan said Malpass's visit was an expression of confidence in South Africa's ability to implement a JET in a way that minimises any negative impacts on local communities, which have over the years developed around coal stations. 'This project will greatly assist Eskom, South Africa and the international community to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of how the processes of decommissioning and repurposing of coal-powered stations can be done in a manner, which mitigates the socio-economic impacts for workers and communities; before we scale up the move of the power sector into a low carbon path. Crucially, it will provide training in new skills and for new jobs,' Gordhan said. The last unit of the Komati Power Station was decommissioned and switched off on 31 October 2022, signalling the end of its operating life as a coal-fired power station. The Komati plant will be converted into a renewable generation site powered with 150MW of solar, 70MW of wind and 150MW of storage batteries, adding generation capacity to the grid, thereby continuing to put the site and its associated transmission infrastructure to good use. A containerised micro-grid assembly factory has already been established on site. This will help prolong the usefulness of the infrastructure and provide economic opportunities to the community. Eskom has developed a comprehensive JET Strategy, which places equal importance on the 'transition to lower carbon technologies,' and the ability to do so in a manner that is 'just' and sustainable. The employees remaining at Komati at the time of the decommissioning will become part of the Repowering and Repurposing project. The Komati Training Facility is already under development. It will facilitate the reskilling, retraining, and upskilling of Eskom employees and members of the community, as appropriate. Eskom has signed a partnership agreement with the South African Renewable Energy Technology Centre (SARETEC) of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to develop the training facility. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Barbara Creecy has expressed concern at some developed countries who were reverting to coal in response to their negative national circumstances. This as the Glasgow Climate Pact called upon nations to phase down unabated coal power and inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels. 'We cannot have backtracking by developed country Parties. Developed countries must continue taking the lead with ambitious action. The ultimate measure of climate leadership is not what countries do in times of comfort and convenience, but what they do in times of challenge and controversy,' the Minister said on Monday. Creecy was addressing the opening of the 13th Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin, Germany. 'Climate change is currently costing African countries between three and five percent of their GDPs. Regionally, Africa is experiencing extreme climate impacts which the continent had very little role in causing. 'Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) needs to focus on supporting a people-centred just equitable transition in the developing world. The urgent need is to adapt now, while we build resilience for the future. We can only avoid loss and minimize damage with the appropriate scale of public finance that does not exacerbate the indebtedness of Africa,' the Minister said. Creecy said South Africa is further accelerating its climate actions, in the context of just transitions and sustainable development. 'Since Conference of the Parties (COP 26), we have finalised our Just Transitions Framework, which will form the basis for our long-term climate action. To this end, we have set up a Task Team to develop an investment plan for the Just Energy Transition Partnership or JETP announced in Glasgow, with our Partner countries - Germany, France, the UK, the US and the European Union (EU),' the Minister said. The Climate Bill, which is currently before Parliament, lays the regulatory framework for the whole of government, business, organised labour and civil society to implement our country's climate commitments. 'However, we are very concerned at the lack of progress in the multilateral negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on key areas since COP 26. The discussions on loss and damage, finance, adaptation, and the just transition remain trapped in process-related discussions. Last year in Glasgow some developing countries were vilified for stressing their national circumstances in relation to some of the desired outcomes in the Glasgow Climate Pact. Yet just over six months after Glasgow we are witnessing many developed countries reverting back to coal in response to their negative national circumstances,' she said. -SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

While the COVID-19 pandemic and East European war have severe global consequences, Minister Naledi Pandor says the world should not neglect the needs of the marginalised. 'Our greatest global challenges are poverty, inequality, joblessness and feeling excluded,' the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) Minister said on Wednesday. Pandor was delivering South Africa's statement to the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA77). 'Acting on the Common Agenda Vision 2021 of the UN Secretary-General should become the major objective of this time because addressing poverty and underdevelopment will be the beginning of the real inflection point in human history,' she said. The Minister reminded the leaders that the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration for Human Rights and its human rights protocols,which commit them to protecting everyone. 'We must acknowledge that we face these crises today because we have not always upheld these foundational principles consistently and fairly.' Solidary Meanwhile, Pandor believes that global solidarity is required to meet other pressing challenges such as energy and food insecurity, climate change and the devastation caused by conflicts, including the existential threat of nuclear weapons. 'Instead of working collectively to address these challenges, we have grown further apart, as geopolitical tensions and mistrust permeate our relations,' she admitted. 'We should, however, move forward in solidarity, united in efforts to address our common global challenges to ensure sustainable peace and development.' COVID-19 Pandor said developing countries, especially in Africa, should not be left behind in treatments where global pandemics such as COVID-19 are concerned. 'It will be a tragic indictment on all of us as leaders if future pandemics found the poorest as unprepared as many were for COVID-19.' She also called on strengthened global health architecture to better meet the challenges of new pandemics and other infectious diseases of concern. 'South Africa is proud to be part of this solution through the establishment of the first mRNA global technology transfer hubs, which will contribute to the security of supply of life-saving medication for African countries and other developing countries.' Trade In addition, Pandor said the multilateral trading system must be strengthened to create a conducive environment for fair trade that also provides opportunities for developing economies. 'If actionable steps such as these are not taken, developing countries will remain subject to an imbalanced global financial and trading system.' Climate change Pandor urged leaders to collectively deal with global energy shortages by deploying innovative solutions that are cheaper, cleaner and more accessible. She said urgent action is needed to protect the environment and the world for the current and future generations. 'Whilst Africa is the least responsible for the climate crisis, it finds itself at the epicentre of its worst impacts.' Pandor said the world needs to emerge from COP27 , in Egypt in November this year, with an agreement that contains enhanced and balanced actions on adaptation, mitigation and financing. Peace The Minister also took the time to call peace a global public good. 'There have been no winners of the wars of the past seven decades. Instead, they engendered strife, distrust among nations, divisions, a perpetual misallocation of resources to weapons, and increased poverty and underdevelopment.' She told the delegates that Israel must be held accountable for its destructive actions that have significantly impaired the possibility of a two-State solution. 'Similarly, we cannot ignore the decades-long struggle for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. We must treat all conflicts across the globe with equal indignation, no matter the colour or creed of the people affected.' She voiced South Africa's stance to end the embargo against Cuba, which she said continues to impede the right to development of her people. 'In the same vein, we call for an end to unilateral coercive measures against Zimbabwe, which have compounded the problems experienced by the people of Zimbabwe and have a detrimental effect on the broader Southern African region.' - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

Energy transition details on the way International funding package 'will play a role' in SA's climate finance plan Energy WriterAfter months of talks, details of the investment plan for $8.5bn in climate finance pledged to SA by the governments of rich nations at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021, are eagerly awaited after the cabinet endorsed the plan this week. Briefing reporters on Thursday after a cabinet meeting, minister in the presidency Mondli Gungubele said the cabinet accepted the Just Energy Transition Partnership Investment Plan (JETP-IP) and that a briefing soon would elaborate on the "funding challenges in taking forward that plan". Nick O'Donohoe, CEO of UK development finance institution British International Investment was in SA this week and told Business Day that talks were continuing on financing details, and implementation challenges. O'Donohoe did say, however, that while much of the financing would be "sovereign" in nature, development finance institutions would also play a role. The UK is co-ordinator for the partner countries and also co-ordinating the involvement of development finance institutions in the partnership agreement. "Overall, the SA government is doing a good job of orchestrating [the JETP and the investment plan], especially given the very tight time frame within which the plan has to be put together," O'Donohoe said. The investment plan was developed by the presidential climate finance task team, which is being led by former Absa CEO Daniel Mminele. It will set out how the $8.5bn - to be mobilised by the governments of the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU - will be spent to support SA's transition to a low-carbon economy. The plan is also expected to provide more insight into the sort of funding the partner countries will provide. O'Donohoe said British International Investment "will be making a contribution" as part of the UK's role in the JETP. After having scaled its investments into clean energy infrastructure, British International Investment's investment portfolio in SA increased from $142m in 2021 to $520m in 2022. Recent investments include British International Investment's partnership alongside Standard Bank and H1 Holdings in three projects under the Risk Mitigation Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. The projects, to be developed near Kenhardt in the Northern Cape, will be SA's first baseload renewable energy project, powered entirely by renew-able sources. British International Investment also invested in H1 Holdings, a black-owned and managed renewables investment and development company. O'Donohoe said it was "amazing" how much focus the JETP was getting internationally with its potential to serve as a "role model" for how rich nations can support and finance climate adaptation and mitigation in developing economies. This was illustrated, he said, by how much attention the partnership attracted during the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington earlier in October. "The whole world is waiting for this," he said. When the partnership was first announced, much was left unfinalised, with the official text saying it was subject to conditions such as "concurrence on the investment framework, and in line with budgetary procedures and consensus on the use of funds and terms on which finance may be provided". Some in government have expressed their reservations about the partnership. Mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe has said that partner countries should not use the JETP to dictate how SA's energy transition will play out, and public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan has warned against committing SA to costly debt obligations. Statements made by representatives from some of the partner countries suggest that the funding package will entail little in the way of grant funding, and that it will rather consist of concessional finance and investment in private sector initiatives. The investment plan (JETP-IP) is expected to be endorsed formally by all the partners at the COP27 climate negotiations in Egypt in November. erasmusd@businesslive.co.za Low-carbon economy: The Just Energy Transition investment plan will set out how the $8.5bn funding raised by the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU will be spent to support SA's transition. 123RF \</doc>

Climate task team says reports on $8.5bn funding 'inaccurate' 'Numbers cited don't reflect current status of package' Denene Erasmus and Thando MaekoPresidential climate finance task team head Daniel Mminele, who is responsible for putting together an investment plan for $8.5bn in climate finance pledged to SA, has distanced the group from reports suggesting the package will comprise loans almost exclusively and include very little grant funding. Business Day asked Mminele to comment on details of the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) reported by Climate Home News, a UK-based news site, which said it obtained a leaked copy of summary notes of the financing provisions. While Mminele did not mention the article by Climate Home News specifically, he said the task team was "aware of the recent speculative coverage about the [JETP-IP] and have been concerned to note the perpetuation of inaccuracies in some of the reporting. "The numbers cited do not reflect the current status of the financing package, details of which will be provided once the plan is released to the public," he said. The JETP-IP for $8.5bn in climate finance pledged to SA by the governments of the UK, the US, France, Germany and the EU at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021, was accepted by the cabinet last week, but it has not been made available to the public yet. Climate Home News reported that, the investment plan appears to contain just $230m (2.7% of the package) as grants by the donor countries. According to the news site, about $4.6bn - just over 50% of the funding - would be made available in the form of concessional loans, while the other $3.7bn would include a mix of commercial loans and investment guarantees. BALANCE The rough balance of the funds would come from the Accelerating Coal Transition initiative of the Climate Investment Funds, it added. The Climate Investment Funds is a multilateral climate finance mechanism, with African Development Bank an implementing agency. However, a document published recently by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries & the Environment and the Climate Investment Funds, which details the Climate Investment Funds's investment plan for SA's coal transition, states that while both plans are being prepared in co-ordination with the SA government, the Climate Investment Funds' plan will "dovetail" with the JETP-IP to avoid parallel processes. The document states that the Climate Investment Funds will leverage the $8.5bn JETP package to unlock further funding. The Climate Investment Funds has proposed a financing package of $2.6bn the majority of which is being earmarked for the decommissioning and repurposing of Eskom coal-fired power stations. This will include $500m of loan funding directly from the Climate Investment Funds and $2.1bn in both public and private finance to come from institutions such as the African Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation, and the World Bank. Mminele said it was "understandable that speculation around the yet to be circulated final draft [of the JETP-IP] is front of mind given that the investment plan is an "important initial five-year road map for a systems approach to securing an inclusive and just energy transition for SA. "Rest assured, the government plans to share the accurate and final version of the JET-IP with the public in the near future," he said. Speaking at the Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation's Inclusive Growth Forum last week, Mminele said there was already a "strong focus" on leveraging the $8.5bn to source additional funds from "other interested countries, development finance institutions, philanthropic capital and the broader private sector." The total estimated scale of the investment plan is more than R1-trillion over a five-year period, Mminele said. The financing instruments used as part of the investment plan had to reflect SA's own priorities, taking into account the need for fiscal sustainability, he said. The related terms for any loans that form part of the funding package had to be more attractive than what could be secured in capital markets and they had to be granted "without unduly onerous reporting requirements".

GRANTS AND LOANS African countries need reality check on climate finance The past two weeks have seen two important climate-change forums playing out on the continent in the build-up to COP27 in Egypt in November. The first was Botswana Global Adaptation Week, from August 22 to 26, and the second was last week's Africa Climate Week held in Gabon. Unsurprisingly, the topic on everyone's lips at both events was climate finance, specifically how to access more grants to fill the ever-widening gap between demand and supply. Indeed, the opening session of Africa Climate Week featured a ministerial dialogue on the challenges of mobilising and accessing climate finance to drive the implementation of countries' nationally determined contributions and national adaptation plans. I do have a great deal of sympathy for the perspective that, given Africa's minuscule historical responsibility for creating climate crises in the first place, the onus should fall on developed countries to pay for the mess they created. I also firmly believe developed nations should, at a bare minimum, make good on their pledge to provide $100bn a year in climate finance. However, I also think African countries need a serious reality check on this front. A report from the Climate Policy Initiative in December 2021 found that while global climate finance flows have increased over the past decade, the increase in annual climate finance flows between 2017/2018 and 2019/2020 was only 10%, compared with an increase of 24% in previous periods. Moreover, grants accounted for a meagre 6% ($36bn) of 2019/2020 global climate finance, inching up only 1% from the previous assessed financial year of 2017/2018. It should then hardly come as a surprise that recent reports on the state of the $8.5bn climate-finance investment intended for SA's just energy transition made by the US, the EU and Britain at COP26 indicate that as much as 80% will be in the form of soft loans. This is a worrying trend for two main reasons. The first is that in the scramble for grants, African countries are allowing lenders to determine the priorities for the spending of grant funds, which is often at odds with where the needs are. Despite African countries accounting for less than 5% of total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and having identified adaptation as the largest funding gap, only 2% of total global climate finance flowed to projects that reduce both climate vulnerability and GHG emissions. For Sub-Saharan Africa, two-thirds of this dual-benefit climate finance went into "other & cross-sectoral" projects, while only a third went to water supply, flood protection and climate-resilient agriculture, where the funding gap is greatest and the risks most acute. The second major problem with this international grant-dependent mindset is that it runs against the grain of the rest of the world. In 2019/2020, three-quarters of tracked climate investments ($479bn) flowed domestically, not internationally. Moreover, at the global level almost 60% of climate projects funded domestically were from private sources, whereas in Sub-Saharan Africa only 10% came from private sources. This indicates poorly articulated national adaptation goals and the lack of clearly identified tangible investments in climate-vulnerable sectors. African governments, including our own, need to urgently get with the programme and start engaging the private sector to identify investable opportunities to insulate their economies from the increasingly apparent physical risks of climate change. One key initiative towards this end is the upcoming three-part series of events organised by the National Business Initiative and African Climate Foundation to engage business and decision-makers, building on Africa Climate Week. These vital engagements aim to unpack the key challenges, opportunities and debates surrounding climate action and just transitions on the continent, and their relevance for business.

IMF AND WORLD BANK Greylisting on agenda for SA at Washington meetings Greylisting on agenda in Washington Editor at LargeThe issue of SA's potential greylisting by the Financial Action Task Force is expected to loom large in conversations between SA banks and their international counterparts in Washington, DC, this week, as the world's bankers gather on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, which start on Monday. About 10,000 people traditionally descend on Washington for the annual meetings, which are being held fully in person for the first time since before the Covid pandemic. And the title of the opening panel discussion, "Addressing multiple crises in an era of volatility", reflects the magnitude of the issues to be discussed this year. Finance minister Enoch Godongwana and Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago and their senior officials will be there, as will leading private sector bankers and economists. The head of SA's climate finance team, Daniel Mminele, is also due to attend ahead of the COP27 climate summit next month at which SA is due to present the $8.5bn (about R150bn) just energy transition investment plan agreed with its international partners. While the finance ministers and central bankers of the IMF's 190 member countries attend the official meetings of the fund and the bank, the week-long event also draws CEOs and board members from all the major global banks. "You've got a massive number of bankers in Washington at this time of year," said one CEO, who said all SA's banks would use the gathering as an opportunity to meet at senior level with the correspondent banks with which they do trade finance, foreign exchange trading and other international business. They would also meet with some of the global investment banks. Investec traditionally hosts a breakfast in Washington at the end of the annual meetings which it uses to promote SA to investors and lenders, and which draws senior executives from SA and global banks. With SA facing possible greylisting by the Financial Action Task Force, some local bankers see this year's meetings as a particularly important opportunity to cement their relationships with correspondent banks. "When times are tough, you need those relationships," the banker said. While SA's financial regulators have done much to put measures in place to stave off greylisting, the question is whether the task force, which is due to publish its report-back on SA in February, will deem it to have done enough on the law enforcement side to prevent fraud and money laundering. The expectation is that greylisting would make cross-border transactions more cumbersome and costly for banks' clients because of the enhanced due diligence international banks will demand in light of the high risk attached to transacting with SA. Bankers say if SA is put on the greylist, the priority will be to get off it as rapidly as possible, ideally within a year. This year's annual meetings in Washington are expected to be particularly important given the dramatic developments in the global economy over the past year and the big questions these have raised for economic policymakers. Climate finance, global inflation and the debt distress and food security crises facing many poor countries are among the issues that will be high on the agenda at the meetings. In a curtain-raiser on Thursday last week, IMF MD Kristalina Georgieva provided a stark assessment of the outlook for the global economy, saying that the IMF's latest forecasts indicate countries accounting for about one-third of the global economy will slide into recession this year or next year. "Overall, we expect a global output loss of about $4-trillion between now and 2026," she said. "This is the size of the German economy - a massive setback for the world economy." In just three years, the world had experienced the Covid-19 shock, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and climate disasters on all continents. "These shocks have inflicted immeasurable harm on people's lives ..." Georgieva said. "It is a dramatic moment and we can only deal with it if we strive to build bridges so that the world comes together ... "Trouble travels: it doesn't stay in one place." \</doc>

Just as Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine has highlighted Europe\' s dangerous dependence on fossil fuels, increasingly frequent and intense climate-driven weather events are highlighting the death and destruction that dependence on fossil fuels has wrought. Understandably, political and public pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, move away from insecure primary energy supplies, and develop new, reliable, secure and affordable energy sources is at an all-time high. But rather than rushing ahead, we need to carefully consider which options are most realistic, and how they will be deployed and operate in the real world. Consider nuclear power. With many countries and companies now giving this option a second (or even a third) look, the 2022 World Nuclear Industry Status Report (WNISR) offers valuable insights into how the sector is faring. While the past 12 months may be remembered as a turning point for the broader energy sector, it won\' t be because of the nuclear industry. Nuclear energy\' s share of global commercial gross electricity generation in 2021 dropped to 9.8%, which is its first dip below 10% in four decades, barely more than half its peak of 17.5% in 1996. Meanwhile, wind and solar surpassed nuclear for the first time in 2021, accounting for 10.2% of gross power generation. These diverging trajectories can be seen clearly across every indicator of investment, deployment, and output. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), operating reactors peaked in 2018, both in terms of their number (449) and total capacity (396.5 gigawatts). The IAEA reports that 437 reactors were  in operation globally at the end of 2021, including 23 reactors that have not generated power for at least nine years, and which may never do so again. In 2018, when installed nuclear power peaked below 400GW, solar and wind capacity rose above 1 000 GW, on its way to reaching 1 660GW by the end of 2021. In just three years, solar and wind added two-thirds more capacity than nuclear at its last peak. Even if nuclear plants usually generate more electricity per unit of installed capacity than wind and solar, the divergence in these numbers is staggering. In 2021, total investments in non-hydro renewables hit a record $366 billion, adding an unprecedented 257GW (on net) to electricity grids, whereas operating nuclear capacity decreased by 0.4GW. Only six new reactors were connected to the grid that year, and half were in China. Then, in the first half of this year, five new reactors went online, two of which were in China. But while China has the most reactors under construction (21, as of mid-2022), it is not building them abroad. Until recently, that role was taken up by Russia, which is dominating the international market with 20 units under construction, including 17 in seven countries as of mid-2022. Sanctions and potential other geo- political developments have cast doubt on many of these projects, with a Finnish consortium already cancelling the construction of a facility based on a Russian design. Only 33 countries operate nuclear power plants today, and only three \- Bangladesh, Egypt and Turkey \- are building reactors for the first time (all in partnership with the Russian nuclear industry). Twenty-six of the 53 construction projects around the world have suffered delays, with at least 14 reporting increased delays, and two reporting new delays, just in the past year. For the first time, the WNISR also assesses the risks of nuclear power and war. There has been significant international concern about Ukraine\' s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March 4. Owing to repeated shelling in and around the area, the plant has frequently lost external power, prompting warnings from the IAEA that the situation is  untenable . Operating a nuclear facility requires motivated, rested, skilled staff, but Zaporizhzhia\' s Ukrainian personnel are under severe stress. The key challenge now is to maintain continuous cooling for the reactor core and the pool for spent fuel, even after the reactor is shut down. The failure to evacuate heat from residual decay would lead to a core meltdown within hours, or a spent-fuel fire within days or weeks, with potentially large releases of radioactivity. As world leaders convene at COP27 to discuss the global decarbonisation agenda, they should focus on the technologies that can be deployed rapidly and universally to replace fossil fuels. As consecutive editions of the WNISR have shown, nuclear power is too slow and too expensive to compete with energy efficiency measures and renewable energy.

Unless world leaders act with urgency and purpose to close the gap between the wealthy and poor, hardship and suffering will only deepen, says President Cyril Ramaphosa. The President made the remarks while addressing the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament during South Africa's State Visit to the country on Tuesday. President Ramaphosa is on a two-day Royal State Visit to the country at the invitation of His Majesty King Charles III. Without this urgency, the President said 'instability, conflict and terror will increase'. He said: 'We need to attend to the deficiencies in access to education, health care, safe water, sustainable energy and economic opportunity if we hope to end the poverty that is handed down from one generation to the next. 'Nowhere is the need to tackle inequality more important than in our response to climate change. Those countries that carry the least responsibility for global warming are most vulnerable to its effects. They do not have the resources needed to adapt to drought, floods and rising sea levels. And as they seek to grow, industrialise and diversify their economies, their energy needs will increase and the space they have to reduce emissions will narrow'. This, he said, places a responsibility on industrialised nations to contribute substantial resources to low- and middle-income countries to fund their climate actions. 'This is not charity,' he said. 'It is compensation for the harm done - and the harm yet to be done - to people in developing economies as a consequence of the industrialisation of wealthy countries. And because a global reduction in emissions benefits all countries and all people, it is also a necessary investment in the future of humanity.' The President said South Africa greatly appreciated the commitment of the UK to the implementation of a just energy transition in the country. He said this demonstrated a clear recognition by the UK government of the importance of supporting transitions to low-carbon economies in a manner that does not disadvantage affected workers, communities or industries. 'We have called on the United Kingdom and the other partners to ensure that a substantial part of the funding takes the form of grants and highly concessional loans. 'We are pleased that the final outcomes of COP27 hold out the promise of concerted action to address climate change. It was President Nelson Mandela who espoused the vision of a global community of nations that strives by all means available to improve the human condition.' Given the two country's history, shared values, durability of their relationship, he said he firmly believes that South Africa and the United Kingdom should work together for the realisation of such a global community. 'Now, let us rekindle the moral purpose of the global fight against apartheid to confront the discrimination, inequality and injustice that divides humanity and that stifles the progress of all,' he said. Strengthening commerce, trade, investment ties 'British companies need to use this advantage to greater effect, to seek out the opportunities in our country for investment and for trade. The cooperation in science and innovation between the two countries is significant, with rich potential for further expansion,' he said. He said the South African government was convinced that there was great scope to expand these areas of cooperation. 'We are undertaking far-reaching economic reforms to make our economy more competitive and more efficient, to reduce the cost of doing business and to encourage new entrants into several industries. 'As we undertake the most significant restructuring of our energy market in almost a century to address severe power shortages, there are great opportunities for investment, innovation and partnership,' he said. 'By exploring the full extent of our common interests and capabilities, I am certain that we will add another chapter to our long and rich history,' he said. He said members of the UK Parliament had been vital and engaged participants in the evolution of the relationship between the two countries. 'We thank you for your friendship, solidarity and partnership. Please be assured of the sincere and enduring friendship of South Africa and its people,' he said. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

BOARDROOM TALES BY Cynical Sasol's COP out It's difficult not to suspect the world is suffering from COP fatigue, or at least that large proportion of the world that never attends a COP event. This year nonattendees include Greta Thunberg and, given that it's taking place in no-nonsense Egypt, it's possible that the nonattendees might include thousands of activists. Thunberg reckons the events are worse than pointless as they allow governments and big business to indulge in "greenwashing, lying and cheating". As it happens, COP27 also provided Coca-Cola with a great sponsorship opportunity. COP supporters rightly counter that it's the only multilateral forum where representatives from 200 countries can speak as equals on climate change. The downside is that decisions have to be taken unanimously and end up looking like the lowest common denominator. Even then there's little evidence of any action taken and commitments made. The Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015, pledged to limit temperature increases to 1.5\'b0C. We're on track for an increase of about 2.5\'b0C by the end of the century. Of course, it might be even grimmer were it not for the annual COP f\'eate. But it's difficult to see how any progress can be made while individuals, companies and governments are determined to measure progress in terms of consumption-based economic growth. After a few days at COP, companies and countries are back to scrambling over each other to score the highest rates of growth; inevitably the environment is thrown under the consumption bus. This dark reality is probably why the annual COP events tend to be such grim affairs; countries and companies know they have to make commitments and also know most of those commitments are likely to be ignored. Having spent a sad amount of time trawling through Sasol's suite of annual reports, it's evident to me this should be the Global South's nomination for the inaugural Greg Taylor COP award. Initially I was pretty sure Sasol was just a year or two away from reaching its net zero ambition. It was using so many roadmaps it seemed impossible not to be close to its destination. Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction targets "are supported by roadmaps detailing the methodologies we propose to employ to achieve our targets," says Sasol, sounding so very like Mr Taylor. "We are also developing a scope 3 category 11 emission-reduction roadmap to support our 2030 target." And there's lots of talk about setting up partnerships with various unmentioned entities to assist Sasol on these roadmapped journeys. After more hours of intense reading, I began to suspect something was amiss. There was an absence of, well, hard facts. In Mr Taylor's life it would be pints of beer not drunk. It dawned on me: Sasol is still at the roadmap-making phase of its grand transition plan to reach net zero by 2050. And like Mr Taylor it might be taking the imperceptibly slow, steady, phased approach until 2049 and then going hell for leather. Of course, also like Mr Taylor, by that stage Sasol might be dead. COP awards aside, it is difficult to understand why a company like Sasol, which talks an awful lot about reducing emissions and improving energy efficiency, included climate control metrics in its executive performance targets only this year. One reason could be that it is able to persuade the government to give it whatever extensions it requests to legislated deadlines to clean up its act. So why bother if you don't really have to? Runner-up nominees for the inaugural Greg Taylor award must include Sasol's enabling institutional shareholders led by the Government Employees Pension Fund, Ninety One, Prudential and Allan Gray, who we all thought were investing for the long term. Now we've just got to persuade Greta. \</doc>

Private sector keen to fill the JET gap? Businesses ready to fund up to R500bn of the just energy transition investment plan Private sector keen to fill the JET gap? Editor at LargeSA's private sector stands ready to fund up to R500bn of the almost R1.5-trillion just energy transition (JET) investment plan that President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled on Friday ahead of the COP27 climate summit, which opened in Egypt on Sunday, with some of those projects already under way. The plan, which is the first of its kind globally, was sparked by the $8.5bn (R128bn) that the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU offered to support SA's just energy transition at COP26 in Glasgow a year ago. It was approved by the cabinet last week and endorsed by the international partner group and is expected to be launched formally by the leaders of the group and Ramaphosa in Egypt this week. It outlines the total investment needed over the next five years - in electricity, green hydrogen and new-energy vehicles - to enable SA to achieve its ambitious climate targets in a just way. "Based on the scale of need, the $8.5bn is clearly a small part, but it is a very important and a catalytic contribution to kickstart this process during the first five years," the head of the presidential climate finance team, Daniel Mminele, said in an interview on Saturday. The R1.5-trillion plan, which was based on extensive evidence and modelling, set out the scale of need into which the international partners would contribute and it would provide a model for others to follow. Now that the plan was out, SA was in a better position to advance discussions with the international partners and other international and domestic funders and there was significant interest, he said. European countries were revealed on Friday to be the largest contributors to the $8.5bn, along with the climate investment funds led by the World Bank. The European Investment Bank has offered over $1bn, with France and Germany together offering almost $2bn more in their own right, with a further $2.6bn from the climate investment funds. The money includes grants, concessional and commercial loans and guarantees and will mainly go to the decommissioning of Eskom's old coal plants and supporting coal mining areas, as well as to expanding SA's transmission and distribution infrastructure to enable more renewable energy to be brought on to the grid. Separately, the World Bank announced on Friday that it had approved $497m to finance the shutdown and repurposing of Eskom's 62-year-old Komati coal power station, whose last unit was switched off last week. The funding, which will also support affected workers and create new opportunities for local communities, is almost double the amount the World Bank indicated earlier this year and it will see the installation of new solar and wind plants as well as battery storage. The bank, whose president, David Malpass, visited Komati on Sunday en route to Egypt, said the Komati project was a good first step towards low-carbon development, which would enhance energy security and "can serve as a reference on how to transition fossil fuel assets for future projects in SA and around the world". The 216-page JET investment plan document released on Friday shows that SA's private sector can make R500bn available over the next five years and international and domestic public sector development finance institutions can contribute a further R150bn, to add to the R128bn from the international partner group. "There is a lot of appetite based on our discussions with the domestic financial sector. Some of it is built into their own projects and pipelines in the renewable space and some is in play already. We have been in discussions with the private sector and encouraged them to indicate to us what enabling actions from the public sector need to be in place to trigger greater flows from the private sector," Mminele said. There were also discussions under way with the Global Financial Alliance for Net Zero coalition of leading financial institutions led by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney and there was significant interest internationally, including from philanthropic funders, Mminele said. The next step would be to put the arrangements in place to implement the plan. Ramaphosa said the plan would be the subject of consultation and engagement. joffeh@businesslive.co.za \</doc>

Germany and South Africa have agreed that, because of their similar fossil fuel use challenges, they would benefit from a relationship based on cooperation and mutual learning. During a high-level round-table discussion on Just Energy Transition and Climate Action, German Vice-Chancellor https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/africa/germany-to-boost-aid-for-african-deals/ Robert Habeck said Germany was setting up climate and energy partnerships around the world, including in Africa, to support its decarbonisation plans, which included the large-scale importation of green hydrogen. The two parties discussed issues of development cooperation, including climate change, energy, training and skills development. Habeck encouraged South Africa to let go of fossil fuels to gain an advantage in seeking to HYPERLINK https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/02/21/cf-how-south-africa-can-advance-reforms-to-achieve-its-climate-goals secure green investment, for more renewable resources. Germany's energy challenge He added that the two countries could assist each other to overcome the challenges of power shortages and embrace renewables. This is despite Germany's failure to let go of fossil fuels. HYPERLINK https://www.npr.org/2022/09/27/1124448463/germany-coal-energy-crisis Reports suggest that coal-fired power plants across Germany were being given new life after Russia cut gas supplies. This opens up questions on Germany's motives for funding a just transition when it is pursuing energy from fossil fuels. Habeck insisted that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had underlined the risks of being too dependent on both a single country and on fossil fuels for energy. He added that the war had encouraged Germany to speed up its strategy to phase out its use of oil, gas and coal, despite world pressures to secure them for use in the short term. Germany was pursuing its own energy transition - referred to as "energiewende". In a statement, he said Germany had been facing difficulties similar to those in South Africa which could form the basis for enhanced cooperation and mutual learning. The European nation is planning to be off coal by 2030, HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germanys-cabinet-approves-accelerated-coal-exit-by-2030-western-state-2022-11-02/#:~:text=BERLIN%2C%20Nov%202%20(Reuters),the%20cutting%20of%20greenhouse%20emissions. according to it's cabinet Jochen Flasbarth, state secretary in the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development added that South Africa's decision to embark on a path of green growth and to tackle the problems of energy supply, unemployment and inequality had their full support.\~ "We are engaged as partners offering support to make this just energy transition a reality and to deliver tangible results for those left out for too long." Mutually beneficial relationship Trade, Industry and Competition Minister Ebrahim Patel, speaking at the fourth German-African Business Summit in Sandton on Wednesday, said Africa was seeking to build mutually beneficial partnerships to bolster its manufacturing output in "greener and more sustainable ways". Patel added that, while Africa was home to 17% of the world's population, it made up only 3% of global GDP and 2% of global manufacturing. To attract investment, Patel said African countries needed to promote political stability, the rule of law and intra-African trade and investment, while developing skills and modern infrastructure, including reliable energy supplies. He also called for greater support from German investors in Africa, including to promote higher levels of manufacturing and minerals value addition. "While this is vital for Africa, it is an opportunity for Germany too. "First, this will provide opportunities for German businesses to invest in an expanding African manufacturing sector and to strengthen your own local manufacturing capabilities, and many German companies are already doing that. "This is particularly important given the experience of supply-chain disruptions and vulnerabilities during the pandemic and as a result of geopolitical tensions," Patel said. Habeck added that the South African context was unique because, "I believe the existing and growing supply gap of electricity can be closed with renewable energy sources much faster and cheaper.

As world leaders gather at COP27 to tackle the global challenge of climate change, Western Cape MEC for Local Government and Environmental Affairs Anton Bredell faces critical decisions on the future of the city\' s food hub. Developers of the controversial Oakland City located in the Philippi horticultural area are scheduled to submit a new environmental impact assessment to Bredell tomorrow seeking approval for building more than 400 houses on land 10 times the size of Century City. And Bredell will be required to decide whether to give the development the go-ahead. Philippi Horticultural Food and Farming Campaign member Nazeer Sonday said Bredell\' s decision would have major implications.  Bredell has to decide whether he supports the development that threatens to ruin the food basket of the City or agrees with climate science and food security. If Bredell approves the assessment, this would give the developers the right to develop the land, and the campaign would be forced to seek a remedy in court. In a bid to preserve the horticultural area as a  breadbasket for the city, the campaign instituted court action challenging the approval of the Oakland City development by the City and the provincial Department of Environmental Affairs in terms of an earlier environmental assessment. In February 2020, the Western Cape High Court ordered the developers to conduct a new assessment showing the impact of the 500-hectare development on climate change, the Cape Flats aquifer, and water scarcity in the horticultural area. In her judgment, Judge Kate Savage said the City and the provincial government had not given due consideration to the impact on water and climate change as a result of some of the decisions about Oakland City. Earlier court papers showed that the Oakland City development company was controlled by collective investment schemes which belonged to several trade unions\' pension funds. However, the company was placed under curatorship after financial challenges. Sonday said:  With the new EIA we are now back again in the process of fending off any harm to the farmland, which, even during the drought that hit many farmers, managed to produce food. The development will also affect the infrastructure in the PHA.  By leaving the land fallow for the last 12 years, the developer has prevented at least 1 billion tons of vegetables from being grown, 1 500 direct and 15 000 indirect jobs, and other opportunities for land reform, claimed campaign volunteer Susanna Coleman. The campaigners said that between 2015 and 2022 climate-change science had been clear across the world following an increase in climate-change events. However, the horticultural area had shown itself to be a centre for  climate-change resilience , they said. The campaigners said there were other issues at stake that Bredell would also have to apply his mind to. These included the fact that food supply was in a precarious state, and land speculators with an interest in the outcome would  pave over the land if the outcome was in their favour.  There\' s a sand mine proposed for the north of the PHA. How much can you take away before the PHA collapses? asked Coleman. Bredell, along with former MEC for agriculture and now Premier Alan Winde, were part of a provincial cabinet decision that commissioned a study into the agricultural value of the horticultural area. The 2018 study by Indego Consulting found that the horticultural area was an urban asset that contributed to the city\' s water resilience, inclusivity, food security, and sustainability. The study also found that the encroachment on the horticultural area of industrial, informal and residential land use increased the risk of aquifer contamination and decreased the available recharge area. As early as 2009, the national Department of Agriculture decided not to grant approval for the Oakland City development land to be rezoned from horticultural to urban development use. In 2012, the department reiterated its decision. Sonday said the campaign had provided input into the new environmental assessment, as it had not addressed climate change and other land-related issues.  Colonialism resulted in indigenous people being removed from their land and contributed to poverty, hunger and unemployment. The land for the proposed Oakland City development could be used for restitution. A lawyer for the campaign, Glynn Williams, feared Bredell\' s decision would be a box-ticking exercise.  One of the dangers we are faced with is that politicians make decisions that scientists should make. But if the decision is to grant the developers the right to go ahead, we will seek a remedy in court, he said. \</doc>

As 2022 draws to a close, we are confronted with an unprecedented collision of global risks, interacting and reinforcing each other in dangerous new ways. The impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine are still rippling outwards, colliding and combining like waves on a sea. The heightened threat of nuclear conflict, the global energy crisis, the rising cost of food, deepening poverty and inequality: these consequences are interacting with the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of climate change. This confluence of global risks has led to unwelcome new terms entering the dictionary, such as 'polycrisis' and 'multicrisis.' In the face of such complex challenges, it's easy to feel helpless and paralyzed. And yet, if this year has shown us anything, it's that we need an urgent upgrade of our systems of cooperation to tackle them. It starts with making sure we have the right knowledge. Climate scientist Johan Rockstr\'f6m, a board member of our foundation, has written powerfully on the need for an international consortium of scientists to provide shared insights on the emerging interactions between risks. At the Global Challenges Foundation, we've just released our annual review of global catastrophic risks, risks that threaten the survival of more than ten per cent of humanity. This year's report shows how, more than ever, our systems and structures for preventing and managing these risks are both outdated and inadequate. Whether it's climate change, environmental breakdown, nuclear conflict, pandemics or artificial intelligence, we have a systemic problem with processing and acting on the complex challenges that lie in the intersections. Of course, there is no one magic solution, given the multilateral system that we inhabit. However, there are many existing proposals to improve the mechanics of global governance that could be immediately fast tracked. The report also proposes reviving the UN's Trusteeship Council, inactive for many years, as a multi-stakeholder body to tackle emerging challenges and to act to preserve the global commons on behalf of future generations. The failure of the COP27 climate talks in Egypt to agree strong measures to curb fossil fuel production has demonstrated how intergovernmental negotiations are not producing rapid enough action on climate change. On top of this, the global energy crisis has led to some countries slowing or shelving their green agendas, in a year of extreme temperatures and climate-related crises. We urgently need to find alternative ways of collaborating to prevent catastrophic climate change. One key proposal is a carbon tax - administered at both global and national levels - with the proceeds going to the communities who are most affected. The International Monetary Fund concluded that, of all the various recognised strategies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, implementing a carbon tax would be the most powerful and efficient. Of course, this may not be the easiest 'sell' politically during a cost-of-living crisis but evidence from countries like Canada shows that it can be done gradually and sensitively. The spread of COVID-19 around the world since 2020 has highlighted the linkages between environmental destruction and pandemics. COVID-19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic that humanity faces. As renowned epidemiologist and public health expert Professor David Heymann writes in his pandemics chapter in our report, as well as tackling the root causes of new pathogens coming into contact with humans, we need to upgrade the international frameworks that govern how countries report on new disease outbreaks. This means enacting a stronger enforcement mechanism to the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations, and a Pandemic Treaty. When it comes to nuclear risk, looming ever larger over Ukraine, it's now more likely than ever that nuclear weapons will be used in either military actions, miscalculation or by accident than at any time since the beginning of the nuclear age. The international community must treat all threats to use nuclear weapons very seriously. Even 'small' or 'tactical' weapons can cause terrible damage and their use would undermine the nuclear taboo in place since their use at the end of the Second World War. Nuclear expert, and contributor to our report, Kennette Benedict says there is still much more we can do to prevent a nuclear disaster. IAEA Director General Raffael Grossi and his colleagues are doing heroic work to prevent nuclear plant disasters in Ukraine. The international community must continue to support the agency and provide more funding for IAEA's work. Explicit protection of nuclear plants in violent conflicts and war should be codified in international law. As we say goodbye to this year of global risks, this should be top of our 'to do' list for 2023.

SA's foreign policy faces the $8.5bn question PETER BRUCE In the great scheme of things, $8.5bn is not a lot of money. It's a fraction of what the Guptas stole from us, and Elon Musk just paid $44bn for Twitter. Prosus, once Naspers, has seen its market capitalisation fall $200bn in the last 12 months, to a mere $82bn on Friday, when $8.5bn was worth R154.36bn. Nonetheless, $8.5bn is the most important number in the country right now. It is the amount the US, the UK and the EU promised last year to lend South Africa to help it move away from polluting coal-fired energy, epitomised by Eskom, towards a carbon-free future. From November 6 at Sharm el-Sheikh, the Egyptian Red Sea resort, the UN's COP27 meets to measure progress in slowing down global warming. South Africa is committed to presenting a plan to its potential donors of how it will spend that $8.5bn. To get new generating power on line, even if it is privately produced, Eskom will have to build 14,200km of extra high- voltage transmission lines and build 170 new transformers in the next 10 years. Mainly this is to help get new solar and wind power on the transmission network, and to do it close to where the wind and solar are strongest and not in Mpumalanga and Limpopo where the coal power stations are and where the grid is already muscular. This is the work Eskom CEO Andr\'e9 de Ruyter needs the $8.5bn to finance, and it was he who first found the money. It was quickly subsumed into the political sphere however, and the plan for Sharm el-Sheikh will be presented by a team from President Cyril Ramaphosa's office led by former deputy Reserve Bank governor Daniel Mminele. Not all of the money will go to Eskom. Other ministers have fought to get their paws on it. Ebrahim Patel wants some to develop green hydrogen and to start producing electric cars. It isn't clear that's what the lenders want. Indeed, it isn't clear the money is even still on the table or what conditions might now apply. If you were lending to South Africa to help it cut carbon emissions, who would you trust enough to give the money to? Officials will deny it but the fact that South Africa cannot bring itself to vote in the UN against not just the invasion - which the donor countries are spending huge amounts to resist - but against the annexations of parts of Ukraine is something that grates in London, Washington and Brussels. The arrival of a Russian oligarch's multimillion-dollar superyacht seeking refuge in Cape Town this week will grate as well. Sure, Ramaphosa got to see US President Joe Biden last month. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\'e1nchez, saw Ramaphosa in Pretoria on Thursday, and he gets a state visit to meet King Charles in London at the end of November. But these are not visits of old friends. We are being measured up again. Efforts by our largely amateurish diplomatic service to stay in the middle of the road ignore the fact that this is where the accidents happen. Is South Africa still a friend the West can rely on? Every time it opens its mouth, foreign affairs whines at the West and comforts its enemies. On Friday it whined about a routine US terrorism alert. Do they mind? My guess is that despite our loss of moral standing (we continue to whine about sanctions against Zimbabwe when few countries deserve sanctions more) the West will still consider us worth the $8.5bn effort. They know by now that the ANC won't run this country forever. By 2032 the ANC may not even exist because it so utterly depends on being in power to fund itself. It's probably that prospect that best promises Mminele the success he is working for. And, like I said, $8.5-billion isn't a lot of money. \</doc>

Remember that amusing aphorism about ice hockey? "I went to a fight the other night and a hockey game broke out." That's how the Fifa World Cup in Qatar is beginning to feel.\~ Despite the host nation's doubling down on their discriminatory laws against gay people in the face of better-late-than-never global outrage and buyer's regret over the choice of the Middle Eastern oil powerhouse in the first place, with its jarring juxtaposition to the annual climate change negotiations at COP27 just across the desert in Egypt, massive air conditioners keeping stadiums built on the blood of poorly paid and treated migrant workers, to the point where journalists and fans have been arrested or hassled for wearing the LGBT+ colours and the resulting will-he-won't-he? saga of whether England Captain Harry Kane would wear a "one love" armband - he didn't, as the English Football Association meekly backed down ahead of a match against Iran in which the pampered and over-paid Englishmen faced an Iranian team who by declining sing their national team and by virtue of their captain's defiant press conference in which he spoke out against human rights' abuses back at home - to the same uncertainty clouding the pre-match coverage of Germany's first game of the tournament and questions over how Germany captain Manuel Neuer would handle the situation - answer: admirably, as his team opted to wear rainbow-coloured boots and to defiantly cover their mouths with their hands in the team photo just prior to the start of the game, prompting a culture war in the Arabian Peninsula and a dismally shallow and trite global conversation about whether football and politics should mix, at a World Cup where real football fans appears to be in short supply and largely outnumbered by those of the fake, bussed-in-for-the-purpose variety, despite all of this, and more, a football tournament has broken out.\~ Just. But only just.\~\~ Japan beat Germany with a stirring second half performance, but then yesterday inexplicably lost to Costa Rica, who had been hammered 7-0 just a few days before by Spain, who then last night struggled to draw with a mediocre German team.\~ Saudi Arabia's eye-catching shock defeat of Argentina in the first round of matches could not eclipse the fact that Qatar 22 is on track to break the record number of goalless draws - there have been four so far and we are barely two-thirds of the way through the group stage.\~ Having emerged blinking and hesitatingly into the bright Arabian desert light, the football now has to decide whether it can provide enough diverting drama to save Qatar 22 from ignominy and from winning the prize for the worst and as well as the most grotesquely inappropriate Fifa World Cup of all time.\~ What will that take? A whole lot more. Great World Cups are defined by great matches, great teams and great individual players - especially the latter.\~ This one seems perilously short of all three at the moment. The curiosity and surprise of HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/sport/2022-11-26-minnows-prove-that-there-is-no-i-in-team-at-the-world-cup/ a big team losing or even failing to get through to the knock-out stages is not nearly enough to cross the threshold.\~ So far, there have been very few fine goals, let alone stirring games. But it is not too late for something more exhilarating to happen. Lionel Messi's extraordinary goal against Mexico - HYPERLINK the overhead drone footage of the goal reveals just how good it was - was breath-taking, suggesting that this, finally, may be the tournament where he does justice to his unique generational talent.\~ The Brazilians look very good, but not brilliant - not, at least, by the standards of their great teams of the past: Sweden 1958, Mexico 1970, South Korea 2002. There is no Roberto Carlos or Socrates or Bobeto, let alone a Pele.\~ The French team look "merely competent"; which may be enough for them to keep the trophy.\~ No cheeky little upstart team has yet suggested that it can break the hold of the big five - Brazil, Germany, Argentina and Italy, who between them have won 15 of the 21 World Cups.\~ If there cannot be brilliance, then there must at least be romance. But Qatar 22 feels anything but romantic - more like a Florida holiday camp than Venice; tacky wealth rather than elegance and art.\~ I suspect one friend's observation captured the mood among politically progressive football fans around the world. "I switch on the television to watch a game and immediately feel guilty," he remarked. I know how he feels.\~ It shouldn't feel like this. But it does. Either football will raise its game to extraordinary heights to enable us to transcend all the nonsense, with the drama eclipsing our ambivalence and guilt, or we will continue to squirm uncomfortably in our living room seats.

SOCIAL MEDIA Queen's death stirs debate on colonial past of UK The UK has been following the debate in SA on the colonial legacy of the late Queen Elizabeth with interest and believes it is important for it to understand and participate in those debates, the UK's high commissioner in SA, Anthony Phillipson, has said. President Cyril Ramaphosa went to London to attend the state funeral for Queen Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey, a prefuneral reception hosted by King Charles and a reception immediately after the state funeral service hosted by UK foreign secretary James Cleverly. The funeral is expected to be the largest gathering of the world's heads of state since the funeral of former president Nelson Mandela in 2013. While many South Africans responded with warmth and positive sentiment after the death of the queen, who reigned for 70 years, there has also been extensive negative comment on social media. The EFF last week distanced itself from President Cyril Ramaphosa's condolence messages, saying that the queen had been the head of state of countries that were colonised by Britain and had headed an institution whose role was synonymous with pain, suffering and land dispossession. Phillipson, who was speaking to the media last week before the queen's state funeral on Monday in London, said that the queen's death has reopened these debates, but that these debates are not new. The new king, Charles had conceded there was a need to recognise the past when he opened the commonwealth meeting in Rwanda. Charles also spoke about the dark stain left by slavery when Barbados became a republic, saying there was a need to recognise this in building relationships for the modern world, said the British envoy. "In SA, we have always wanted to be very conscious of how people perceive the past relationship between the UK and SA as we go about building bonds for the future. "We can't change the history, but we can recognise how it affects people, and that's the context in which we are framing partnerships for the future," said Phillipson. Condolence books have been available for the public to sign at the UK high commissioner's residences in Pretoria and Cape Town. The queen is credited with having helped to build the commonwealth as the British Empire ended. The commonwealth, which was recently joined by two new African countries - neither of which had ever been British colonies - now has 56 members, including SA, compared with the original 14. The UK is one of the rich countries that have agreed to make $8.5bn available to support SA's just energy transition (JET). Phillipson said that the UK is supporting SA in developing an investment plan for the Just Energy Transition Partnership, which will be delivered at a pace to be determined by SA. Ramaphosa also discussed the partnership with US President Joe Biden on his visit to the US last week. The presidency said on Saturday that work on the investment plans for the partnership between SA, the US, UK, France, Germany and the EU is expected to be completed by the UN Climate Change conference ( COP 27 ) in November in Egypt. \</doc>

SA will see real change from Just Energy Transition Partnership The solid and actionable scheme will soon transition the country to a low-carbon economy South Africans should start to see real economic change as a result of the country's internationally ground-breaking $8.5bn Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP). During the world leaders summit at COP27 on November 7, President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP). This sets out in detail how SA proposes to use the $8.5bn the EU and several developed nations have pledged towards the country's transition to a low-carbon economy. This is a moment of enormous opportunity, one that should be celebrated. The JET-IP has a real chance of boosting investor confidence in SA - and as we all know, with investment comes jobs. That is good news in a country caught in a seemingly interminable quagmire that is commonly called our "triple challenge" - the world's highest rate of inequality, compounded by high levels of poverty and unemployment. The JET-IP presents a solid and actionable scheme for transitioning SA to a low-carbon economy over the next five years, in line with our commitment under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's 2015 Paris Agreement. More than that, the plan ties in with work SA's public and private sectors are already undertaking. This sends a clear signal that this should not be yet another document that gathers dust on official shelves. The JET-IP itself is internationally significant as a first of its kind, and has caught the attention of other developing countries, several of which have approached SA to learn how they too can garner international support to achieve their own decarbonisation goals. It is also remarkable as an example of the power of collective action in driving climate ambition and investment. The power of collective action is something the National Business Initiative (NBI) strives to achieve across all of our work areas, including our work on the JET in SA. Our Just Transition Pathway's work was developed alongside our partners, Business Unity SA and the Boston Consulting Group, with the aim of developing an analytical fact base to support decision-making and co-ordinate the efforts of key national and international stakeholders. This work was also shared with important actors, including government, to inform our country commitments to global climate efforts at COP26, in Glasgow during 2021. This collective action boosted SA's climate ambition, declared in the run-up to COP26 in a revised nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement, to restrict global warming to well below 2\'b0C, compared with pre-industrial levels. This increased ambition caught the attention of the US, France, Germany, the UK and the EU, now SA's JET-IP partners. Together with our Just Transition Pathway project partners, the NBI also pinpointed three key sectors - renewable energy, electric vehicles and green hydrogen - that also form the backbone of the JET-IP. This is why the NBI confidently supports our country's new practical blueprint for investing in a greener future. In addition, we are confident that South Africans will start to reap the rewards of the JET-IP in what is a fairly short time: 18 months. The first step will be a solid answer to the energy crisis we all face, which will be a real boon to our economy. It urgently requires an increase in SA's grid capacity so that more energy from renewable resources can be fed into our severely anaemic system - something that cannot happen quickly enough. South Africans - and particularly those living in Mpumalanga, where most of our major coal-fired power plants are situated - will also begin to see many more focused programmes aimed at ensuring individuals gain the skills they need to take part in this transition to a low-carbon economy, whether through upskilling or reskilling. There can be no quibbling about the need for this transition: we must make it happen, and as quickly as possible. Without switching from an economy that emits high levels of greenhouse gases to a low-emissions economy, SA stands to lose out on business with some of its largest trading partners. By some estimates, up to 15% of GDP and 1-million direct jobs are at risk. The EU and others will increasingly tax and restrict trade in goods produced in ways that emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, while China has pledged to stop financing coal beyond its borders. The Asian country has to do this to meet the pledges it has made to restrict climate change. If SA is to reach greener pastures, we must as a country make this transition from a high- to a low-carbon economy. We must also do it as quickly as we can. Now we have a plan to lead us, so let's get busy. Molotsoane is head: environment & society at the National Business Initiative. Climate ambition: Green hydrogen is part of the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, which has a chance of boosting investor confidence in SA. 123RF \</doc>

As HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/#/ COP27 comes to an end and African delegations return to focus on the implementation of policy and programmes on adaptation, mitigation, the just energy transition and setting financial requirements on a work programme that sets clear goals and targets, we need to start advocating for youth and women to play a part in this process and what effective and substantive inclusion should look like at institutional level in Africa. African countries either intend to or have already started taking climate action to cut carbon emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. Countries such as Ghana, Morocco and Uganda are to translate their nationally determined contributions commitments into implementation strategies capable of attracting investments, while countries such as Nigeria, Mauritania and Zimbabwe are in the process of developing HYPERLINK https://www.unep.org/regions/africa/regional-initiatives/responding-climate-change national adaptation plans Youth and women could play a fundamental role in strengthening and enabling the transition to climate-resilient development in Africa through responsive policies, plans and programmes towards transformed economies, healthy ecosystems and human well-being that embody intersectional interventions. The main reason marginalised groups must be involved in the design and implementation of climate response actions is they are the most affected by climate change andcan ensure equal sharing of benefits.\~ They possess unique knowledge, innovation and local experiences that could shape critical decision-making that is effective to combat climate change. Their participation is crucial and, if neglected, will amount to inequitable climate action in Africa.\~ The question is how should African countries include youth and women in their climate action processes. African governments and multilateral institutions need to make political and financial commitments to support the contributions and substantive inclusion of youth and women at all levels.\~ For example, policies and national adaptation strategies need to be developed with youth and women (not just in consultation), strict youth and women quotas need to be set for every decision-making body at all levels and procurement processes need to give preference to youth and women-owned entities.\~ This holds the governments accountable to achieve gender and youth parity in environmental decision-making institutions. In South Africa the Climate Change Commission consists of one person who has been identified as a youth out of the 34 commissioners and 40% of the commission is composed of women. The African Union, regional economic communities such as the Southern African Development Community and the Economic Community of West African States and national governments must implement a climate action fund, which provides funding for formal and informal projects on mitigation and adaptation to climate change proposed by youth and women's organisations or NGOs that work with youth and women. This should be coupled with technical skills support, partnership and collaborations and capacity building in project implementation. Working together with learning institutions, African countries need to develop climate change educational programmes and knowledge resources for marginalised groups to be capacitated on climate change.\~ Capacity-building, environmental awareness and information exchange, with a vision to foster a generation of environmentally conscious citizens capable of positive action is important.\~ Climate education, including technical environmental training, can increase their resilience and build their capacity to work with climate information and lead climate solutions. Youth and women face multiple, interconnected barriers that restrict their ability to effect change. Resource allocation gaps make it difficult for them to contribute to climate action.\~ For example, land tenure systems and access to land remain an impediment to youth development and gender equality in forestry and agriculture. Collective land tenure systems tend to assume youth and gender inclusion, so proactive intersectional measures to achieve access are crucial. Supporting youth and women entrepreneurs in climate change innovation is important. Increasing their participation in the labour force will sufficiently increase the world's GDP for financing sustainable development. It offers youth and women many entrepreneurial avenues for further use of renewable energy, which in turn mitigates carbon emissions.\~ This can be achieved by accelerators and incubators that offer capital and minimise red tape, appointing more young people and women to the boards of venture capital firms and banks that invest in climate change innovations at community level and recruit more youth and women in "green" jobs. African institutions and governments need to avoid youth and women tokenism, where young people and women have little or no substantial influence in decision-making and the design and implementation of programmes and policies.\~ Investing in youth and women creates a ripple effect that yields multiple benefits, not only for individual youth and women, but also for families, neighbourhoods and countries.\~ Although youth and women on the continent are pushing their way forward into decision-making spaces, their involvement remains fragmented because of a lack of access to resources, expertise and opportunities. Moving away from fossil-fuel-based economies to clean, environmentally friendly economies is a complex task that requires changes to many social and economic systems. Therefore, co-creating solutions to climate change through the direct involvement of youth and women in the design, implementation and evaluation of all climate action is crucial - not as beneficiaries but as partners.

South Africa can only meet its commitments to reach net zero emissions with help from local and transnational financing, from both the public and private sectors COP27 concluded with yet another acknowledgement of the importance of climate finance, but questions linger over how a developing country like South Africa can shift from its current fossil fuel-intensive economy over the next two decades. This transition is not only necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, but to ensure that the country's export market is not at risk of being left behind and crippled by its reliance on carbon-intensive products. Climate action, or lack thereof, therefore has broad macroeconomic implications.\~ Intellidex, a research and consulting firm that specialises in capital markets and financial services in Africa, says in its Capital Markets Report 2022 that South Africa will need between R4 trillion and R8.5 trillion over the next 30 years for financing the country's climate mitigation commitments. This will require substantial and innovative financing mechanisms and drastic changes to capital market flow structures. The World Bank says the R8.5 trillion needs to be divided roughly into R4.2 trillion for mitigation, R2.2 trillion for adaptation and R2 trillion for the Just Economic Transition (JET).\~ In the short term, Eskom requires an estimated R1.2 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2030 to develop a successful transition in the power sector. This includes R990 billion for generation capacity, R130 billion for transmission capacity and R56 billion for distribution capacity.\~ What is climate finance, and why is it limited in the capital market? South Africa can only meet its commitments to reach net zero emissions by mid century with the help of local and transnational financing from both the public purse and the private sector. Unlocking the level of finance required cannot hinge solely on the state's coffers, which are limited by weak growth and a widening debt-to-GDP ratio.\~ It will need new and innovative approaches which, according to the Intellidex report, "will help bridge the gap between traditional philanthropic funding, development aid and public sector financing on the one end of the spectrum, to commercial investors on the other end". Globally, the existing capital markets structure has shown to be limiting and insensitive to the scale of support and investment required for this transition to happen at the pace required. President Cyril Ramaphosa told the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP) in Egypt that at present, multilateral banks are risk averse, and that financing is generally inaccessible for\~ developing nations.\~ "The multilateral development banks need to be reformed to meet the needs of developing economies for sustainable development and climate resilience. At present, multilateral support is out of reach of the majority of the world's population due to lending policies that are risk averse and carry onerous costs and conditionalities," Ramaphosa said.\~ The Intellidex report says continued blockages in the existing capital markets include:   a lack of investable pipelines;\~ ambiguity around the Just Energy Transition (JET) conceptualisation;\~ a leadership vacuum;\~   issues related to liquidity, FX risks and lacklustre demand;\~ insufficient financial innovation;\~ skills shortages;\~ [a lack of] sustainable investing and ESG integration practices;\~   the green finance taxonomy;\~   JSE sustainability and climate disclosures;\~ poor macroeconomic fundamentals; and\~ poor quality data.\~ "The challenge for financing the JET is not only how to deliver large-scale new renewable infrastructure and associated grid and storage capacity (as well as other components of the energy ecosystem), but also how to ensure that the losers from the transition are appropriately compensated or have a fair stake in the success of it, and indeed how those social solutions are financed," states the Intellidex report. South Africa has been slow to adopt newer finance instruments such as green, social and sustainability bonds. The JSE has expanded its green bond segment to include sustainability but this remains largely underdeveloped, according to the report findings. A lack of pipeline projects has also meant that banks have no need to issue higher sustainability bonds. To date, data shows the value of these bonds are nowhere near to what is needed.\~ But the JSE's Transition Finance segment has an important role to play in helping facilitate a just transition by ensuring that heavy emitters and hard-to-abate sectors are not cut off from capital markets entirely, and thereby not forced to shut down abruptly. For it to work, institutional investors need to be sensitised to how this segment works.\~ A number of other finding mechanisms are also required from banks and insurers. "To reach the scale required, banks will need to move assets off the balance sheet to the institutional market," the Intellidex report states. To accelerate the just energy transition, the report concludes that South Africa must:   identify the gaps in the local ecosystem that need to be closed to crowd in commercial funders;\~ identify the key aspects from a technical ESG application perspective that need to be addressed, to ensure that commercial investors as well as development financiers can allocate capital to the markets most urgently in need of funding to achieve the SDGs; and identify the key areas for philanthropic funders to provide catalytic capital to achieve measurable, scalable and replicable impact on the JET. This may assist in addressing the pressing blockages that are currently limiting finance for the country's road to carbon neutrality in the next 30 years. - Tunicia Phillips\~ The gap to avoid certain future disasters is closing and the world is strolling to avoid the worst, according to scientists. This is why it is critical that everyone understands climate change language. Climate change diplomacy at large conferences like the 27th gathering of the COP in Egypt involve technical language and common concepts that are often unfamiliar to the general public, yet the outcomes have enormous consequences for everyone, particularly society's most vulnerable\~ Climate change issues are loaded with technical terms that directly relate to dealing with and preventing the unnatural warming of our planet. This warming is fueled by past and present greenhouse gas emissions that are trapping heat in the air: Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the fluorinated gases (F gases) that are released from various industrial, commercial and domestic activities such as electricity generation, steel and cement production, transport, agriculture, refrigeration and air conditioning.\~ Global energy production is still largely reliant on fossil fuels, which have released the bulk of historical emissions trapped in the atmosphere. Scientific assessments like those of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) dating back to 1990 have evolved with technological and scientific modelling advancements and have consistently shown increased proof that this heating is occurring and that it is anthropogenic, meaning it originates from human activity.\~ The science\~ The IPCC gains its credibility from the transparent, robust peer reviewing and rigorous checking process on its research and supporting data, showing the extent and risks of the warming. It took eight years before it released the Sixth Assessment in 2022, warning, among other things, that our capacity to handle the current projected warming is slowly narrowing, and so is the time available to avoid the worst.\~ The reports are a synthesis of large quantities of available data and research by hundreds of experts around the world. In the Fifth Assessment, 830 lead authors and review editors drew on the work of over 1 000 contributors. In addition about 2 000 experts provided over 140 000 review comments. The IPCC findings are largely responsible for the 1.5C warming target.\~ To put warming into perspective, there is only a 2% temperature difference between a person whose body temperature is regarded as normal (36 or 37C) and readings that indicate someone is seriously ill from infection at 38, 39 and 40 degrees celsius. In climate science, one degree of warming can be the difference between liveable and unlivable land. At present the outcomes of the COP are not aligned to the urgency and scale of the IPCC science and recommendations.\~ Mitigation Mitigation is the act of stopping current and future greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming to liveable levels. It involves decarbonising major industries and moving towards greener sustainable development that is less reliant on fossil fuels. Other greenhouse gases such as methane are expected to see an uptick as countries turn to natural gas for energy. Meanwhile fossil fuels like coal are seeing increased demand and boom in the global market in the short term because of global energy insecurity, and a number of developing nations are only willing to peak their emissions after 2025 and 2030. This may require historically high emitters to reduce emissions at a faster pace and scale to bring emissions as close to zero as possible by 2050. Reforestation and restoration are key to mitigating climate change by using plants' natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide, although questions around whether they can single-handedly do so is a continued topic of debate.\~ To support mitigation various financial mechanisms have been introduced, such as carbon tax on high emitting industries and carbon markets, which are essentially trading in certificates linked to emission reduction activities. Sasol, for example, can contribute to emission reduction activities away from its operations and count that credit towards its reductions or sell that credit on the carbon market. Finance is needed to move global energy to renewable systems and invest in the technology to capture CO2 in the future.\~ Fair Share For share refers to a country's responsibility on climate action in the context of its development and historical emissions, which are generally low for emerging markets. Parties under the COP submit nationally determined contributions that indicate how much they are willing to cut emissions over a certain period in relation to their fair share of the crisis. A country like Zimbabwe, for example, would not share the same responsibility towards mitigation as the US or Australia. Developing countries are heavily reliant on financial support to cut emissions and developed nations have committed to helping them.\~ Adaptation & Resilience Adaptation and resilience are society's ability to withstand present and future climate related shocks such as extreme weather, slow onset disasters like drought and sea level rise as well as the health, economic and social risks associated with these events. Calls to put as much focus on adaptation as mitigation at the COP level have intensified over the years, but financial targets have been missed. Wealthy nations are already due to set a new financial target to support developing countries faced with the risks of climate change - a task that COP27 failed to complete. Scientists have recommended restoration of natural ecosystems as key to building the natural adaptation capacity to withstand current and future climate impacts. This is driving global calls for a new deal for nature that will conserve and restore nature's ability to continue providing resources for humanity. \~ The post HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/special-reports/2022-12-08-climate-finance-requires-substantial-shifts-in-markets/ Climate finance requires substantial shifts in markets appeared first on HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za The Mail & Guardian \</doc>

Powered by the passion for running and the environment, an Africa-focused global movement is harnessing the power of the youth in order to help improve the air quality of cities across the continent. Conceptualised by public health physician and urban epidemiologist Tollulah Oni, the Cityzens for Clean Air campaign seeks to amplify young voices by enabling run groups to capture information about the air quality and feature neighbourhoods where it is easy or difficult to run. Building the momentum towards COP27 in November, this information will be used to design youth-led advocacy tools and tactics with the hope of spreading the activation across the continent, advocating for healthy climate-resilient public spaces in urban cities. Oni said given that the climate crisis is a health crisis, she noticed how urban residents are disproportionately impacted by climate-induced disruptions and felt something needed to be done.  I\' m a runner. I run wherever I go as a way to get to know the city. And in many cities in South Africa and Africa that I ran through, I started noticing that people were claiming public space for physical activity in ways that sometimes posed risks to their health. In particular, I noticed people running in places with high levels of air pollution and high risk of injury. So, as a public health doctor, I was conflicted.  While it was great to see people running and exercising in public space, I realised that despite the fact that the air we breathe is so critical to our health, air pollution has been essentially normalised in many cities, often perceived as the norm.  As a result, air quality was often not measured, and many people were not aware of the many different ways that air pollution impacts health, such as. increasing the risk of strokes, premature births, and negatively impacting cognitive development of children.  So I thought, what if we harnessed the young demographic on our continent to raise awareness of the fact that air quality is a critical ingredient in creating healthy climate-resilient cities, and have youths shape efforts to raise awareness of the importance of measuring air pollution so that we can have a better understanding of where to target interventions and to be able to know how interventions improve air quality and health, said Oni. Biostatistician at UrbanBetter and chief of staff for the Cityzens for Clean Air Campaign, Monika Kamkuemah, said that seeing climate change is the biggest threat to human well-being and human development, collaborating with young citizen scientists in this participatory design is important so that they can shape the narrative that will emerge from the research process.  Climate change is the biggest threat to human well-being and human development. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, and heat stress between 2030 and 2050.  The campaign aims to address the air we breathe and the spaces we live, which are fundamental in shaping human health.  Climate change leads to increased morbidity and mortality from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues.  Furthermore, air pollution and lack of access to safe and clean public spaces compromises the ability to engage in physical activity. Lack of/ insufficient physical activity is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs).  Therefore, the campaign will sensitise the community, particularly young people, on the role they can play in mitigating climate risks and ascertaining their political self-efficacy around environmental justice, climate change and advocating for healthier public spaces, said Kamkuemah. The advocacy messages will be co- designed with Run Leaders recruited in Cape Town, Accra and Lagos. The campaign will start in Cape Town on July 30, Accra in August and Lagos in September. \</doc>

The inaugural Future of Sustainability Summit, held in partnership with Old Mutual, featured a broad spectrum of thought leaders, entrepreneurs, industry experts, and business leaders all sharing their insights on how to mobilise Africa towards a net-zero and fully sustainable future. Moderator Zanele Morrison led a discussion with Sue Allchurch, chief of outreach and engagement, and Olajobi Makinwa, chief of intergovernmental relations and Africa, both from the UN Global Compact. They tackled the topic of progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and Africa's role in achieving sustainability.Allchurch pointed out that the world is well off track in achieving the UNSDGs by 2030 - according to the Social Progress Imperative, we are 62 years behind schedule, and the Covid-19 pandemic has only made matters worse.Women empowerment a potential silver bulletLooking at gender equality, for example, Allchurch noted that at our current pace - according to data from the World Economic Forum, it would take 267 years to close the economic gender gap.The benefits of women participating in economies are multiple, she noted, and could serve as the silver bullet to achieving all the other SDGs. Women-owned businesses deliver twice as much as male-owned businesses for every dollar invested. They plough more of their money back into their communities and families. And women in leadership invest significantly more in innovations that have a social and environmental impact, explained Allchurch."We also know that women-owned businesses employ more women - two and a half times at the rate of men-owned businesses. So if we can get more women entrepreneurs... we will have better businesses, we'll have better societies, and we'll have better emissions progress," she said.Sustainability is about mindsetWhile Africa has abundant human and natural resources, the continent faces numerous challenges, including poverty, inequality and inadequate infrastructure, said Makinwa. Sustainability, she noted, is about mindset and how we navigate these challenges as a continent while effectively harnessing our resources so that all may benefit.Covid-19 has been an eye-opener for the continent, she said, underscoring the need for openness, accountability, partnerships and solidarity. "We saw during Covid-19 how the private sector partnered with governments to address the challenges, and this is what sustainability is also about - ensuring that all stakeholders are on board in addressing the challenges that we face today," she said.The UN Global Compact, explained Allchurch, works with the Science-based Targets initiative to help businesses set emissions reduction goals that align to the below-2\'b0C global warming target outlined in the Paris Agreement. It also focuses on working towards a fair and just transition to a green economy, collaborating with partners across various fields. "We need to make sure that no geography, no people, no sector is left behind in this chain," she said."In the next eight years the world has to halve its emissions output that happens each year... So everyone, including Africa, has to fully engage," emphasised Allchurch.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/422/229390.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/422/229390.html :EMBED-->Africa has to prioritise its unique challengesWhile acknowledging that the climate crisis requires urgency, Africa has to also prioritise its most pertinent challenges so that it can develop to its own full potential, said Makinwa. To this end, the UN Global Compact launched its Africa strategy last year to ensure its programmatic offerings are relevant to the continent.The organisation has also established the Africa Business Leaders Coalition (ABLC), providing companies with a platform to advocate for issues most relevant to Africa. The ABLC is this year focusing on climate action ahead of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. \</doc>

PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa\' s energy plan got a passive nod from the ANC\' s policy conference while a resolution to continue with the use of coal as the bedrock of the energy mix received a resounding response. However, the governing party also spoke of sticking to commitments made at COP 27 on a Just Transition programme that had received at least $8 billion in an endowment. Briefing the media at the weekend, ANC head of transformation and Human Settlements Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi said the retirement of coal should be  at a pace and scale the country could afford , which explained why Mineral Reources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe was adamant that the abundant supply of the coal resource would be a folly to let go of.  There is a strong feeling the Just Transition should not compromise security of supply, but also the issue more around concerns around communities, where others were sharing experience that when you decommission plants, don\' t only concern yourself with Eskom employees but think as well of the coal mines that are supporting or supplying that plant; also do the just transition at a pace and scale that the country can afford (while) not leaving anyone behind. There was consensus of the need to protect Eskom and make sure it comes to efficiency, Kubayi said. Kubayi said recent pronouncements by Ramaphosa, along with Mantashe, on Eskom 2, a second state entity to supplement the existing entity, were not discussed, although the seriousness of intervention to rehabilitate Eskom was stamped by two former presidents and youth leaders.  There were concerns that the role of Eskom and other SOEs should not be weakened, but strengthened so that they play a stronger role, said ANC economics consultant Kenneth Creamer. South Africa at the COP 26, forged the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) jointly with the UK, the US, France, Germany and the EU. Under the JETP, partner governments pledged an initial $8.5 billion (R139.94bn) to accelerate the country\' s long-term just transition process to reduce the carbon intensity of the electricity system, while also developing new sectors such as green hydrogen and electric vehicles. Kubayi clarified that there wasn\' t a call to review the compacts that South Africa has made, but that the delegates focused more on the practicality of what was in front of them.  Delegates deliberated on the practicals of the Just Transition. We had delegates from Mpumalanga and Limpopo, particularly Mpumalanga who were concerned that the communities should benefit from the transition \- that is what we are saying, nobody must be left behind. There wasn\' t a call for us to review agreements or treaties, it\' s about how we respond as a government and how we move in the just transition, she said. Mantashe has been known to caution against an  accelerated transition .  The assumed pendulum swing, or what others call \' accelerated transition\' , intent on replacing one system with another in a flash, is both irrational and dangerous, Mantashe said earlier this year. \</doc>

ESG in the maritime sector Samsa has published drafts of two codes of good practice, while an amendment bill is in the worksAndre October, Sheena Dias, Sharmila Naidoo & Lesiba Legodi Webber Wentzel E nvironmental, social and governance (ESG) principles and reporting are highly relevant to the maritime sector, which faces issues such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants, recycling, ecological impacts, business ethics, employee health and safety, as well as accident and safety management. About 90% of global trade is transported by sea and the shipping industry accounts for nearly 3% of the world's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The industry is under immense pressure to become cleaner and greener. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO), as the international governing body for shipping, sets out several regulations to protect the environment, through the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (Marpol), safety of workers through the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (Solas) and the welfare of shipping professionals through the International Labour Conference-Maritime Labour Convention (ILO-MLC). CSR is not imposed on entities but rather adopted by them. Making it mandatory for maritime organisations to comply with CSR would help the shipping industry to: develop green ships, from building and operation to scrapping; ensure the welfare of ships' crews in terms of safety, security, health and communication; and go a step further than IMO and other international regulations to ensure crews' enjoy basic rights. Bunkering and ship-to-ship transfers codes of practice The SA Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa) has published drafts of the Bunkering Code of Practice and the Ship-to-Ship Code of Practice for Cargo Transfers. In September 2022, Samsa published Marine Information Notice 10-22. This explained that Samsa, in collaboration with SA's transport department and the National Ports Authority, had updated the codes because of several oil spills along the SA coastline (specifically in Algoa Bay) during bunkering activities between 2016 and 2019. As a result, the government reviewed all policies, procedures and processes for the application, approval and management of these activities. The stated purpose of the codes is to ensure that bunkering/STS transfer operations are conducted with zero harm to the marine environment. The code details the requirements for accomplishing safe bunkering/STS transfer operations to support commercial marine activity. The codes are underpinned by the principles of consistency, fairness, objectivity and timeliness in each application for bunkering/ STS transfer approval. Samsa will ensure all applications for bunkering licences are dealt with in a transparent manner, within three months from the date that a full and complete submission is made, and that the applicant is advised of the outcome of the application within the stated period. The roleplayers will co-operate to ensure bunkering/ STS transfer operations are conducted in an environmentally safe and efficient manner. Entities involved in bunkering operations are encouraged to advise Samsa about challenges and make suggestions to promote safe operations, considering new technologies available and their benefit. While Samsa has invited the public to comment further, it aims to release both codes as soon as possible. Marine Pollution (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment Bill A further development in the maritime sector is the Marine Pollution (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment Bill (B5-2022) (MPPPSA Bill). The MPPPSA Bill aims to: amend the Marine Pollution (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act, 1986, to give effect to Annex IV of Marpol; to incorporate the 1997 Protocol to give effect to Annex VI of Marpol; and to provide for related matters. Annexing Marpol to the bill means it will be incorporated into SA law and will have legal force. In addition, the MPPPSA Bill empowers Samsa to issue technical standards for dealing with marine pollution from ships on such matters as may be prescribed by regulation, which will have the force of law. The bill expands on the minister's powers to make regulations to include the following: "(e) To make regulations relating to the prevention of air pollution from ships; (f) relating to the prevention of pollution by sewage from ships; (g) relating to the removal of endocrine disrupting substances from sewage streams before it is treated and released; (h) relating to the permitted types of emission abatement equipment; (i) relating to the requirements for the disposal of waste generated by the mitigation equipment; (j) relating to accredited laboratories eligible to test the fuel samples and the costs; (l) relating to the enforcement of protective measures in particularly sensitive sea areas and other special areas; and (m) on generally any other ancillary or incidental administrative or procedural matters that are necessary for the proper implementation or administration of this act." OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE ESG is gaining traction in various sectors, including the maritime sector. But there is still a lot of work to do to raise standards. Engagements such as COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt (which began on November 6 and ends on November 18) are a starting point for figuring out a sustainable way forward.

In the end, it worked out well. President Cyril Ramaphosa and his team went to the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, armed with a Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (the JET-IP) he'd worked out with Britain, France, Germany, the US and EU in 2021 at the COP26 in Glasgow. They had agreed they would make an initial $8.5bn available to SA to help it lower carbon emissions. The plan was received with much celebration. "Congratulations dear @CyrilRamaphosa on your Just Energy Transition Investment Plan," tweeted the president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. "A road map to a greener, cleaner future for (SA) supported by your EU friends and other global partners. Our partnership can show the world how to achieve a just transition everywhere." The photo-opportunity was pure gold for Ramaphosa as Van der Leyen, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden's climate emissary, John Kerry, poured affection all over him. "Everyone loves Cyril," a former diplomat had reminded me the day before. Primarily, the JET-IP details SA's plans to reach carbon net zero by 2050 and how the funding will be used, mainly by Eskom but also to spark efforts to create a green hydrogen industry and invest in producing electric vehicles. The $8.5bn is a lot but not nearly enough. Ramaphosa briefly stumbled by announcing that SA needed $90-trillion to complete the transition away from coal, a slip that reminded some of another leader who had trouble with numbers. Even so. The real number is about $90bn (depending on the exchange rate). Ramaphosa likes to use the rand equivalent of R1.5-trillion. In his mind it is $100bn. Sounds low to me. The events in Sharm el-Sheikh demonstrate three things. But their relief that a major developing world polluter like SA could produce a plan of any kind was palpable, a victory for them all. Second, the notion in SA that we are somehow being "captured" by these big Western powers to do their bidding is widespread and insane. We are, in every way possible, light years behind all of them in the introduction of green energy. In the UK, renewable power regularly contributes more than half of the energy that economy consumes. In SA, renewables contribute less than 10% a day. Yes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has created a crisis in Europe as gas prices soar, but it's a gas price crisis, not a renewables crisis. Russia's actions will simply speed up the adoption of green technologies and we risk falling further behind. The third lesson concerns an idiosyncrasy we may not fully appreciate about Ramaphosa. Think about it: R1.5-trillion is roughly the same number Ramaphosa used as his "investment target" when he said back in 2018 he would raise $100bn (it became a R1.2-trillion target) in new investment and sent envoys into the world to get it. The fact that he is almost there a year early is less a sign of success than it is of it being an easy target. We can see with our own eyes how little difference the R240bn a year has made. You would have had to double the target to make a difference. Investment as a percentage of GDP in Botswana is about 26%, Australia 24% and France and Germany 24% and 23%, respectively. In SA, investment as a percentage of GDP runs at about 14%, below even Cameroon, Brazil or Argentina. Basically, if you're trying to attract enough investment to grow your developing economy you have to be targeting north of 25% of your GDP, and Ramaphosa didn't even try. So, if the JET is also going to cost $100bn Ramaphosa should get there easily. He reckons local businesses will themselves spend R500bn on renewable energy for their own use, and the rest will come from either foreign investors (as is the case currently with renewable bidding windows) or as soft loans from development finance institutions like the World Bank or Development Bank of Southern Africa. But the big question is whether he can spend the money constructively given the near total collapse of the institutions around him and the poor support he gets from his close circle. Already the 2,500MW renewables Bid Window 5 is failing, with only two or three of 25 approved projects finding finance. The delay in launching a first bid window for a mere 513MW of battery storage is approaching two months. You'd expect more urgency in a crisis. Success on the international stage will help Ramaphosa in his party - the just transition plays well with union allies - but our reality remains awful and it'll soon reclaim him.

Eskom, which has focused almost exclusively on distributing coal-generated electricity, is looking to become an unlikely pioneer of agri-voltaic technology as it repurposes its decommissioned Komati power station. South Africa, one of the world\' s largest greenhouse gas emitters, secured funding to the tune of $497 million (about R9 billion) from the World Bank to finance the Komati power station\' s transition to renewable energy. Of this amount, $47.5m is from the Canadian Clean Energy and Forest Climate Facility. This project aims to reduce greenhouse gases and create economic opportunities. In its ambitious plan, Eskom said it wanted to grow crops under solar panels. The shade protects crops, meaning less water is needed, and boosts yields while producing energy.  In its simplest form, the plan is to build a renewable energy power plant at the site to facilitate the switch from coal-generated power to energy generated from renewables, said energy expert Professor Mark Swilling. Swilling expected the project to take at least two years to complete.  A lot of work to clear the way has already been done, he said, adding that now that the finance had been secured, it should get off the ground. The Komati project was in line with South Africa\' s efforts to achieve energy security, and the project could contribute to reducing load shedding. The repurposed Komati station is expected to generate about 500MW of energy and was part of plans to generate about 1 800MW of renewable energy from Eskom\' s old coal power stations. Eskom CEO Andr\'e9 de Ruyter told the Africa Energy conference in March that, to ensure security of supply, the country needed 30GW of new generation capacity, 70% of which would be renewables, by 2030.  Significant transmission infrastructure upgrades are required in the short and medium term at a cost of R180bn between now and 2031. De Ruyter said  innovative projects were on the cards, including rolling out mini-grids. One of the projects involved repurposing shipping containers with an inverter and battery as off-grid renewable power plants in line with the Just Energy Transition plan. Regarding the World Bank loan, an economist from the North-West University Business School, Professor Raymond Parsons, said the cash injection should be welcomed. The loan comes amid concerns by African countries that rich nations were not honouring commitments they made at COP26 in 2021 to help emerging economies reduce dependency on fossil fuels. South Africa is expected to share its Just Energy Transition Investment Plan at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, which starts today. Economist Ulrich Joubert told Weekend Argus:  At the end of the day, we do need to pay a lot of money back, but the loan is guaranteed by Treasury \- it\' s important to take that into account. We need to do away with coal, he said. Swilling said:  The World Bank loan will be paid back through the energy generated. It\' s a straightforward deal. The full plan for the Komati power station includes building a micro-grids manufacturing facility, implementing agri-voltaics, providing renewables skills training for employees and local residents, and redirecting the water the coal plant used to the community. Eskom on Friday said the loan would be guaranteed by the National Treasury.  This is a significant development for South Africa\' s Just Energy Transition to renewable energy, as it brings the much-needed funding to enable Eskom to train its employees and members of the host communities to empower them to continue playing a central role in the provision of clean energy for the country, said Mpho Makwana, newly appointed chairperson of the Eskom board. Former Eskom boss Matshela Koko believed the utility could not afford the loan, even though the government had promised to take up to two-thirds of Eskom\' s R400bn debt on to its books.  Komati initiatives are not necessarily generating cash, Koko told Weekend Argus.  The revenue generated out of Komati initiatives will not be able to pay for this loan. I have a serious problem with that. Keep in mind that Eskom\' s sales volumes are declining by 3% to 5% per annum.  While the National Energy Act was enacted by Parliament in 2008, section 6 (which addresses decarbonisation) had not yet been brought into operation, and to date, we have no final integrated energy plan. African Development Bank Group\' s acting chief economist and vice-president Kevin Urama called for more robust development and research on the impact of climate change in Africa. Urama said Africa was home to most of the world\' s green development minerals, including lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, rare earth, copper, and aluminium. These had the potential to position the continent as the leader in the emerging climate-resilient development markets.  Continued investment in high-carbon energy sources presents significant asset-stranding risks, as technologies, policies and markets are increasingly shifting towards the green transition, he said. \</doc>

GLOBAL WARMING Gaslighting Big Oil rides roughshod over climate warnings The 2022 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report makes it clear that the risks to human livelihood from global warming and extreme weather events due to climate change are more serious than before. Yet the state of emergency on the climate seems to have recently taken a back seat in terms of global leaders' policy priorities, and even more shocking in this context is that fossil fuel companies, particularly oil majors, have filed record profits over the past financial year. Despite the sector's volatility, oil and gas are highly profitable, particularly at moments of geopolitical uncertainty coupled with high prices, as is the case now. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron have made about $2-trillion in the past three decades. But the Russian invasion of Ukraine has made the sector even more ridiculously profitable, with the 28 largest oil and gas companies recording profits of more than $100bn in the first quarter of 2022 alone. Shell recorded $9.1bn, while BP made its highest-yet first-quarter profit of $6.2bn. It is not surprising that there is mounting evidence that Big Oil has little intention of transitioning to net-zero or investing in renewables delivery with numbers like these. The invasion of Ukraine has led to energy uncertainty, with much of Europe dependent on Russian gas supplies. And the reputational toxicity in the EU and UK for Russian oil has seen the price of oil skyrocket in recent weeks. Instead of capitalising on a golden opportunity to develop the renewables sector and wean themselves off the volatile geopolitical booby trap of Big Oil, global leaders are instead doubling down on assuring oil and gas supplies as fossil fuel lobbyists smell blood, sensing the climate policy vulnerabilities. UK prime minister Boris Johnson sucked up to the Saudis shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, when he could have done what he should have been doing since he was elected: invest in accelerating the UK's promising renewables sector. The UK wouldn't have to bargain with less-than-salubrious regimes if it had put its money where its mouth was on net-zero targets and commitments made at COP26. It's just a matter of time before the Saudi kingdom becomes another political dirty bomb. If the outcry over alleged human rights abuses there reaches critical mass, then what? Then I suppose African governments will step in as they are already positioning themselves to do: showcasing their oil and gas bounty to the world's extractive and exploration majors. We have already seen the beginnings of an extraordinary backlash against the global consensus of climate change mitigation on the continent. With a rare opportunity to capitalise on and develop their lucrative oil and gas deposits over what is sure to be a protracted conflict, many African countries have been asking why they should be made to stick to climate targets when they emit the least emissions and their countries need economic development. European countries and their extractive and exploration companies are already pivoting their long-term energy strategies towards the African continent that will undermine the real progress that has been made on the continent towards large-scale renewables development and implementation. This will also all prove interesting geopolitically given the African countries' recent voting patterns on Russia at the UN Security Council. In the run-up to COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh later this year, these issues are likely to come to a head. While global leaders allow them to be gaslit by Big Oil, the world is simultaneously burning and drowning in extreme weather events. \</doc>

ON THE MONEYBegging for more to fund just energy transition is no option ON THE MONEY Climate finance and SA's ability to finance the costs involved appear to have become increasingly contorted as evidenced by events at COP27 last week. The argument goes that as SA is already overindebted, there is no room for more debt to fund the just economic transition. But that only serves to confuse and conflate a range of issues. There has been a build-up of government debt to a level that is seen as bordering on problematic. Debt service costs as a share of GDP will rise from 3.6% three years ago to a forecast 4.7% in the next fiscal year. That has started crowding out other forms of spending. Through the pandemic, there has been concern that banks and investors would rather buy government bonds than lend more money into the economy. The concern was that lending rates would have to be so much higher to compensate for rather buying high-yielding government bonds. This is the crowding-out effect. The binds on the fiscus are related to its ability repay the debt, given constraints that ultimately come from its ability to issue new debt at low interest rates and on its ability to raise much more tax. Pushing too far on either debt issuance or tax has adverse consequences in the economy, including higher interest rates (compounding the crowding-out problems) or slower growth and lower tax take. This paradigm for the fiscus is not true generally in the economy. While government bonds aren't tied to underlying productive revenue streams, for the just energy transition they often are. Debt to build photovoltaics (PVs), wind or battery storage is tied to tariff income (tariffs that are now lower than what it costs Eskom to produce electricity). Debt to build a hydrogen plant will be linked to export volumes or revenue from domestic use. The same is true of electric vehicles exported or sold domestically. Debt to build a local manufacturing facility for PVs, or for an SMME to have working capital to do rooftop installations again has productive revenue sources. Debt in these cases is used to smooth future income. DEBT SWAP This should be as true for a profitable, sustainable Eskom as it is for any private entity. The issue has been huge corruption and cost overruns that are divorced from this logic. Someone ultimately has to pay to clean up the mess, and that's why the inevitable swapping of Eskom debt for sovereign debt will finally occur next year. Deleveraging Eskom's balance sheet is the only plan that has ever been on the table, despite the many fanciful distractions in the media of debt for equity swaps and so on. The point of the debt swap is to take about R200bn of Eskom's debt - and service costs of about 9.6% - on to the sovereign balance sheet and allow the government to refinance it at a lower rate of about 7%. Ultimately, this is a saving to the taxpayer and a reduction in the risk of large, disorderly - and more expensive - bailouts. Eskom, meanwhile, then has space to take on new, much cheaper climate loans and so its annual debt service bill can fall, perhaps by a third. This certainly doesn't solve all Eskom's problems, but it does allow space for new funding. Cue the problem of counterfactuals. The "debt is bad" view says that Eskom shouldn't be relevering, or shouldn't be relieved of the debt in the first place because you are just replacing it with other debt. But where else is the money to fund huge transmission build expected to come from? Bizarre, deep-seated views emanating from the Left permeate SA's political economy on the evils of financialisaton. The financial community may have many problems - greenwashing tendencies, the obsession with ticking ESG boxes and so on - but ultimately there isn't a viable alternative. How else are you going to find R1.5-trillion over five years to fund the just energy transition? The antifinancial alternatives simply don't add up. The default, easy, option has been to plead the charity case and ask for more grants, but there is little sympathy for SA as a middle-income country that for too long didn't fix Eskom or the broader electricity supply industry. Frankly, it is demeaning; there are far more deserving cases of charity among lower-income countries with underdeveloped financial systems. SA has a deep savings pool and a huge appetite for funding projects that are properly formed with good look through to underlying revenue sources. SA also has a complex insurance sector and deep capital markets that can deal with adaptation finance, as well as loss and damage funding domestically. CORE PROBLEM Everyone has a role. Offshore official-sector support can be efficient in derisking and lowering the cost of borrowing domestically. For its part, the government needs to concentrate on flattening the sovereign yield curve to lower the cost of funding for everyone associated with the just energy transition - a policy with economic benefits that always seems to be overlooked. A core problem around the hype of the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan is linking the funding requirements to a viable investment case to unlock domestic funding rather than just looking offshore. The hard work on that starts now. It will require a different approach to the cap-in-hand offshore view, given the scale of need domestically and the competition from more deserving peers.

DECARBONISATIONThis is why climate sceptics should support a just energy transition The gains for the people of SA, especially the poor, will outweigh the costs to a great extent Jacques Morissetand Mariano SaltoAt COP27 in Egypt earlier in November, SA positioned itself as the "champion of the South" in the global effort to curb carbon emissions. The country not only announced the decommissioning of its first coal-fired plant (the so-called Komati project), but President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled an ambitious investment plan for a just energy transition. The cost of the plan, estimated at about $97bn over the next five years, raised some eyebrows in national and international communities. Though this cost is substantial, we argue that the just energy transition should be implemented urgently, for the following reasons: it would bring considerable benefits to the country's economy and its people, and the required financing would become available with the right set of domestic policies and external assistance. Despite scepticism about the climate benefits of reducing carbon emissions, a just energy transition would be economically justified for SA. In fact, by 2030 it is likely to yield economic gains at least double the costs projected above. Most of these gains would come as the country shifts away from coal towards low-carbon energy sources (mainly renewables), already the least-cost option for SA due to its ageing and unreliable coal power plants. In addition, by investing in renewables (and transmission), the country can quickly increase electricity supply, which will help eliminate the extensive load-shedding that is projected to cost at least $24bn in 2022. The country could therefore save about $192bn by 2030 ($24bn per year for eight years) by eliminating load-shedding. A just energy transition would also improve the country's competitiveness on global markets by reducing the carbon intensity of its exports. Should the EU introduce a carbon tax at the border, about a third of SA's exports would be at risk - a potential loss of $8bn per year, or $64bn by 2030. A third benefit would be lower air and water pollution, which would reduce the risks of early deaths and improve workers' health and productivity. The combination of these three benefits would accelerate SA's economic growth and help create jobs in several green and low-carbon sectors such as renewables and batteries. We estimated in the "Country Climate & Development Report" recently published by the World Bank that the just energy transition could create as many as 1-million jobs from 2023 to 2050, which will be several times higher than the nearly 300,000 jobs projected to be destroyed. SA will need to implement adequate safety nets and active labour programmes to mitigate negative effects on dismissed workers and local communities. The just energy transition should also be supported as its costs are not insurmountable: SA can find the resources to finance it. The costs of the transition fall into the following main categories: New investment in power generation, primarily in renewable energy - about $66bn until 2030: given the age and condition of the existing coal-fired power plants, renewables are the least-cost option to expand the generation sector. New investment in power transmission and distribution - about $11bn until 2030. New measures and investment to cope with the economic and social damage to workers, local communities and municipal governments associated with the decommissioning of coal-fired plants (including mines) - about $20bn until 2030. SA can arguably attract private domestic and foreign resources to finance new investment in power generation. Developers have been keen to invest in renewables, as demonstrated by the success of the different renewable energy programmes: as much as 6,000MW in renewables were added to the grid between 2012 and 2022. More could come if the country were to unleash the potential of the private sector by streamlining administrative and regulatory procedures and opening the market to greater competition. By taking this approach, Vietnam attracted more private investment in solar energy than the entire Sub-Saharan Africa in 2020. This would leave the country to find about $31bn ($3.9bn per year). The government spent about $3bn in 2021/2022 to support the financially distressed national electricity company Eskom. This assistance could be cut by half should the government successfully implement a plan to return Eskom to its path of historical excellence, saving as much as $12bn in taxpayers' money in 2023-2030. FINANCING GAP Another source of financing could be advancing and broadening the carbon tax, which the National Treasury has scheduled for 2026. Eliminating the current exemptions and gradually increasing the tax rate could yield about $8bn in additional revenue by 2030. The financing gap would therefore be about $11bn in 2023-2030, which could be raised from external sources. The international community is ready to provide concessional finance to support SA's decarbonising effort, as it is partly a global public good. Five donors (the EU, US, Germany, France and the UK) have committed to allocating $8.5bn for this purpose over the next five years, while international finance institutions (particularly the World Bank and African Development Bank) stand ready to assist SA through, for example, budget support and blended financial instruments to reduce the risks for private investors. Against this backdrop, we hope even climate sceptics would support the implementation of the just energy transition. This would clearly help lower global carbon emissions, but the primary benefit of a rapid energy transition is to the country itself. The gains for SA's economy and its people would significantly exceed the cost of the transition, and the required financing can be leveraged from available domestic and external resources.

Minister sets date for Eskom debt details Enoch Godongwana to outline size and conditions of relief package in medium-term budget Eskom debt relief: minister sets date Editor at LargeFinance minister Enoch Godongwana will provide details on the size, timing and conditions of the Eskom debt relief package when he tables his medium-term budget policy statement on October 26, he said on Friday. "We will be saying what is the quantum over what period, and what are the conditions to be attached, because if Eskom does not make efficiency improvements we are likely to come back ... moving forward, Eskom must be able to invest in productive infrastructure," he said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank. As the strike at ailing Transnet continues to cripple exports and the economy, Godongwana also said he will say something about Transnet in the budget statement. "It presented a facade of an efficient institution, but now things begin to burst out into the open ... If we don't make an intervention we are going to have another Eskom on our hands," he said, adding any intervention is likely to include financial and operational aspects. Markets are eagerly awaiting the details of an Eskom debt solution after President Cyril Ramaphosa promised this in July when he announced his energy emergency plan and said the debt would be addressed in the medium-term budget. Eskom's operations do not generate enough cash to meet the interest and capital payments on its almost R400bn of debt, much of which is guaranteed by the government. It depends on large annual cash infusions from the government to remain a going concern. The government undertook more than four years ago to find a debt solution that would make Eskom financially sustainable, but the issue was put back on the table only when Ramaphosa announced his energy emergency plan in July. Godongwana and Treasury officials said in July that the government would take over a portion of the Eskom debt and promised "broad brush" details at budget time. Any transfer of debt will require agreement from the investors or lenders holding each debt instrument, and it is expected the package will be finalised next year only after talks with them. While many in the market are expecting the debt relief package to focus on the guaranteed portion of the Eskom debt, Godongwana said it has not yet been decided whether it will target just the guaranteed debt or also unguaranteed debt. Eskom is understood to be keen to look at some of the more expensive unguaranteed debt as well. RMB Morgan Stanley economist Andrea Masia calculates that if the government were to take over R250bn of Eskom's guaranteed debt in 2023/2024 this would lift the government's debt ratio to 72%, from the 68.5% it would otherwise have been. In a recent report he argued that this is an "opportune time to address the Eskom overhang", with the fiscal deficit likely to come in far lower than February's budget estimate thanks to the revenue windfall and well-contained spending growth, and the government's debt ratio starting to stabilise as early as this year. Addressing the uncertainty about the Eskom overhang could significantly cut the cost at which the government borrows on the market, Masia argued. Deutsche Bank strategist Anthony Wong and economist Danelee Masia said an Eskom debt transfer of R100bn might be relatively easy for the government to absorb, but going beyond this might raise questions about debt sustainability, particularly in a low-growth environment. However, the impact on SA's overall creditworthiness would be positive irrespective of the amount transferred if a debt transfer is combined with successful restructuring of Eskom that leaves it financially independent, they said in a report. SA has since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic borrowed more than $8bn from multilateral institutions including the IMF and World Bank, and Godongwana said that while the government had originally been cautious on this, the two institutions are now quite different from what they were in the 1980s. He welcomed the fact that the Group of Seven is adopting the attitude that developing nations have had for a while and arguing for reforms to the shape and focus of the two institutions. And he said he was struck by the warmth and respect they had for SA and their willingness to support the country financially and technically. Godongwana said he spent a lot of his time in Washington in talks on climate financing for SA, including on the $8.5bn just energy transition investment plan due to be announced at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt next month. The IMF now expects SA's economy to grow 2.1% in 2022, with a strong recovery in the services sector, particularly tourism, helping to offset the effect of load-shedding and floods. But it expects growth to fall to 1.1% in 2023, with external conditions deteriorating and commodity prices correcting. joffeh@businesslive.co.za \</doc>

SOUTH African SMEs were responsible for 14% of scope 1 non-household emissions, thereby amplifying the call to all local small business to reduce their carbon footprint in the effort to minimise the country\' s climate impact, according to recent research by accounting, financial, HR and payroll technology for provider Sage. The SME Climate Impact Report commissioned by Sage and launched in partnership with Oxford Economics and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and being revealed at COP27 , was described as a call to action for government and policymakers to help South African SMEs become more sustainable, given the influential role they played in the economy. Pieter Bensch, MD and executive vice-president, Sage Africa and Middle East, said the study confirmed the crucial role that South African SMEs play in the country\' s economy.  SMEs make up a large share of the economy of South Africa, contributing two-fifths of GDP. Collectively they have a significant climate impact, despite being clustered in less-emitting industries. However, their direct climate impact is relatively small in comparison with large companies due to their low presence in high-emission sectors like mining and utilities, Bensch said. Sage said South African SMEs directly contribute R2.1 trillion, or 40%, to the national GDP, and directly account for 6.2 million direct jobs or 46% of direct employment. The economic footprint generated through their indirect supply chain and induced consumer spending contributions amounts to R4 trillion in GDP value; their total employment footprint in South Africa is over 10.2 million people. This meant South African SMEs\' total economic footprint totalled just over three-quarters of gross-value added and employment.  Nonetheless, the sheer number of SMEs and their role in supply chains mean they have an instrumental role to play in reaching the government\' s target of net zero by 2050. In the midst of the energy crisis and a just transition from fossil fuels to renewables SMEs are working hard to become more energy efficient and tap into cleaner, alternative power sources. But the fact remains our reliance on coal-fired power is a barrier to SME sustainability. The SME Climate Impact study models the climate impact of SMEs using the Oxford Economics Global Sustainability Model as well as survey data of more than 2 000 SA and 2 000 UK SMEs. The report showed that South African SMEs\' Scope 1 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \- those created from sources they own or control \- totalled an estimated 61 million tons of CO2 last year. This accounted for 13% of South Africa's total GHG emissions of 479 million tons of CO2. SMEs\' footprint totalled 29% of non-household emissions in the country when GHGs generated in their supply chains were considered. The numbers exclude much of the agriculture sector, where there were many informal and unregistered businesses that were difficult to track. These SMEs were responsible for a substantial share of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, from raising livestock and the use of fertilisers. Fortunately, the report showed that local SMEs and those in the UK were eager to play their part in addressing climate impact. Over half (53%) stated that sustainability was either a priority or central to their operations. A third of SMEs in SA and the UK were already using technology to measure their environmental footprint. SMEs identified a range of key ways that technology could support their sustainability efforts, with technology to track energy consumption (38%) and directly reduce carbon emissions (35%) as the most important. Reducing waste (46%) and energy use (42%) were among the most common steps SMEs are taking to reduce their environmental footprint. However, prior Sage research has found that 90% of SMEs said they faced significant barriers to taking climate action. The survey showed that these include cash flow constraints, difficulty navigating government policies, measuring impact, and influencing their suppliers to become more sustainable. Bensch said SA SMEs were eager to be partners in addressing climate impact.  They understand that sustainable practices can help them weather the inflationary pressures they are experiencing. But SMEs cannot be expected to behave the same as large companies in reducing emissions and using resources more sustainably. Big business, government, lawmakers, and other stakeholders should provide support specific to SMEs to help them reach their potential. In light of these findings, Sage and ICC are calling for governments to create a comprehensive plan that empowers SMEs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support the country\' s overall plan towards net-zero. Andrew Wilson, global policy director, International Chamber of Commerce said they believed climate action was everyone\' s business and they must act in concert to ensure that micro, small and medium-sized businesses were both sufficiently heard and fully equipped to take ambitious climate and environmental action.

Garth Theunissen Forestry, fisheries and environmental affairs minister Barbara Creecy says SA will need to turn sunshine into oil if it wants to decarbonise its economy. Moreover, she says that may be critical to the country's ability to retain access to lucrative export markets like the EU, which are increasingly looking at restricting imports from carbon-intensive economies. "SA is one of the top 10 sunniest countries in the world, so it's a no-brainer that we should be expanding our solar infrastructure. "We also have significant wind," Creecy said at the 2022 Standard Bank Climate Summit in Johannesburg yesterday. "We also have a very interesting advantage ... in terms of green hydrogen. "Through Sasol, we have this Fischer-Tropsch technology, which enables us to convert carbon into a liquid fuel. The North African countries have a locational advantage due to their proximity to Europe, which allows them to run pipe-ines directly into the continent. "The current energy crisis in Europe is leading them to say they are going to skip the gas phase and go straight to green hydrogen," Creecy said. She also revealed that SA planned to unveil details next month on the country's investment plan to access the $8.5bn (R154bn) financing pledge by the UK, US, Germany, France and the EU that will be used to facilitate the country's energy transition. Creecy said the investment plan, which would be revealed at the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) in Egypt in November, would focus on Eskom's energy transition, the feasibility of evolving of the country's car-manufacturing industry to electric-vehicle (EV) production and SA's own green hydrogen technology. The government had also been working on providing more detail on the form loans would take as well as the concessions that would have to be made without worsening the SA's fiscal debt load. She said the bulk of the investment plan required to gain access to the $8.5bn financing pledge from developed nations would focus on repurposing as many as 10 Eskom plants that were facing retirement. The plan would involve replacing them with solar, wind and gas-fired alternatives while the feasibility of replacing combustion-fired engines for cars manufactured in SA with alternative electric systems would also be high on the agenda. Eskom chief executive Andre de Ruyter, who also spoke at the 2022 Standard Bank Climate Summit, said while the energy transition was inevitable, SA's power challenges should not be viewed in binary terms of coal vs renewables. While coal would be used for a long time to produce baseload power in SA, the long-term solution to energy security was renewable power as it could be rapidly and more cheaply deployed than coal or gas-fired options. "So, the notion that we will somehow succumb to pressure from the Global North to sterilise all of our natural resources to satisfy pressure from international lenders is simply not substantiated by the facts. "[But] if we act smartly, we can leverage concessional financing that is available ... and enable ourselves to pivot to a cleaner, greener future at the same time as growing our economy and creating jobs," he said. - BusinessLIVE WAY FORWARD: Forestry, fisheries and environmental affairs minister Barbara Creecy FREDDY MAVUNDA \</doc>

THICK END OF THE WEDGE Everyone loves Cyril, but can he make a just transition? In the end, it worked out well. President Cyril Ramaphosa and his team went to the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, armed with a Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (the JET-IP) he'd worked out with Britain, France, Germany, the US and EU in 2021 at the COP26 in Glasgow. They had agreed they would make an initial $8.5bn available to SA to help it lower carbon emissions. The plan was received with much celebration. "Congratulations dear @CyrilRamaphosa on your Just Energy Transition Investment Plan," tweeted the president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. "A road map to a greener, cleaner future for (SA) supported by your EU friends and other global partners. Our partnership can show the world how to achieve a just transition everywhere." The photo opportunity was pure gold for Ramaphosa as Van der Leyen, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and US President Joe Biden's climate emissary, John Kerry, poured affection all over him. "Everyone loves Cyril," a former diplomat had reminded me the day before. Primarily, the JET-IP details SA's plans to reach carbon net zero by 2050 and how the funding will be used, mainly by Eskom but also to spark efforts to create a green hydrogen industry and invest in producing electric vehicles. The $8.5bn is a lot but not nearly enough. Ramaphosa briefly stumbled by announcing that SA needed $90-trillion to complete the transition away from coal, a slip that reminded some of another leader who had trouble with numbers. Even so. The real number is about $90bn (depending on the exchange rate). Ramaphosa likes to use the rand equivalent of R1.5-trillion. In his mind it is $100bn. Sounds low to me. The events in Sharm el-Sheikh demonstrate three things. First, the Western leaders who lauded Ramaphosa's plan needed to give the money away, or lend it, almost as badly as Ramaphosa needs to spend it. None of the people on the photograph will have read the JET-IP. That's for officials. But their relief that a major developing world polluter like SA could produce a plan of any kind was palpable, a victory for them all. Second, the notion in SA that we are somehow being "captured" by these big Western powers to do their bidding is widespread and insane. We are, in every way possible, light years behind all of them in the introduction of green energy. In the UK, renewable power regularly contributes more than half of the energy that economy consumes. In SA, renewables contribute less than 10% a day. Yes, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has created a crisis in Europe as gas prices soar, but it's a gas price crisis, not a renewables crisis. Russia's actions will simply speed up the adoption of green technologies and we risk falling further behind. The third lesson concerns an idiosyncrasy we may not fully appreciate about Ramaphosa. He's cautious and doesn't deliberately set himself up for failure. Think about it: R1.5-trillion is roughly the same number he used as his "investment target" when he said back in 2018 he would raise $100bn (it became a R1.2-trillion target) in new investment and sent envoys into the world to get it. The fact that he is almost there a year early is less a sign of success than it is of it being an easy target. We can see with our own eyes how little difference the R240bn a year has made. For the most part, this has been simply companies investing what they need to in order to continue functioning. You would have had to double the target to make a difference. Investment as a percentage of GDP in Botswana is about 26%, Australia 24% and France and Germany 24% and 23%, respectively. In SA, investment as a percentage of GDP runs at about 14%, below even Cameroon, Brazil or Argentina. Basically, if you're trying to attract enough investment to grow your developing economy you have to be targeting north of 25% of your GDP, and Ramaphosa didn't even try. So, if the just energy transition is also going to cost $100bn, Ramaphosa should get there easily. He reckons local businesses will themselves spend R500bn on renewable energy for their own use, and the rest will come from either foreign investors (as is the case currently with renewable bidding windows) or as soft loans from development finance institutions like the World Bank or Development Bank of Southern Africa. But the big question is whether he can spend the money constructively given the near total collapse of the institutions around him and the poor support he gets from his close circle. Already, the 2,500MW renewables bid window 5 is failing, with only two or three of 25 approved projects finding finance. The delay in launching a first bid window for a mere 513MW of battery storage is approaching two months. You'd expect more urgency in a crisis. Success on the international stage will help Ramaphosa in his party - the just transition plays well with union allies - but our reality remains awful and it'll soon reclaim him.

JUST ENERGY TRANSITION The demoralising scale of SA's nasty coal habit EDITOR'S NOTE The lowlight of our annual drive from Gauteng to the Lowveld is the view from the N4. The carnage wrought on our economy by Eskom's ageing coal fleet is reflected perfectly in the hellscape as we travel through Emalahleni, Middelburg and Makhazeni. As coal mines give way to giant coal-fired power stations and the roads disintegrate, it's impossible to miss the ghastly social and environmental manifestation of decline and disarray. The landscape is brutalised, and the horizon littered with smokestacks. This week at COP27 On Friday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa released the Just Energy Transition Partnership Investment Plan (JETP-IP), a document explaining how SA will spend $8.5bn of loans, grants and guarantees to kick-start its transition away from fossil fuel-powered energy. Many people hope it will stand as an exemplary solution for countries that need access to cheap energy to boost their development as much as they need to decarbonise. As with anything involving SA, they may find it is more complicated than they expected. The JETP-IP deal, a mixture of concessionary finance and loan guarantees, was thought up by the British government at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, and we're the lab rats for what some hope will be rolled out elsewhere. To be clear, much of the "justice" work in the JETP-IP deal describes work that the government ought to have done decades ago. Included in the document are "repurposing of coal-mining land" (surely a condition in a mining licence that ought to be enforced by the state?), the "diversification of local economies", "care for coal workers", "policies for post-mining redevelopment" and "investment in youth". These appear to describe the basic functioning of a state, and should have no place in an energy transition finance deal. The fact is that the energy transition is partly responsible for the circumstances experienced by communities attached to Eskom's coal fleet and associated mines. Those power stations were built during apartheid by a racist mineral-industrial complex to provide cheap electricity to a minority of the population and to power its development and industrialisation. No real plans were made for affected communities during or at the end of the plants' lifespans because they were black communities, and they were dispensable. Injustice is hard-baked into SA's energy system and that is not the fault of the technology. It is impossible to really understand the mess we're in until we accept this. The Nats may have built it, but the ANC has been sailing it for 30 years. In pushing for a "just" transition, overseas funders are financing the fig leaf that saves government's dignity. It is our government that has not done enough to address the apartheid design of these places, and it is our government that has trashed municipal services in the towns that have always had big employers: power plants and mines. Asking Eskom, of all entities, to worry about social justice is just absurd. It was designed to deliver electricity, historically at the expense of justice. Aside from all of its operational and financial woes, it is little surprise that the government struggles to raise grants for "just" energy projects. It is like asking a carpenter to make a souffl\'e9. It may be able to persuade the big philanthropies and the World Bank and the Climate Investment Fund, but on what planet would foreign politicians who want to be re-elected hand over billions of dollars of cash to deliver "justice" to the one entity that has proven from 1948 to 2022 that it is incapable of doing its job? Let us be honest about what this is about. Climate finance should not to be used to fund a deficit of government work. Anyone grumbling about a paucity of grants (cash handovers), the fraught nature of the negotiations, the complexity and conditionality of the loans and the guarantees, and the US's insistence of investing through the private sector, needs to take a look about. Our government is openly at war with itself over the future of energy in SA. Some dinosaurs want to keep the big old nationalist filth machine running, and the last time the World Bank thought it would lend us money to build an energy project they were probably surprised to discover they'd bought some gold taps in Dubai. The trust gap is reflected in the nature of the finance, and if SA wants a better deal next time - and there will be a next time - the government will need to mind the gap.

Slipping gas and nuclear into the Eskom mix could threaten the $8.5bn IPG loan PETER BRUCEFinance minister Enoch Godongwana told a reporter this week: "We prefer to freeze in the dark than burn coal." This was his way of siding with mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe in his pursuit of more fossil-fuel energy as part of the solution to our electricity shortage. Anyone who read the ANC's economic policy documents while Godongwana ran the party's economics unit will understand he is never short of poor ideas, but even by his standards his remarks to and on the sidelines of a SA Chamber of Commerce & Industry (Sacci) conference were especially destructive. SA needed, he said, more reliable sources of electricity like gas and nuclear. They were in the 2019 Integrated Resource Plan anyway. He warned that while government has agreed to take on some of Eskom's R400bn debt, it would have to meet certain preconditions. "When I'm saying I'm going to take the debt, I'm going to have conditions precedent, which will make sure that Eskom makes certain undertakings before I take the debt," News24 quoted him saying. One condition would be that Eskom would have to bring these "old and reliable" technologies into its energy mix. So our finance minister will relieve Eskom of half its debt, but require it to build an entirely new gas infrastructure and at least one large nuclear power plan for which we can presume Eskom will incur more debt for technologies almost as old as the rinderpest. Smart fellow this. Will Godongwana be joining President Cyril Ramaphosa, Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter and Ramaphosa's hand-picked climate finance chief, former SARB deputy governor Daniel Mminele, at the big gathering of world leaders next week at Sharm el-Sheik in Egypt? Welcome to COP27 Ramaphosa arrives with a 163-page document titled "SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET IP) for the initial period 2023-2027". The declaration at Glasgow resolved to establish a partnership comprising SA and global partners, to enable the accelerated decarbonisation of SA's electricity system; SA's efforts to lead a just transition that protects vulnerable workers and communities affected by the move away from coal; SA's efforts to sustainably manage Eskom's debt, define the role of the private sector, and create an enabling environment in the electricity sector. Nowhere does it mention "old and reliable" technologies like nuclear and gas. If the lenders in the IPG were to have heard the finance minister speak at the Sacci meeting would they still give him the money? And what will they make of dti minister Ebrahim Patel's sudden passion for electric vehicles (EVs)? He has managed to elbow his way into the $8.5bn with a raft of EV proposals he wasn't even remotely considering in his automotive master plan in 2019. Will the IPG lend Patel the money? He has special powers to make money disappear. "The rate at which alternative engine technologies displace the [internal combustion engine], and what specific material composites come to dominate 'body in white' and structural components over the period is unclear," he declared in his master plan. What is not at all unclear is that he has been caught napping. SA is now desperate to catch up with EVs. The IPG will be told there's a plan to build 50,000, e-bikes or e-motorbikes in the Western Cape for export. As an example of the thirst for this localised product the SA document notes that Kenya imports 291,553 bikes and cycles a year. Absolute pie in the sky. I feel sorry for citizens relying on this government to get them through our energy transition. As our JET IP notes, the transition "is highly dependent on the scale and nature of financial support it can secure from the international community to complement domestic resources". So getting this $8.5bn really, really matters, even if it is just a start. And while dodderers like Mantashe and Godongwana may be embarrassing, they are merely representative of a party with little clue what to do next. Financial help needs to be ring-fenced fiercely. It needs to avoid SA's corrupting tender procedures. If it is of any help, I'd say to the IPG that the South Africans they can trust at Sharm el-Sheik are Daniel Mminele, Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago and Andre de Ruyter. And if De Ruyter is fired as CEO I'd advise them not to lend Eskom a cent. Bruce is a former editor of Business Day and the Financial Mail.

GODONGWANA IN THE DARK The fossilised energy plan rules out a just transition Finance minister Enoch Godongwana told a reporter this week: "We prefer to freeze in the dark than burn coal." This was his way of siding with mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe in his pursuit of more fossil-fuel energy as part of the solution to our electricity shortage. Anyone who read the ANC's economic policy documents while Godongwana ran the party's economics unit will understand he is never short of poor ideas, but even by his standards his remarks to and on the sidelines of a SA Chamber of Commerce & Industry (Sacci) conference were especially destructive.

Welcome to COP27 Ramaphosa arrives with a 163-page document titled "SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET IP) for the initial period 2023-2027". It needs to present this to the UK, US, German, French and EU administrations to unlock $8.5bn of financing pledged by them, the International Partners Group (IPG), at COP26 in 2021, to help Eskom stop burning fossil fuels. The draft document I have seen may not yet have reached the finance minister. "The political declaration (at Glasgow) resolved to establish a partnership comprised of SA and international partners, to enable ... the accelerated decarbonisation of SA's electricity system; SA's efforts to lead a just transition that protects vulnerable workers and communities ... affected by the move away from coal; SA's efforts to successfully and sustainably manage Eskom's debt, define the role of the private sector, and create an enabling environment through policy reform in the electricity sector...." Nowhere does it mention "old and reliable" technologies like nuclear and gas. If the lenders in the IPG were to have heard the finance minister speak at the Sacci meeting would they still give him the money? And what will they make of trade, industry & competition minister Ebrahim Patel's sudden passion for electric vehicles (EVs). He has managed to elbow his way into the $8.5bn with a raft of EV proposals he wasn't even remotely considering when he produced an automotive industry master plan in 2019. Will the IPG lend Patel the money? He has special powers to make money disappear. "The rate at which alternative engine technologies displace the [internal combustion engine], and what specific material composites come to dominate 'body in white' and structural components over the period is unclear," he declared in his master plan. What is not at all unclear is that he has been caught napping. SA is now in a desperate race to catch up with EVs. So does the IPG pay for that? How do these plans help communities that live off coal today? EV production will probably employ fewer people than today's combustion technology. The IPG will be told there's a plan to build 50,000, e-bikes or e-motorbikes in the Western Cape for export. As an example of the thirst for this localised product the SA document notes that Kenya imports 291,553 bikes and cycles a year. Absolute pie in the sky.

SA faces R700bn funding gap for just energy transition Country at risk of being locked out of export markets Energy WriterSA will have to make quick work of plugging a R700bn gap for the implementation of its just energy transition plan that is to be implemented over the next five years. The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP), launched ahead of the UN's COP27 climate summit held in Egypt last month, sets out the country's funding needs for the next five years to primarily transition from coal-fired to renewable energy. Daniel Mminele, who heads the presidential climate finance task team, told MPs on Tuesday that of the roughly R1.5-trillion needed to implement the JET-IP, about R700bn required "to meet our climate change targets" had yet to be determined. Mminele told MPs serving on the mineral resources and energy committee that the balance, about R800bn, is already committed with a fair amount of certainty from SA's Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with the US, UK, France, Germany and the EU, from the private sector, and from public entities such as development finance institutions and multilateral development banks. The JETP will contribute $8.5bn (about R147bn), private-sector investment is expected to amount to roughly R500bn and the government has secured, or is in talks to secure about R150bn from development finance institutions, according to Mminele. He also provided more detail about the structure of the $8.5bn JETP funding package, which will contribute about 12% of the total amount needed to implement SA's JET-IP. Less than 4% will be in the form of grants, 35% will be available as commercial loans or guarantee instruments, and the remaining 45% will come as concessional loans. FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY The EU - through the European Investment Bank, France, Germany - and the US will each contribute about $1bn, and the UK will contribute $1.8bn, the largest share from any one country, mostly via commercial loans and guarantees. About $2.5bn will come partly from multilateral climate finance institution Climate Investment Funds in the form of $500m in grant and concessional loan financing that will be leveraged to obtain a further $2bn in concessional loans. This means that through the JETP, SA will be taking on debt of about $8.1bn (about R140bn) in one form or another. Several committee members expressed their concern about the affordability of loans being taken on by SA, but Mminele said that the JET-IP will stand or fall with the "availability of financial resources". Any financing instrument taken on to fund the implementation of the plan will need to consider SA's "need for fiscal sustainability", he said. "All debt-related terms should be at more attractive rates than the National Treasury could secure on capital markets on its own, and it should not lead to SA getting caught up in unduly onerous reporting requirements," he said. Mminele said that SA was one of the most highly carbon-intensive economies, which exposes the country to certain "transition risks that can affect our trade system because of the degree of carbon embedded in our products". The goal of the JET-IP is to put the country on course to achieve its revised nationally determined contribution (NDC) submitted at COP26. The revised NDC commits the country to reduce carbon emissions within a target range of 350-million tonnes to 420-million tonnes of CO2-equivalent by 2030, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. That would be a reduction of about 20%-33% from current emissions by 2030. The three priority sectors identified in the plan are electricity, electric vehicles and green hydrogen. The power sector will demand two-thirds of the R1.5-trillion JET-IP spending, with funding directed primarily towards decommissioning coal-fired plants, expanding and strengthening the transmission grid and investment in new renewable energy generation. About R128bn is budgeted for investment in decarbonising the automotive sector and supporting the switch from internal combustion engine vehicles to manufacturing electric vehicles. About R320bn will be spent on supporting the development of a green hydrogen industry in SA, including R150bn on port infrastructure for green hydrogen exports. But, ANC MP Thokozile Malinga said that the JET-IP plan, which has already been endorsed formally by the cabinet, "did not sit well" with her. As a resident of Mpumalanga, Malinga said she was concerned about the effect the energy transition would have on the province's economy and jobs. "Most coal comes from Mpumalanga. You say that mines and power stations will be decommissioned, and workers reskilled, but how do you reskill a mineworker that is not educated and that has been working as a miner for 30 or 40 years," she asked. Other MPs were also critical about the JET-IP's perceived overwhelming focus on "phasing out coal and repurposing of coal stations". Mminele and minister in the presidency Mondli Gungubele, outlined the economic risks SA would face if it failed to reduce carbon emissions in line with international commitments. Referring to SA's automotive industry, Gungubele said that the majority of the country's trading partners will by 2030 no longer be importing cars that emit greenhouse gases. "If we don't move at pace with that call, we will lose our position [as an exporter], placing no less than 100,000 jobs are at risk in the automotive sector," he said. Mminele said that the coal-dependent electricity sector was responsible for 45% of SA's greenhouse gas emissions and, as such, offered the largest mitigation potential "if we decarbonise the sector and diversify the energy mix". erasmusd@businesslive.co.za Critical: Presidential climate finance task team head Daniel Mminele says SA's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan. depends on the availability of financial resources.

President Cyril Ramaphosa will in the coming weeks undertake a number of bilateral and multilateral engagements to advance South Africa's growth and development as well as international cooperation. In a statement on Tuesday, the Presidency said that the President is currently preparing to advance partnerships for growth and development in South Africa and for global solidarity, security and inclusive prosperity. 'At the multilateral level, South Africa seeks to advance its national interest - the well-being and development of all citizens - as well as the development priorities of developing countries including the SADC region and the African continent, and to promote an equitable rules-based multilateral system,' the Presidency said. October In October, President Ramaphosa will host President Brahim Ghali of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic for deliberations in Pretoria. President Ramaphosa will also welcome Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain to Pretoria for discussions on relations between the two countries. 'Still in October, President Ramaphosa will undertake a Working Visit to the Kingdom of Saudia Arabia, in fulfilment of a planned visit the President postponed in April 2022 to focus on government's intervention in the KwaZulu-Natal flood disaster,' the Presidency said. Saudi Arabia is South Africa's second largest trading partner the Middle East and largest source of imports from the region. The exchange of political and business visits, as well as trade and investment exhibitions and seminars by both countries in the past years have had a positive effect on trade and investment trends. November In November, President Ramaphosa will participate in the global climate change conference, COP 27 , to be held at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Heads of State and Government, government delegations, non-governmental organisations, private sector delegates and other representatives will engage at the global conference on action on climate and sustainable development goals. The delegates will also engage on adaptation and resilience; climate4 finance; education and youth; gender; innovation, and land use, as part of deliberations on mitigating climate change and securing sustainability for future generations. 'President Ramaphosa will subsequently undertake a visit to the Republic of Kenya for his first engagement with recently elected President William Ruto with a view to expanding trade between the two countries and enhance people-to-people relations between two significant economies in their respective regions,' the Presidency said. Still in November, President Ramaphosa will participate in the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, where leaders of the world's major developed and emerging economies will hold discussions on global priorities advocated by Indonesia during its term as the G20 Presidency. These priorities include the global health architecture, sustainable energy transition and digital transformation. Together, the G20 members represent more than 80 percent of world GDP, 75 percent of international trade and 60 percent of the world population. UK state visit Later in November, President Ramaphosa and First Lady Dr Tshepo Motsepe will honour an invitation by His Majesty King Charles III of the United Kingdom to undertake a State Visit to the United Kingdom. The Presidency said that the State Visit follows visits at this level to the United Kingdom by Presidents Mandela, Mbeki and Zuma since the advent of democracy and follows visits by King Charles III and the Queen Consort to South Africa. South Africa and the UK are strategic partners with a broad and vibrant relationship, led by a commitment to liberal values, democracy and the rule of law. The two countries share a wide array of mutual interests and continue to deepen collaboration to resolve global challenges. December In early December, President Ramaphosa is set to host President Nicol\'e1s Maduro of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for bilateral discussions in Pretoria. Venezuela is a strategic partner of South Africa in Latin America, especially in the context of South-South cooperation as well as the potential for future economic partnership due to its abundant oil and gas reserves. The Presidency said that it will provide closer details of these engagements, including dates, closer to these events. - SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

Last month, Frans Timmermans, the European Union Commission vice-president and the person in charge of leading its work on the European Green Deal and the European Climate Law, HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen/status/1567074459470766081 delivered a revealing speech Europeans, he said, have their own problems and would not worry about the effects of climate change in Africa. European countries might keep their climate finance pledges, but there are no guarantees.\~ In his words, with inflation and other economic pressures upon Europe, the loyalty of European states lies with their people. He advised African leaders to take the path of clean renewable energy and to seek baseload only when it is green to do so. Although discordant to many in Africa, these words can also be liberating. More and more Africans are showing in small and big ways how uninterested they are in being told what to do, who to stand up for and when to stand up. This justified anti-neocolonial sentiment is also freeing Africans from perpetually waiting for the old colonial master's favour and focusing on what we - and our leaders - do for ourselves. But as far as the climate crisis goes, African leaders couldn't be more out of line. In justifying its plans to auction off the forest for oil, the Congolese government said it cares more about its people than gorillas, all the while trying to sell an area greater in size than Ghana. Some gorillas would indeed lose their habitat, but many more people would see their lands grabbed and water sources seized and polluted. In many cases, people would be displaced. This is in line with the HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/01/african-nations-set-to-make-the-case-for-big-rise-in-fossil-fuel-output intention of many African leaders to use HYPERLINK COP27 to encourage more oil and gas activities , a move that will benefit the same neocolonial forces driving the fossil fuel industry, giving big oil and a handful of local elites another boost.

Yet there is hope in organised communities who are resisting in the face of the climate crisis.

They are mobilised to demand clean air and respect for nature. They are changing the rules of the game that the old guard is pushing. They know that it is a neocolonial model of extraction and exploitation that has deepened hardship for many of them. They know that the multibillion-dollar projects are never about them. They know that the neocolonial model of extraction and exploitation is always about growing the profit margin of big multinationals and lining the pockets of elites who have remained in bed with the oppressors. Before the floods, droughts, contaminated water, or toxic air, they know they have no choice but to resist and fight the greed that puts profits before people and the planet. The resilience that African communities continue to show, in defending their lands, protecting the quality of the air they breathe and the decentralised economic gains that come with protecting the riches that nature has given them, is the hope of Africa in the face of the climate crisis.

TAKING STOCK Justifying the just transition not for power and mining sectors only ESG (environmental, social and governance) objectives, which are long-term in nature, have lately been deprioritised in favour of shorter-term objectives. This approach, albeit "kicking the can down the road", has been what is required from stakeholders in the current environment. Events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine coupled with sanctions are good examples that required immediate attention from all global leaders and decision-makers. The media has lately focused on the "E" in ESG and how corporates, governments and countries' actions affect the environment. Which brings us to the main question: how should SA respond as a developing nation given all the consequences and considerations, and what can be considered as a just transition? A "just transition", according to the international Trade Union Conference, "aims to secure the future and livelihoods of workers and their communities in the movement towards a low-carbon economy". Ideally, the approach to the transition should deal with inequality, job creation and poverty, among other social issues. To facilitate SA's just transition, an initial pledge of $8.5bn over the next three to five years was made by multiple developed countries at COP26. This pledge could result in SA moving away from its heavy reliance on coal for its energy needs and will go a long way to help the country meet its net carbon emissions target by 2050. Earlier in 2022, the government published its just transition framework. The implementation plan is expected to follow. The conversations about just transitions seem hyper-focused on the mining and power sector, but many large sectors of the economy will be affected. The transition away from harmful fossil fuels is likely to be compulsory in the future, given the possible introduction of climate change laws. This inevitable transition will affect many South Africans, especially the unskilled workforce, and the government is likely to be compelled to provide support for those communities and businesses. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, most businesses' impact are through their operating activities. The main contributor in SA is the energy sector, which accounts for almost 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. Eskom, which now supplies 95% of SA's electricity, accounts for 65% of all the coal burnt in SA, contributes 41% of SA's greenhouse gas emissions and employs 1% of SA's workforce. PILOT PROJECT In 2020 Eskom established its just energy transition office, looking at repurposing ageing coal fleets such as the pilot project at the Komati power station. The initiative aims to produce power through renewable energy, separate coal, promote green business and more. Like SA, Eskom has committed to a 2050 net-zero ambition. The transport, manufacturing and construction sectors are also large contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The transport sector contributes 13%, of which 90% is attributed to road transport. The manufacturing and construction sectors together contribute about 7%. Manufacturing industries, which include food and beverages, are greatly affected by extreme temperature fluctuations because of climate change. The petroleum and chemical industry has a large contributor in Sasol, which accounts for 24% of all the coal burnt in SA. Sasol has committed to a 2050 net- zero ambition by progressively shifting feedstock away from coal and towards green hydrogen and sustainable carbon over the long term. Other smaller players, such as Omnia, are moving towards managing a lower carbon emissions future and Reunert has a division that assists corporates in moving towards renewable strategy. At the end of June the COP26 president visited SA, meeting with the presidential climate finance task team and various ministers to accelerate the transition partnership. A six-month update showed the progress made, which included the tabling of a Climate Change Bill in parliament and the launch of the SA Green finance taxonomy earlier in 2022; developments with green hydrogen; electricity sector reforms, and more. With COP27 being held in Egypt later this year, it is critical that SA shows real progress. We are encouraged to see numerous of our investee companies making commitments to meet their respective sector targets. What is even more encouraging is that these goals are supported by the respective boards, have the appropriate budgets and many are aligned with executive management incentives. Funders are also providing cheaper funding to projects in SA that are focused on the environment, or as it is phrased colloquially, "green projects". As part of this journey, All Weather Capital remains committed to doing its part, and we strive to nudge our investee companies to become better corporate citizens in various aspects. One such aspect is the various just transition strategies and targets, which are near and dear to our hearts. is an ESG analyst at All Weather Capital. \</doc>

THICK END OF THE WEDGE Squabbling ministers worse than kids in a sweet shop There's a colourful twis going on over a possible loan to SA from the EU, Britain and the US of $8.5bn. Ostensibly, it is money to help encourage SA to adapt its economy to mitigate climate change. That at least is what the would-be lenders had in mind last year at COP26 in Glasgow when they offered it. The reception here to the intended loan has been, well, confused. Perhaps a brawl is to be expected when South Africans contemplate a large pile of money. Mineral resources & energy minister Gwede Mantashe has been saying that the money is there so that the Europeans, Brits and Americans can use us as "guinea pigs" to experiment on new power technologies. President Cyril Ramaphosa was so alarmed at the possibility that his terminally squabbling ministers would screw up the opportunity being offered (there's competition for the money from much better-governed economies than ours) that he hired former Reserve Bank deputy governor Daniel Mminele to head a special team, in his office, to secure the funding and try to get it on the easiest terms. The $8.5bn was originally found by Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter. He needed it to fund Eskom's transition away from coal. Once the number actually existed, there was no way the government was going to give it all to Eskom. Trade, industry & competition minister Ebrahim Patel is fighting for some of it to go to the development of green hydrogen and, more recently, to invest in a faster transition of the automotive industry to electric vehicles (EVs). Now, with COP27 But environment minister Barbara Creecy is keen on green hydrogen (made by using a renewable electric charge in water to separate the hydrogen from the oxygen), and Patel has realised that SA-made vehicles may simply be excluded from lucrative markets unless we begin to make EVs. In other words, we're behaving like kids in a sweet shop. No-one can make a decision. This is the story of the ANC from the day it took power nearly 30 years ago - it never quite appreciates how little time it has to do the right things. No-one epitomises this quite as starkly as Mantashe. He continues to insist, quite untruthfully, that SA is being "pushed" into cutting coal; that somehow we are being asked to "take the lead" in the fight against climate change when we are doing just fine with our coal and the exciting gas and oil prospects we have offshore. But as former Business Day colleague Nick Hedley has written, there's no way we are being asked to take the lead. We are, in fact, way behind. "We are expected to get to 33% renewables by 2030," Hedley said recently. "By then, wealthy nations, including Australia, Germany and the US, will be above 80%." Indeed, little Portugal will be above 80% by 2026. But Mantashe doesn't let facts get in his way. He's become a climate whiner, arguing that SA entered into the agreement for the $8.5bn, believing it would be grant money, not loans. "We thought that's a gift. It's not a gift. It's a loan, part of it, [a] concessional loan, [a] very small part of it is actually a grant," he said at a conference recently. It is hard to describe just how destructive Mantashe has been at his job at mineral resources & energy. It was Ramaphosa who combined the two departments and gave them to him. There is no minerals exploration. I struggle to find a mining expert to tell me how many shafts have been sunk in SA this century. He has completely failed to produce a cadastral survey (a complete view of who owns what land in SA) despite businesses offering to pay for one. On the energy side, Mantashe has failed to meet any of the deadlines he set himself in the 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP, the energy plan up to 2030). The deadline now being missed is the first auction window (bid window one) for battery storage, which is two months late. Complicating the picture, Eskom is fighting what seems to be an insane legal battle against Babcock, one of the world's leading industrial engineering multinationals. Babcock has taken Eskom to court after being excluded from a R16bn boiler maintenance contract in 2021 as it failed to include its welding certificate in its tender. For crying out loud. Asking Babcock if it can weld would be like asking God for his ID at the heavenly gates. Babcock has been welding for Eskom since 1920. And the people who excluded it were the Eskom board of 2021 - barely quorate, barely coherent and recently, and thankfully, replaced. And so we stumble on, a country in desperate straits with a leadership oblivious to all but the most obvious of our shortcomings. In a normal democracy, the absolute shambles that is the ANC under Ramaphosa would lose the coming elections badly in 2024. But because our opposition parties are so full of inflated egos and so lacking in intellect, policy and spark, the ANC may actually hold on to power. It is hard to believe.

As South Africa works towards achieving a just energy transition, government has reiterated that workers and communities that are highly dependent on the fossil fuels value chain will be part of the various initiates that seek to protect livelihoods. Addressing a virtual media briefing on Thursday, Head of the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team, Daniel Mminele, emphasized that communities will be considered through a level of consultation. 'We are committed to making sure that communities and employees that stand to be affected most by the transition are part and parcel of the various initiatives and plans that we put in place to protect livelihoods. [We are going to] make sure that the retraining and reskilling opportunities allow people to be equipped to find jobs in a new, greener and more sustainable economy,' Mminele said. He made these remarks during a joint media briefing, together with climate envoys from the European Union, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The briefing provided an update on the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) and the finalisation of an Investment Plan to guide South Africa's just transition. Through the Political Declaration issued in November 2021 to establish this partnership, the United Kingdom - together with the European Union, France, Germany, and the United States - undertook to mobilise an initial amount of $8.5 billion over the next three to five years to support the achievement of South Africa's ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). The NDC is a climate action plan aimed at cutting emissions and adapting to climate impacts. 'Decisions that need to be made have a very far reaching nature. There is extensive levels of stakeholder consultations that need to be undertaken and processes that we have no intentions of short-cutting, and making sure we consult and take everyone along as best as we can,' Mminele said. The envoys have already had engagements with the most affected region in Mpumalanga in terms of how the country plans to deal with the transition. In terms of the investment plan, which maps the investments required to achieve a just energy transition, South Africa is working with the JETP secretariat. 'We are aiming to complete the investment plan by October, which will then enable us to demonstrate concrete progress in realising the objectives of the partnership by COP27 . 'We will make sure that the governance arrangements, monitoring and reporting will ensure that funds are applied for the intended purposes,' Mminele said. In addition, the credentials climate commission has finalized its work on the Just Transition Framework, which will be submitted to Cabinet, and will inform elements of the investment plan, as well as mechanisms that are necessary to ensure a just transition for affected workers and communities. 'We will be consulting with key stakeholders on the investment plan in the coming months, including through working groups in each of the priority areas that include representatives from both the private sector and public sector. 'This will ensure that we have an investment plan that represents a shared vision for South Africa's transition and programme of action to achieve our climate commitments and national objectives. 'South Africa remains committed to making this partnership a success towards the path of a greener and more sustainable future. We are convinced that this path will also contribute to long-term energy security and support economic growth, development and job creation,' Mminele said. United Kingdom's COP26 Envoy and Chair of the International Partners Group, John Murton, said the investment plan is a huge undertaking that supports the ambitious transformation of South Africa's energy systems, ensuring that it is done a way that is just and inclusive. 'It will also ensure that we can support a process that develops and builds the energy that South Arica requires and helps it achieve its emission goals in a way that leaves no one behind. 'A guarantee will form a part of the UK's contribution to the mobilisation of funds for the JETP. We will be supporting a guarantee as part of our contribution,' Murton said. He said the UK will support the build-up of clean and reliable power in South Africa, in line with the country's NDC, in a way that is the most cost effective. 'All of the countries around the table are in the process of accelerating our transition away from fossil fuels, and accelerating and making more ambitious targets for 2030 and beyond. 'We are trying to support the South African government in providing ample and reliable power to help drive forward its economy and deliver the ambitious emissions reductions set out in the NDC and to mobilise funds in a way that is just and supports South Africa's broader inclusive economic growth and leaves no one behind,' Murton said. -SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

The 10th anniversary of the HYPERLINK https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/info/2022/ Global Citizen Festival The idea of the festival came about when music entrepreneur and philanthropist Ryan Gall met Australian humanitarian HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/arts/music/hugh-evans-29-force-behind-global-festival-on-great-lawn.html Hugh Evans .\~ Gall says the inspiration for the festival came after visiting HYPERLINK https://austincitylimits.com/ Austin City Limits Music Festival "The most marginalised populations are paying the price of the stagnant inaction of our leaders and now millions of lives, and the future of our planet, are at stake," Evans said in a press release\~ "We refuse to just stand by and watch. We refuse to accept the starvation of multitudes when solutions are readily at hand. We demand a secure future for girls everywhere. We demand governments keep their promises on climate funding. We demand relief from debts unjustly crushing economies. And we demand action now, while there's still time to change our collective trajectory."\~ The Global Citizen Festival has been calling for an end to poverty by uniting millions of voices, amplified by the world's biggest artists, demanding world leaders to take action now. This year's festival will unite artists, world leaders, and Global Citizens to help empower girls and women, defend the planet and end extreme poverty.\~ The Central Park event will be hosted by actor, producer, author and Global Citizen ambassador Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Performers will include Metallica, Charlie Puth, Jonas Brothers, M\'c5NESKIN, Mariah Carey, Mickey Guyton and Rosal\'eda, with more to be announced. Gall and Evans recognised the importance of including Africa in the global conversation and action needed to end poverty. This year' event at Accra's Black Star Square is the festival's second appearance on the continent.\~ Marking the 65th anniversary of Ghana's independence and the 20th anniversary of the African Union, Black Star Square will see the world's biggest performers live on stage.\~ The location for the festival in Ghana is significant because of its history. Black Star Square, also known as Independence Square, contains monuments to Ghana's independence struggle, including the Independence Arch, Black Star Gate and the Liberation Day Monument.\~ The New York and Accra concerts will take place simultaneously. Performances include Usher, SZA, Stormzy, Gyakie, H.E.R., Sarkodie, Stonebwoy and Tems, with more to be announced.\~ The festival was first held on the continent at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg on 2 December 2018. The event was a culmination of the Global Citizen Festival and HYPERLINK https://www.nelsonmandela.org/nelson-mandela-100 Mandela 100 , celebrating the legacy of Nelson Mandela for his centenary year.\~ Beyonc\'e9 and Jay-Z headlined the festival, which included a host of international and local performances. Presenters included Naomi Campbell, Gayle King, Tyler Perry, Trevor Noah, Bob Geldof, Forest Whitaker and Bonang Matheba. Oprah Winfrey delivered the keynote address.\~ Globally, the disproportionate effect of the Covid-19 pandemic has pushed nearly 100 million more people into extreme poverty and is reversing the trend of shrinking inequality, leading to the loss of at least three years of progress. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has aggravated the situation further, with as many as 323 million people now facing acute hunger and 1.2 billion people now living in nations experiencing food, energy and financial crises. The 2022 Global Citizen Festival, which will take place ahead of the G20 meeting and the climate change conference, COP27 , in November - will call on world leaders at the HYPERLINK to step up and invest $600-million in the future of women and girls, close the annual $10-billion climate financing shortfall, deliver $500-million to help African farmers respond to the global food crisis, and provide urgent relief from crushing debts to end extreme poverty.\~ Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo, said: "The time to help make a change is now. We must align forces to make an impact in Africa and help end extreme poverty. I have called fellow African leaders to join me in September and help break these systemic barriers that have been affecting our people.

TRANSITION FUNDING Soft loans won't save ANC from hard yards in December President Cyril Ramaphosa did the optics well last week at COP27 . He looked at ease as he made small talk with John Kerry, Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron and Ursula von der Leyen during a Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh, but his bonhomie with Western leaders isn't the show of strength he would like us to think it is. The reality of their dynamic was more apparent in the terms laid out in the sovereign loans made by the French and German public development banks announced two days later. In a carefully worded media release, the National Treasury highlighted how "highly concessionary" the \€ 300m of climate-linked loans are, possibly hoping no-one would notice that the loans are also "non-earmarked budget financing" that will be "transferred directly into the National Revenue Fund". I'm sorry to pour cold water on all the excitement, but there are two things that bug me. First, a loan is a loan. It needs to be paid back with interest, and the interest must, at a minimum, be paid off by the upside in growth and development that results from the economic activity the loans generate. Perhaps these loans will do that, but I remain sceptical. SA taxpayers already have to pay R311bn to service interest on sovereign debt this fiscal year. This number has ballooned over the past decade since the Zuma administration used the country's credit card to buy bread and pay the school fees, all the while looting the capital investment projects that were meant to kickstart growth. What was looted should have been spent on sorting out our energy crisis, fixing our ports, roads and rail operations, and addressing municipal failings that drag on businesses the country over. Then came Covid. Anyhow, that money has gone and very little has been fixed. This has resulted in several outcomes: our credit record has been pummelled, we have a burgeoning debt-servicing bill that taxpayers are unable to afford, and we still have to spend billions on much-needed basic infrastructure. This ill-discipline has resulted in a dramatic loss of fiscal elbow room, which is reflected in our politics. It will be interesting to see whether the ANC has the courage to even broach these topics at its December elective conference. The fact that the ANC national executive committee meeting this weekend was dominated by discussions about wads of cash and their provenance, it would seem they are too distracted to focus. political loyalty It is obvious to anyone who casts their eyes over the Treasury's documents that a useful way to stretch scarce rands would be to eke out an iota of efficiency from our public service. Debt servicing and personnel costs add up to just shy of a R1-trillion of this year's R2.16-trillion budget. However, the concept of public service efficiency is political, because it would require those deployed into positions for political expediency to be held accountable for their operational output, as opposed to their political loyalty. That said, the government has started to show some stomach for this fight. Employment & labour minister Thulas Nxesi's hard line on the 3% across-the-board cost-of-living wage hike for public servants may, as this newspaper argued last week, be a blunt tool. But it is certainly a necessary and laudable approach. The question is, will he be able to hold this line when there are unpalatable political consequences? The second thing that bugs me is that we must accept that being given access to cheapish money is a part of a geopolitical power play by Western nations at a time when China is looking inward and Iran and Russia appear to be in the throes of self-immolation. Concessionary loans come with other costs, and the National Treasury may have disclosed the fiscal terms of the new loans and just energy transition loans, but it hasn't been so keen to discuss other conditions attached. As reasonable as these conditions may be, they are conditions imposed by the lender over and above just repaying the debt. This can be interpreted as an erosion of some degree of sovereignty, whereas money raised in international capital markets typically comes with only one condition: pay it back with interest. Of course, if we could just get control of the finances and a handle on the personnel costs and graft, we'd not be clutching the begging bowl for sovereign cash at climate conferences. Any number of private balance sheets would be open for a country like ours, and pension funds the world over climb into ESG-friendly renewables projects. beyond satire Regrettably, we have opted to kick the hard work down the road, so that option is increasingly too expensive to contemplate. In light of this, it's hard not to see the ANC national executive committee's discussions this weekend about Phala-Phala, Ramaphosa versus Zweli Mkhize and the to-and-fro about who will be secretary-general and who will be treasurer, as being parochial to a point beyond satire. Increasingly, our problems are post-political and as a result are drifting out of our hands. External forces - like our debt - mean the government has little choice but to address an inefficient public service that also serves as a client electorate of more than 1-million people. We cannot afford it, but the ANC cannot afford to alienate it. How it plans to win that battle for efficiency - for win it it must - without alienating a key constituency, and without incrementally handing over policy direction to foreign capital, will be interesting to watch. It's the real issue this December, but it doesn't seem like anyone has noticed. The ANC doesn't have long to make a plan before the electorate does it for it.

The 77th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), convened predominantly in person with 193 members heads of state and government, was the first at the UN headquarters since the declaration of Covid-19 as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and worldwide restrictions to contain its spread. UNGA 77 took place last month, under the theme  A Watershed Moment: Transformative solutions to interlocking challenges . This year, there were 195 speakers. This included speeches from three permanent observers \- Palestine, the Holy See and the EU \- as well as speeches from the UN secretary- general and the president of the General Assembly, who delivered a closing speech. The order of speakers is generally determined by factors that include geography and the position of the speaker. Because of the continuing war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was granted special dispensation by a vote to address the General Assembly via a pre-recorded video. The General Assembly is the pre-eminent organ of the UN where all member states enjoy equal rights and votes. The gender of the speakers were 173 men and 22 women. Women\' s voices at the General Assembly are typically few. This time around, the number was less than half, only nine of whom were heads of state or government, an improvement from last year when only 18 women spoke. The president of last year\' s General Assembly convened the first UNGA platform of women leaders, with the aim to address the gap. During the meeting, participants said it could take anywhere between 130 and 300 years to achieve gender parity. High-level meetings of the 77th Session included: Amid an education crisis, the UN secretary-general convened the Transforming Education Summit to mobilise solidarity and solutions to recover pandemic-related learning losses, reimagine education for the future and reignite global efforts to deliver education-related Sustainable Development Goals. World leaders joined  Leaders Day discussions, a major highlight of the General Assembly\' s 77th session. The event was preceded by a two- day segment focused on youth and solutions to scale up global support and action. SDG Moment: Sept 19 The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) moment serves to place an annual spotlight on the Sustainable Development Goals that took place in the beginning of the UN General Assembly High-Level Week. It was held as the world faces its deepest cost-of-living crisis that carries huge implications for the advancement of the SDGs, especially in developing countries. Platform for Women Leaders: Sept 20 The General Assembly convened female heads of state and government for an event titled the  UNGA Platform of Women Leaders , to discuss priority issues on the international community\' s agenda and identify solutions to today\' s complex and interlinked challenges. It is a special initiative of the Assembly president and UN-Women to help enhance the focus of the 193-Member organ on gender equality. The theme for this year is  Transformative solutions by Women Leaders to Today\' s Interlinked Crises . General Debate: Sept 20 to 26 This is the busiest diplomatic session of the year at the UN head- quarters in New York. Heads of state and government explored solutions to the intertwined global challenges under the theme,  A Watershed Moment: Transformative solutions to interlocking challenges . 30th Anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of Minorities As requested by a General Assembly resolution, a high-level meeting was convened to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Persons of Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities. Leaders\' round-table on climate change Amid the worsening climate crisis, the secretary-general, with the president of Egypt, hosted a closed Leaders\' Roundtable on Climate Action, bringing together a small but representative group of heads of state and government to reboot international co-operation on climate action. The aim was to have a frank and informal exchange in the lead-up to COP27 set to take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt at the end of the year. Security Council\' s high-level meeting on Ukraine Foreign ministers of the current members of the security council held the meeting at the security council chamber, to debate on the war in Ukraine. Other meetings included: Commemorating International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. Ending the Covid-19 Pandemic. Accelerating Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions. High-level Meeting on the Sahel. The meetings were the formal ones that were agreed upon to be held during this 77th session of UNGA as part of the programme for this year. There were as usual many bilateral and other meetings held on the sidelines of the formal ones. The period is a hive of diplomatic activities in the UN building and other venues in the Manhattan area of New York. The meetings keep diplomats in missions in New York and at country headquarters level. Heads of state and government are not exempted from a few hours of sleep and endless meetings. Many of the issues affect all regions and member states. The sessions are important for developing countries as this is the forum where they have an equal voice and votes with all other member states of the UN. \</doc>

THICK END OF THE WEDGE Hopes for green hydrogen are inflated by the hype There is a lot of heat being generated by the Green Hydrogen Summit in Cape Town this week. President Cyril Ramaphosa launched it, and the meeting has been animated by discussions and plans and strategies for positioning SA to play a large role in the production of green hydrogen, an important fuel for the future. Our green hydrogen (GH2) ambitions formed a large part of the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) we presented to the COP27 climate summit in Egypt in early November. The JET-IP has secured $8.5bn of the $98bn Ramaphosa reckons the just transition is going to cost. Fortunately, the one thing successive ANC governments haven't yet broken is the power of the sun, but they're working on it. The green hydrogen chapter of JET-IP is revealing. In scenarios where we export GH2, it says "up to 1.8-million more jobs could be created by 2050 than in scenarios without". It says up to 10-million tonnes a year (Mtpa) of demand for local production "could be in play" by 2050, creating a $20bn market, more than 650,000 "job years" (defined as one job for one year) and more than 50,000 permanent jobs. We've seen this movie before. "The target of 3.8Mtpa by 2040 will require a total investment of $164bn," the JET-IP calculates. By 2050, SA could "aggressively pursue deeper decarbonisation by seeking a GH2 demand uplift to 7Mtpa, "which will displace 541Mt carbon dioxide and require an additional investment of $133bn" - a lot of money when you consider that the basic ingredients of GH2 are sun and water. Still, Western economies seem happy to pay us. Eskom CEO Andr\'e9 de Ruyter recently explained why to the Financial Times. "Mitigating a tonne of carbon in SA is a 10th of the cost of mitigating a tonne of carbon in Europe," he said. That's because we produce it so inefficiently. If you're German, you get rid of carbon in SA far more cheaply than back home. We're happy to play that game even as the energy minister tries tirelessly to keep fossil fuels well in the field of play, and the industry minister tries to pretend it isn't happening. It's a sideshow in the greater scheme of things. Agora Energiewende, a well-regarded German energy think-tank, said in 2021 that "hydrogen from renewable energy has all but taken over as the darling of deep-decarbonisation". Not least in SA. Hydrogen is the new natural gas, and while Agora doesn't see it reaching the intensity in Europe that liquefied natural gas (LNG) has now, that's because there are things that can't easily be (renewably) electrified. Some petrochemical industry processes, steel making and aviation fuel, for example. Passenger cars may be another. And all you need is (renewable) electricity, an electrolyser (platinum) mined (presumably) with renewable power, and water. Switch on, separate the hydrogen and oxygen, and voila! Needless to say, we're late. The Australians are well ahead of us. And the Chileans. Namibia has landed its first supply contract already. The Germans will open their first hydrogen terminal in 2026 to take imports from Saudi Arabia. Eventually everyone will be doing it. New solar panels can generate power in the dark. Trade, industry & competition minister Ebrahim Patel's default is to over-plan and over-promise. There's a whole port to be built at Boegoebaai in the Northern Cape north of Port Nolloth, and Patel's contribution to the JET-IP says we will need 100GW of renewable power, and more than 60GW of electrolyser capacity, to realise the JET-IP dream. Those are just staggering numbers. He will want to localise all the parts and machines and when he does, he will rapidly begin to miss his targets. Part of his problem is that Gwede Mantashe at mineral resources & energy, and a big section of industry, including Sasol, are also hot to install new LNG infrastructure as a "transition" fuel. Business has already published a plan to build LNG terminals at Richards Bay, Durban and Coega, and in a sleight of hand, the JET-IP mentions that there may need to be "upgrades at those ports. "These projects span a range of use cases and require significant capital for deployment for the early incubation of SA's GH2 ecosystem." "Range of use cases" my ass. The JET-IP is lying here, but if international funders are happy to be deceived then that's up to them. South Africans will have to fight the LNG plans on our own. Can LNG infrastructure even be used for hydrogen? Sadly, Agora thinks it can. The "technical requirements for conversion appear to be both feasible and relatively trivial", it reported in 2021. Others disagree: "The perceived advantage of hydrogen is its resemblance to natural gas - it exists as liquid or gas, flows through pipes, stores in tanks and burns in engines," argued Canadian academics Johanne Whitmore and Paul Martin earlier this year. "However, hydrogen-ready LNG terminals do not actually exist today because both gases have different properties which require different infrastructure." The most encouraging hydrogen investment in SA thus far is in Coega in the Eastern Cape, where the UK's Hive Energy is building a $4.6bn green ammonia plant in the special economic zone (SEZ) around the port. It will use desalinated water from the nearby Cerebos salt plant, construct a huge 1,350MW solar plant on a farm nearby, and suck nitrogen out of the air to mix with the hydrogen it makes from the solar power to produce 780,000 tonnes of easily transportable green ammonia a year. It will be exported and used in fertilisers or broken back down into green hydrogen again. And beyond a few minor subsidies and the privileges SEZs offer, it will cost SA nothing. Offering investors who know their stuff an opportunity to do it here, or going out to the world with a begging bowl for $300bn to do much the same thing ourselves? What a terrible dilemma.

Damn! It's 4.30am and the low, pale blue is already lighting up my clunky bathroom window. Drag a cup of "on sale strong, classic" coffee - and the trash - across Deary Drive to outside the Gonubie commodore's verge, where I dump the rubbish and wobble down to the sea on finished knees. Thar she blows! The first piepie of sun rising - not where I expect it over at Kwelerha point, but out on the tip of Gonubie Point. Ever had that? The thrill of not knowing where the hell you are? When north is south and ain't nothin' gonna change that? Today it's good. In '79 'twas slithy tove bad: hair sheared, racist, sexist, ethnicist korporaal Spikkels screaming, I clumped off at sunset for supper in hard boots, and got blue eggs and blue-ball tea ... for breakfast? Ja-ah. Disco-balas, Kimberley. When I finally came up for air in 1991, I was craning, looking at the pulsing orange rock dotted with luminescent yellow moss, all the way up the north-facing ramparts of Blouberg mountain, Malebogo's refuge, all 350m of it, and then looking out at the vista at Botswana. Thin tendrils of smoke rose from the little dagga patch cut into the dark, tangled carpet of Afro-montane forest wrapped tightly, impenetrably, around the massifs we called donjons. But no. See I was always looking "south" from that big wall. Still feel like I am. Disorientating, but kif! Blouberg was a legendary rock 'n roll ride for a certain band of trad (traditional) climbers. Six hours along the traffic-jammed "snake" from Joburg at 180km/h in Clive the crazy engineer's Cressida. We headed north, then west from now-Polokwane. I was good with those orientations. Then up, up into the centre of high, wild, secret paths - miss it and you are seriously lost - cave life, glittering tarns in secret grassy vlakte, scrambling down a tiny break 300m in the predawn gloom wearing head torches to the bottom of the wall, and picking through those forests to reach the base of the climb. The sun just rising - in the "west"! But wait, now 30 years later, does it feel like it rose in the east? How perspective can shift over the years. You rankle under parenting, then grow to have your own sprogs, and now you're the tyrannical monster! Then your rentals die and you ponder, well, what was that all about? Lives neatly condensed in memorialising, then poof! they're gone, and climate chaos just blew down a chunk of ceiling at your local store! On Blouberg we'd climb hard all day, topping out at 3pm if all went well. Lots of grunting terror, thrills and a few spills to clear the mind. Often we'd emerge into soft, golden high-altitude late afternoon yellow light, the sun keeling and keening in the west ... west? Yes! I suddenly feel have my orientation right! Question: Am I standing upside down on this spinning exercise ball? Is Earth wobbling off its axis as its over-heated, polluted sheath melts the summer ice? Or is the kooky politico who connects with me at my local store in Gonubie actually right in her assertions - there has been a change in the sloshing of the molten gloop in the epicentre of our blue ball, whose only significance, in the cosmic sense of it all, is that conditions are favourable for sustaining life right now. But, amid questionable argument that in such vastness we actually do exist, appears the answer - of equally huge importance to me, and you fellow they-person traveller, my solo reader. We actually do exist, whether we have any idea from which part of the compass the sun rises or if we actually are driving, Muriel. My mind is on the road, this time to "The Thez", Nieu-Bethesda, one of the most epic high-Karoo Eastern Cape villages. Have you been there? It is much more than the marvellous dark-light, creative machinations of outsider artist Helen Martins, and her story of terrible suffering and abuse and the liberating love she found in the arms of her draad-en-daga sculptures, and apparently the cement statue-maker, Koos Malgas. No, Bethesda is much more. It's about the magical power of Compassberg peak, rising tangled-toothed in the north (south? Whatever.) This second highest peak in the province (2,502m) after the 3,000m Ben MacDhui, has a twisty path up to its rocky summit. There is - was - a metal box there. Inside is a notebook for people to record passing but a moment on top of our world. I know because I put it there at the request of my late, great editor and china, Gavin Stewart. I wrote a note to my daughters. They might get to read it. Or not. Messages floating in water and air, in bottles and tin boxes, can feel disconnected, of no use. The authors can be long dead, long since returned to cosmic dust. And so we yaw into summer time, make all sorts of "dronk planne", search for orientation, meaning, build pictures of joy and dread at the looming arrival of loved and loathsome relatives. But let's lower our ambitions. OK, not as low as the cheating climate scumbags, the heads of state and corporate oligarchy who made a mockery of Cop27 . You get my drift. Just imagine the announcement arrives in your inbox that said relative is not arriving for Christmas but is actually ... dead! Shocking, but pause for a moment's reflection. Who were they really to you? What were they saying and feeling which drove their offending social interaction with you? And now they are gone. Just an empty, inanimate space, a cup, a shoe, hat, spectacles, painting, a cupboard shelf of personal items, an empty seat at the table. And that's where getting over yourself, moving along swiftly, finding perspective when others have lost theirs, enjoying the ride, the climb, your knitting, or having loved ones by your side, becomes your everything. CLOCK CHANGE: Gonubie Point at 4.50am this week. Summer's up, everyone, but are you? Time to segue into long. languid days. Picture: DELORIS KOAN \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH: World leaders, policymakers and delegates from nearly 200 countries are in Egypt at the COP27 UN climate summit, which delegates kicked off with a deal to discuss compensating poor nations for mounting damage linked to global warming. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged countries to hasten action on climate change, speaking at the COP27 summit in Sharm El-Sheikh yesterday.  The global fossil fuel crisis must be a game changer. So let us not take the \' highway to hell\' but let\' s earn the clean ticket to heaven, she said, echoing remarks by UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres on Monday. In a separate statement, European Council President Charles Michel said that Russia had chosen to make energy  a weapon of mass destabilisation . | \</doc>

Greylisting means heavy weather for climate package South Africa's possible greylisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in February will complicate accessing the $8.5bn (R155bn) climate change package pledged to the country. Stuart Theobald, chair of Intellidex, said it was unlikely the money would be withdrawn, but complications could be expected around its dispersal. At Cop26 in November 2021, the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU pledged money to South Africa to speed up the transition from coal. The funds have "been brought together from several sources, including a few national development funds. Particularly from the EU side, we can expect complications if South Africa is greylisted," he said. "This will place South Africa on the EU anti-money laundering (AML) blacklist and it will therefore impose a high-risk category on South Africa with immediate effect. Funders in that jurisdiction will be required to increase due diligence significantly." Theobald was speaking after the release this week of a report by Intellidex, commissioned by Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA), which found there was an 85% probability the country would be greylisted by the FATF at its next plenary session. A greylisting would also mean the money would be paid out with strict conditions. "Once greylisted, part of the loan agreement would require South Africa to commit to certain targets related to AML and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT)," he said. The Cop26 pledge was also a political declaration, said Theobald. "It is only an announcement of intention and not a signed agreement, meaning the greylisting can still impact. South Africa will present an investment plan at Cop27 indicating what it intends to do with the funds, and only then will the formal process of signing the agreements regarding the specific loans start." This process would, in all probability, coincide with the greylisting, making the funding subject to greylisting requirements. The National Treasury did not respond to a request for comment. Theobald said it was not only Cop26 financing at risk, but donor funding in general would become more complicated in future. "It will, for the most part, depend on each donor as different rules apply in different places. The EU, however, is by far the most strict and has a standard directive that is applied to greylisted countries. This determines how any country is treated by institutions within the EU when greylisted." He said the economic impact of greylisting would depend on the seriousness with which South Africa was perceived to be acting to address the FATF's concerns. "For the EU, however, it will make no difference how far we are in this process. It will implement and require that very deliberate steps are followed by all institutions to minimise the risk of money laundering, corruption and terrorism financing until South Africa is officially no longer greylisted." Government and multilateral institutions, in particular, would be affected. "These organisations will be part of the $8.5bn deal and obligated to follow the stringent due diligence process." He said while the EU approach, adopted in May 2020, had been criticised for being disproportional, it remained in place and institutions were bound to follow procedures. "While some consider it a very blunt instrument, the reality is it can be very negative for South Africa. Getting any agreements through the EU committees will be far more difficult and costly if greylisted." The Intellidex report found South Africa fell short of at least half of FATF recommendations for AML and CFT. While the FATF had told South Africa of the 12 priority actions it needed to implement to avoid being greylisted, not much progress had been made and only two of the recommendations had been satisfactorily achieved. Three of the actions remained far from being achieved and only limited progress had been made on the rest. BLSA CEO Busi Mavuso described the looming greylisting as "yet another hard blow" to a country already struggling amid difficult economic conditions. "This comes at a time when we are trying to strengthen the business case for investment and it can have dire consequences. The question now is whether the country is going to be caught napping or do we have a clear plan on how to get us out of this greylisting situation." Estimates are that even with such a plan, it would take at least two years to convince the FATF to lift greylisting. According to Theobald, politicians and government officials reacted slowly when the initial possibility of greylisting became apparent, but as the severity of the situation became clearer, there was more traction. "Recently there has been a considerable increase in concern and an acceleration in efforts by the likes of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) to address the issue, but it is likely too little, too late," he said. "It is important now, even if we don't avoid being greylisted, that we mount a concerted national effort to deal with this and get off this list as quickly as possible."

The Minister of Public Enterprises, Mr Pravin Gordhan on behalf of the South African Government today welcomed the President of the World Bank, Mr David Malpass, to the recently decommissioned Komati Power Station, the site of the country's flagship Just Energy Transition (JET) project. Mr Malpass is on a short visit to South Africa while on his way to the COP 27 Summit taking place in Egypt. Minister Gordhan and Mr Malpass were welcomed in the Mpumalanga Province by Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane and received at the Komati power station by the Eskom Board chairperson, Mr Mpho Makwana and Group CEO, Mr Andre de Ruyter. Komati is set to become the first major coal power station in South Africa to be converted into a site for renewable energy generation, as the country gradually transitions from fossil fuels to clean energy resources. It seeks to make a major contribution to mitigating climate change and ensuring energy security while supporting a range of economic initiatives for local communities in the Komati area. The World Bank last week, at the request of South Africa, announced that it will provide a R9 billion concessional loan towards South Africa's just energy transition, of which the Komati project will be the first step. 'Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a difficult challenge worldwide, and particularly in South Africa given the high carbon intensity of the energy sector. Decommissioning the Komati plant this week is a good first step toward low carbon development. We are cognizant of the social challenges of the transition, and we are partnering with the government, civil society, and unions to create economic opportunities for affected workers and communities,' said Mr Malpass.' The Minister of Finance, Mr Enoch Godongwana, who met with Mr Malpass on Saturday evening, said Government is in partnership with a range of social partners to ensure a just energy transition. 'The financing Eskom is receiving from the World Bank will go a long way in assisting us to meet the ambitious targets relating to decarbonisation and a Just Energy Transition that we have set for ourselves.' 'The repurposing of Komati is a critical first step in a long journey, one that we cannot walk alone if we are to strike the urgent balance between our environmental, economic and energy imperatives. We will continue to mobilise capital, internationally and domestically, to finance the transition in the interest of the lives and livelihoods of our people,' said Minister Godongwana after the meeting. Minister Gordhan indicated that Mr Malpass's visit to Komati, is an expression of confidence in South Africa's ability to implement a just energy transition in a way that minimises any negative impacts on local communities which have over the years developed around the coal stations. 'This project will greatly assist Eskom, South Africa and the international community to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of how the processes of decommissioning and repurposing of coal-powered stations can be done in a manner which mitigates the socio-economic impacts for workers and communities; before we scale up the move of the power sector into a low-carbon path. Crucially, it will provide training in new skills and for new jobs', Minister Gordhan said. The last unit of the Komati Power station was decommissioned and switched off on 31 October 2022, signalling the end of its operating life as a coal-fired power station. The Komati plant will be converted into a renewable generation site powered with 150MW of solar, 70MW of wind and 150MW of storage batteries, adding generation capacity to the grid, thereby continuing to put the site and its associated transmission infrastructure to good use. A containerised micro-grid assembly factory has already been established on site. This will help prolong the usefulness of the infrastructure and provide economic opportunities to the community. Eskom has developed a comprehensive Just Energy Transition (JET) Strategy, which places equal importance on the 'transition to lower carbon technologies,' and the ability to do so in a manner that is 'just' and sustainable. The employees remaining in Komati at the time of the decommissioning will become part of the Repowering and Repurposing project. The Komati Training Facility is already under development. It will facilitate the reskilling, retraining, and upskilling of Eskom employees and members of the community, as appropriate. Eskom has signed a partnership agreement with the South African Renewable Energy Technology Centre (SARETEC) of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to develop the training facility. \</doc>

WORLD BANK AND IMF MEETINGS It may be good thing SA was overlooked in Washington Summing up what happens at the annual meetings that took place in Washington DC this week, one chief economist described them as being "like a geekier Davos". It was certainly geekier, with hundreds of economists among those in the city for the IMF and World Bank Group annual meetings, and a series of "Analytical Corner" seminars on the programme, which brought the experts together to discuss the latest research on the big macroeconomic issues worrying the world's policymakers. There was similarity to the World Economic Forum's annual Davos meeting too, in that as numerous as were the seven days of meetings inside the official venues, there were many more outside. Where Davos is no more than a private profitmaking enterprise led by a man with a talent for convening everyone from heads of state to CEOs to celebrities and getting lots of publicity, the annual meetings are just that: official meetings. The governance structures of the IMF and World Bank meet this weekend, which means almost all of the finance ministers and central bank governors of the 190 member countries of the two institutions attend. Since they are all there, they also have a Group of 20 (G20) meeting, not to mention meetings of Commonwealth and African finance ministers and a variety of other official gatherings to keep the officials busy. But if the world's macroeconomic policymakers and regulators are the official core of the annual meetings, the private sector periphery is even larger. Bankers, investors, civil society organisations and academics converge, to meet the policymakers as well as to meet each other. Everyone is there, in a sense, because everyone is there. SA's policymakers and its private sector bankers use the meetings as an opportunity to meet investors and correspondent banks. So do those of other countries. In contrast to the celebrity gathering at Davos though, this is serious business. It's not just that the fund and bank disburse large sums of money to member countries that need it and enable even larger sums from other official and private sector sources. It is also that these gatherings convene the people who make the economic policy decisions driving the global economy, providing a forum for collective thinking on the world's challenges. Which, this year, are very big and scary. The world is facing a possible global recession as countries grapple with high inflation and interest rates in advanced economies that were near zero for more than a decade but are now not just normalising but heading well beyond normal. What the fallout of this new world of high inflation and high interest rates will be is not yet clear. But policymakers are worrying about falling incomes and rising poverty. With borrowing costs rising and capital flowing out of emerging-market and developing countries, they are worried about the possibility of another debt crisis. And the climate issue is increasingly on their agenda. Where does SA fit into all of this? The answer is hardly at all. It rated not a mention in the various IMF media conferences, nor in some of the big plenary sessions - though one of the few mentions was to Eskom's Komati power station decommissioning project. Ahead of COP27 Far more exciting was the UK. Its spectacular efforts to blow itself up fiscally drew much attention from the assembled media in the IMF building, as well as down the road at the private sector Institute for International Finance annual meetings, where Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey's session was one of the star turns. One can only wonder about the conversations UK chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's peers were having with him in the G20 and other official meetings. And there's still a real concern that the UK's financial market craziness could have spillovers for other markets. At the other end of the scale, there was much talk about the low-income countries, particularly in Africa, that are facing debt distress - and how their debt might be restructured. One of the SA banks that had planned meetings with policymakers from the other African countries in which it operates found some of them cancelling because they were busy talking to the fund about debt relief. There's apparently an expectation SA should provide leadership on the issue, particularly when it comes to trying to get the Chinese to provide relief on the very large debts they've extended to some of Africa's poorest countries. But for the most part it seemed large emerging markets such as SA fell between the cracks as policymakers dwelt instead on the troubles of the richest countries, and the poorest. It was a welcome antidote to SA parochialism. But close your eyes when you listen to central bank governors from Mexico or Hungary, and the language and issues are just the same as those of our own central bankers. What is striking and important in a global forum like this is the extent to which SA's own macroeconomic policymakers are sharing lessons and experiences with their counterparts - and have to make their decisions in the context of a global environment whose risks they are well appraised of. SA has its own crippling economic challenges to deal with in a global economic environment that is deteriorating and becoming more risky. There isn't a lot of space to make fiscal or monetary policy mistakes. And as the UK's experience shows, markets will punish even advanced countries that make such mistakes, with severe consequences for their citizens. The geeks ensure the central bankers and finance people in Washington are well aware of that. Their challenge is to get the politicians to appreciate it. Joffe is editor at large. \</doc>

DAVID Bowie released his seminal album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars 50 years ago, on June 16, 1972. It was an ambitious rock album which captured the time\' s sense of being on the cusp of new technological and cultural frontiers. In the early 1970s, the US Apollo programme was, briefly, making men visiting the moon seem routine. The possibilities of computer power were beginning to unfold, and the countercultural youth revolt was challenging prevailing values and norms. Bowie\' s fictional alter ego encapsulated these groundbreaking developments: an androgynous rockstar from outer space. But coupled with its playful fascination for space technology, the Ziggy Stardust album also described a dread of the Pandora\' s box that might be opened as a result. Its opening track, Five Years, warned listeners that  Earth was really dying . During the Cold War, the prospect of man-made Armageddon through nuclear war was never far away. And by the early 1970s, fears of an ecological crisis and overpopulation were starting to take on similar apocalyptic proportions. Indeed, the day of Ziggy Stardust\' s release coincided with the final day of a landmark gathering in Sweden to discuss the future of the planet. The Stockholm Conference, which began on June 5, 1972, was the first UN conference on the human environment, and the starting point for global environmental governance. Today\' s global climate summits, most recently COP 26 in Glasgow in November, are its direct descendants. It was during the manned moon expeditions that Earth was first photographed from space. The most iconic image, Earthrise \- taken over Christmas 1968 with a Hasselblad camera by the crew of Apollo 8 \- shows our planet rising over the lifeless landscape of the moon. It has become one of the most widely shared and reproduced photographs of all time. In the words of historian Robert Poole:  It gave people a picture to think with. Other scholars talked about the  overview effect : by seeing the Earth from space, people became aware that life on their planet was interconnected, limited and vulnerable \- giving impetus to the emerging survivalism movement. Five Years also echoes some of the survivalist debate\' s darker sentiments, with its weeping  newsguy confirming the end of the world is nigh. In Sweden, the pivotal moment for the awakening of environmental consciousness came in 1967. At that time, a choir of prominent Swedish scientists publicly warned of an impending global environmental crisis. Foremost among them was the chemist Hans Palmstierna, whose Plundering, Starvation, Poisoning became a best-seller. The impact of Palmstierna\' s and other scientists\' collective intervention was powerful. The national press, radio and television reported on mercury-poisoned fish, biocides and acid rain with unprecedented intensity. In the words of the Swedish historian Lars J Lundgren, it was as if a  new continent of problems had been discovered. Intrinsic to this reorientation was the very concept of  the environment . To an observer in 2022, with last year\' s COP26 still fresh in memory, the dividing lines of Stockholm 1972 look eerily familiar. Then, as now, young environmental activists viewed the conference as a slow and insufficient way of dealing with urgent problems. The final day of the Stockholm Conference was the day the Ziggy Stardust album was released. Fifty years on, the hopes and fears evoked in this album still feel disturbingly relevant. This November\' s COP 27 , in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt, will be the first such conference to be held on African soil. | The Conversation Heidenblad is associate professor of history at Lund University in Sweden. \</doc>

Rampant energy exploitation will not benefit Africa's poor In his book Entangled Life, the charmingly named Merlin Sheldrake recounts how a type of zombie fungus, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, induces carpenter ants to leave their nests and climb the nearest stalk. Mycelia fix the ant's feet to the plant and the fungus eats the ant from inside out, before sprouting from its head to spread its spores. As someone sleepwalking to my doom while the planet burns, I can identify with the ants. The fungus, on the other hand, brings to mind companies seeking to develop new fossil fuel fields in Africa and beyond despite the burning need to reduce the amount of CO2 and methane in the atmosphere. The Russian invasion of Ukraine - and the energy crisis that followed when European sanctions abruptly shut off Russian oil and Russia choked gas supplies to Europe - has seen a number of coal, oil and gas companies exporting their commodities to Europe at premium prices. This trend will only strengthen as Europe enters winter and the war shows no sign of abating. Europe has come in for criticism for preaching green even as it gobbles up whatever old energy sources it can procure in its time of crisis. But, if anything, the conflict will spur its transition to green energy, and any profit in selling fossil fuels will be short-lived. The Global North grew rich while polluting the planet. Africa, on the other hand, is still poor but has vast untapped oil, peat and gas fields. That does not mean we should uncritically accept views put forward by Nigeria's former president Olusegun Obasanjo and others that Africa should be allowed to assert its energy sovereignty by exploring and developing new oilfields. Obasanjo is a keynote speaker at the upcoming Africa Oil Week, an event sponsored by a number of major oil companies. It is obvious what their interests are. It is less clear that these interests coincide with those of the citizens of a continent widely believed to be the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Profits from African resources have a well-documented tendency to benefit the rent-seeking elite while the needs and interests of the poor are ignored. There is no debate that existing coal mines and oil or gas fields are necessary, not only in Africa but also in other parts of the world, as we move to a cleaner and renewable energy future. There is also no question that we need them to be phased out everywhere if we are to limit the effects of an overheating planet and move towards a net-zero carbon economy. Emissions caused by humans have already led to feedback loops in nature, such as an increase in microbe activity in tropical wetlands, leading to more methane in the atmosphere. Similar processes are at work in the Arctic, which is heating three times faster than other places on the planet, and where melting ice sheets mean radiation that would previously have been reflected back to space is now being absorbed by the Earth. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global greenhouse gas emissions rose from 38Gt in 1990 to 59Gt in 2019 and Africa's contribution went from 7% to 9%. Europe and North America have reduced their contribution from 18% and 16% to 12% and 8% respectively. East Asia has the highest contribution at 27%, up from 13%. North America, however, has by far the highest per capita emission. It would be wrong to make Africa carry the can for the profligacy of the rest of the world, especially given the legacy of its colonial history. The solution must lie in learning from how North America and Europe have reduced their emissions, and in a form of climate reparation by finance and technology. One of the lessons in reducing emissions is that it is not a case of one size fits all. Each country will have its own blend of wind, solar, hydroelectric, nuclear and fossil fuel, depending on its resources. It is also apparent that renewable technologies have some inbuilt vulnerabilities, and steps will need to be taken to mitigate these. As for financing, there is a renewed focus on the pledges made by developed nations at Cop26. Cop27 In the meantime, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is showing there is more than one way to leverage the nondevelopment of fossil fuel fields. The country last month invited bids for the exploration of 30 oil and gas blocks, including areas in peatland and rainforest. The cost to the environment would be significant if discoveries in these places were developed. But the hydrocarbons minister, Didier Budimbu, is opening the bidding to carbon credit companies - which will then be able to sell the rights as avoided emissions. Bids close in February so we will have to wait to see whether there is any uptake. It is a novel idea, and one that will hopefully spark others to create income while saving the planet. Development in Africa and climate change are difficult challenges. We should beware of glib statements about sovereignty that would take our focus away from developing meaningful solutions. Extinction Rebellion activists stage a protest at Africa Oil Week in Cape Town three years ago. We should not uncritically accept the view that Africa should be allowed to assert its energy sovereignty by exploring and developing new oilfields, says the writer. Picture: Esa Alexander \</doc>

President Cyril Ramaphosa has concluded his official working visit to the United States at the invitation of President Joseph Biden. The two leaders deliberated on a range of critical issues of national, regional and global importance during their bilateral meeting, where trade, investment, global peace and stability, health, as well as climate change and the just energy transition were discussed. Trade and Investment On trade and investment, there was agreement on the need to create a more attractive environment for American companies to invest in South Africa, where an estimated 600 US companies are already doing business in a range of sectors. A joint task force on trade and investment will be established to expand bilateral economic ties. In 2023 South Africa will host the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum which will map the next phase of Africa-US trade. President Ramaphosa welcomed the United States' further commitment to improve bilateral trade and investment volumes, which will create much needed jobs and economic growth in South Africa. President Ramaphosa expressed South Africa's concerns about tariffs levied by the US on South African steel and aluminium products, which South Africa views as unfair and punitive. Just Energy Transition The leaders affirmed their commitment to the Just Energy Transition and agreed that South Africa will require more funding to achieve an effective and just transition that leaves no one behind and that protects workers and communities that would be affected by the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. The work on the investment plan for the Just Energy Transition Partnership between South Africa and the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and the European Union is expected to be completed by the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in November 2022 in Egypt. Regional stability and global security Global security and stability discussions focused on the insurgent attacks in Mozambique. President Ramaphosa acknowledged the assistance currently being provided by the US in responding to the insurgent threat in Mozambique. President Ramaphosa called for more US support in the provision of skills and resources to counter the terrorist activities that are causing great suffering in Mozambique and threaten the stability of the SADC region. Food Security in Africa Africa's food security featured prominently in the meeting with both Heads of State. 'Following on from the discussions at the G7 meeting held in Germany this year, there is consensus on supporting Africa's efforts towards fertiliser manufacturing, which will bolster Africa's independence in ensuring the continent's food security,' said President Ramaphosa. Malign Russian Activities Biil President Ramaphosa raised concern about the Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Bill, which is currently before the US Congress. President Ramaphosa said that if it becomes law, the Act would unfairly marginalise and punish African countries for exercising their sovereignty in their pursuit of development and economic growth. President Ramaphosa emphasised the need for an urgent end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and and emphasised the leadership role of the United Nations Secretary-General of Ant\'f3nio Guterres can provide in leading a peace process. Health and capacitation of health systems President Ramaphosa expressed appreciation for US support on health services capacitation and future pandemic preparedness. This includes the continued support for the PEPFAR programmes to combat HIV/Aids and Tuberculosis, and the support during the COVID-19 pandemic. President Ramaphosa applauded the leadership role played by President Biden in assisting developing economies to strengthen their health systems and for support on the WTO TRIPS waiver on vaccine manufacturing. United Nations Reforms and Multilateralism Africa's representation in key multilateral institutions was highlighted by President Ramaphosa. This includes the proposal for Africa's admission through the African Union (AU) into the Group of 20 countries (G20). 'The absence of representation of 1.3 billion people from Africa in the United Nations Security Council remains a blight in the global democratic order,' said President Ramaphosa. Both leaders agreed on the need for broader reforms of the United Nations. Building capacity of the State President Ramaphosa tabled a proposal for a partnership with the US in supporting South Africa's efforts to develop public servants, especially women. In this regard South Africa's National School of Government will work closely with leading American institutions in designing training programmes for South African public servants. Ahead of the meeting with President Biden, President Ramaphosa met with the United States Vice President Kamala Harris at her official residence, where they discussed women's empowerment, health and security, partnership on technology and space exploration.

When it comes to moral endorsements, having the Vatican's backing takes some beating. So the international campaign for a legally binding Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty took a huge step forward in July when Cardinal Michael Czerny, the prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, gave it his total support. "The planet already is 1.2\'b0C hotter (with respect to pre-industrial levels), yet new fossil fuel projects every day accelerate our race towards the precipice," the Czech-Canadian prelate said. "Enough is enough. All new exploration and production of coal, oil, and gas must immediately end, and existing production of fossil fuels must be urgently phased out. "This must be a just transition for impacted workers into environmentally sound alternatives. The proposed Fossil Fuel Nonproliferation Treaty holds great promise to complement and enhance the Paris Agreement". The name of the proposed treaty has a familiar ring as it is inspired by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) that came into force in 1970 and successfully helped reduce the threat of nuclear war. The supporters of the proposed treaty say that, like atomic bombs, fossil fuels pose an existential threat to humankind as they are the main cause of the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis. "Fossil fuels are responsible for 86% of carbon emissions in the past decade. So despite our efforts over the last 30 years, emissions have continued to increase, and this hasn't changed since the Paris Agreement was signed seven years ago". Under the Paris Agreement, the international community agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions to a degree necessary to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C, and, failing that, to keep them "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels. But Byrnes said that, as things currently stand, governments plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels consistent with limiting global temperature rises to within a 1.5-degree trajectory by 2030, and 10% more than their own climate pledges. So, she argued that a separate treaty specifically dealing with fossil fuels is needed to stop States from making empty pledges on climate policy. "We need both domestic action and international cooperation to explicitly stop the expansion of fossil fuel production and therefore emissions," she said. "Only addressing half of the equation has allowed countries and companies to claim climate leadership while also supporting new coal, oil and gas extraction projects, directly or indirectly. "In countries that are particularly dependent on fossil fuel profits for government revenue and economic development, fossil fuel supply is now a driver of demand. "It will not be possible to reduce demand for, and therefore emissions from, fossil fuels without first breaking this fossil-fuel lock-in through phase-out, economic diversification measures and finding new development opportunities. "A Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty will complement and implement the Paris Agreement by directly addressing the supply side of the equation and providing support to fossil-fuel-dependent developing countries to make this transition". One of the positive aspects of the treaty would be that it would help put an end to the perverse situation in which States are sometimes forced to pay compensation to polluters when they put a halt to fossil-fuel projects because of the protection that corporations enjoy under legal mechanisms such as the Energy Charter Treaty. "A Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty will mitigate the risk of legal liability faced by country governments in both national courts and international tribunals, by providing legal justification for phase-out policies," Byrnes said. Critics have suggested the plan is simply too ambitious to ever come to fruition. The treaty campaign might have the Vatican on its side, but the fossil-fuel lobby has powerful allies, lots of money and it has not been shy about using its clout to sow doubt about the climate crisis and stop or delay emissions cuts. "Some of the criticism we get on the idea of the treaty is that it's unfeasible and that we don't have time to negotiate something like this," said Byrnes. "The same was erroneously said about weapons treaties. "But we don't have time for more of the same. We know it's unlikely that oil-producing countries will enthusiastically embrace a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty and the fossil fuel industry has huge influence. "Just creating the concept of a treaty is already sparking new ambition and new conversations". Indeed, the treaty campaign is on a roll. It has the support of over 100 Nobel Laureates, including the Dalai Lama, and dozens of the world's biggest cities, such as London, Barcelona, Paris, Montreal, Lima, Buenos Aires and Los Angeles. In September the World Health Organization joined the host of international organizations backing the campaign. "The modern addiction to fossil fuels is not just an act of environmental vandalism. From the health perspective, it is an act of self-sabotage," said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Vanuatu became the first nation-state to call for a fossil fuel treaty in the speech made by President Nikenike Vurobaravu at this year's United Nations General Assembly. And on October 20 the European Parliament called on nation-states to "work on developing a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty" in a resolution outlining its demands for COP27 . "Today, we see oil and gas are fuelling war in Ukraine and elsewhere, and are a paramount danger that demands of us and world governments to rally behind a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty". It is possible to endorse the call for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty via the campaign's website. Furthermore, the Parents For Future Global network of climate parent groups has launched a letter that people can sign online to express their support. \</doc>

Just a few days ahead of the UN Climate Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt (6-18 November), new revelations show how far rich, industrialised countries -those who contribute most to the growing catastrophes- have been lying over their real contributions to climate finance. The True Value of Climate Finance Is a Third of What Developed Countries Report unveils that many rich countries are using "dishonest and misleading" accounting "to inflate" their climate finance contributions to developing countries - in 2020 by as much as 225%, according to investigations by Oxfam International. Inflating the figures The report estimates between just 21-24.5 billion US dollars as the "true value" of climate finance provided in 2020, against a reported figure of 68.3 billion US dollars in public finance that rich countries said was provided (alongside mobilised private finance bringing the total to 83.3 billion US dollars). Rich countries' contributions not only continue to fall miserably below their promised goal but are also very misleading in often counting the wrong things in the wrong way. They're overstating their own generosity by painting a rosy picture that obscures how much is really going to poor countries Nafkote Dabi, Oxfam International Climate Policy Lead The global climate finance target is supposed to be 100 billion US dollars a year, an amount which is slightly more than the 83 billion US dollars the world's biggest nuclear powers spent in one single year- 2021, on such weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, "the combined profits of the largest energy companies in the first quarter of this year are close to 100 billion US dollars," said already last august the UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, adding that it was "immoral" that major oil and gas companies are reporting "record profits", while prices soar. "Very misleading" Moreover, "rich countries' contributions not only continue to fall miserably below their promised goal but are also very misleading in often counting the wrong things in the wrong way. They're overstating their own generosity by painting a rosy picture that obscures how much is really going to poor countries," said Nafkote Dabi, Oxfam International Climate Policy Lead. Mostly loans "Our global climate finance is a broken train: drastically flawed and putting us at risk of reaching a catastrophic destination. There are too many loans indebting poor countries that are already struggling to cope with climatic shocks." There is too much "dishonest" and "shady" reporting. The result is the most vulnerable countries remain ill-prepared to face the wrath of the climate crisis, warned Dabi. Rich countries' "manipulation" Oxfam research found that instruments such as loans are being reported at face value, ignoring repayments and other factors. Too often funded projects have less climate focus than reported, making the net value of support specifically aiming at climate action significantly lower than actual reported climate finance figures. Currently, loans are dominating over 70% provision (48.6 billion US dollars) of public climate finance, adding to the debt crisis across developing countries. "To force poor countries to repay a loan to cope with a climate crisis they hardly caused is profoundly unfair. Instead of supporting countries that are facing worsening droughts, cyclones and flooding, rich countries are crippling their ability to cope with the next shock and deepening their poverty." Least Developed Countries' external debt repayments reached 31 billion US dollars in 2020. Such 'funding' is primarily based on loans "A climate finance system that is primarily based on loans is only worsening the problem. Rich nations, especially the heaviest-polluting ones," said Dabi. A key way to prevent a full-scale climate catastrophe is for developed nations to fulfil their 100 billion US dollars commitments and genuinely address the current climate financing accounting holes. "Manipulating the system will only mean poor nations, least responsible for the climate crisis, footing the climate bill," said Dabi. Stalling all efforts Other findings by this global confederation which includes 21 member organisations and affiliates reveal that an average of 189 million people per year have been affected by extreme weather-related events in developing countries since 1991 - the year that a mechanism was first proposed to address the costs of climate impacts on low-income countries. The report, The Cost of Delay, by the Loss and Damage Collaboration - a group of more than 100 researchers, activists, and policymakers from around the globe - highlights how rich countries have repeatedly stalled efforts to provide dedicated finance to developing countries bearing the costs of a climate crisis they did little to cause. Six fossil fuel companies "Analysis shows that in the first half of 2022 six fossil fuel companies combined made enough money to cover the cost of major extreme weather and climate-related events in developing countries and still have nearly $70 billion profit remaining." The report reveals that 55 of the most climate-vulnerable countries have suffered climate-induced economic losses totalling over half a trillion dollars during the first two decades of this century as fossil fuel profits rocket, leaving people in some of the poorest places on earth to foot the bill. Super profits. And massive deaths It also reveals that the fossil fuel industry made enough super-profit between 2000 and 2019 to cover the costs of climate-induced economic losses in 55 of the most climate-vulnerable countries, almost sixty times over. The report estimates that since 1991, developing countries have experienced 79% of recorded deaths and 97% of the total recorded number of people affected by the impacts of weather extremes. The analysis also shows that the number of extreme weather and climate-related events that developing countries experience has more than doubled over that period with over 676,000 people killed. The entire continent of Africa produces less than 4% of global emissions and the African Development Bank reported recently the continent was losing between five and 15% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita growth because of climate change. Enormous gains Lyndsay Walsh, Oxfam's Climate policy adviser and co-author of the report said: "It is an injustice that polluters who are disproportionately responsible for the escalating greenhouse gas emissions continue to reap these enormous profits while climate-vulnerable countries are left to foot the bill for the climate impacts destroying people's lives, homes and jobs." Meanwhile, in addition to manipulating the figures and further indebting the poor, business continues as usual. The largest polluters-the fossil fuels private companies make more and more profits, and rich countries' politicians are set to increase their subsidies to these fuels to nearly seven trillion by 2025.

President Ramaphosa discusses climate, energy and health at G7 Leaders' Summit President Cyril Ramaphosa has concluded a successful visit to the Federal Republic of Germany, where he attended the G7 Leaders' Summit, at the invitation of the German Chancellor H.E Mr Olaf Scholz. Together with leaders of G7 countries, invited Heads of State and Government from Argentina, India, Indonesia, as well as the African Union Chairperson, European Union President and leaders of other International Organisations, President Ramaphosa participated in working sessions where Climate, Energy , Health as well Global Food Security and Gender Equality were discussed. In these discussions, President Ramaphosa highlighted concerns regarding the absence of equity and transparency in the availability of vaccines for African countries, which has been sharply exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He urged the international community to work together towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response. In this regard, President Ramaphosa pointed out that the financing gap for the ACT Accelerator, which currently stands at more than USD 16 billion for 2022 needs to be narrowed , among other issues. On energy, President Ramaphosa cautioned against adverse ramifications of the proposed revision of the European Union Renewable Energy Directive, which is intended to accelerate green hydrogen investments. The President highlighted that the proposed regulations have the potential to limit the ability of enterprises to supply key export industries with sustainable energy solutions and impact their global competitiveness. Abrupt disinvestment from fossil fuels by international financiers poses a great risk to Africa because of the impact on jobs, stranded assets, national economies, energy and food security,' said President Ramaphosa. President Ramaphosa urged that all climate related actions should find expression within the context of both the right to development and a just transition. He emphasised the need for a just transition that is well resourced to enable the move to a low carbon economy that is phased and planned. 'A transition that catalyses new economic opportunities, while protecting affected workers and communities', the President said. To a greater extent, the President expressed that South Africa is pleased with the progress that has been made in advancing the long-term collaboration under the groundbreaking Just Energy Transition Partnership. COP27 that delivers far more significant outcomes with regards to means of implementation support, adaptation and addressing loss and damage caused by climate change. President Ramaphosa discussed issues of food security, fuel supply and increasing local production on items that are currently in low supply due to the conflict in Ukraine. He expressed the need to enhance the resilience of food and agricultural production systems through adaptation, reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and safeguarding national food security. He then further made a special proposal that developing countries on the African continent, working together with the G7 countries, should be self-reliant in the production of fertilizers to ensure food security. President Ramaphosa reiterated South Africa's commitment to working with the international community, including the G7 countries, in the collective quest to end global hunger. 'We also remain committed to forging the necessary partnerships with business, academia, the scientific community and our development partners to build agricultural resilience and increase production and thereby lift millions out of dire poverty. This includes the urgent consideration and support to the proposal of capacitating the African continent to be self sufficient on the production of fertilisers to enhance food security ,' said President Ramaphosa. Furthermore, the President shared South Africa's commitments and interventions on advancing Gender Equality, mentioning the public employment programme in which 62 per cent of participants are women. As well as the promotion of women's financial inclusion through a national policy that calls for 40 per cent of all public procurement to go to women-owned businesses and South Africa's successful chairing of the 66th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. On the margins of the Summit, the President met with several Heads of State and Government, including the Prime Minister of Japan and the German Chancellor. He also met the Prime Minister of India, H.E Narendra Modi. The leaders discussed cooperation between the two countries in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic which resulted in the World Trade Organisation's acceptance of the TRIPS Waiver. They also discussed the enhancement of trade relations and commitment in multilateralism and BRICS cooperation. President Ramaphosa also met Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, H.E Boris Johnson. The leaders discussed their commitment to the speedy resolution of the Russsia-Ukraine conflict and further enhancement of bilateral trade relations. They also discussed opportunities in Green Hydrogen and Fuel Cells. He further had discussions with the African Union Chairperson, President Macky Sall of Senegal, who shared a report from his his recent trip to Russia.

ON APRIL 10, I received a frantic call from an out-of-town colleague. She wanted to know if I was safe, as our attractive small Wild Coast town of Port St Johns and surrounding villages were under water after days of heavy rains. In 2020, just two years earlier, extreme heat had dried the natural water sources and agricultural land. We survived by buying water in drum containers for R250 to last our households for seven days. Yet in April this year, water was gushing out of hill slopes, collapsing more than 30 houses and damaging private property and public infrastructure. KwaNonyevu, Greens Farm, and Mthumbane villages were among those hardest hit and were full of panic-stricken relatives and neighbours. We did what we could for three frantic days to help one another before the uMzimvubu River overflowed. While we thought we would manage, floodwaters consumed more areas on a scale never witnessed before. The dumping of solid waste and proliferation of alien invasive plants have radically increased our vulnerability to climate change, both because of how they have caused the water channels to recede and how they can overflow when the rains are heavy, exacerbating floods. Over the years, our arable land has become less productive, as drainage systems have poisoned our soil with effluent and other contaminants such as disposable nappies dumped upstream. I have watched as changing climate conditions have challenged villagers. Like almost everyone in the village, my family\' s cattle herd has also shrunk dramatically throughout my lifetime. Climate change is the direct cause of this wealth deterioration: our polluted, drying, and eroding land cannot sustain as many animals as it used to. When this happens, local communities have fewer options as to which plants to cultivate. Because of increasing crop failure during droughts and floods, there is food insecurity and increased reliance on government social grants. I told my story to more than 60 community activists attending the week-long Rural Action for Climate Resilience learning festival in Cape Town, convened to empower communities with climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. As I listened to the stories of other participants, I realised that millions of people were already battling for survival. No society has been left unscathed by more frequent and intense droughts, wildfires, storms and floods resulting from three factors, all caused by humans. First, global warming has caused the seas to rise. Second, South Africa\' s heavy reliance on fossil fuels mined on land and offshore results in carbon emissions and the destruction of the environment. Third, the rapid destruction of indigenous vegetation and land pollution have negatively altered the flow of fresh water, exposing the land to rapid degradation. My country needs to abandon its excessive consumption approach to natural resources and speed up the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, lest our ecological and economic situation becomes even more tenuous. The UN Climate Change Conference \- to be held at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18 \- must develop approaches to mitigation and adaptation based on justice and equity reflective of local community realities. COP27 represents a unique and timely opportunity for the world\' s citizens to come together, recognise our common interests and restore multilateral co-operation underpinned by grassroots concerns about implementing a just transition and the often overlooked needs of local communities. My country must demystify myths regarding what is in the best interests of local communities in line with our constitutional rights to the environment, and face the concerns of Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe. He said at the Africa Energy Week in Cape Town on October 18 that developed economies offering energy transition finance to African economies were using them as  guinea pigs on which to perform energy experiments. Local communities call for meaningful engagement in climate change negotiations and decision-making of small-scale food producers and indigenous communities, including women and the youth. An inclusive approach should also ensure the recognition of community voices rejecting false solutions that threaten land productivity, and universal access to seeds through the imposition by multinational corporations of an artificially created increase on the reliance of global agrochemical corporations. We must be concerned about the South African government seemingly wavering in its commitment to switch to green energy. Some examples are its retrogressive issuing of licences to mine on the Wild Coast and the West Coast, and its repeated calls for investment in fossil fuel infrastructure. It is hard to believe politicians who insist that their worrisome stop-gap measures necessitated by immediate energy supply problems should not be mistaken for long-term strategies. Yet their stubborn promotion of oil and gas mining along our coastal waters and their intentions to enter into a 20-year agreement with Turkish company Karpowership, cast doubt on the sincerity of their commitment to embark on a greener road ahead. We must be concerned about the worrying signs at national and international levels that governments and businesses are not making the changes needed to avert catastrophe, at least not fast enough. As citizens in the developing world, we are increasingly frustrated with rich countries\' refusal to pay their fair share for a crisis for which they bear overwhelming responsibility. To date, a disproportionate share of climate finance has been directed towards mitigation, leaving us in developing countries largely to fend for ourselves in financing adaptation investment. But even the finance provided for mitigation is insufficient and has not been delivered with the appropriate instruments; hence civil society calls for transparency and accountability. Before leaving Port St Johns to attend the festival, I first packed my clothes and important documents safely as I feared that I would be at the mercy of floodwaters should unpredictable heavy rains fall. I was surprised to learn that others at the festival had taken similar precautions. This experience showed me that we all struggle with the same forces, from the Wild Coast to the West Coast  My local community is connected to yours, wherever you read these words.

We are in the toughest period the world economy has faced since the creation of the multilateral system more than three-quarters of a century ago. A quadruple shock of COVID, climate change, conflict and cost-of-living has undone years of hard-fought development gains. As financial conditions tighten, even countries that had seemed on track to prosperity and stability now stare into the abyss of debt distress, fragility and uncertainty about the future. Coordinated, multilateral action is necessary to tackle the crises we face. Both aid and trade have key roles to play in reversing the impacts of this quadruple shock and putting the world back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We head the three international agencies that comprise the Geneva trade hub - the World Trade Organization (WTO), UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Trade Centre (ITC). The WTO makes and monitors the rules for global trade. UNCTAD delivers research and consensus-building to guide governments. ITC helps small business go global, especially firms led by women and young entrepreneurs. We work together so that trade works better for development. All three of us share a deep commitment to trade-led prosperity. All three of us understand that a world in crisis means no more business as usual. And all three of us want our organizations to "walk the talk" on making aid and trade deliver for real people. To guide aid and trade towards a better world, policymakers need to pivot in three fundamental ways. First, make trade greener. Global trade can play an important role in a transition to a low-carbon economy. Preliminary research at the WTO suggests that removing tariffs and regulatory trade barriers for a set of energy-related environmental goods would reduce global CO2 emissions by 0.6% in 2030 just from improved energy efficiency, with additional potential gains from innovation spillovers and as lower prices accelerate the shift towards renewable energy and less carbon-intensive products. Second, make trade more inclusive. Promoting greater trade by small businesses and greater participation by women and youth make companies and countries more competitive, drives economic transformation and reduces poverty. Yet ITC business surveys found that one only out of every five exporting companies is women-led. WTO data show that micro, small and medium-sized firms represent around 95 percent of all companies globally but only one-third of total exports. Third, make trade more connected. In our networked world, the future of trade is through digital channels and platforms, especially for small businesses. During the pandemic, we saw how doing business online went from being useful to critical for survival. UNCTAD data shows that digitally delivered services reached almost two-thirds the level of global services exports. These themes were discussed at the Global Review of Aid-for-Trade, which took place 27-29th July in Geneva. The event took place one month after the WTO's successful Twelfth Ministerial Conference, which put trade multilateralism back on track and delivered a landmark agreement on fisheries subsidies, and two months before the COP27 meeting in Egypt (November 6-18) that could determine the world's chances to keep the 1.5C target alive. The data shows promising signs that aid-for-trade is tilting towards greater sustainability, inclusivity and connectivity. OECD and WTO data reveal a record high of nearly US$50 billion in aid for trade disbursements in 2020, of which half were either climate or gender related, and one-third supported the digital economy. Despite growing budgetary pressures at home, it is critically important to continue and increase these aid-for-trade flows. Apart from a stronger thematic focus on sustainability, inclusivity and connectivity, maximizing the contribution of aid for trade to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires a resolute focus on the "where" and "how" of delivering development results. This means a focus on those countries whose trade and development needs are highest - particularly Least Developed Countries and fragile/conflict-affected countries - and regional initiatives like African Continental Free Trade Area, to ensure they become stepping-stones to wider and more inclusive regional value chains and trade-led growth. It means partnership across international organizations. The WTO, UNCTAD, and ITC already collaborate on initiatives like the Global Trade Helpdesk, which simplifies market research by bringing key trade and business information into a single portal, as well as on support to cotton-exporting countries in Africa. Last but certainly not least, it means mobilizing public and private finance. The IFC estimates a worldwide US$300 billion financing gap for women, and the global trade finance gap has nearly doubled from an already-staggering $1.5 trillion. Without access to finance, firms cannot grow, diversify or formalize. We want to end with a call to action. Creating a more sustainable, inclusive and connected future is the moon shot of our times. Aid, trade and multilateralism - working together - are part of the solution. It is normal and understandable that governments act to shore up their own economies in troubled times. But we must act now to ensure that the world's poorest and most vulnerable can still see a pathway to prosperity through global trade.

MEDIUM-TERM BUDGETEskom debt Godongwana's biggest poser in bid for sustained recovery Liberalisation, freeing of labour market, technological change and structural reform could catalyse growthIf the saying "desperate times call for desperate measures" is true, it must also be true that tough times call for bold, courageous and creative measures - exactly what is needed from Wednesday's medium-term budget policy statement. Finance minister Enoch Godongwana should address the poor economic outlook. Investment in emerging markets is about the balance between growth and risk. Without growth there is only risk. This is the real challenge SA faces, in which progrowth (political) rhetoric does not translate into substantive economic progress. Fortunately, it is one the minister has an opportunity to address. The headwinds facing the global economic outlook are rising, a fact confirmed by the IMF, which has reduced its 2022 GDP growth forecast for SA to 2.1% from the 2.3% forecast in July. And for next year GDP growth is expected to slow to 1.1% from the July forecast of 1.4%. SA's growth outlook is among the weakest of all emerging markets. This weaker outlook reflects load-shedding, policy implementation inertia, slower trading partner growth, tighter financial and monetary conditions and a negative shift in the commodity terms of trade. SA's structural unemployment is tragically a constant cause for concern, with the IMF expecting the unemployment rate to rise to 34.6% this year from 34.2% last year, and to rise to 35.6% next year. If the government is serious about driving growth it should start thinking, and acting, outside its ideological boxes. Liberalisation, freeing of the labour market, embracing foreign and local talent, structural reform, embracing rather than blocking technological change, and a renewed push towards regional integration could catalyse growth. The market trust the Treasury already enjoys will underpin this. President Cyril Ramaphosa's energy plan, announced earlier this year, offered hope for a resolution of SA's short- to medium-term energy supply challenges. The plan includes new agreements with neighbouring countries for the import of electricity and enlisting independent power producers to plug gaps in the grid. It also aims to encourage households to go solar and sell excess power to the grid. Little further detail on the plan has been made available, with even fewer details on its implementation. The budget policy statement is a good opportunity to spell out the intricacies of the plan. COST OF LIVING CRISIS Eskom's debt is the biggest issue the minister must address. Publicly available information suggests the power utility's debt servicing costs exceed its operating profit, a clearly unsustainable scenario. The government needs to address the matter in a way that frees cash flow for Eskom to address its immediate operational challenges. The cost-of-living crisis is caused by rising energy, food and fuel prices, which come amid rising interest rates and less income for households, according to the Quarterly Employment Survey. Of the 3-million jobs that were lost due to the national Covid-19 lockdowns, only some have been recovered. When the pandemic struck two years ago, the government responded with a R500bn stimulus package, R70bn of which was in tax measures. A case can be made to again introduce tax measures to offer consumers relief. One of the ways to do this is to extend the social relief of distress (SRD) grant beyond March next year, with the view to making it permanent. The government's own research shows that the fiscus can afford this. It would offer some relief in these tough times. Recently described by one business leader as being "glacial" in pace, one of the most puzzling, frustrating and frankly disappointing aspects of SA's economic performance has been the lack of adequate infrastructure spending. Despite launching the Sustainable Infrastructure Development Symposium and gazetting R320bn worth of infrastructure projects in July 2020, very little has happened by way of implementation, and therefore spending. Infrastructure spending has shielded the economy from the worst effects of previous economic crises and can again help carry SA through the current or pending downturn. However, actual spending, not just planning, is required for this to happen. JUST TRANSITION It will be interesting to see how healthcare spending is being calibrated away from the response to the Covid-19 pandemic to responding to other health emergencies such as HIV/Aids and TB, as well as SA's burden of disease, including trauma and lifestyle diseases. Implementation of the National Health Insurance (NHI), hastened by the pandemic, could also be important. During November in Egypt, where much of the world will gather for the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), SA has to present a framework of how it intends to spend the $8.5bn aimed at achieving a just transition that was pledged at COP26. Though the work is carried out through the presidential climate finance task team and a framework approved by cabinet, the budget policy statement seems like a good opportunity to show the government's thinking, considering the transition must be in an economy that was built on coal. It is time for a proper recovery. Fourteen years ago this month, former finance minister Trevor Manuel returned from the IMF to report a coming storm in the global economy. The market jitters that had been present since 2007 culminated in the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, sparking the global financial crisis. Manuel used the room created by SA's healthy public finances and good banking regulation to maintain infrastructure spend, boost public confidence and shield the economy from the worst of the great recession. It is now time for a proper and sustained recovery, and the medium-term budget policy statement is a good place to start. The authors are with Deloitte Africa. \</doc>

Kinshasa: Climate activists protested in the Democratic Republic of Congo\' s capital Kinshasa on Friday, ahead of a climate summit in the city next month. Kinshasa is due to host the pre- COP27 talks next month, before the main summit begins in Egypt in November. But the pre- COP27 meeting comes after the DRC put 27 oil and gas blocks up for auction in July, ignoring warnings from environmentalists that drilling in peatlands and forests could release huge volumes of carbon dioxide. On Friday, about 200 protesters marched in Kinshasa toting banners bearing slogans such as  No to new fossil fuels . | \</doc>

End reliance on global supply chains SA could become an African distribution hub by making more foreign goods under licence BOTTOM LINE Should it be a cause for celebration that the IMF marginally upgraded its 2022 GDP forecast for SA? As the global outlook continues to look gloomy, particularly in Europe, a renewed interest in emerging markets, driven in part by higher commodity prices, could bode well for SA's growth outlook. While the outlook has improved moderately, it is still expected to be worse than most African peers. According to the IMF Regional Economic Outlook, African economies are forecast to expand 3.8% in 2022 and 4% in 2023, while SA's figures could be 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively. SA is plagued by energy insecurity and high energy costs; environmental unsustainability; and socioeconomic challenges. Foreign direct investment would represent welcome relief to the above crises, but the question is whether this would be enough. One of the clear consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war is how evidently dependent SA is on market dynamics, especially supply chains and the financial health of developed economies. The high-inflation, high-interest environment has placed unprecedented pressure on domestic consumers. Inflationary pressures, driven largely by higher energy costs, are also influenced by depressed Chinese growth. SA is not immune to such global economic contagion and now requires intensive economic care before it can be fit enough to grow independently and consistently. Stats SA's consumer price index reports show that inflation broke through the upper limit of the Reserve Bank's target range in May and has since remained above that level. Food and nonalcoholic beverage prices have become inflated, with an increase of 11.3% year on year in August. To illustrate how dramatic the effect has been, the KwaZulu-Natal household affordability index recently indicated that the price of a basket of groceries comprising commonly purchased products has increased almost 14% over the past year. This economic fever needs to be reduced to within a manageable pain threshold. In the private sector, there has been a strong trend for SA companies to localise their manufacturing and take greater control of their value chains. The adverse effects of SA Inc's dependence on global supply chains were highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The strain on businesses and households was worsened by the Russian-Ukraine conflict breaking out in early 2022, forcing SA importers to source alternative raw materials, manufacturing capacity and logistics supply lines without disrupting their operational sustainability. From a geopolitical perspective, SA Inc needs to fast-track its programme to end its reliance on global supply chains. This is particularly so in light of the pervading energy crisis in primarily the developed world, including its overdependence on goods manufactured in Asia, especially China as the world's factory. Of course, localisation should not mean isolationism or protectionism. SA's economy can only thrive through robust participation in global and regional markets. As such the country could fabricate, assemble and manufacture more foreign goods under licence to serve as the world's African value-added distribution hub. However, to ensure that we derive greater economic benefit from participation in such global value chains SA urgently needs to overhaul its dysfunctional infrastructure, including electricity, port, pipeline, rail, road and aviation corridors locally and into the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. Any supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and unfortunately SA's industrial capacity is beset by multiple weak points, notably transport congestion, social instability, and above all an unreliable energy supply. In this context, a strong focus on revitalising SA's infrastructure presents an excellent opportunity to boost the economy now that it is needed most, but only if we make a concerted effort to attract such countercyclical investments. Given the scope and scale of our infrastructure requirements, we need to attract the kind of foreign direct investment at a scale and pace that makes a big difference to our capacity to effectively service local, regional and global markets. Economist Mike Schussler wrote shortly before his death that local manufacturing production levels between May and July 2021 were lower than in 2005. SA's share of global manufacturing by value had declined since the 1980s, whereas the median increase for countries with only a decade-old manufacturing history was 15.5%. This represents an astonishing opportunity for SA. We need to urgently reduce our reliance on imports to redress SA's trade imbalance. Coupled with this, the state and private sector need to invest heavily in local skills and supplier and enterprise development programmes, and commercialise locally researched and developed technology-based solutions that could be integrated with those of our foreign trading partners. A successful localisation programme depends on extensive investment in production of our natural endowments, the assembly and manufacturing of value-added goods and the capacity of critical infrastructure. For SA to realise its potential as a leading pan-African producer and the world's African distribution hub, it must set itself free from being overdependent on developed economies by forging more interdependent, mutually beneficial relationships with its trading partners. By prioritising local assembly, fabrication and manufacturing for at least local and pan-African markets in collaboration with the suppliers of otherwise foreign-manufactured goods, SA will go some way in solving its unemployment, poverty and inequality challenges, while also mitigating the risk of global supply chain disruptions to the mutual benefit of foreign exporters to Africa. The COP27 It is common cause, also from World Bank studies, that decarbonisation costs in the global north - estimated to be greater than $100/kg of CO2 equivalent - are higher than in the global south, which are less than $10/kg CO2 equivalent. Therefore, investments in decarbonisation projects in SA, including any and all greenhouse gas emissions reduction projects and the enabling infrastructure, would realise a saving for the global north. SA has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to share in such savings to finance cleaner and more inclusive economic growth. Morkel is chair of the SA Oil & Gas Alliance. \</doc>

LEADERS' MEETING Commonwealth set to discuss Ukraine Ukraine looks set to feature in the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, while Rwanda's "interference" in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is not on the agenda discussed by officials ahead of the meeting. There has been talk of President Volodymyr Zelensky addressing the high-level component of the summit that will be attended by heads of state and government, scheduled to take place on Friday and Saturday. But some countries are objecting, arguing that only conflicts that directly involve member states are sanctioned to be discussed at such summits. A number of African countries that are also members of the Commonwealth have remained neutral in two votes on the Ukraine crisis. Canada is one of the countries said to have been lobbying for Ukraine to be on the agenda. In a media statement last week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would "advance collaboration on continuing to hold Russia accountable for its unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in turn, paid a second visit to Zelensky on Friday to express his support and to announce a training programme for Ukrainian forces. Meanwhile, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi has called on international leaders to support his country, saying: "We have the right to demand that our neighbours respect our territory." The DRC has accused Rwanda of supporting M23 fighters who have occupied the city of Bunagana near the border with Rwanda, but Rwanda has denied these claims. On Friday, a Congolese soldier was killed by Rwandan soldiers after he reportedly crossed the border and started shooting. Tshisekedi also expressed his hope that Johnson would be able to "leverage his influence" on Rwanda over the border issues since the UK had recently paid millions of pounds to Rwanda to host its illegal immigrants claiming refugee status. The first of these asylum seekers were supposed to have arrived in the country last week, but their flight was halted after the European Court of Human Rights intervened. Amnesty International's Deprose Muchena last week urged Commonwealth leaders to take a "firm and clear stand" against what it said was the UK's "racist and disgraceful asylum seeker deal with Rwanda". He also said the UK government was "shirking its interna-tional responsibility under the Refugee Convention to protect people in need of asylum". Prince Charles, an outspoken critic of the new policy, is also set to attend this week's meeting to represent Queen Elizabeth as the head of the Commonwealth. This could yield some awkward moments with Johnson and Rwanda President Paul Kagame. An official said Ukraine, the DRC and the Rwanda refugee issues were not on the official agenda, but Ukraine's ambassador to SA, Liubov Abravitova, said a speech by Zelensky to the Commonwealth meeting was planned. President Cyril Ramaphosa is this week set to focus instead on issues such as the Brics summit, to be hosted remotely by China on Thursday, and on addressing the ANC Gauteng conference that starts on Friday, his spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, said. The Commonwealth meeting was meant to have taken place in 2020, but was twice postponed until this year because of Covid-19 lockdown measures. Climate change features prominently on the agenda ahead of the COP 27 gathering in Egypt at the end of the year. Economic development, fashion, extremism and opportunities for young people will also be on the agenda. The meeting starts with a women's forum on Sunday, while Wednesday and Thursday have been set aside for ministerial meetings. It is the first time a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will be hosted and chaired by a country that has not traditionally been part of the Commonwealth. Rwanda joined in 2009. \</doc>

ON THE SPOT Energy transition 'will be rapid, disruptive and expensive' The Energy Council of SA was founded by business in 2021 in agreement with the government to play a leading role in the energy sector in support of a sustainable energy transition for the country. The council appointed James Mackay in October as its first CEO. Mackay is an industry veteran and the former head of energy for PwC. He spoke to Denene Erasmus about what the council's role will be in SA's fast-unfolding energy transition. Why was the Energy Council of SA established and what do you want to achieve? Delivering a successful energy transition over the next 10 to 30 years is fundamental to meeting our global climate change contributions, as well as to the future of our economy, and must include energy affordability, security and sustainability. With this in mind, there was a call from the government that recognised the need for unity within the sector and more cohesiveness around business action towards the energy transition. The Energy Council was established to play a leadership role in unifying the voice of business and meaningfully supporting the national energy vision and pathway to net-zero. The council is inclusive and aims to be broadly representative of the energy sector. The founding members, and this is quite unique about the Energy Council, includes private and public sector business, as the Central Energy Fund, the Industrial Development Corporation of SA and Eskom are founding members and on the board. Private founding members were Sasol, Anglo American, Exxaro, TotalEnergies, Toyota and the automotive industry association Naamsa. Part of our role will be to encourage investment across the energy sector. We are now expanding the membership base to include the banking sector, other industrials, and we are also seeing a lot of interest from the renewables sector. What are the broad implications of the energy transition for SA and its economy? The energy transition is the most difficult and expensive transition that the world will ever have to go through. Historically, transitions were commercial, technology driven, which took many decades to achieve. But because of the existential threat of climate change we must achieve the transition away from fossil fuel-based energy sources to cleaner, renewable sources in record time. We have made a commitment as a country to transition to net-zero by 2050. This is in our legislation. We have to do it. It is convenient to frame this as a long-term, gradual transition of us moving towards a low-carbon economy by 2050, but the commercial and economic reality is that we must have our net-zero platforms in place by 2030 to stay relevant in global trade, especially in trade blocks such as the EU and UK who are rapidly transitioning and implementing emissions taxes on imports. Our committed global obligations, the Nationally Determined Contributions [NDCs] under the Paris Agreement, is a 30% reduction in emissions by 2030. SA is one of the most emissions-intensive economies and most coal-dependent countries in the world, which means that our energy transition journey is going to be very challenging as we have to invest in a significant scale of new renewable energy, as well as bearing the cost of decommissioning significant fossil fuel energy at record pace. This is ultimately a system and society transition that will require levels of investment that will likely be unaffordable, without innovative models and international support. What is the risk of SA not meeting its 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction target? If we do not stay within our NDC commitments, and if we don't have those net-zero platforms in place by 2030, we will increasingly get shut out of global trade. With over 40% of our exports directly exposed to the EU's new carbon pricing framework to prevent the risk of carbon leakage by importing from high-emitting countries, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, industries such as our petrochemical, pulp and paper, automotives, metals, ferroalloys and other export trade will have to be able to very clearly demonstrate that they are able to operate within emissions reduction targets as they progress towards net-zero by 2050. What is your main focus now? Is it planning for the energy transition or finding solutions to the immediate supply of energy crisis? The short answer is both because it is the same pathway. Energy security and stability is an immediate need of our economy, as well as business, which needs the confidence to invest in growth and new technologies. Over the longer term, we need a clear transition strategy and implementation pathways, including the changing role of government and policy reform. This will create the certainty for investment, growth, sustainability and ultimately equality and prosperity for all citizens. One of the key messages we are driving from the Energy Council is that the energy transition is not going to be gradual. There is a long-term vision of how we mature to net-zero by 2050, but the transition platforms for that journey must be in place by 2030 and that is going to be rapid, it is going to very disruptive and very expensive. We really need to form an understanding very quickly around how we can effectively spend towards achieving the transition. We also need to make sure we have the right policy pathways in place to create business confidence because the private sector will need to make the majority of the investment needed to achieve the transition and we need to ensure that we are factoring in what is socially just as we move along that pathway. SA launched its R1.4-trillion Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) at COP27 in Egypt in November. Does the plan focus on the right actions to take the country forward in the transition? It is a great step in the right direction. If we look at the investment plan and at the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) between SA and its partners (the US, UK, EU, France and Germany) that was announced at COP26 in Scotland last year, and from which the JET-IP flowed, this really is an internationally leading and recognised initiative by SA. Having said that, the JET-IP doesn't adequately cover where we need to get to. The energy transition is not just an asset replacement programme and the JET-IP was built on three asset pillars: decarbonisation by shutting down coal-fired power stations; establishing a green hydrogen sector; and the transition in the automotive industry to manufacturing electric vehicles. Over and above this asset replacement drive, the energy transition will fundamentally change the way economies and societies behave. It is a systems transition, and we will have to go into a very liberalised market that will be decentralised and digitised, which means the role of the government must change and we will see an unbundling of state-owned entities. What the JET-IP does not address is the huge amount of work that will have to go into creating the type of integration needed at a systems and governance level to make a sustainable transition at a country level. erasmusd@businesslive.co.za \</doc>

A joint task force on trade and investment is to be established to expand bilateral economic ties between South Africa and the United States. The formation of the task force follows on the conclusion of President Cyril Ramaphosa's official working visit to the US. The visit was at the invitation of President Joseph Biden. This comes as there was an agreement on the need to create a more attractive environment for American companies to invest in South Africa, where an estimated 600 US companies are already doing business in a range of sectors. 'A joint task force on trade and investment will be established to expand bilateral economic ties,' said the Presidency in a statement on Saturday. In addition, South Africa will host the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum in 2023, which will map the next phase of Africa-US trade. 'President Ramaphosa welcomed the United States' further commitment to improve bilateral trade and investment volumes, which will create much needed jobs and economic growth in South Africa,' said the Presidency adding that the President has expressed concerns about tariffs levied by the US on South African steel and aluminium products, which South Africa views as unfair and punitive. President Ramaphosa departed the country for the US on Wednesday and met with President Biden at the White House on Friday to discuss bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest. Energy The Just Energy Transition also formed part deliberations. 'The leaders affirmed their commitment to the Just Energy Transition and agreed that South Africa will require more funding to achieve an effective and just transition that leaves no one behind and that protects workers and communities that would be affected by the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.' The work on the investment plan for the Just Energy Transition Partnership between South Africa and the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and the European Union is expected to be completed by the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in November 2022 in Egypt. Stability and global security Discussions on global security and stability focused on the insurgent attacks in Mozambique. President Ramaphosa acknowledged the assistance currently being provided by the US in responding to the insurgent threat in Mozambique. President Ramaphosa called for more US support in the provision of skills and resources to counter the terrorist activities that are causing great suffering in Mozambique and threaten the stability of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. Food security Africa's food security also featured prominently in the meeting with both Heads of State. 'Following on from the discussions at the G7 meeting held in Germany this year, there is consensus on supporting Africa's efforts towards fertiliser manufacturing, which will bolster Africa's independence in ensuring the continent's food security,' said President Ramaphosa. Malign Russian Activities Bill President Ramaphosa raised concern about the Countering Malign Russian Activities in Africa Bill, which is currently before the US Congress. If it becomes law said President Ramaphosa, the Act would unfairly marginalise and punish African countries for exercising their sovereignty in their pursuit of development and economic growth. The President also emphasised the need for an urgent end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and and emphasised the leadership role of the United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres can provide in leading a peace process. Health systems Meanwhile, President Ramaphosa expressed appreciation for US support on health services capacitation and future pandemic preparedness. This includes the continued support for the PEPFAR [President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief] programmes to combat HIV/Aids and Tuberculosis, and the support during the COVID-19 pandemic. President Ramaphosa applauded the leadership role played by President Biden in assisting developing economies to strengthen their health systems and for support on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver on vaccine manufacturing. UN reforms Africa's representation in key multilateral institutions was highlighted by President Ramaphosa. This includes the proposal for Africa's admission through the African Union (AU) into the Group of 20 countries (G20). Building capacity of the state President Ramaphosa tabled a proposal for a partnership with the US in supporting South Africa's efforts to develop public servants, especially women. 'In this regard, South Africa's National School of Government will work closely with leading American institutions in designing training programmes for South African public servants.' Ahead of the meeting with President Biden, President Ramaphosa met with the United States Vice President Kamala Harris at her official residence, where they discussed women's empowerment, health and security, partnership on technology and space exploration. -SAnews.gov.za \</doc>

FINANCING Loans related to climate may whet state appetite for more One rich country diplomat tells how when he arrived in SA in 2019 and suggested that his country's development finance arm might be keen to make some cheap finance available to the government to support its energy transition plans, he was quite firmly rebuffed. "Didn't your predecessor brief you that the SA sovereign doesn't borrow from international financial institutions?" he was asked. SA has come a long way since. The Covid-19 pandemic combined with the climate imperative to drive a policy shift which proved to be more fundamental than was evident in mid-2020, when the government reversed its 25-year-old decision not to borrow from international financial institutions and raised a $4.3bn loan from the IMF. It was the depths of the Covid-19 crisis. The government had to raise a huge amount of money to fund a spiralling deficit at a time when financial markets were making it hugely expensive to do so. The IMF and other international institutions were making hundreds of billions of dollars available at below-market rates to help countries through the crisis and its aftermath. SA would have been rash not to take advantage. Since then the government has raised more than $8.7bn (R145bn) of loans from the IMF, New Development (Brics) Bank, African Development Bank and World Bank. The loans are for up to 30 years at rates well below what SA would have to pay on the market for such long-term finance, and they come with three to five-year grace periods. The Treasury said in February it planned to borrow $11bn on the market over the next three years and would seek to replace some of its expensive market loans with cheaper loans from international financial institutions. SA's climate finance team, led by Daniel Mminele, is finalising the investment plan, which has to go to the cabinet and to the partners - the US, UK, Germany, France and the EU - for launch at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt in November. SA wants to direct the money on offer to three programmes: electricity, including strengthening the transmission grid to support more renewable energy and repurposing old coal-fired power stations, electric vehicles and the hydrogen economy. The plan is likely to be programmatic rather than project-specific, setting out which programmes will merit JETP allocations - and which won't, even if they are part of SA's broader energy transition plan. It's still not clear how much of the $8.5bn will be grants and how much will be loans, nor how much of the funding will go to Eskom and other agencies and how much to the government directly. What is clear though, is that the JETP can only cement SA's international financial institutions policy shift, and broaden the range of international institutions from which the government is willing to borrow. For example, the German development finance institution KfW is understood to be in talks with the government on a \€ 300m climate-linked loan; so is its French counterpart. Talks on those loans predated the $8.5bn but they will be included in the package, so \€ 600m (R10.3bn) in concessional loans would be disbursed directly to the government. By contrast, the World Bank loan for the decommissioning of Eskom's Komati power station is not part of the $8.5bn. The amount is still under discussion, but in January, the bank mentioned $250m and it could be as much as $300m. It will go directly to Eskom. But it will be the third World Bank loan to SA this year, after a $750m loan for general budget support in January and a further $480m loan in June to cover Covid vaccines. Both of those were sovereign borrowing, directly to the government. And that's the essence of the policy shift of the past three years. This might have been the first time SA borrowed from the IMF but it had borrowed from the World Bank and other international financial institutions before: the difference was that those were loans to Eskom or other entities, not to the sovereign. SA shifted its stance out of necessity, but also to take advantage of international lenders' appetite for lending to it - first on Covid-19 then on climate, where the JETP is being looked to as a model for other fossil fuel-dependent emerging markets too. But there are still risks. Conditionality is one. That had always been the democratic government's big worry about borrowing from international financial institutions, going back to the days of the "Washington Consensus", when lenders tended to impose conditions on sovereign borrowers that were economically tough and politically contested. These days, however, the borrower supposedly is in the lead. Loans are made to countries based on their own programme of structural economic reforms, or in the case of the JETP, SA's own plans and commitments to transition to cleaner, greener energy. But skilled negotiating is needed, especially given how politically contested those reforms and energy plans are within the government. The bigger risk is that however cheap the loans and attractive the terms, this is still foreign borrowing. Since democracy SA has been careful to keep a lid on foreign borrowing and avoid the trap other emerging markets have fallen into when they borrowed too much abroad and ran out of foreign currency to repay it. It is fortunate to have a well-developed domestic market where the government can do most of its borrowing. The international financial institutions loans are just a fraction of total government borrowing of R4.5bn, and the government's foreign borrowing is still only about 11% of that total, which is within its self-imposed limit of 15%. But it has edged up from about 9% five years ago. In a volatile global environment in which emerging market currencies such as SA's are vulnerable, the mix of foreign and local loans is still one to watch with care. Joffe is editor at large. \</doc>

Make no mistake, we no longer live in a stable, international rules-based order.

Whatever their rhetoric, China, Russia and the US have HYPERLINK https://globalsummitryproject.com/disrupted-order-g20-global-governance-at-a-time-of-geopolitical-crisis/ lost faith in global institutions, withholding their support whenever it suits their interests.\~ While the EU, Japan, the UK, Canada and major players from the global South continue to support multilateralism, global governance cannot be sustained without the participation of the world's largest economies and military powers.\~ Making matters worse, the world is facing at least eight systemic challenges simultaneously.

Bay residents furious as household renewable energy charges increase Solar power users roast new tariffs HYPERLINK mailto:rogersg@theherald.co.zaDaylight rogersg@theherald.co.zaDaylight Members of the small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) group are now calling on the metro to reconsider the structure laid out in the 2022/2023 tariff book which they say penalises their efforts. The metro, however, said the previous tariff was not economically sustainable. A Bay energy expert said while some of the new tariff figures made sense, a way had to be found to incentivise the household solar power generation group. The matter has come to the fore amid rolling load-shedding and the start of COP27 , the UN climate change summit in Egypt. The SSEG furore dates back to the October 2016 communication to a group of about 120 residents who had installed household solar photovoltaic energy systems. The metro proposed that, in terms of its new initiative, customers could feed the renewable electricity they generated into the Eskom grid to offset the electricity they consumed, and they would just pay the difference. Because it worked so well, he added a powerwall and more solar panels. "Because I was able to use my excess renewable electricity to offset my billed grid electricity, I only had to pay a power bill about three months of the year," Blandford said. He said the 2022/2023 tariff structure was a change for the worse. The tariff for SSEG customers was increased by an average of 109% in January. "According to this new system, there's now a R300 small-scale embedded generation basic charge for us to have our renewables installed and linked to the grid. "So we're being penalised for having solar." He said peak/off-peak and summer/winter differentials were also introduced, further skewing the situation. "My benefits have halved. "Their excuse is the municipality is losing money. "Eskom and the municipality are at fault and they're trying to shift the blame to those trying to solve the crisis." Blandford said one problem was the electricity revenue the metro collected was from electricity sales and rates, paid by only a small portion of the electorate. "Furthermore, the money collected is not ring-fenced to maintain the network. It's being used for everything from potholes to salaries." Another SSEG customer, Mark Gaskin, said: "We're being penalised to feed the grid with renewable energy. "It nullifies any renewable energy investment made and those contemplated. "It makes any effort to generate excess electricity to pump into the grid unfeasible. "You would think they would welcome efforts to reduce the pressure on the municipal grid, which is one of the reasons the small-scale embedded generation system was introduced." Gaskin said he had seized on the metro's proposal in 2016 because it made financial and environmental sense. "If you could make the investment, you would get your money back and at the same time you would align yourself with the international trend to help counter climate change. "In the Netherlands, if you purchase renewables, you don't pay VAT. "You would think SA, with the state Eskom is in, would offer a similar incentive, but at the moment it's the opposite." Another Bay resident, who declined to be named, said the situation was unacceptable. "I've invested more than R200,000 on solar panels and batteries and I expect a return." He said the system had worked well and the group was bemused by the sudden change. "There was no communication, but by looking at our bills we realised we had been taken from our previous domestic 31A block tariff and changed to a much higher time of use T31 tariff." He understood the pressure the metro was under from electricity theft and vandalism. "But we need a rational rethink of the situation. "If we adopt the right strategy, we could stimulate further investment into renewable energy which will strengthen the resilience of our grid, address Eskom's inability to provide sufficient electricity, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions." Electricity expert David Mertens said the tariff increases should be seen against the backdrop of a criminal onslaught on the Bay's electrical supply system. "About 40% of the meters in the Bay are being tampered with. Including illegal connections, at least 450GW/h of power per annum gets stolen. "The value of stolen electricity in Nelson Mandela Bay is about R1bn." He said both the SSEG users and the metro were correct to some extent - but a way had to be found to incentivise renewable generation by households. "If you look at the metro's 2022/2023 tariff book, SSEG users have to pay a substantially higher tariff this year to purchase electricity. "In the summer off-peak period we are in now, there's an increase of 36.42%." He said while it might be that the 2016 deal which did not include a basic charge had been carried through for the SSEG users, it was not unreasonable. "The municipality still has to look after your account. "However, we have to find ways to further incentivise these users. "One way would be to scrap the ring-fence rule that says you cannot build renewable energy credit to offset future electricity bills. Bay electricity and energy boss Lance Grootboom said the metro supported renewable energy. However it needed to be sustainable. He said the small-scale embedded generation tariffs had been approved by the national energy regulator and the reality was the city was losing revenue with the old tariff structure. "The city buys power at different rates from Eskom using the time of use tariff and so if we do not charge the time of use tariff for SSEG customers it will mean reduced margins for the city. "Photovoltaic systems produce electricity during the standard period and export excess power through the grid, and at night during peak they import power from the grid, when Nelson Mandela Bay is paying higher rates. "We understand it's not easy, but we had to be cost-reflective. The tariff was approved by Nersa and the council. This means the city may not change it at this stage." \</doc>

As the world faces a pivotal moment for family planning, new data released today shows that the use of modern contraception is soaring around the world, with an estimated 371 million women of reproductive age in low- and lower-middle-income countries now using a modern method of family planning - 87 million more than just a decade ago. The new data released at a press briefing this morning at the International Conference on Family Planning was accompanied by commitments from governments, including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and the announcement of a historic new five-year pledge to FP2030 of $15m from the United States Agency for International Development (USAid).Calling USAid, a pillar of this global family-planning partnership since FP2030 was created 10 years ago, Samukeliso Dube, executive director of FP2030, said the new commitment, affirms the success in our new report: that a diverse global partnership, deliberately working together, can accelerate the use of family planning everywhere."The findings presented here today provide us with a message for global leaders meeting at major events in parallel to ours: whether at the Cop27 in Egypt, the G20 in Indonesia, or the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Thailand; whether their goal is to address climate change, inequality, or economic development, they must begin with a commitment to invest in family planning. According to FP2030 s 2022 Measurement Report, more women in low- and lower-middle income countries are using modern family-planning methods than ever before: today, one in three women of reproductive age in low- and lower-middle income countries are now choosing to use modern contraception.Contraceptive prevalence has steadily increased in these countries, but in 14 countries, the number of contraceptive users has actually doubled. The sharpest growth has been in sub-Saharan Africa.In the last year alone, women s use of contraception in low- and lower-middle income countries has averted more than 141 million unintended pregnancies, 29 million unsafe abortions and almost 150,000 maternal deaths.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/158/227004.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/158/227004.html :EMBED-->The FP2030 report also suggests that despite the unprecedented strain Covid-19 placed on national health systems and global supply chains, and throughout restrictive lockdowns, record numbers of people around the world continued to seek out and use family-planning products and services. The scale of the Covid-19 pandemic was unprecedented, said Dube, and over the past 10 years, health systems have been buffeted by a number of threats, including natural disasters, violent conflicts, epidemics of Ebola and Zika, political shifts and changing economic conditions. Paired with the significant commitments made by governments and philanthropies, the new FP2030 report demonstrates the strength and resilience of a movement that has withstood a host of global challenges, as more and more countries and organisations recognise that voluntary, rights-based family planning is integral to their development and a major driver of gender equality. The benefits of family planning are enormous, and have a multiplier effect, added Dube. Family planning is the key to reducing maternal deaths; it is the difference between finishing high school and entering into early marriage and parenthood; and it can unlock a woman s economic survival and prosperity. That is why we are delighted to welcome the announcement today of the USAid s decision to support FP2030. A human-rights centered approach to developmentLess than two years after the FP2030 global partnership was launched, 24 governments and 78 non-governmental actors - including civil society organisations, private-sector providers and youth-led organisations - have now made a public financial, policy or programmatic pledge to advance rights-based family planning, vowing to expand access to voluntary, rights-based contraception.Also at today s press conference, the government of DRC announced its commitment to provide every person of reproductive age in the Congo Basin country with access to affordable, quality family-planning information and services, regardless of social class, geographical location or political or religious affiliation.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/330/226532.html https://www.bizcommunity.africa/Article/410/330/226532.html :EMBED-->The government also pledged to increase access to family-planning information and services for all adolescents and young people, from 13.1% in 2018 to at least 18% in 2025.19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have also finalised their FP2030 commitments: Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda.These commitments share many common priorities, including improving service delivery for young people, increasing domestic financing, scaling up postpartum family planning and strengthening supply chains.According to Jason Bremner, FP2030 senior director of data and measurement, the number of women seeking modern methods of contraception has continued to climb. This is a testament to women s desire to control whether and when to have children, and how many children to have. Speakers at the press briefing today noted that meeting the growing demand for family planning will require continued efforts to understand the changing needs and preferences of women and their partners.Today, for example, implants are the most used method in 10 countries and the second most common method in another 14 countries. This represents a stark contrast with the method mix a decade ago, when implants were not as widely available.Stepping up progressWhile celebrating the good news today, Dube also noted that in many places, access to family-planning services is under attack. The recent United States Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs vs Jackson Women s Health Organization imperils not only abortion access, but also the right to contraception, the right to make personal medical decisions and potentially the right of LGBTQ individuals to marry and have children. Repressive movements around the world are threatening to roll back women s rights, depriving people of bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom, said Dube. Despite the overwhelming demand for family planning, the progress of the last few years should not be taken for granted. At the same time, donor government funding for family planning is not keeping up with the growing demand for modern contraception.<!--EMBED: HYPERLINK https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/548/233065.html https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/548/233065.html :EMBED-->Data released today shows that bilateral donor funding totaled approximately $1.4bn in 2021: essentially flat compared to 2020, but substantially lower than the peak achieved in 2019 ($1.52bn). Given current financial instability and inflationary trends around the world, there could be further funding cuts in the future. Failing to adequately fund family-planning efforts would be a missed opportunity for millions of women, said Dube. We need not only to hold the line, but also to secure new funding to accommodate the surge in demand for family planning."To ensure that the world stays on track to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 - including the intersecting goals of gender equality, health, and prosperity - investments in family planning must be safeguarded and strengthened. In 2021, FP2030 introduced a new decentralised, regional model, consisting of five regional hubs on four continents.This new structure promises to make FP2030 more inclusive - and therefore more effective - than ever before, and places family-planning decisions where they should be; firmly in the hands of the nations and communities making these commitments and seeking their own solutions. As more and more young people enter their reproductive years, the demand for family-planning services will continue to grow. This rising demand must be met by adequate funding and increased supply, said Dube. The hard-won gains of the last 10 years could slip away if we don t act now. \</doc>

Insight Cyril struck by the disease of putting consultation over outcome On Friday morning, before President Cyril Ramaphosa announced SA's R1.5-trillion just energy transition (JET) investment plan in the afternoon, I happened to be on a visit to Gold Fields' South Deep mine. The deep level gold mine has an 80-year lifespan, which means it will be the last shaft standing in SA's gold industry. It also has a new 50MW solar energy plant, the first self-built renewable energy plant of this scale in SA. South Deep spent R715m on the plant, which can supply a quarter of its electricity; its panels occupy 200 football fields of land around the mine. Looking across the sea of panels to the mine shafts was a reminder that one day soon almost all of SA's mines might look like that. Certainly, most of them plan to build their own renewable energy plants, if they haven't started doing so already. They want cleaner operations and a more secure electricity supply, and are keen to fund and build it themselves - as soon as the bureaucrats will let them. South Deep's solar expanse was a useful lens through which to view the president's session later in the day, one that should have been an exciting milestone in SA's energy journey. Yet it raised more questions than it answered. A first question was how an $8.5bn offer from five international partners last November to help fund SA's JET morphed into an $84bn (R1.5-trillion) grand plan a year later. At least one commentator described the plan as a wish list for the next five years - not the $8.5bn investment framework envisaged in last November's political declaration by SA and the international partner group (IPG) comprising the UK, US, Germany, France and the EU. Perhaps the president and his team needed to fend off the clamour of demands for a piece of the IPG package, which started life as a response to a plan devised by Eskom to shut down its oldest coal power stations, provide alternatives for affected communities, and strengthen the national grid to support more renewable energy. Perhaps they needed to put a clear rationale and sequence to the spending choices involved, especially since more than 90% of the IPG money is destined for the electricity sector's green transition. Perhaps most important, given the controversy around that transition, the investment plan needed to be seen to be home grown, not imposed by rich international partners keen to pressure coal dependent poorer countries to cut their carbon emissions. Daniel Mminele, who heads the presidential climate finance task team, says it was decided early on that SA needed to outline the scale of need over the next five years and how the IPG could support that - and that the plan needed to be owned and led by SA. And he is emphatic that it is not a wish list. The team did extensive work and modelling to establish the pipelines of projects and financing that were out there in public and private sectors. It's a plan supported by huge amounts of work and evidence. And it involved extensive consultation, with a range of experts as well as groups representing youth, municipalities, labour, business and other stakeholders. All of this raises the second question: why did Ramaphosa put the plan forward as a document for consultation and engagement, when it had already been approved by the cabinet and endorsed by the IPG? There seemed something of an obsession with consultation at the presidential climate change commission session where he presented the plan on Friday. Hardly anyone criticised or questioned the details of the R1.5-trillion JET investment plan itself. Instead, there was all sorts of discussion and confusion about the status of the document, which is due to be formally launched by the leaders of all the international partner countries at COP27 in Egypt this week. Putting consultation over outcome is an SA disease anyway, but in this case may reflect the discomfort of some stakeholders, including some in the climate commission itself, with the IPG and the JET. It's not just the coal lobby but also the resolutely anti-Western bias of many older ANC leaders - not to mention the anti-capitalist bias of many older environmental activists, who must hate that the private sector has espoused the green transition with such enthusiasm and so much money. Nobody seems to expect the government to consult when it goes to the international bond market to borrow billions of dollars, as it did earlier this year at rates and on conditions more onerous than those the international partners are offering. But climate finance raises a clamour. On the other side of the table, however, the international partners worry about how welcome they really are, given SA's stance on Ukraine, and about how committed SA's government really is to implementing the ambitious decarbonisation plans it committed to at Glasgow last November. There must be at least some risk that some of them renege on their offer if SA doesn't take its own plan seriously. That makes it more puzzling that Ramaphosa seemed to dwell more on the negatives than the positives on Friday. He complained of how little of the $8.5bn was grants (R439m) as opposed to loans. He emphasised how small the sum was relative to the total need SA had identified for itself, and hinted that others were lining up to fund us. Of course, the world's rich countries need to do far more to help poorer countries. But Ramaphosa could and surely should have taken the opportunity to trumpet that the plan was a world first, with SA taking the lead to provide a model other fossil fuel dependent poor countries could follow. He could have highlighted that this was a pretty large sum of hard currency, at attractive rates, for a country that sorely needs foreign investment - and that the endorsement by the international partners will attract more funding to fast-track the transition. Instead the message was muted. And the final big question is how much of this plan will translate into tangible outcomes. The government is great at policies and plans but none too good at implementation. This one will need political will, and political authority, to make it happen. SA will need to keep the partners on board to ensure the money flows. Fortunately some of the funding agreements are already done and dusted, particularly those with the World Bank-led funds and the French and German loans to the government. Fortunately too, there are many more private sector renewable projects ready to follow South Deep's Khanyisa ("light up" in isiZulu), and plenty of appetite to fund them. The government just has to allow that investment to happen, and ensure it uses IPG funding to enable a faster transition to cleaner energy, in a way that not only cushions the negative effects but also triggers positive growth and employment. \</doc>

Africa needs to trade in carbon credits to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, finance the transition to renewable energy, and boost economic development, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) says. Carbon credits present an opportunity for African countries - many dependent on fossil fuels for energy - to protect themselves against climate change while raising much-needed finance for the transition to renewable energy transition, said Jean-Paul Adam, Director for Technology, Climate Change and Natural Resources Management Division at UNECA. Carbon credits are globally traded commodities or permits that allow the emission of one tonne of CO2 or one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent gases to be traded on national or international carbon markets. These credits, which can be used to boost economic growth and attract financing for various projects, are traded on the carbon offset markets. By selling carbon credits, African countries can also tackle climate change by protecting their forests which absorb and store a measured amount of carbon. Besides, the carbon credits can also be sold as 'offsets' to companies unable to cut pollution to reduce emissions elsewhere. Lack of finance and capacity to trade on the global carbon markets are hurdles for African countries have to overcome in the growing global carbon markets, where the carbon pricing revenue increased by almost 60 percent last year to about $84 billion, according to the World Bank. Cashing in on carbon credits Africa suffers energy insecurity, as seen in chronic power load shedding and blackouts that have a huge cost on people's livelihoods and economic growth. Fossil fuels dominate Africa's energy mix, which comprises crude oil, coal, natural gas, hydropower, wind, and solar power. Africa is an untapped market for carbon trading. About two percent of global investments in renewable energy in the last two decades were made in Africa, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) report. But letting go of fossil fuels is a catch-22 situation for African countries. Many could lose essential revenue and risk stranded natural resources as the world demand for fossil fuels declines in favour of renewable energy. According to the African Development Bank, more than 600 million people in Africa have no access to energy, and the continent has some of the world's lowest electricity access rates for African countries at just over 40 percent. The UNECA is supporting African countries to raise their resources reliably and transparently through carbon trading, said Adam, noting the need for an appropriate supervisory body for transparent carbon credit trading. "We know that the rate of deforestation in Africa is the highest in all regions of the world, and therefore a well-structured carbon credit system can allow African countries to protect at-risk resources and generate income from the protection of those resources," said Adam. UNECA projects that through nature-based carbon removal, Africa can generate between $15 and $82 billion annually, depending on the price of carbon. For example, at $50 per tonne, the revenue potential from natural carbon sequestration removal would be $15 billion. Adam said the average price for carbon credit in Africa was currently about $10 per tonne, which could be raised with the creation of high-integrity registries. Africa's carbon market was not as well developed as many countries did not have a registry to measure carbon emissions and trade them. Adam argued that a predictive carbon market would benefit African countries with long-term access to affordable energy. Africa accounts for only three percent of cumulative global CO2 emissions and less than five percent of the world's annual CO2 emissions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) highlights that Africa has made the smallest historical contribution to the greenhouse gases causing global warming but bears the brunt of the negative impacts of climate change. "African countries on average are spending nine percent of their budgets, that means for every $100 that governments are spending, $9 is being removed right at the onset just for paying for climate change," Adam told IPS. "Essentially, climate change is putting a tax on African countries that is higher relative to incomes in other countries." Adam says Africa has crafted an energy transition plan to boost energy security using natural gas as a transition fuel, given that many countries did not have access to geothermal and hydropower that could also be used for baseload generation. African countries, through the African Union, have adopted a common position for energy transition recognising natural gas as a temporary energy need with oil and coal being phased out and allowing for more investment in renewable energy, particularly solar, wind and geothermal. No to gas The African Common Position on Energy Access and Transition proposed for adoption by African Heads of State and to be launched at COP27 in Egypt this year comes on the back of the European Union's recent vote in favour of a new rule that will consider fossil gas and nuclear projects as "green". The African Group of Negotiators (AGN) and the African civil society have opposed the plan. They worry it would detract from Africa's energy access and transition goals while locking the continent into fossil fuels for decades. "Africa is blessed with abundant wind, solar, and other clean, renewable energies. African leaders should be maximising this potential and harnessing the abundant wind and sun, which will help boost energy access and tackle climate change," said Mohamed Adow, Director of Power Shift Africa. Lorraine Chiponda, Africa Coal Network Coordinator, said the acceleration of gas projects in Africa was another colonial and modern 'Scramble and Partition of Africa' among energy corporations and rich countries.

Perhaps they needed to put a clear rationale and sequence to the spending choices involved, especially since more than 90% of the inter-national partner group money is destined for the electricity sector's green transition. Perhaps most important, given the controversy around that transition, the investment plan needed to be seen to be home grown, not imposed by rich international partners keen to pressure coal dependent poorer countries to cut their carbon emissions. Daniel Mminele, who heads the presidential climate finance task team, says it was decided early on that SA needed to outline the scale of need over the next five years and how the international partner group could support that - and that the plan needed to be owned and led by SA. And he is emphatic that it is not a wish list. The team did extensive work and modelling to establish the pipelines of projects and financing that were out there in public and private sectors. It's a plan supported by huge amounts of work and evidence. And it involved extensive consultation, with a range of experts as well as groups representing youth, municipalities, labour, business and other stakeholders. All of this raises the second question: why did Ramaphosa put the plan forward as a document for consultation and engagement, when it had already been approved by the cabinet and endorsed by the international partner group? There seemed something of an obsession with consultation at the presidential climate change commission session where he presented the plan on Friday. Hardly anyone criticised or questioned the details of the R1.5-trillion JET-IP itself. Instead, there was all sorts of discussion and confusion about the status of the document, which is due to be launched by the leaders of all the international partner countries at COP27 in Egypt this week. Putting consultation over outcome is an SA disease anyway, but in this case may reflect the discomfort of some stakeholders, including some in the climate commission itself, with the international partner group and the just energy transition. It's not just the coal lobby but also the anti-Western bias of many older ANC leaders - not to mention the anti-capitalist bias of many older environmental activists, who must hate that the private sector has espoused the green transition with such enthusiasm and so much money. Nobody seems to expect the government to consult when it goes to the international bond market to borrow billions of dollars, as it did earlier this year at rates and on conditions more onerous than those the international partners are offering. But climate finance raises a clamour. On the other side of the table, the international partners worry about how welcome they really are, given SA's stance on Ukraine, and about how committed SA's government is to implementing the ambitious decarbonisation plans it committed to at Glasgow last November. There must be at least some risk that some of them renege on their offer if SA doesn't take its own plan seriously. That makes it more puzzling that Ramaphosa seemed to dwell more on the negatives than the positives on Friday. He complained of how little of the $8.5bn was grants (R439m) as opposed to loans. He emphasised how small the sum was relative to the total need SA had identified for itself, and hinted that others were lining up to fund us. Of course, the world's rich countries need to do far more to help poorer countries. But Ramaphosa could and surely should have taken the opportunity to trumpet that the plan was a world first, with SA taking the lead to provide a model other fossil fuel dependent poor countries could follow. He could have highlighted that this was a pretty large sum of hard currency, at attractive rates, for a country that sorely needs foreign investment - and that the endorsement by the international partners will attract more funding to fast-track the energy transition. Instead the message was muted. And the final big question is how much of this plan will translate into tangible outcomes. The government is great at policies and plans but none too good at implementation. This one will need political will, and political authority, to make it happen. SA will need to keep the partners on board to ensure the money flows. Fortunately some of the funding agreements are done and dusted, particularly those with the World Bank-led funds and the French and German loans to the government. Fortunately too, there are many more private sector renewable projects ready to follow South Deep's Khanyisa ("light up" in isiZulu) solar plant and plenty of appetite to fund them. The government just has to allow that investment to happen, and ensure it uses international partner group funding to enable a faster transition to cleaner energy, in a way that not only cushions the negative effects but also triggers positive growth and employment.

The global oil prices are steadily rising, raising the spectre of excessively higher prices at the pump. The timing could not have been more inauspicious. The implication of such extensive movements in a country whose majority of the populace is dependent on taxis to a large extent, and to a lesser degree buses, is enormous. The trucks that move cargo to and from South Africa tend to increase significantly at this time as well. In a climate of high inflation of both goods and services and rising costs of diesel and petrol, the inflationary cost pressures are transferred directly to the suffering consumer. According to Statistics SA, an increase in the fuel price has an impact on the economy. Higher fuel prices place upward pressure on consumer inflation. During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the tumbling fuel prices contributed significantly to the overall inflation pushing the headline rate to its lowest reading since September 2004. Every so often, our system which is wired to produce these rigged outcomes, comes into full heat. Arguably, most capitalist derived systems are like Las Vegas casino machines: designed to disadvantage large numbers of persons and not surprisingly, handsomely reward a few. There are certain flash points that keep us occupied in earnest. These are the rand/dollar exchange rate and the global oil prices contracts which would eventually find a statistical rounding up or down in the State Levy Over and Under recovery mechanism. Starting with the Basic Fuel Price which reflects the global oil prices, it is a concept that sounds innocent enough. Yet what does secondary storage refer to and when the storage facilities have long been paid for, what is the purpose of continuing to reimburse the proprietors of these facilities on a permanent basis? In mid April of last year, AA made five key recommendations to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources and Energy. The first two are telling. They recommended an investigation be conducted on the current pricing model for all fuel, without elaborating what is wrong with the current model nor what indeed should support the investigatory pursuit. The second recommendation was that a recalculation ought to be done, including an audit of all existing elements within the pricing model. Coming from that august body of consummate experience, the policy- makers need to heed their counsel. For so long is their memory slate that they even witnessed the first regulation of wholesale and retail margin in 1946 under the War Measures Act. From the mouths of the AA experts, it would seem that the BFP is genuinely unwell and wholly unsuited to serve the people for whom it was designed. The other is the rand/dollar exchange rate. However, that would be a subject for another day. The challenges posed by our systemic constructs present us with an equal number of commensurate opportunities, if we put our minds to it. These include the recommendations of the AA. By a subtlety of an admixture of public bullying and smart coercive tactics, South Africa is made to believe that it is in their best interest to be an all-out energy importing economy. It is meant to accept that the public responsibility to refine and the enjoyment of attending benefits is a privilege reserved for someone else. And that privilege, when in the utility of others, is not a subject which South Africa is suffered to partake in. Ours is to do or die. Literally, both economically and by political implosion. And as is common in latter day politics, militarily if everything else fails. Heading to Cairo for the COP 27 , the commitment to the rigour of inflexible carbon emission policy strictures and environmental inviolability is a painful subject which will be grotesquely twisted into the usual developed economies\' double speak. A glimpse from a collection of excerpts from the government utterances, South Africa seems to be determined to stay the course and tread lightly on the side of rationality and diligent care. Their avoidance of doctrinaire cacophony that feeds into strange agendas which change every so often depending on the fortunes or otherwise of Nato\' s military adventurism in Ukraine, is emblematic of a matured policy instinct by a Pretoria bureaucracy playing a longer game than the tenure of their political heads. This summer will see a shortage of refined products accounting to a number of factors, both internal and external. Internally, we have two crude oil refineries which have closed down, Enref and Sapref. The third, Glencore\' s Astron Refinery, is still shut, even though it is expected to reopen before the end of this year. With so much import volume demand putting a strain on the country\' s current account balance, our reliance on foreign suppliers will be subject to the same pressures as all other importing countries are. If America has less than 25 days worth of diesel reserves, they will soak up all available products in the open market. So will Europe and the rest of the net importer Asia Pacific nations. South Africa is not a priority right now. And therefore it is wise to brace ourselves for an economically severe summer holiday. The representatives of the people should take advantage of this policy crisis and not let it go to waste. So much of our energy discourse has got severe intellectual limitations. The choices presented to us as the only ones available simply because they are given vogue epithets, should be approached with caution and a lot of research.

Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United nations, in an address to the Joint High Level Dialogue on Africa, 20 July 2022. The "Africa We Want" - as outlined in Agenda 2063 - embodies the African Union's bold vision of an integrated, prosperous, and peaceful continent. An Africa shaped by its own narrative, informed by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force on the world stage. The United Nations shares this vision and its realization through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Today's event provides a global platform for African Member States and the United Nations and partners to share progress and reaffirm that giving light to this vision remains our shared priority. Sadly, Africa's development gains are at risk, as a consequence of the current three ongoing crises. First, the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of the pandemic have reversed progress made over the past two decades, and further shrank an already limited fiscal space. Social inequalities have been exposed and exacerbated in nearly every sphere: in vaccine distribution, in economic growth, in access to education and health care, and in terms of job and income losses. For the first time in over 20 years poverty has increased. Women and informal workers have been disproportionately affected. Second, climate change continues to threaten Africa's future. Droughts, floods and hurricanes are growing in number and severity and African countries are on the front line. Even though this week, we are witnessing record hight temperatures in Europe and UK, where forest fires and homes burring have taken lives. COP27 in Egypt will be the African COP. It will be the opportunity to build on the outcomes of Glasgow and to signal the ambition of the stock take COP28. There is a unique opportunity to lift the ambition and keep the promise of the 2030 Agenda, including the Paris agreement and the promise of the Agenda 2063. To scale-up and speed-up investments in climate adaptation solutions that that protect people and ecosystems, building resilience for the crises to come. Third, the war in Ukraine. The war is not only causing immense human suffering -- it is now precipitating a global food, energy, and finance crisis. 71 million people in developing countries have fallen into poverty in the space of just 3 months, as a direct consequence of global food and energy price surges. People living in regions like the Sahel and the Horn of Africa are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. As the Secretary-General has warned, "there is a real risk that multiple famines will be declared in 2022. And 2023 could be even worse." The Africa we want is still within reach. To get there, we need to change our mindsets and turn the triple crisis into an opportunity. To do so, we must focus on five, amongst many of our key issues: First, building effective and reliable policy frameworks and institutions. To be clear: policy choices have the capacity to make or break this world. Without a forceful policy response to today's challenges, there is a risk that inequality will become entrenched. For an inclusive economic recovery, policy responses need to put human capital and future resilience at the centre of policy making. We need to promote the complementarity between formal and informal social protection networks as tools to achieve income distribution. Second, we must future-proof Africa's infrastructure by investing in connectivity and digital technologies. The launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area provides an exciting opportunity for African countries to industrialize, diversify and digitize their economies, and enhance regional cooperation and resilience. Third, education and skills-development are enablers of Africa's industrialization. Digital skills, science, technology, engineering and mathematics need to be integrated into the curricula of African schools and education institutions. This is the only way that the continent will be able to build a skilled workforce that is able to realize the fourth industrial revolution. The Transforming Education Summit that the Secretary-General will convene in September will help to radically redesign our education systems for the world of tomorrow, today. Fourth, achieving sustainable energy for all across the continent. The global rise in energy prices that we are witnessing should prompt African countries to accelerate energy access and a just transition, including through scaled-up domestic renewable energy production and energy efficiency. But this is an opportunity for foreign direct investment in many of these economies that will pave a way for that industrialization that we speak to. Finally, we need an overall of our approach to financing. In the short term, African countries need immediate relief to ensure they can survive the immediate next years -- through the re-channeling of unused Special Drawing Rights, increased concessional grants, and the renewal of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative. In the long term, we will need to re-prioritize where and how investments get made. This requires massively scaling up investments in the sectors that remain critical to bolstering resilience and inclusive growth. The Africa We Want is not only good for the Continent -- it is good for the world. Building the Africa We Want means delivering the urgent scale in the support that Africa needs, it also means putting at the centre our youth and women. Now is the time to urgently rescue the SDGs in Africa and lay the foundation for the ambition of the 2063 Agenda - and in the world at large. Today, let us recommit to our ambitious vision and to continue to work alongside African countries to realise a greener, more sustainable, and more inclusive future for all.

JUST TRANSITION INVESTMENT PLAN One year after the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, SA and its international partners are preparing to announce the details of their $8.5bn just energy transition investment plan JET-IP at COP27 , which opens in Sharm el Shaik on Sunday. President Cyril Ramaphosa is due to speak on the plan on Friday afternoon. There will be so many questions to probe once JET-IP is released in full - possibly only after the big COP launch next week, where Ramaphosa will be joined by his counterparts from the UK, US, France, Germany and the EU. But meanwhile, it is worth starting to ask what the long-negotiated $8.5bn package might look like - as well as where and how it will be spent. How much of this is new money? Does that matter? And how much of it will actually materialise? Those are some of the questions to ask as we pick the package apart and ask how much of a difference it will make in helping SA to transition to cleaner energy, and in a way that not only mitigates the effect on affected communities but also smoothes the path to a different kind of economy. This week the World Bank's climate report on SA estimated the country will need $8.5-trillion between now and 2050 to meet the ambitious net-zero goals it has set for itself. The $8.5bn, which is intended to be disbursed over the next five years, is clearly just a fraction of that. Ramaphosa and the climate finance team are sure to emphasise that the JET-IP is just a start, with much work still to be done. The question will be whether it is a good start. Much of the debate in the lead-up has focused on how much of the money is grants as opposed to loans. All indications are that SA won less by way of grants than it had hoped, with much of the package focused on concessional and commercial lending from the partner countries. We know too that a fair amount of the funding is not new, at least in the sense that it was being planned and discussed before Glasgow, and might well have happened with or without the JET-IP. That's the case with the biggest chunk of funding, via the World Bank-led group of multilateral lenders in the Climate Investment Funds (CIF). The CIF has committed $500m to SA (and a similar sum to Indonesia) and expects to bring in other lenders to leverage this up to at least $2.5bn. This will help to finance SA's Accelerating Coal Transition investment plan which was developed by Eskom to manage the scheduled decommissioning of its oldest coal fired power stations, by repurposing the stations and mitigating the impact on Mpumalanga's coal communities. Separately from the JET-IP, the World Bank will put $250m-$300m into the shut down of the Komati power station, which is a pilot project. But funding for the next set of Mpumalanga stations to transition will come from the CIF. That includes $500m from the World Bank itself - which has set aside a similar sum for coal-dependent Indonesia. And the bank has brought in funding from other countries and development institutions to leverage this up to a total Accelerated Climate Transition package of $2.5bn. Also not new are about \€ 300m from each of France and Germany, mainly concessional loans to government via their development finance institutions AFD and KfW. Those too were being negotiated before Glasgow, though Germany recently announced it would add fresh funding, which would raise its JET-related contribution to \€ 320m. Arguably it does not matter how much of the funding in the $8.5bn is genuinely new and would not have happened without it. The important thing is that the plan has brought the international partners together to commit to help kickstart SA's energy transition - even if it is not nearly enough. One of the interesting issues is going to be how the government deals with loans and grants that will go directly into the public purse. The Treasury tends to be reluctant to ring-fence funds, but it will have to ensure this money goes to the just energy transition plan - and will have to account transparently for that. There is a broader issue, though, of how much of the $8.5bn goes to SA's public sector and how much to its private sector. The US, for example, has committed more than $1bn of the total. But its government's development finance arm only finances private sector projects, not public ones, so most of the US money is expected to go to private sector companies in SA. It is not clear whether that will be commercial lending at market rates or concessional funding, but if it is commercial there is plenty of appetite from our local banks and financial institutions to fund private renewable energy projects, and one has to wonder why local companies would want dollar borrowing instead. There are some similar issues with the funding from the UK, which makes up about $1.8bn of the funding. Some of the UK's contribution is also said to be commercial lending, but most of it is not actual money at all - it is a guarantee to the African Development Bank, which will use it to advance concessional loans. The reason, apparently, is that unlike the other partners the UK government does not have a development finance institution. Then there is the really big question of where the money will be spent. In practice, different pots of money will go to different projects based on bilateral negotiations. The plan is not expected to detail particular projects. Instead, it will outline the allocation of the package to three broad programmes - electricity, electric vehicles and green hydrogen. If we really wanted to speed up SA's transitioning from coal and bringing new private sector renewable electricity generators onto the national grid, we should surely have spent most of the $8.5bn on strengthening and extending that national grid. That would have provided the public transmission capacity urgently needed to support much more private electricity generation. Hopefully a big chunk will go on boosting electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure. But trade, industry & competition minister Ebrahim Patel has clearly got his way on electric vehicles and hydrogen, even though private sector motor companies and miners would happily fund most of that without any help from the COP. How the plan will work and how it will be executed have still to be sorted. It is going to be messy, more so if the international partners get worried that Eskom's Andre de Ruyter might not stay in his job - or that climate finance chief Daniel Mminele might not stay in his, as rumours have it. The JET-IP has a long way to go. But even if only some of it materialises it will boost foreign inflows and investment at the same time as it advances the transition. So let's see it.

A few years ago, I found myself in the Baka indigenous sacred forest in Assok, in Cameroon in the course of my work in supporting them to preserve their forest against land grabbers. We were building a forest hut using only leaves and the knowledge of our indigenous partners. I was skeptical when we started. "What about rain," I thought. But the leaves were placed in a way that the rain simply flowed down the sides. Inside was warm and dry. Indigenous forest peoples are recognized as the first inhabitants of the forests around the world. For millennia Indigenous People have lived symbiotically with nature - gathering fruits and insects; hunting, and protecting the environment they rely upon. I've seen the power of Indigenous Peoples' ancestral knowledge and wisdom about forest and biodiversity sustainable management. If we embrace this expertise we will be taking the most cost-effective ways to reduce poverty, preserve biodiversity, halt deforestation and contribute to reducing the harmful effects of climate change In the Congo Basin, around 50 million Indigenous Peoples depend on forests yet they are the most vulnerable, the most marginalized and the poorest inhabitants of a region that stretches across some five countries including Cameroon, Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. I have interacted with various indigenous people over the last decade as part of my work as an environmental advocate. In Cameroon, where I live, the Indigenous World 2022 Report estimates Baka, Bagyeli and Bedzang peoples represent 0.4% of the total population while the Mbororo pastoralists make up 12%. These interactions include numerous field visits to their ancestral land where I have admired their solidarity and harmony in living with nature. Over the generations, Indigenous People have developed their own codes of forest conservation, including preventing overhunting with methods that include rotational hunting and harvesting. For instance, the Baka don't hunt in sacred sites, at a place where a newborn has been circumcised and nor do they hunt large mammals. They eat only fresh meat so hunt only that which can be consumed. I am amazed by their extensive knowledge of forest medicinal plants and their uses. Prior to the expropriation of their ancestral land by logging and Agribusiness companies, they hardly went to the hospital. While COVID-19 and deforestation have changed that, we still have much to learn from them. For them, forest conservation is not an isolated, compartmentalized concept but an integrated part of their lives. Yet their very rich traditional culture-and often their lives are at risk: experts say up to 10 indigenous linguistic identities are at risk of disappearing. Embedded in that language is identity and their cultural knowledge, which will also disappear. When we mark International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples on August 9, we can expect politicians to invite them for photo ops and public appearances. But we have to ask what will be done to really prevent them and their language and expertise from disappearing? I've seen the power of Indigenous Peoples' ancestral knowledge and wisdom about forest and biodiversity sustainable management. If we embrace this expertise we will be taking the most cost-effective ways to reduce poverty, preserve biodiversity, halt deforestation and contribute to reducing the harmful effects of climate change. Globally, this is a powerful path forward for responding to climate change, improving the environmental, and advancing justice. Indigenous Peoples make up about 6.2% of the world's population, but they safeguard 80% of the planet's biodiversity. Their sophisticated knowledge of the natural forest - documented by scientific research worldwide - allows forests and biodiversity to flourish. Their sustainable land use fights climate change and builds resilience to natural disasters and pandemic. Among the recommendations made by Indigenous leaders at the last COP 26 global climate conference, was the recognition of the rights and land tenure of Indigenous Peoples' to land, forest and water and that Indigenous Peoples, as knowledge holders, should be able to participate directly with their own voices in the UN process to ensure that their "rights, cultures, lands and ways of life" be respected. US$1.7 billion was announced during the last COP 26 to help Indigenous and local communities protect the biodiversity of tropical forests that are vital to protecting the planet from climate change, biodiversity loss, and pandemic risk. Little has changed on the ground, despite another recent paper further confirming that traditional ways of using and managing biodiversity are grounded in progressive principles of sustainability. In short, indigenous knowledge and management systems represent critical yet frequently untapped resources in global conservation efforts. Despite this evidence and policy recommendations, it is business as usual where conflict, insecurity, lack of recognition of Indigenous Peoples land rights, expropriation, lack of inclusion and participation in the decision-making process continues. COP27 will take place in Egypt, an African country, this year. It is my hope that a delegation from the Congo Basin will not only be there but will influence climate change policies and decisions. Indigenous Forest Peoples cannot assume the burden of global conservation and climate mitigation challenges without our support. My question to the global climate leaders and government authorities is this: what has happened to the COP 26 IPLC forest tenure Joint Donor Statement that pledged for support indigenous people's land tenure rights and guardianship of the world's forests? Business as usual will not save us. If we don't act to preserve our forest guardians and their knowledge and properly involve them in our conservation effort, we will lose their rich wisdom and knowledge. Without healthy, thriving forests, we will never see the sustainable future we are aiming for.

Patricia Espinosa's six years as Executive Secretary of the UN's climate change secretariat ends on July 15th. During her time in charge, she has led efforts to operationalize the 2015 Paris Agreement and inject greater urgency into the diplomatic process. Although progress has been difficult, COP26 in Glasgow added some momentum and arguably brought the UN process to the start of its next stage: implementation. As thoughts turn to this next, critical phase, several names are already circulating for who the next leader should be. These include the UK's Alok Sharma, who chaired COP26, former GEF head Naoko Ishii of Japan, and Egypt's Environment Minister Yasmine Fouad, Sri Mulyani Indrawati of Indonesia Finance Minister and Ambassador Liz Thomson from Barbados among others. So, who should step into Espinosa's shoes? And what sort of qualities will they need to succeed? Location, Location Any leader who believes it is all about them, or that they can charm or compel governments to act, will be doomed to failure. This is a particular risk for candidates who have been senior politicians in the past. They would have to curb the instinct to garner headlines for themselves. In this role the ability to listen, not just talk, will be critical For any senior UN job there is a geopolitical calculation in play. With more being asked from the Global South in combating climate change, there is an argument to be made that the next Executive Secretary should hail from a developing country. Some observers feel this would help build trust in the climate talks. There is an equity argument in play here, too. Historically, the first three UNFCCC leaders were Europeans: Michael Zammit Cutajar of Malta, then Joke Waller-Hunter and Yvo de Boer, both from the Netherlands. The next two came from the Americas: Christiana Figueres from Costa Rica, and Mexico's Patricia Espinosa. An argument could easily be made that the next leader should come from Asia-Pacific or Africa. Interestingly, the next two COPs will be in these regions: COP27 in Egypt and COP28 in the United Arab Emirates. But which should it be: Africa or Asia-Pacific? In this respect, it is worth noting that two Africans already lead the other so-called Rio Conventions: Ibrahim Thiaw is responsible for the UN's efforts on desertification, while Elizabeth Mrema heads-up biodiversity. Based on this, there is a strong case for appointing a developing country person from Asia or the Pacific or perhaps from the Small Island Developing States as they are hit worst by the impacts of climate change. Seeking courageous, ego-free networkers Irrespective of geography, what sort of qualities would a future leader need? We believe someone with excellent networking skills is essential, especially as we move from negotiating into implementation mode. A naturally-charismatic figure who can build trusting relationships and bring people together will be essential. These are qualities Christiana Figueres deployed to great effect to help birth the Paris Agreement. They know not only when to step up, but also when to step back and share the limelight. In this respect, Michael Zammit Cutajar--who led the UN climate secretariat in its early years--was a master, as was deputy leader Richard Kinley (2006-2017). There is an important lesson here: any leader who believes it is all about them, or that they can charm or compel governments to act, will be doomed to failure. This is a particular risk for candidates who have been senior politicians in the past. They would have to curb the instinct to garner headlines for themselves. In this role the ability to listen, not just talk, will be critical. The next Executive Secretary should ideally have been active in the climate negotiations for some time. This is a complicated field and they will need to have a good understanding of not just the issues or political positions of various country groupings, but also the people who are doing the negotiating. Diplomacy is always a complex web of geopolitical positions, but underneath this are individuals. An effective leader will get to know the people involved and seek to build personal trust. Having someone who already knows the key individuals involved will help them hit the ground running. The role will also require both courage and persistence. These are qualities we believe are essential for any successful leader when it comes to multilateral environmental agreements. It is something we explore in-depth in our book, Heroes of Environmental Diplomacy: Profiles in Courage. Yes, the science is telling us we must supercharge our efforts and sprint to the finish line. However, persistence and the knowledge that all diplomacy is a marathon will be needed by whoever takes on this important role. Finally, this is such an important appointment that we would propose the hiring process be undertaken in the open. What we mean by this is that there could be "hustings" for member states and stakeholders to question the candidates, as there is for the UN Secretary General's position. "Town hall" meetings with staff would also be useful so their input can be considered. It is not hyperbole to suggest this appointment comes at a critical time for our planet. The need for inspired, courageous and exceptional leadership has never been greater. We wish the selectors--and their choice--the best of luck.

SA has joined many countries to fight climate change resulting from many economic activities which include manufacturing/industry, agriculture and energy. After the signifying of the Paris Agreement, SA developed an energy policy document called the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), developed and published by the department of mineral resources & energy (DMRE), currently led by minister Gwede Mantashe.& xA0; The document was published in 2019 after many other early publications and consultations with all relevant stakeholders. As the branch, we are aware that the IRP 2019 will be reviewed, and we appeal to Mantashe to make sure the new IRP set to be developed is informed by the science and economic conditions of the country. Accordingly, coal using cleaner technologies, gas, and other baseload energy systems should inform the new IRP. & xA0;The 2019 IRP advocates for a mix of energy that will accommodate environmental concerns and cheap and reliable dispatchable baseload energy. The aim of the department, as articulated by its director-general and the DDGs responsible for policy and energy at the recent mining conference in Limpopo, is to make sure our energy systems lead to the economic development of the people of this country, particularly the poor and the unemployed. As the branch, we strongly believe that deployment of renewable energy is not an issue and we must prepare for the future. What we have a problem with is a situation where the country seems to be dictated to by developed countries which have undergone their development stages, and by the way that development took place without the majority of black Africans as they were used as slaves while they [the developed countries] were developed, using African resources.& xA0; The leadership that we elect should avoid a situation where we are recolonised economically, where we are told not to use our resources. Mantashe calls this the coming back on Nongqawuse, and, as the branch, we strongly agree with his sentiments, and we call on the 55th national conference to take a strong resolution on energy and the future of South African natural resources and their use. Our natural resources need to be used to take our economy to greater heights. Asian countries have demonstrated to us how an economy can grow faster and uplift your people using the natural resources at your disposal. For example, mining contribution to the South African economy has helped the country to pay social grants to help the poor, started during Covid-19. Mining absorbs labour from the Eastern Cape. Instead, the rich and developed countries continue to be offered loans and funds such as the $10bn (R170bn) SA received from COP 27 to phase out mining and using its coal to produce electricity. This happens when they import coal from SA when they build new nuclear power stations and issue exploration licences for oil and gas (the UK issued more than 100 licences). Their aim and priority is energy security, while they make us believe that our aim and priority is climate change only. SA's priority is to end hunger, reduce inequality and employ its people. The actions of the current leadership deployed by the ANC in government will not take the country out of poverty. There are few national executive (NEC) members who have announced on this energy mix properly, according to our view and who have defined the energy policy, Mantashe, Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma and other NEC members seem to be ignoring this important matter. These actions will affect areas such as Emalahleni Local Municipality where coal mining has the potential of employing the unemployed people of the area and contribute to the GDP of the municipality and that of the district, and the province. Unemployment in the district and province is very high, and in Emalahleni local municipality it is at about 40%. According to the IDP (2021), in 2007 only 22.9% of economically active people were residing in the district, which increased to 26% in 2017. Without a doubt, coal mining will increase this percentage in the district if we defend this development. This will also help diversify the province's economy and avoid migrant labour and over-concentration of the economy in one province. & xA0;The biggest worry in SA is that the just transition is led by people who claim to represent communities such as Emalahleni, when it comes to stopping mining in the area. These NGOs and environmental lobbyists do not care about the development of our economies, but the fulfilment of their emotions and political agendas. It is therefore in the hands of the communities to lead these development projects to develop their communities. These NGOS are funded by developed countries, some of which are continuing with coal mining and building more coal power stations. Many of these developed countries used coal to build big factories for their development and employment of their people. It is time the community of Emalahleni stands up and asks the leadership to defend this development for the benefit of the people who want and need it. The community must come up with a strategy for the department of mineral resources to continue with this development. NGOs have taken the DMRE and its minister to court to stop coal mining and stop building coal power stations as part of the energy mix. Building a coal station in Emalahleni will create employment opportunities for the communities who live here. That is why we must support the DMRE, so that the public will see that we support the development of the coal project as part of the energy mix.

JUST TRANSITIONA chance to reshuffle the stacked decks of net-zero measurements Current rules greenwash rich countries' climate record, and SA can do something about itIs SA more carbon-intensive than Saudi Arabia? According to a draft proposal for net-zero investing in sovereign debt that the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) may soon adopt, it is. The proposed carbon intensity metric ranks SA dead last. If the Glasgow alliance adopts this standard, it could compel financial institutions with $130-trillion in assets to steer their sovereign debt investments away from SA. But how can SA, whose trade-adjusted per capita carbon emissions are less than a third of oil-producing Saudi Arabia's, be considered more carbon-intensive? President Cyril Ramaphosa has embraced climate action as a core pillar of domestic and foreign policy, and the world is watching the country's ambitious plan to steer a just transition away from coal. Last November, at COP26 in Glasgow, the $8.5bn Just Energy Transition Partnership with SA was widely lauded as one of the summit's few tangible climate finance victories. What has changed? As global investors embrace the goal of net zero what seems like the dull details of measuring a country's carbon intensity hide questionable assumptions with material consequences for international investment flows. Proposed carbon intensity metrics greenwash rich countries' outsized responsibility for climate change at the expense of SA and other developing countries. Instead of supporting the just transition, the GFANZ is in danger of further stacking the deck in favour of wealthy countries. The proposed carbon intensity metric uses two tricks that systematically favour rich countries and put SA last. Perversely, this could steer financial flows away from SA government bonds just as the state needs to finance the restructuring of the energy sector away from coal and mitigate the effects for the hundreds of thousands of SA families who depend on coal for their livelihoods. Thankfully, it is not too late for SA to stop this flawed approach and demand that net zero and other sustainable investing frameworks ensure that the incentive structure they create matches their rhetoric of supporting the just transition in developing countries. But, before we get there, let's start with some context. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, recognises that on a per-person basis advanced economies bear disproportionate responsibility for causing climate change. And they have more resources for fighting it. Article 9 of the Paris Agreement commits developed countries to help fund climate adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. At COP26, wealthy countries once again failed to deliver on even their modest climate finance commitments. In part to make up for this failure, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's COP26 finance adviser, Mark Carney, announced the launch of the GFANZ. With more than 450 firms and $130-trillion of assets, the alliance aims to align the global financial system with the targets of the Paris Agreement and catalyse trillions of dollars of investment in climate adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. After the bright lights of climate summitry fade, the real work begins. An army of technical committees works to finalise standards for every asset class. The sustainable finance standard-setting process treats sovereign debt as a $60-trillion afterthought. When sustainable finance standard-setters try to fit sovereign debt into frameworks initially built for corporates and equities, it can result in incentive structures that skew financial flows away from developing economies and harm the sustainability goals that the investment standards claim to support. The first and most potent trick for greenwashing rich countries' high emissions is to change the denominator of the carbon intensity calculation. If affluent countries look bad when judged by their per capita emissions, what happens if we choose something more flattering, such as GDP, as a denominator instead? The formula for emissions per capita and emissions per GDP are the same, except the latter multiplies the denominator by GDP per capita. The equation explicitly rewards rich countries simply for being rich. All else being equal, a country that is twice as wealthy can pollute twice as much at the same level of emissions per GDP. Using this carbon intensity metric in effect gives countries a larger carbon budget just for having a higher GDP per capita. Using current GDP per capita estimates from the IMF, this standard would give Saudi citizens an implicit carbon budget 360% larger than that of SA citizens. And the wealthy Swiss can pollute 550% more than South Africans at the same level of carbon intensity measured by emissions per GDP. The second trick is choosing the scope of carbon emissions for the numerator. The proposed standard uses what are known as territorial emissions, which only measure the carbon emissions that take place within a country's borders. Territorial emissions are an excellent standard for wealthy countries because advanced economies outsource their dirty work to developing countries. Consumption-based emissions, which adjust for trade, tell a different story. Switzerland's consumption-based emissions are three times higher than its territorial carbon emissions because the country imports the carbon-intensive products its prosperous population consumes. In contrast, SA's consumption-based emissions are 30% lower than its territorial emissions because it exports natural resources consumed elsewhere. A failure to adjust for trade systematically undercounts the impact of affluent countries' consumption patterns on climate change. There is still time to stop this greenwashing magic act. The GFANZ has yet to decide on net-zero standards for sovereign debt. SA's leadership and ambition in promoting a just transition towards a low carbon future give it a moral force to push against this misguided proposal. Ramaphosa consistently reminds climate negotiators that developing countries have done the least to contribute to climate change and will be the worst affected by it. Consequently, rich countries must live up to their commitments to finance and enable a just transition in developing countries. COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh this November is the first African COP. SA leaders and negotiators should push the GFANZ to align the incentive structure of net zero investing towards accelerating the just transition in developing countries, not hindering it. They should reject metrics that systematically stack the deck against SA and other developing countries. And they should ensure that rich countries finally deliver their climate finance commitments. Good intentions and vague promises to support a just climate transition do not matter for investment flows. Incentive structures do.

The UK's new Prime Minister (and former Foreign Secretary), Liz Truss, enters Downing Street with a full and urgent in-tray, dominated by the highest inflation rate for 40 years and concerns across the country about the cost-of-living crisis. Whilst urgent domestic policy is required, these national issues are symptomatic of a broader set of global crises, including the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Therefore, the Prime Minister also has an urgent foreign policy agenda to address, within which international development has a vital role to play. The FCDO's long-awaited International Development Strategy was published in May, but the vision it set out broadly failed to meet the scale of the global challenges we face. These are the eight international development priorities we believe the new PM should be addressing: 1. Climate justice Climate and environmental change are creating pervasive threats to the UK and all other countries, highlighted most recently by the UK's record-breaking summer temperatures and the devastating floods in Pakistan. Ahead of the COP27 climate summit, where the UK hands over the COP Presidency to Egypt, the new PM should take the opportunity to show global leadership in the pursuit of climate and environmental justice. This means prioritising support for those most disadvantaged and already experiencing the worst impacts and ensuring that their voices and knowledge count in decision making. It also means investing in effective mitigation and adaptation initiatives, which are purposefully connected to interconnected issues, such as access to water, food, healthcare, gender justice, education and land rights. 2. Health security The UK's expertise and investment in tackling epidemics has been world leading. The production and roll-out of technologies such as Covid-19 vaccines, and in health systems strengthening and universal health coverage (UHC), are valued by low-income countries and have been a critical part of the UK's soft power. As the Covid-19 pandemic proved how globally interconnected our health is, investment in future pandemic preparedness, that embraces institutional, knowledge and system questions (not just pharmaceutical interventions), and is guided by inclusive, localised and context-specific evidence, is critical for the UK, as well as globally. 3. Multilateral Cooperation and the SDGs Universal challenges such as climate change and global health require co-ordinated international responses, which link local and national action with global level commitments and solidarities. Multilateral agencies such as the UN are best placed to lead these. Whilst there is room for reform, it's short-sighted for the FCDO to have cut support for multilateral agencies without a clear assessment of the impact this will have. IDS research shows that today's crises - conflict in Ukraine and Ethiopia, climate change induced floods and heatwaves, pandemics, and rising inequalities - are all interconnected and require a rounded response, not a strategy that handpicks a few priorities in isolation. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide the framework for addressing development challenges as a whole and should be at the core of the Government's strategic planning. 4. Food equity Whilst exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, rising global food insecurity is the result of a vastly unequal global food system, where power is held by vested interests and low crop yields are aggravated by drought or flood, conflict, and economic instability. In the short-term, the UK needs to help stabilise global food supplies, but longer-term reforms are also needed, such as supporting more regenerative methods of food production and agro-ecological approaches that enhance agricultural biodiversity and resilience. By investing in 'bottom up' research working with smallholder farmers and pastoralists in low-income countries, the FCDO can help identify what works best where, preventing the 'one-size-fits-all' technological solutions that often cause more problems than they solve. 5. China Development has a great role to play in support of UK diplomacy. For the UK-China relationship where official channels of communications and diplomacy may deteriorate, strong relationships fostered by development and knowledge exchanges provide alternative channels for constructive dialogue. There is particular potential around issues such as the vast Belt and Road Initiative, climate change, global health and the SDGs. Liz Truss is reported to be planning to take a more robust stance on the UK's approach to China but we believe constructive dialogue with China around approaches to development co-operation should continue. 6. Transparency In July, the department was downgraded in the Aid Transparency Index and the FCDO has been repeatedly criticised for its poor record on transparency since the DFID/FCO merger, including from the cross-party International Development Committee, Bond, the UK network of International Development NGOs and from the National Audit Office. At a minimum the FCDO must be transparent about forward-looking budgeting and provide public data on planned ODA spending. To 'stand up for freedom around the world' as set out in the International Development Strategy, the FCDO must lead by example and have a clear framework for transparency, monitoring and evaluation, by which it can be held accountable. 7. Restoring 0.7 Reducing the UK's ODA budget from 0.7% of GNI to 0.5% in 2021 resulted in a real terms reduction of \£34.6bn. This dramatically reduced the UK's ability to deliver the high-quality aid and interdisciplinary research essential to improving the lives of people around the world. It also dismantled international science partnerships and damaged the UK's global reputation. Other countries such as the US, Japan, Canada and Australia increased international aid budgets in light of Covid-19 and other global crises, yet the UK Government downgraded its contribution. Re-instating the Conservative manifesto commitment to 0.7, along with appointing an International Development Minister at FCDO would demonstrate to the rest of the world the UK's commitment to international development, and tackling the challenges that affect us all - poverty and inequalities, disease and climate change. 8. Investing in international research There is a vital role that the knowledge generated from UK-led international development research can play, with a threefold benefit to the UK as well as to global communities - contributing to the Government's goal for the UK to be a science superpower, benefiting the UK directly through lessons learnt and new discoveries that can apply to challenges at home, and finding effective and value for money support for lower and middle-income countries. Whilst we welcomed the commitment to evidence and expertise in the International Development Strategy, this should go further. It is important to ensure that social science contributions are valued as much as technical science 'solutions'. It is important to champion the importance of working with and from the perspectives of people living in poverty and marginalisation, and not overlooking the capabilities of low-income countries in generating knowledge for vital transformations. The commitments to UK science must be complemented by investing in the equitable, interdisciplinary and international research partnerships needed to find contextual solutions that will benefit marginalised people around the world, and in many cases, here in the UK as well. In conclusion, through UK-led international development, the new Prime Minister has the opportunity to help tackle the significant crises we all face. As new disasters around the world unfold with increasing frequency and severity, we are constantly reminded that the cost of delay or denial is far too high.

POWER GENERATIONEuropean U-turn on gas presents historic opportunity for Africa This continent is well placed to exploit its resources to smooth the energy transitionAradical change has taken place in recent months in the international debate concerning natural gas. As recently as November, gas was on its way to being banned, with many voices calling during the COP26 climate forum for a reduction of subsidies for gas production. Three months later, in early February, the European Commission enthroned gas, which emits half the greenhouse gases of coal and 30% less than oil, as a "transition energy", and labelled it "green" for the purpose of gas-fired power plant investments under certain conditions. Three weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine, destabilising energy markets. With Russia providing 40% of the EU's gas needs, the energy source found itself at the centre of diplomatic wrangling, fuelled by Moscow's threats to shut off supply. European countries reacted differently to the looming threat. While Germany experienced weeks of domestic political turmoil over its dependence on Russia, Italy was quicker to react, immediately looking south for an alternative to eastern gas. The Mediterranean nation, which received 45% of its gas from Russia, has already signed supply agreements with Algeria, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola in an attempt to reduce that dependency. Gas financing, which became scarce in recent years, is suddenly finding its way back to Africa. Even before this reversal a study by the Norwegian firm Rystad Energy, published in February, estimated that the continent, whose coasts are rich in natural gas deposits, could see gas production double from 1.3-million to 2.7-million barrels of oil equivalent by 2030. The European U-turn on gas holds great promise for Africa, but also serves as a reminder of the potential the continent holds in the process of energy transition and the fight against climate change. Its main advantage resides in mining resources like cobalt, copper, graphite, nickel, aluminium and lithium, which form the basic elements of a notably metal-hungry energy transition. A solar power plant requires three times more metal than a gas turbine to produce 1 terawatt of electricity, while a wind farm uses four times more. From Guinea to Tanzania, Gabon, SA and Zambia, these "green" metals, which are also essential components in making batteries for electric vehicles, are present in abundance. Then there is its potential for hydrogen production. Reasonable land costs, sunshine and proximity to Europe, with its growing demand, should in theory allow Africa to provide large-scale hydrogen production at a competitive price. There are already a dozen green hydrogen projects in development in countries such as Egypt, Namibia and Mauritania. Admittedly, hydrogen is still years away from becoming a profitable and sufficient energy vector, but it is a new window that is opening. However, these new venues are not the "new paths to African prosperity" that organisations such as the Africa CEO Forum are calling for. While this promised windfall is good news at the end of a period that strongly affected the continent's public finances, Africa must not repeat the mistakes of the past in betting its future on unprocessed resources. The global market for electric vehicles, particularly hungry for cobalt, could reach more than $1.3-trillion by 2030, just under a third of the GDP of Africa as a whole in 2021. African governments and economic leaders must seize the opportunity of this emerging industry and consider the best strategy to capture part of this added value on African soil. While ambitious, such a plan is far from being impossible. According to the UN Economic Commission for Africa (Uneca), producing batteries in the DRC would cost 30% less than in the US and 20% less than in China. SA and Morocco have already embarked on the production of electric vehicles. According to various estimates, Africa will need more than 2-million trucks to make the African Continental Free Trade Area effective. "Why wouldn't these trucks be electric trucks produced in Africa," Uneca secretary-general Vera Songwe wondered aloud recently. Similarly, the strong comeback of African gas in global politics must serve the electrification of the continent. African leaders can now ensure this local dimension exists in gas projects; rather than committing to projects that ignore the socioeconomic effects, international financiers could grant preferential conditions to more virtuous ambitions. Finally, Africa must defend its interests and make its voice heard to fight against the establishment in Europe and the US of new tariff barriers in the name of the environment. These protectionist strategies, which are seen by some in Brussels and Washington as easy ways to clear the Western conscience, only serve to hamper the investment capacity of African companies and make the transition even more difficult. In these battles, the development of infrastructure essential to the emergence of regional markets of sufficient size will be key. Resolute and continuous political leadership will also be essential. In a recent development on this front the DRC and Zambia signed a co-operation agreement in April that seeks to facilitate the development of the value chain of electric batteries on their soil. This global green transition is a multifaceted, generational opportunity for Africa, a historic chance. Its mineral, gas, renewable energy, green hydrogen and forest heritage resources must contribute to the industrial transformation the continent has not yet successfully achieved. The process should continue to accelerate, driven in part by the increased accessibility of cutting-edge technological breakthroughs available throughout the world. COP27 will take place in November in Cairo and presents itself as a perfect opportunity for the continent to move forward in this direction, and help reconcile energy transition and economic transformation. It is up to the continent, particularly its pan-African investors and national champions, to strike a delicate balance: making green transformation a source of growth and industrial transformation, and making its deposits the source of local and regional development. After two years of a pandemic that has unsettled economies globally, and while a raging war in Europe has brought economic sovereignty back to centre stage, Africa's ambition to create new paths to prosperity is strong. \</doc>

Programme Director Representatives of governments Business leaders and captains of industry, here present Members of the diplomatic corps Ladies and gentlemen Introduction It is my privilege to welcome all of you to the 9th Southern Africa/Europe CEO Dialogue. In February this year, leaders from Africa and Europe met in Brussels for the 6th European Union - African Union Summit. A key outcome of that Summit was the adoption of a joint vision for a renewed partnership between Africa and Europe. This, we said, will be a partnership based on solidarity and shared values towards a prosperous, sustainable and shared future. We committed to work together to build more diversified and inclusive economies. We also agreed on strengthening investment, supporting industrialisation and the development of sustainable and resilient value and supply chains. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is in this context that this 9th Southern Africa/Europe CEO Dialogue is taking place. We are also meeting against a backdrop of two major global crises: the lingering COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This Dialogue, therefore, is not only a platform to advance the vision we articulated in Brussels, but also to respond to the challenges of our time. It is also a platform to strengthen trade and economic relations between Europe and South Africa. Economic outlook Due to a significant slowdown in the world's largest economies including the Euro Area, the IMF projects global growth of 3.2 percent, from a forecast of 4.4 percent in 2022. The 2023 outlook has also been revised downward to 2.7 percent. Global headline inflation is projected at 8.8 percent in 2022, before slowing to 6.5 percent in 2023 and 4.1 percent in 2024. In the short-term, global monetary policy will continue to tighten as central banks intensify the fight against inflation. Global trade volumes will slow significantly from 10.1 percent in 2021 to 4.3 percent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023. Disruptions to global trade, supply and value chains have tilted the balance of risks to Africa's economic growth outlook to the downside. Africa's real GDP growth is now projected at 4.1 percent in 2022; significantly lower than the near 7 percent recorded in 2021. Growth is likely to come in at around 4 percent in 2023. In South Africa, real GDP contracted by 0.7% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2022, compared to a downwardly revised expansion of 1.7 percent quarter on quarter in the first quarter. We expect domestic monetary policy to tighten further in the near term. Persistently high inflation, rising interest rates, slowing global growth, increased volatility and uncertainty all point to a challenging outlook in the near to medium term for South Africa's economy. Domestic GDP growth for 2022 has been revised downward to 1.9 percent from a projected 2.1 percent, and to 1.4 percent in 2023 from 1.6 percent. Our response to the challenging economic environment In response to the challenges of the moment, our focus has been on the implementation of structural reforms to improve competitiveness, industrial policy to boost manufacturing and measures to strengthen the capacity of the state. We are doing this within a clear and stable macroeconomic framework, including a stable and flexible exchange rate, low and stable inflation, and sustainable fiscal policy. On structural reforms, we are creating a competitive energy market, dealing with inefficiencies in our ports and rail network, addressing our visa regime to attract skills and investments and are reforming our water and telecommunications sectors. Work continues to build a capable and developmental state which is a necessary precondition for inclusive growth. We are also intervening to reverse the decline in fixed investment, including through ensuring policy certainty and addressing the cost and ease of doing business. The capacity of our state-owned enterprises to invest in the economy, to unlock growth and job creation is being enhanced. Infrastructure budgets across government are being increased while capacity for project planning, preparation and execution is being enhanced. Spending on capital assets is the fastest growing expenditure item on our budget. Action is being taken to modernise procurement and improve contract management. Our investment in fighting crime and corruption is being strengthened as part of removing impediments to investment and growth. The African continent is devastated the most by the worsening effects of climate change, which poses an existential threat to humanity. We are committed to the goal of a just transition. Our approach envisions accelerating investment in new generation capacity, while preserving the livelihoods of communities adversely affected by the transition from coal and other fossil fuels. We reiterate President Ramaphosa's call at COP 27 that Africa needs to build adaptive capacity, foster resilience and address the loss and damage due to climate change. For this to happen, our continent needs a predictable, appropriate and at-scale funding stream and technological support. This places a responsibility on developed nations to honour their commitments to those countries with the greatest need and that confront the greatest environmental, social and economic effects of climate change. Programme Director, in the words of Andrew Steer, the CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund, this is a sobering moment not only for Africa, but also for the world. It is a time of a slowing growth globally, geopolitical tensions, and the lingering impact of COVID-19. It is also a time of the perfect storm of rising food prices, rising energy prices, rising interest rates, as well as increases in the impact of climate change and vulnerability. All of this is happening when the fiscal space has narrowed considerably in many countries and access to global capital even more constrained. Faced with this stark reality, the need for ongoing dialogue among key decision makers has never been greater. We need a deeper conversation on accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth on our continents. We need to find ways of strengthening trade among ourselves in this new environment. We must strive for prosperity and sustainability for our people and continents. I have no doubt that this will be the platform where all of these issues will be thoroughly deliberated upon. I wish you a successful Summit. Thank you! \</doc>

'The worst is yet to come' The world economy is undergoing a tectonic quake with many low-income countries facing debt distress, writes from the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington DC They were standing in the aisles and hanging over the balconies at a panel debate on the world economy at the International Monetary Fund's Washington headquarters this week. It was a celebrity panel of sorts of the finance world, chaired by CNN anchor Richard Quest, with participants who included IMF MD Kristalina Georgieva, UN climate envoy and former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Cambridge University's Mohamed El-Erian and the finance ministers of Nigeria and Ireland. It drew enthusiastic applause at the end when Georgieva said: "We love being with each other. We get energy from it ... After three years of Covid we are back in this place and we are together." But that, as she said, was the good news. For the rest, the view from the annual meetings of the IMF and its sister organisation the World Bank Group was bleak. The world economy is going through a huge regime shift, not a routine cyclical adjustment, said Carney. Georgieva described a transition from a world that was predictable when interest rates and inflation were low to one facing exogenous shocks. "We have to change our mindset to be more precautionary and be prepared to think of the unthinkable," she said. After more than a decade of very low inflation and near-zero interest rates in advanced countries, inflation has spiked, driven initially by supply chain constraints and labour shortages coming out of Covid, then by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the fuel and food price crises that have resulted. Led by the US Federal Reserve, advanced countries are increasing interest rates at a rapid pace after calling it wrong last year and acting too late. The fallout for global markets and the global economy has been dramatic, as the IMF's latest set of flagship reports, released at the annual meetings, reflects. The IMF sees global inflation rising to a peak of 9.5% later this year. It has cut its global growth forecast for next year to 2.7%, with countries accounting for a third of the global economy expected to contract this year or next. Its research department director, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, warned this week that "the worst is yet to come". The IMF says global growth could slow to as little as 1.1% next year - which would mean per capita incomes would be stagnant given annual global population growth of 1.1%. Over at the World Bank, economists have slashed their growth forecast for next year to 1.9%, which the bank's president, David Malpass, described as "close to recession". Incomes are falling; poverty levels are rising. Malpass warned too of a fifth wave of debt crisis facing the developing world. With borrowing costs climbing and capital flowing out of emerging markets and developing countries as investors flee riskier assets towards the safety of the dollar, many low-income countries are facing debt distress, the IMF and World Bank have warned. "A debt crisis overhangs Africa and the world doesn't have a technique to provide debt relief even when this is unsustainable," said Malpass. More broadly, with global financial markets extremely volatile and unpredictable, the IMF warned this week of the risks to global financial stability. "Central banks around the world need to keep a steady hand, with monetary policy firmly focused on taming inflation," said Gourinchas. On the fiscal side, countries are grappling with the challenge of dealing with the cost-of-living crisis when they have little space to do so - and the IMF and World Bank have urged that their priority must be to target any support at the poorest and most vulnerable. Director of the IMF African department Abebe Selassie said South Africa had been impacted quite a bit by global economic conditions and pressure from financial markets on top of its internal challenges. "This is unfortunate because with higher global commodity prices South Africa could have benefited from exploiting this if it had been in a better position". Yet, in the context of all the doom and gloom, South Africa shapes up relatively well, despite its severe economic challenges. It acted earlier than many to contain inflation, and it has benefited from the commodity price boom, which provided a windfall that helped to cut the government's deficit and debt ratios to well below what had been expected. But it is a troubled neighbourhood that South Africa is in. IMF deputy director Gita Gopinath told a panel discussion on debt restructuring that 60% of low-income countries were at risk of debt distress. Many are in Africa. The IMF's Sub-Saharan African outlook, published on Friday, said the "worldwide slowdown, tighter global financial conditions and volatile commodity prices spill into a region still struggling with the fallout from the pandemic ... Rising food and energy prices are striking at the region's most vulnerable, with 123-million people acutely food insecure." It added that public debt and inflation in Sub-Saharan Africa are at levels not seen in decades, amid ongoing supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine, with double-digit inflation in more than one-third of countries, "eroding household purchasing power and adding to social tensions". Georgieva's frequent call during the meetings was for countries to work together to devise a co-ordinated response to the multiple crises facing a volatile world. But she emphasised too that the fund's role is precisely to support its 190 member countries when they are in need. The IMF has $1-trillion (about R18-trillion) of lending capacity available and has so far lent just $350bn. Not only is it lending to countries in need of emergency assistance - especially those whose economies are "innocent bystanders" taking pain from exogenous global shocks. It has also come up with new lending facilities to tackle what it sees as the big macro challenges - food insecurity and climate change. It recently launched a new "food shock" facility, with Malawi the first country to take advantage of it. It has also pushed the climate crisis to the top of its list of macroeconomic challenges, adding climate action to the list of measures that the IMF itself and its member countries need to pursue. At the annual meetings this week it launched its new Resilience and Sustainability Trust. This is the first time the IMF has introduced a longer-term lending facility, designed to enable countries to invest in climate mitigation or adaptation infrastructure, for example, not just to provide them with short-term balance of payments assistance. Its efforts complement those of the World Bank, which has an extensive programme of climate finance - including to South Africa, with which the bank is in talks over a $300m loan to support the decommissioning and repurposing of Eskom's elderly Komati power station. Indeed, the next big outing for the global community will be the COP27 climate change summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, next month, where South Africa and its international partners are due to announce details of South Africa's $8.5bn just energy transition investment plan. It is hoped it will provide a model for other coal-dependent emerging markets to follow. And with the world desperately seeking new sources of growth at a bleak time for the global economy, the "green" transition is being seen as the best chance for a return to growth in years to come.

End hydrogen fantasy Your edition of November 29 contained a number of articles that might have prompted the late Nigerian author Chinua Achebe to write a sequel to his well-known novel Things Fall Apart. Criminality is rampant at Eskom and load-shedding is at a record high. Cement production is at a record low. High interest rates are crippling the housing market, and everyone is strapped for cash this Christmas. President Cyril Ramaphosa is hoping to get $8.5bn from donors so we can transition to a green tomorrow. It seems the half that doesn't get stolen will be wasted on the flavour of the month - green hydrogen, a chemical fantasy that even sophisticated economies aren't sure about. The money could buy eight small modular reactors, and our energy problems would be over. However, in a country whose products are mainly low-grade politicians and a few rugby players, this seems unlikely. Bernard BensonParklandsSA has unveiled a plan at COP27 to target the green hydrogen industry. Picture: BLOOMBERG \</doc>

Mampara of the week - Ntsiki Mashimbye Lead balloon spoils the climate Areal diplomat, trained in careful and tactful communication, never fails to read the room. But not Ntsiki Mashimbye, our envoy to Egypt, who made an awkward attempt at stand-up comedy at a function on the sidelines of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday. There was embarrassed silence when this Mamparassador proudly announced that he was a "failed businessman and failed civil servant" and that the job of an ambassador is much easier. "All you have to do is eat and drink on behalf of the nation. I am sure all of you would do that." The clumsy joke earned him a reprimand from his red-faced bosses at the department of international relations, who have booked the poor jester a flight home for more tongue-lashing. Now this Mampara can add "failed diplomat" to his CV. \</doc>

As world leaders gather in New York for the opening of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly this week, the security horizon is undoubtedly dark. From the geopolitical shockwaves of the war in Ukraine, to military spending, nutrition and food security, to our stewardship of the planet, far too many key indicators are heading in a dangerous direction. We can, and must, turn them around. In the words of UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres in his 2021 report Our Common Agenda, 'the choices we make, or fail to make, today could result in further breakdown, or a breakthrough to a greener, better, safer future'. Making the right choices requires political will and leadership, based on the best available knowledge. That last aspect is SIPRI's stock in trade. A 'watershed moment' The theme for the 77th General Assembly session is 'A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges'. Evidence of these interlocking challenges is everywhere: the floods in Pakistan, war and insecurity afflicting every region of the world, the erosion of arms control and stagnation in disarmament, rising hunger, the economic and political turmoil that has followed the Covid-19 pandemic, and the list goes on. These interlocking challenges share some common features. Their consequences, and often their drivers, do not respect borders or alliances. They are characterized by uncertainty and volatility. They tend to cut across traditional policy domains. This has a clear implication: the only realistic path towards a 'greener, better, safer future' on this planet lies through cooperation. Countries, societies and sectors must work together to meet global challenges, put aside tensions and political polarization, and restore their faith in institutions and the rules-based international order. Earlier this year, Secretary-General Guterres invited me to become co-Chair of his High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism, alongside Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former president of Liberia. The Advisory Board's task is to come up with concrete suggestions for how to improve cooperation at the multilateral level, how we can ensure it is fit to meet the challenges of an unpredictable future and the urgently needed transition to more sustainable, peaceful societies. To accomplish this mission, we will rely heavily on science and expertise. Addressing the crisis of the biosphere SIPRI's Environment of Peace report explores the most dangerous sets of interlocking challenges we face: the complex and unpredictable ways that climate change and other environmental crises are intertwining with more human-centred aspects of security. Besides providing policy insights, the Environment of Peace report documents the indirect pathways linking climate change impacts and insecurity, and the interactions between climate, conflict and food security, thus continuing SIPRI's contributions to working out how UN peace operations must adapt to climate change. The biosphere crisis can only be successfully addressed through cooperation. Countries need to share green technologies and innovative solutions. They need to agree on fair ways to share vital natural resources and settle disputes peacefully. There must be give and take; action in one society to mitigate impacts on another. Countries also need to agree on fair ways to distribute the burdens, costs and benefits of a green transition. From South Asia to sub-Saharan Africa to Indigenous communities around the world, those most vulnerable to the impacts of the crisis of the biosphere are often those least responsible for causing it--something illustrated starkly most recently by the devastating floods in Pakistan. There is a clear moral case for wealthier, industrialized countries to meet their climate finance commitments and to compensate the most affected countries for loss and damage. But there is also a strong security case for doing so. Localized insecurity can quickly spread. From national security to common security A logical response to such threats to their shared interests would be for countries to put differences aside and pull together. Instead, they have, by and large, followed a path of division and militarization. Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year, that was clear. SIPRI data shows large increases in global military expenditure in the last two years, as well as in arms imports to Europe, East Asia and Oceania. At the same time, we are also seeing rapid and radical developments in weapon systems, technologies and even ways of executing a conflict. A new, expensive and risky arms race is well under way. There is an urgent need to breathe new life into nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control. Disappointingly, the recent 10th Review Conference of the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) ended without agreement on the way forward. However, there were signs of hope. The conference produced much to build on in the next five-year review cycle. Notably, all of the five NPT-recognized nuclear weapon states (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) agree on the necessity of measures to reduce strategic risks. These will be important steps. However, what is needed most of all is a shift away from the pursuit of security through military capability to investing in peace and common security. Once again, cooperation will be key. Successful cooperation needs to be underpinned by reliable, non-partisan information and analysis. As Secretary-General Guterres declares in Our Common Agenda: 'Now is the time to end the "infodemic" plaguing our world by defending a common, empirically backed consensus around facts, science and knowledge.' The Secretary-General correctly characterizes 'facts, science and knowledge' as a public good that it is in everyone's interest to protect. They provide valuable common ground for discussion--even when trust between the parties is lacking. They inform effective solutions. They make it possible to verify that others are following rules and living up to commitments. They give early warning of emerging challenges and imminent dangers. The Environment of Peace report highlights the fact that risks and uncertainty lie not just in the external challenges we face, but also in the actions taken to address them in the transition towards sustainability. This transition needs to happen at unprecedented scale and speed, using novel solutions in an environment of uncertainty. There will inevitably be setbacks, unintended, unanticipated consequences of well-intentioned policies. There will also be resistance, parties who need convincing that the costs justify the benefits. To keep the transition just and peaceful will demand communication, cooperation, trust and agility to deal with unexpected risks and change course quickly to avert them. For this, we will need to produce and disseminate even more reliable and verified information. SIPRI will continue to be a resource in this regard. Opportunities for change The UN General Assembly has a highly ambitious agenda for transformative change. The landmark Summit of the Future, scheduled for September 2024, has been billed as 'the moment to agree on concrete solutions to challenges that have emerged or grown since 2015'. The COP27 However important intergovernmental forums like this are, the task of tackling our interconnected challenges is continuous and society-wide. Solutions need to come at the multilateral, national and subnational levels. I am both proud and daunted to be picking up the mantle of Chair of the SIPRI Governing Board as we confront these difficult challenges ahead. SIPRI's core mission as a source of freely available, reliable evidence, fair-minded analysis and balanced assessment of options, as a convenor of dialogues, and as a provider of support to the formulation and implementation of international agreements and instruments remains as important as ever.

These have "cost Africa dearly", said HYPERLINK https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/african-development-bank-appoints-professor-kevin-chika-urama-acting-chief-economist-and-vice-president-economic-governance-and-knowledge-management-complex-47763 Kevin Urama , the bank's acting chief economist and vice-president. "These have cost different countries huge amounts of resources in building infrastructure that was swept away by floods and destroyed by cyclones, and so on ... The little space of development that we gain gets wiped out with infrastructure, roads, housing and lives lost due to these climate effects." Losing GDP Earlier this year, the bank published its HYPERLINK https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/african-economic-outlook-2022-highlights African Economic Outlook 2022 HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/just-energy-transition/ just energy transition The report detailed how, despite having 17% of the current global population, Africa has accounted for a negligible 3% of cumulative worldwide carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions historically. "However, climate change and extreme weather events disproportionately affect the continent, with severe economic, social and environmental consequences for its people." For Urama, these extreme weather events show him that climate change is an "existential challenge" because Africa doesn't have control over it. "It doesn't matter whether Africa doesn't emit one tonne of CO2 or emits a zillion, because the actions of the rest of the world will continue to impact the continent," he said. Africa is the least climate-resilient\~ region\~ in\~ the\~ world, with high vulnerability to climate change and low readiness for adaptation to climatic shocks, he said. Gas the transition fuel HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/sustainable-development-goals/ sustainable development goals "Energy consumption is highly correlated with GDP growth. So, restraining country access to energy means restraining social and economic progress of countries. In Africa, low per capita electricity consumption (550kWh) compared to other regions significantly constrains economic production and structural transformation in African economies."\~ Energy transitions evolve gradually over time, often over several decades, defined by technologies, market incentives, policy shifts and consumer behaviour. " HYPERLINK has served as a transition fuel during the period, allowing countries to gradually reduce coal in the energy mix cost effectively." Africa's energy mix has a lower carbon intensity compared to other regions. The report notes how the share of coal in the mix has declined progressively from 54% to 29% between 1985 and 2020, respectively. A just energy transition, the report said, requires that African countries harness opportunities in the fast-expanding global HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/renewable-energy/ green growth technologies and markets. "Africa has unique competitive advantages in several green growth sectors: materials, components, products and services, which it needs to harness to benefit from the green transition. Renewables and decentralised energy systems are critical for rapid energy access and need to be co-designed with grid expansion." Global policy shifts, technology and market trends suggest that continued investments in fossil energy, the report said, run the significant risk of becoming stranded assets in the coming decades. This means that they will lose value or turn into liabilities before the end of their expected economic life. "Therefore, while Africa must maintain a balanced energy mix to manage short-term energy security, rapid investments to harness the significant opportunities in the green growth sectors will be critical for the continent's competitiveness in the medium to long term. Africa's resource potentials present unique opportunities for the continent to lead in several green development sectors."\~ Energy necessity Climate policies, such as those on climate finance, are increasingly being interpreted to "short-change" Africa's development, Urama said. The level of growth and development informs the level of capacity to adapt to climate change effects.\~ "And the policies that are now being interpreted, for example in the energy sector, is that we cannot use our natural assets to be able to build out the energy systems, which we have very low levels of in Africa. "If you look at that transition over time in every energy system, the use of gas as a transition fuel is fundamental. And this is for achieving global sustainability goals ... because when you think about transitions, you need to think about two sides of the equation. One is not stopping economic growth and not polluting the environment so much that we will not be able to recover."\~ If Africa increases its gas to power significantly, "our calculations are that it will increase CO2 emissions by 0.6%. That's infinitesimally small, considering that Africa is still at a very low level of emissions and still has a very high carbon headroom," he said. Global climate goals won't be achieved The report found that to adequately implement its https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/all-about-ndcs#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20an%20NDC%2C%20or,update%20it%20every%20five%20years. nationally determined contributions Collectively, African countries received only $18.3-billion in HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/climate-financing/ climate finance between 2016 and 2019. This leaves an average climate financing gap of $108-billion per year during the period. "With current trends, Africa's conditional NDCs will not be delivered. The implications of not achieving the NDCs in Africa for global sustainability is obvious - the global climate goals will not be achieved."\~ Urama said: "The climate finance flows are not coming to Africa at the scale that it should to be able to have Africa transition quickly to the new energy systems, climate-resilient development pathways, that are required for this. On all sides, I see an existential challenge that is actually beyond Africa's control." Developed countries, the report said, should honour their commitment to make available $100-billion annually to developing countries to support climate action, as new and additional resources. "If one thinks of what is owed in carbon debts to Africa ($4.8-trillion), what is required to implement the NDCs ($1.6-trillion by 2030), and what is currently received annually ($18.3-billion), it tells its own story." Global commons problem Climate change, Urama said, is a global commons problem. "That means it doesn't matter how much Europe or America spend on their environmental policy and climate policy. If Africa doesn't do the same, the world is still in trouble ... Greenhouse gases don't need a visa and [neither] do the impacts." The social inequalities that are being created will increase pressures on economies. "It will increase terrorism, it will increase unskilled migration - it will include all those public policies that countries spend billions and billions trying to address. So why not address the problem at its roots? Because, if we remove poverty, we will increase peace and security, we will reduce migration and the drivers ... for terrorism." Ahead of HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop27/ COP27 , Urama hopes that African countries rally together to request increased climate finance and increased knowledge and technology flows to help Africa build its adaptation capacity, "because without that it's really very unlikely that African countries will be able to continue to shoulder the impacts of climate change".

More than 150 countries have now signed up to a global pact to reduce methane emissions, 50 more than signed on when the initiative launched last year, the US and EU said yesterday. The pledge to cut emissions of greenhouse gas 30% this decade is seen as critical to global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C. China and India, the top two methane emitters, have not signed up for the pact. COP27 deal into something the nearly 200 countries at the climate summit can agree on. The draft document repeats many goals from last year\' s UN climate talks while leaving contentious issues still to be resolved. The summit was due to end today, but it could extend into the weekend. Countries are at odds over how to provide financial support for countries hit by economic loss and damage due to climate-driven disasters. | Reuters \</doc>

Military expenditure in preparing for and partaking in conflict deviates the world's scarce economic resources from the pressing problems of hunger, poverty, access to education and basic healthcare Military expenditure in preparing for and partaking in conflict deviates the world's scarce economic resources from the pressing problems of hunger, poverty, access to education and access to basic healthcare Food security The way humankind easily resorts to violence baffles the mind. Despite unfathomable traumatic experiences from the use of violence, people are refusing to unlearn the inclination to destructive tendencies. World instability is a direct result of deliberate conduct of global superpowers. Most of the conflicts that have ravaged parts of the world have been proxy wars between superpowers clashing over territorial ambitions and control over the resources of other nations. This is an unfortunate reality given that countries used as pawns bear the full-length brutality of the wars. Scars of violence, particularly warfare, remain for generations with distinct marks of permanent pain and grief. Over a century since the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War 2, the Japanese freeze at the mention of the attacks. More than half a century since the Holocaust, the Jewish community is still horrified by the massacres. Ordinarily, you would expect global leaders to diligently and actively spend every effort in avoiding war. Instead, they use every available resource to prepare for war and have no shame in flexing their military muscles at each other. Vast amounts of money are spent by the world's leading economies on assembling weapons of enormous genocidal power and in researching war strategies that can annihilate an enemy in the shortest time. The collective annual defence budget of the world's major powers, the US and Nato - $1.1-trillion (R18.6-trillion), China - $229bn (R3.8-trillion), Russia - $69bn (R1.17-trillion) and Japan $43bn (R729bn), is a staggering $1.4-trillion (R23.7-trillion). The Russian estimate is widely believed to be just a fraction of the actual expenditure. This is a frightening preparedness for war. India is among the top four military spenders - with expenditure estimated at between $50bn (R848bn) and $77bn (R1.3-trillion) in 2021, exceeding the reported figure of Russia. This is a densely populated and vastly rural country, with vast economic inequality. A huge portion of the Indian population is languishing in poverty and suffocated by hunger. In 2021, global military expenditure exceeded $2-trillion (R33.9-trillion). This is a ridiculous amount of money being spent on war machinery. Though national security remains a key government responsibility, anyone would struggle to justify such expenditure on defence. The UN World Food Programme estimates $1-trillion (about R17-trillion) would be enough to feed all the world's hungry people and eradicate global hunger by 2030, an amount less than the annual defence budget of Nato and the US. Globally, more than 830 million people are reported to be hungry, 50 million of them on the brink of famine and in desperate need of assistance. Nearly half of the deaths of children under the age of five are preventable and are attributable to malnutrition and inadequate nutrition, which expose children to risk of dying from common diseases. Malnutrition and inadequate nutrition are consequences of global hunger and can be solved. According to Unicef, it would cost the world less than $100bn (R1.69-trillion) a year to deliver full immunisation to all the children whose families cannot afford it. This is less than half the annual defence budget of China. The world has just emerged from a devastating Covid-19 pandemic that ripped livelihoods apart and further worsened global inequality. When it became clear that vaccines were the best method available to retreat the virus, the OECD estimated that $50bn (R849bn) was enough to vaccinate the whole world - an amount equivalent to the annual defence budget of Russia. At the recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt, funding climate adaptation once again dominated proceedings. The world's leading economies, which are excessive military spenders, seem unwilling to commit the $100bn (R1.69-trillion) to $200bn (R3.39-trillion) a year needed for climate adaptation. This is despite the fact that these same countries are the leading carbon dioxide emitters. Climate change continues to cause unprecedented socioeconomic damage estimated to be worth more than $100bn (R1.69-trillion) a year. The Pakistan floods alone earlier this year resulted in $40bn (R679bn) worth of damage. Climate change is disrupting food production and pushing the world further from food security. Despite the many socioeconomic problems, global powers have the indecency to spend unjustifiable amounts of money on their capacity to destroy. These are global leaders that are supposed to champion a collective construction of a better world for all. Sadly, the opportunity cost of military expenditure is global welfare. It is the provision of basic healthcare to the poorest of the poor. It is the provision of food aid to parts of the world ravaged by hunger. It is the provision of education to vulnerable girls in poorly developed communities. It is the promotion of sustainable use of the world's resources. The effect of war is double-edged. Military expenditure in preparing for and partaking in war deviates the world's scarce economic resources from the pressing problems of hunger, poverty, access to education and access to basic healthcare. War itself leads to apocalyptic economic destruction, pegs back global health through disease outbreaks and worsens global exposure to hunger. The cruel and ruthless business of war is a financially expensive exercise. The US spent close to $2-trillion (R33.9-trillion) on the Iraq war, a war that would later emerge as based on a false intelligence report. This the equivalent of two thirds of Africa's GDP and half of what is estimated to cost to eradicate global poverty over a 20-year period. Former US president Barack Obama once pompously boasted of his country's defence budget, which is the highest in the world. Given the size of the US, the need to protect both its territory and gigantic economy are understandable but the extent to which it prepares and spends on war is morally outrageous. It is rather curious how a country such as the US, which the world looks up to as the epitome of a democratic nation, a reverend of the rule of law, including international law, and a firm believer in human rights, would be willing to spend so much on war rather than follow its principles and invest every effort and resource towards the building of peace. The US justifies its frequent involvement in foreign wars as a moral obligation. There is legitimate substance to its assertion that it is the defender of the vulnerable. The US government has played a pivotal role in defending vulnerable states from invasion. In 1991, the US would step in to defend the tiny state of Kuwait from invasion by Iraq, notwithstanding that barely a few years later it had stood with Iraq in the Iraq-Iran war. It quickly discarded an ally for a just cause. For reasons varying from legitimate to illegitimate, the US has been directly involved in almost every fourth war between nations anywhere in the world. There are US wars that were driven by an unsatiable appetite for dominance. The Vietnam War was a deadly 20-year conflict without a justifiable purpose. The US's involvement in foreign wars has led its foes to label it an imperialist power. Russia particularly disdains US foreign influence and rarely hesitates to side with enemies of American wars, under the pretext that it is an alternative guardian of the defenceless. Momentous expenditure on defence by the world's superpowers has brewed a volatile mistrust between them, releasing them in a contest for military superiority. The nuclear weapon race is another senseless bout of superpowers competing to have the ultimate destruction powers. The Russian federation is no exception to exorbitant expenditure on war. It is widely estimated that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has so far cost the federation between $100bn (R1.69-trillion) and $200bn (R3.4-trillion) in both direct war expenses and the economic consequences of the conflict. The economic impact of Ukrainian war is being felt the world over. Grain shortages and a subsequent rise in grain prices have been noticed since the outbreak. Sanctions imposed on Russia as a way to restrain it are causing an energy crisis across Europe due to the Russian energy embargo. Fuel prices have reached unprecedented levels. It is fair to say the world's problems of hunger, inequality, poverty, access to basic education and healthcare are artificial problems. The resources to solve these problems are there - they are just being used in war. There is need for a new generation of leaders to emerge to take the world forward. A generation of leaders who are oriented towards the building of a better world for all, peace through peaceful means, and who are capable of exercising restraint in the face of provocation.

The EU is aiming to clinch deals on three new laws to fight climate change in time for the annual UN climate negotiations next month, in a bid to boost its political clout at the talks. Nearly 200 countries agreed at last year\' s UN COP26 negotiations to upgrade their climate pledges by this year\' s summit, to bridge the gap between their current plans and the far faster reduction in greenhouse gas emissions needed to avert disastrous climate change. But two weeks away from the COP27 summit in Egypt, only two dozen countries have done so and the 27-country EU was still to decide whether to raise its own target. Meanwhile, the EU has agreed to speed up negotiations on three emissions-cutting laws, so it can arrive at the UN summit with newly-ambitious climate policies. The policies being fast-tracked are a law to ban sales of new fossil fuel cars in the EU by 2035, expand Europe\' s natural CO -absorbing  sinks like forests, and set binding national emissions-cutting goals. | Reuters \</doc>

New mindset for SA cities Balancing the books and becoming green are not mutually exclusiveWith COP27 global climate change conference topics on everyone's lips, a warning has been sounded that South African cities don't have the luxury of sitting and waiting for sustainability funding - such as the R400bn promised by Europe at COP26 - to fall into their laps. Cities themselves need to realign their thinking, their budgets and their management to ensure that they are attractive destinations for such investments. And investment secured must be targeted at addressing 21st-century skills requirements in increasingly low-carbon urban economies as much as it does in meeting capital development needs. That will be vital to determining how people, particularly young people, can be absorbed into the system in the decades to come. Today, for example, electrical engineers might focus on high-voltage systems fed by Eskom, but in tomorrow's world they will have to have green energy-orientated expertise. That was a key message to emerge from the three-day Cities Festival, run by the South African Cities Network (SACN), celebrating the 20th anniversary since its establishment in 2002 as a learning network for the metropolitan and city political leaders and administrators who run the country's metros. The metros were responsible for generating 70% of GDP at that time. The SACN, which also pulled together the Integrated Urban Development Framework - which among other things seeks to address the integration of a fragmented infrastructural legacy of apartheid in a just transition - now works with metros to co-create solutions to challenges, making it an applier as well as a generator of knowledge, particularly in the fields of policy and advocacy and of peer-to-peer learning. Essentially, cities and metropolitans need to act now if they are to have any chance of being ahead of the development curve in two decades' time, says SACN executive manager programmes Nosipho Hlatshwayo. An issue identified at the conference that needs to be resolved is governance, as cities are still not achieving clean audits. Related to governance is the coalition chaos that is bedevilling service delivery as political parties focus - since November's local government elections - on gaining power at a local government level. Hlatshwayo says a number of solutions to the coalition dilemma are being explored. Typically, she says, one could look at the US system, where the president and the party political representatives are elected in separate ballots. We could look at applying that here by electing metro mayors and councillors separately. In a similar vein, there are Scandinavian and German examples which might also form part of the solution, where coalition agreements are legally binding so cannot simply be tossed aside on a political whim, and also legally bind the signatories to implement defined policies. Resolving the coalition dilemma, particularly now that coalitions are part of South Africa's political fabric, would also contribute towards good governance. Equally important is efficient and comprehensive data collection, down to the minutest detail, so that cities and metros can plan and implement initiatives on an informed basis rather than on guesswork. This has long been one of SACN's objectives, having first mooted the establishment of a data almanac in 2004 as a living resource of city data, covering five sets of indicators: urban population, productive city, inclusive city, sustainable city and well-governed city indicators. Though uptake has been slow, cities are coming on board, with eThekwini municipality recently launching its "one truth" strategic hub platform. It is aimed at creating a central data hub that enables the city, through accumulating and analysing all data collected, to gain a real understanding of what's happening in their domain, so that trends are revealed - right down to accurate information on how long, for example, it takes a waste collection truck to do its rounds. The accumulation of such information, which could include evidence about truck delays because of potholes or mechanical failures, can then be used to improve service delivery. Similarly, data collected at a day clinic showing a preponderance of people with stomach bugs from a particular location might point to the need to address water treatment problems in a particular area. It even assists those interacting with cities, such as business. Typically, taking the waste truck example, it might alert business to the need to gear up to provide servicing and repair facilities for the mechanically unreliable waste removal fleet. Hlatshwayo says the conference also identified the need for metros to move away from regarding central government as the general provider of needs, whether water, electricity or housing, for example, and local authorities taking these on themselves. Where the funding for electricity might now be through Eskom, in future, the focus needs so be increasingly on local authorities as the organisations that actually bring water and electricity to homes, working with independent power producers. Most of the metros are in the throes of creating independent sources of electricity from Eskom - though these might be motivated as much by the need for greater sustainability and resilience in the face of the economic and social costs of long-term load-shedding as they are aimed at gearing to meet the needs of climate change. eThekwini, for example, has been working on a project involving the conversion of waste gas into electricity. The City of Johannesburg has worked on a similar project, to supplement supplies in its own city. The City of Cape Town already has a hydropower station. In a similar vein, The City of Tshwane also tried to establish a waste-to-electricity project, but it ran into difficulties. "These are still fundamentally at the stage of being case studies, and the problem is that they are not happening at the rate or scale that the economy requires to address the energy issue," says Hlatshwayo. "Among the hurdles are governance issues that prevent these projects from being rolled out on the required scale. Not least of these is that municipalities rely on electricity distribution as a source of revenue. This creates a complication when a private contractor looks to feed electricity into the city's grid," Hlatshwayo says a similar situation is panning out with waste collection, where some cities use private contractors to collect and separate waste at source for recycling, while others are still wedded to the old concept of the city collecting everything and dumping it in a landfill site. One of the dilemmas in making the change is that whereas it is easier using only one truck to collect all waste, two or more are required to collect separated material. This has led to "waste pickers" playing a significant and vital role, both in terms of waste collection and separation and in creating informal employment, though some municipalities simply regard them as a nuisance. Work is being done to better assimilate this element through solutions such as waste separation centres. There is, she adds, also a valid argument that before addressing high-minded projects such as waste separation, the issue of providing universal waste collection to include many areas that are now excluded should be the priority of metropolitan municipalities. The message to the cities is that all these issues need to be mainstreamed and addressed as a priority. "It is true these changes require money, but the longer we procrastinate, the more it is going to cost, and the greater the impact on the environment. And, while they do require start-up capital investment, the cities should also recognise that these projects often have a positive effect on long-term revenue generation and job creation. "The reality is that the cities are moving over from a mindset that applied to city management from the time of the Industrial Revolution to one that embraces sustainability, social responsibility, clean energy, efficiency through the use of data, taking into account what needs to be achieved in future rather than what was done before. But this needs to be done far faster and in a just way to the benefit of society at large." The reality is that, along with climate change, there are a host of challenges confronting hard-pressed metros and their communities that will manifest in the next 20 years as the country's population swells by around 20-million people and urbanisation continues apace. Some cynics may argue that the city should be focused on meeting current targets and balancing the books rather than focusing on issues such as becoming green cities. However, Hlatshwayo says, these two do not need to exist in parallel universes and they are both essential. "For South African cities to move forward, you need the whole of society and government working together, as we all have a common goal. Cities cannot do it in isolation, nor can the private sector, academia, NGOs and NPOs. There are countless examples of people and organisations that have taken the initiative and are not waiting for councils to hand them something on a plate," she concludes. As the SACN continues to host the Urban Festival, it wants to thank the sponsors and lead partner, the Gauteng Partnership Fund (GPF). The SACN and the GPF share a common objective of facilitating and enabling urban development and transformation in South African cities.

Renewables plan submitted, but blackouts dampen business SA submitted an investment plan to donors who have pledged $8.5bn (about R152bn) to accelerate the country's transition to renewable energy that could serve as a model for other emerging economies, two sources familiar with the matter said. Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya confirmed the proposal was ready but declined to say whether it had been submitted. Negotiators are racing to conclude the deal before the COP27 climate talks in Egypt next month. SA buyers are showing a bigger appetite for new-energy vehicles (NEVs), which include petrol-electric hybrids and full-electric vehicles. Motor industry body Naamsa said 2,689 new NEVs were sold between January and August, a more than 1,000% increase over the same period last year. ANGLO American and \'c9lectricit\'e9 de France agreed to form jointly owned Envusa Energy to develop wind and solar projects in SA. Envusa would initially develop more than 600MW of wind and solar projects in the country, they said. \</doc>

Heatwaves will become so extreme in certain regions of the world within decades that human life there will be unsustainable, the UN and the Red Cross warned yesterday. Heatwaves are predicted to  exceed human physiological and social limits in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and south and southwest Asia, with extreme events triggering  large-scale suffering and loss of life , they said. Heatwave catastrophes this year in Somalia and Pakistan foreshadow a future with deadlier, more frequent, and more intense heat-related humanitarian emergencies, they warned. The report was released in advance of next month\' s UN\' s COP27 climate change summit in Egypt. They said aggressive steps needed to be taken immediately to avert potentially recurrent heat disasters.  On current trajectories, heatwaves\' impact would be large-scale suffering and loss of life. Projected future death rates from extreme heat are staggeringly high \- comparable in magnitude by the end of the century to all cancers or all infectious diseases. | AFP \</doc>

Meat, milk, and eggs are bad for you, and livestock is bad for the environment. Growing negative narratives about cattle's contribution to climate change are shrinking the growth of the strategic livestock sector on which the livelihoods of more than 1.3 billion people in the world depend. In Africa, livestock farming is life, providing food, nutrition, jobs, draught power, income generation, and a source of cultural significance. But the benefits of keeping cattle, goats, sheep, and pigs are lost when it comes to the impact of livestock on the environment are mentioned. As a result, livestock farmers are suffering from the low investment in the livestock sector, which has the potential to drive economic growth, address poverty and achieve many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Researchers, farmers, and entrepreneurs, lamenting the negative perception about livestock in contributing to climate change, are calling for a balanced discussion to highlight livestock production, not as a problem but as a solution in tackling climate change, especially in developing countries. Ian Wright, Deputy Director at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi, Kenya, admits that livestock production is today topical for its negative impact on the environment, an area where it can provide a solution. There are suggestions that milk, meat, and eggs are becoming foods to avoid, yet livestock is one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in Africa, he said. "Livestock and livestock systems are very different in different regions of the world, and the cultural significance and economic importance varies but the contribution of livestock to food and nutrition security in Africa is absolutely critical," Wright told IPS in an interview. He added that the majority of people in Africa tend not to eat adequate sources of protein and micronutrients, in contrast to the situation in the Global North, where people will benefit from eating less meat and animal-sourced foods. We can 'meat' in the middle "The global discussions around livestock tend to be dominated by voices from the Global North, so it is important we ensure that perspectives on the role of livestock from the Global South, including Africa, are heard at the top table of global events like the Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ) to articulate the positives about the role of livestock which no doubt has its challenges," Wright said. "The livestock sector must address these shortcomings as there are opportunities to make livestock part of the resilience and adaptation efforts; for example, climate variability makes cropping too risky, but livestock can still be raised producing food from land that cannot produce crops." Better livestock management and improved feed regime can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock, while sustainable rangeland management promotes the fixing of carbon in the soil. Livestock production contributes to about 40 percent of the global value of agricultural output while supporting the livelihoods, food, and nutrition security of billions of people around the world, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). A growing population and rapid urbanization are also driving an appetite for animal-sourced foods from eggs, milk, beef, and pork, which are also some of the best and often affordable sources of protein. Livestock provides energy-dense and micronutrient-rich foods, which are important for pregnant women and particularly babies in the first 1 000 days of life. Scientists are clear about livestock's huge hoof print. Assessments by the FAO show that total emissions from global livestock represent 14.5 percent of all human-induced GHG emissions. Cattle, in particular, are responsible for the most emissions, at about 65 percent of the livestock sector's emissions, largely of dangerous methane gas. As a result, there is a growing movement to stop eating meat and instead tuck it into plant-based diets to promote health and save the environment. However, Africa is one of the regions in the world where malnutrition is rising. More people are going hungry, and even more, have no access to nutritious food. Livestock is a solution. The World Bank notes that Africa is losing between 3 and 16 percent of its GDP annually because of childhood stunting, and animal-sourced foods can contribute to reducing that problem, says Adegbola Adesogen, Director of the Food Systems Institute and the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Livestock Systems at the University of Florida. "We should prioritize livestock-sourced foods in nutrition and increase access to these foods across Africa because there is low consumption of animal-sourced foods in Africa, Adesogen urged. "For example, the consumption of meat in Nigeria is about less than five percent of what is consumed in Argentina, yet the animal-sourced foods contain a plethora of vital macro and micro nutrients which are vital for children of Africa for their growth and health yet most of the interventions address malnutrition in Africa neglect animal-sourced foods." Investing in livestock The livestock sector attracts little investment compared to other agriculture sectors but contributes up to 40 percent of the agriculture GDP in Africa. Of the $129 billion Official Development Assistance in 2020, only 4,3 of that was funneled into agriculture, and livestock received just 1.3 percent, Wright noted. Smallholder farmer, Emma Naluyima from Uganda, who has integrated crop growing and livestock in growing a thriving farm enterprise on an acre of land, says supportive policies are critical in promoting the development of the livestock and the livelihoods of livestock farmers. Naluyima, speaking during a panel discussion at a session hosted by the ILRI during the 2022 Alliance for a Green Revolution Forum in Rwanda, highlighted that livestock is productive and profitable when farmers are supported to do it correctly. Naluyima's one-acre integrated farm, based on the recycling of farm resources to provide natural fertilizers and pesticides as well as biogas, generates $100,000 in income annually. While many countries in Africa have failed to allocate at least 10 percent of their public expenditure on agriculture in line with the Malabo Declaration on Agriculture commitments, the livestock sector was barely getting more than 3 percent of the agriculture budget, yet it has the potential to transform the continent's food systems. Wright says livestock can solve multiple food system challenges in Africa as it is a significant contributor to the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. For a continent that continues to bear the double burden of food and nutritional insecurity, livestock-sourced foods can reduce malnutrition for the most vulnerable communities, he said. "The livestock sector must address these shortcomings as there are opportunities to make livestock part of the resilience and adaptation efforts; for example, climate variability makes cropping too risky, but livestock can still be raised producing food from land that cannot produce crops," said Wright. ILRI has worked with various governments to develop Livestock Investment Master Plans, which have enabled governments and the private sector to get the best value from the sector, which battles to show a return on investment. For example, through a developed Livestock Investment Master plan, the government of Ethiopia was able to leverage $500 million from private sector investment in the livestock value chain. "With the right policies and a balanced narrative about the livestock sector, livestock can attract investment and boost economic growth in Africa," said Wright. IPS UN Bureau Report \</doc>

Leading by example Cape Town's dynamic mayor has pulled out all the stops to maintain Cape Town as the best destination in Africa, the cleanest city on the continent and - surely to follow - the leading city in discouraging single-use plastic. Meanwhile, the national government is focused on allowing an oligarch's obscene motor yacht into Cape Town harbour, against the recommendations of most of the Western world ("Cape Town mayor calls on Pandor to block entry of Russian superyacht", October 24). Geordin Hill-Lewis took a brave stand, knowing full well he would be ignored. Like former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani he is leading the city by setting an example. Now he should tell retail traders to cease accepting single-use plastic bags, especially vegetable and shopping bags, as these are the ones that land up in our oceans, on Table Mountain and littering our suburbs and townships. Historically Cape Town has banned outdoor billboards that compete against Table Mountain. With the COP27 Andrew PollockConstantia \</doc>

Many people around the world, especially those among the political far-right, do not accept the climate change crisis. Over the years their thinking, behavior, and policies dismissing climate change have largely continued and impaired global efforts to address global warming and environmental degradation. The unequivocal findings of numerous reports on the consequences of climate change by international and national scientific committees have not been sufficient to counter climate change skepticism. On the contrary, the reactions of skeptics to the climate change reports can be summed up in the phrase "Don't confuse me with the facts". The rise of right-wing populism in many countries also constitutes a potential obstacle to addressing climate change. Right-wing parties and politicians frequently voice climate change skepticism, denials, and opposition to climate change policies, such as carbon taxes. The nonacceptance of the climate change crisis persists despite its increasingly visible worldwide consequences. It's indeed difficult to avoid news reports of climate change events, including extreme heat, flooding, droughts, destroyed crops, wildfires, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation, smog, pollution, and increasing rates of human morbidity and mortality. Even the signed petitions to government leaders from thousands of scientists from around the world warning of a climate emergency and the concerns, demonstrations, and protests of younger generations calling for urgent action have not been enough to convince skeptics of the climate change threat, especially among the political right. In general, the majorities of most populations are concerned about the climate change crisis. A global survey by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) of public opinion in 2021 covering 50 countries and over half of the world's population found that nearly two-thirds of those surveyed believed climate change is a global emergency. The proportion of the population believing climate change is an emergency ranged from a low of 61 percent in sub-Saharan Africa to a high of 71 percent in Western Europe and North America. The proportions of the remaining four regions varied from 63 to 65 percent. In addition to the UNDP study, a 2022 PEW survey of nineteen countries across North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region found a median of 75 percent viewing global climate change as a major threat to their country. However, views concerning the climate change threat differed considerably across political groups. By and large, surveys find that those of the political right are less likely than those of the left to believe in the reality and anthropogenic nature of the climate change crisis. In the 2022 PEW survey, for example, those on the political right in fourteen countries were found to be consistently less likely to consider climate change a major threat to their country than those on the political left. The largest difference among those fourteen countries was in the United States where 22 percent of the political right considered climate change a major threat to their country versus 85 percent on the political left. Other countries with a large difference between those on the political right and left were Australia with 47 and 91 percent, Canada with 46 and 80 percent, and Germany with 59 and 83 percent, respectively. Moreover, the differences in the views of political groups concerning climate change in some major countries have widened over the recent past. In the United States, for example, the difference between Republicans and Democrats has increased substantially over the past quarter century. Near the start of the 21st century 20 percent of Republicans and 36 percent of Democrats believed that global warming will pose a serious threat in their lifetime. By 2021, the difference between Republicans and Democrats had widened substantially to 11 percent versus 67 percent, respectively. Also, differing views about climate change are reflected in the statements and policies of political parties and their leaders. For example, the Vox party in Spain dismissed climate change as "a hoax", the National Front in France promoted climate skepticism, and Sweden's Democrats described the climate debate as "weird" in budget discussions, arguing that the seriousness of climate change is exaggerated, and scientific evidence is being distorted. The unequivocal findings of numerous reports on the consequences of climate change by international and national scientific committees have not been sufficient to counter climate change skepticism. On the contrary, the reactions of skeptics to the climate change reports can be summed up in the phrase "Don't confuse me with the facts" In Germany the far-right Alternative f\'fcr Deutschland (AfD) challenged the global scientific consensus on climate change, describing it as "hysteria". In addition, the AfD abandoned the previous cross-party consensus on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) In the United States, the world's second largest emitter of CO2 producing about 14 percent of the world's CO2 emissions, the former Republican president said that he was not a believer in man-made global warming, called climate change "a hoax" invented by China, and said scientists were "misleading us" on climate change. Moreover, he dismissed federal scientific reports on climate change and sought to roll back climate regulations, including increasing U.S. coal mining and reconsidering fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. In China, the world's top emitter of CO2 producing about 30 percent of the world's CO2 emissions, some report that the Communist Party's climate change skeptics are mostly shunned and may chatter in the shadows. After decades of rejecting climate change and its visible consequences, such as choking smog hanging over most of the country, no higher-up Chinese officials are saying that climate change is a hoax and while some may have that view, they won't say it. In India, which the IPCC highlights as a vulnerable hotspot, some find politicians denying or ignoring climate change. They note that in the election manifestos of the two leading national parties, the Indian National Congress and the BJP, neither of them mentioned the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Also at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, India reportedly found the IPCC's recent report too gloomy and requested a section on mitigation be removed. A preliminary draft of the Glasgow pact called on countries to "accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels". In the final negotiations, however, India and China, whose coal-fired power stations provide approximately 70 and 60 percent of their electricity, respectively, said they would agree only to "phase-down unabated coal" and the phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. In addition, when heading to COP26, Australia, Japan, and Saudi Arabia were among those countries lobbying the United Nations "to play down the need to move rapidly away from fossil fuels". Some wealthy nations also questioned paying more to poorer states to move to greener technologies. In preparatory meetings for the November COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, African nations pushed back against abrupt moves away from fossil fuels. They stressed the need to avoid approaches that encourage abrupt disinvestments from fossil fuels, which would threaten Africa's development. For example, Nigeria, Africa's largest population, indicated that gas was a matter of survival for the country. The latest report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows greenhouse gas emissions are continuing to rise. The IPCC report also states that current plans to address climate change are not ambitious enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is a threshold necessary to avoid even more catastrophic impacts. A number of social and psychological explanations have been offered for climate change crisis nonacceptance and skepticism, especially among the right-wing conservatives. In the past, the lack of knowledge about the causes of climate change was believed to play a major role. More recently, political ideology and party identification are believed to strongly influence how people selectively seek and interpret information about climate change. Political beliefs and motivations have also been found to guide people's attention, perceptions, and understanding of climate change evidence and mitigation efforts. In addition, some are not willing to accept the climate change crisis and proposed mitigation measures because they challenge their need to protect existing socioeconomic structures and traditional lifestyles, raise their anxieties about declines in living standards, and threaten development efforts, particularly in less developed countries. In sum, it is certainly the case that the majority of most populations worldwide, especially the younger generations, are concerned about the climate change crisis. However, it is also the case that despite the overwhelming unequivocal evidence, many people, especially far-right conservatives, continue their nonacceptance of the climate change crisis. Such a political divide with vocal opposition from the political far-right with the continuing support, political lobbying, and extensive efforts of various extractive industries is worrisome and consequential. It undermines global plans to address climate change and thwarts more ambitious efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the goal set in the Paris Agreement to avert the worst effects of global warming Joseph Chamie is a consulting demographer, a former director of the United Nations Population Division and author of numerous publications on population issues, including his recent book, "Births, Deaths, Migrations and Other Important Population Matters." \</doc>

THE first draft of a deal being hashed out at the COP27 climate summit in Egypt would keep a target of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C, but leaves many of the most contentious issues in the talks unresolved ahead of today\' s deadline. Egypt\' s COP27 president urged negotiators to overcome their differences, while poor nations slammed the draft as unambitious for not addressing their need for money to cope with damage already being wrought by climate-driven storms, droughts and floods.  Time is not on our side, let us come together now and deliver by Friday, COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said in a letter to delegates yesterday. The 20-page draft for a hoped-for final agreement repeats the goal from last year\' s Glasgow Climate Pact to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C, and  welcomes the fact that delegates had for the first time begun discussions on launching a so-called loss and damage fund for countries being ravaged by climate impacts. US Special Climate Envoy John Kerry said last week that a few of the nearly 200 countries gathered for the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh had been resisting language around 1.5\'b0C, the level of warming beyond which scientists say climate change impacts dangerously spiral. Kerry declined to name the countries. Kerry held a closed-door meeting yesterday with his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua at the summit.  We\' re making progress. Let\' s let the talks continue, he said as he left the meeting. Highlighting frustrations over the talks so far, a delegation from Britain, the EU and Canada met COP27  There\' s still a lot of gaps in the texts, said a spokesperson for Britain\' s COP26 presidency, which hosted last year\' s climate summit in Glasgow.  They need to build on what has gone before. Climate-vulnerable countries, including small island nations, pointed out that while the draft deal mentions loss and damage, it does not include details for launching a fund, a key demand in the talks that delegates have worried could stymie a final agreement. Wealthy countries for years have resisted a loss and damage fund over fear that it could open them up to endless financial liability for their historical contribution to climate change.  Anything less than establishing a loss and damage fund at this COP is a betrayal of the people who are working so hard to clean up this environment, and the people fighting for humanity, said Molwyn Joseph, Antigua and Barbuda\' s environment minister. | Reuters \</doc>

INVESTING FOR DUMMIES Does South Africa have a viable investment case to present to international investors? This was a question put to Lord Robin Renwick, the UK's ambassador to South Africa from 1987 to 1991, by the FM this week. It's pertinent, as President Cyril Ramaphosa is on the international circuit, speaking at COP27 in Egypt, and will soon go to the UK to press the investment case. Says Renwick: "Everyone will be polite to Ramaphosa, but everyone knows things aren't working out economically in South Africa." The country is now rated, for example, the 10th-worst destination for mining investments. "Anyone who has had the misfortune, as I've had, of dealing with your department of mineral resources, never wants to have anything to do with them again," he says. The toxic cocktail of corruption, arrogance and incompetence persists - and is anathema to investors, who are already having to deal with Transnet's mounting failures. Renwick is convinced this will change. But while he cites the seven weeks it took the UK to get rid of a prime minister who denied economic reality, the danger is that it could take years for South Africa's leaders to get the message.

Durban - The great pyramids of Giza in Egypt have been a marvel for the world to look at, offering an insight into what life would have been like before the modern world was built. But recently, residents in Egypt have constructed a new pyramid, this time made up of waste. Volunteers built the waste pyramid on the Nile, which will pose as a symbol for Egypt as they will play host to the next UN Global Climate Change Conference from November 6-18 ( COP27 ). The VeryNile organisation is an initiative focused on cleaning up the Nile River and promoting sustainability. They are supported by the Drosos Foundation, One Earth One Ocean and the Egyptian Ministry of Environment. The dirt was then packed into triangular blocks and placed one on top of the other, just as the ancient Egyptians stacked the sedimentary stones.

Speaking at the 77th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Macky Sall, president of the Republic of Senegal and acting president of the African Union, said the time is now to change the world. SPEAKING at the 77th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Macky Sall, president of the Republic of Senegal and acting president of the African Union, said the time is now to change the world. "The theme of this session shows how urgent it is to act together to ease tensions, heal our planet, reduce persistent North-South inequalities, and restore meaning to multilateralism." Sall said the Security Council is called upon first and foremost to treat all threats to international peace and security, including in Africa, in the same way. The terrorism that is gaining ground on the continent is not just an African affair, he added. "It is a global threat which falls under the primary responsibility of the Council, guarantor of the collective security mechanism, under the organisation's Charter." "Also, we invite the Council to better engage with us in the fight against terrorism in Africa, with more appropriate mandates and more substantial means. "Furthermore, the African Union calls, once again, for the lifting of foreign sanctions against Zimbabwe. These severe measures continue to feed a feeling of injustice against an entire people, and to aggravate their suffering in these times of deep crisis. "In the Middle East, we reiterate the right of the Palestinian people to a viable state, coexisting peacefully with the State of Israel, each within secure and internationally recognised borders. "We call for the de-escalation and cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, for a negotiated solution, in order to avoid the catastrophic risk of a potentially global conflict. "Almost eighty years after the birth of the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods Institutions, it is time to establish a world governance that is fairer, more inclusive and more adapted to the realities of our time. It is time to overcome the reluctance and deconstruct the narratives that persist in confining Africa to the margins of decision-making circles. It is time to uphold the just and legitimate African demand for Security Council reform, as reflected in the Ezulwini Consensus. "In the same spirit, I recall our request to grant a seat to the African Union within the G20 so that Africa can, finally, be represented where the decisions are taken, which commit one billion four hundred million Africans. I warmly thank the partners who have already expressed their support and invite others to consider our candidacy favourably. "With regard to economic and financial governance, I draw the General Assembly's attention to the 2022 Report on Financing for Sustainable Development, produced by some sixty multilateral institutions, including the IMF, the World Bank, the Committee of Basel on Banking Supervision, the International Association of Insurance Regulators and the Financial Stability Board." This report identifies shortcomings in rating agencies' assessment processes and stresses the importance of applying "transparent methodologies so as not to undermine confidence in ratings". "We are concerned that the perception of risk in Africa continues to be higher than the actual risk, which increases insurance premiums and penalises the competitiveness of our economies. This is why Africa renews its proposal to the Response Group to the Global Crisis on Food, Energy and Finance so that it undertakes, in conjunction with the G20, the IMF and the World Bank, a constructive dialogue with rating agencies on improving their working and assessment methods. "In the same spirit, faced with the unprecedented scale of the global economic crisis, the African Union reiterates its call for the partial reallocation of Special Drawing Rights and the implementation of the G20 Initiative to suspend the service of the debt. This unprecedented shock further weakens the weakest economies and makes their liquidity needs even more pressing to mitigate the effects of generalised inflation and support the most vulnerable households and social strata, especially young people and women. "Added to this is the management of new or old health emergencies, including cancer, a silent killer that continues to claim millions of victims around the world. Sall further called for mobilisation in favour of the Rays of Hope campaign of the IAEA, for the reinforcement of the capacities of the member countries, African in particular, in the fight against cancer, thanks to nuclear technologies such as medical imaging. , nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. A few weeks before COP-27 in Sharm El Sheikh, Africa is renewing its commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. "At the same time, we want to reach a consensus for a just and equitable energy transition, as was the case at the Africa-Europe Summit last February, at the enlarged session of the G7 Summit in June, and recently at the Rotterdam Forum on financing for adaptation in Africa. "It is legitimate, fair and equitable that Africa, the least polluting continent, and the furthest behind in the industrialisation process, exploits its available resources to have basic energy, improve the competitiveness of its economy and achieve universal access to electricity. I remind you that to this day more than 600 million Africans still live without electricity. Let us also work towards the achievement of the objective of 100 billion dollars per year, in support of the adaptation efforts of developing countries, and the financing of the Programme for Accelerating Adaptation in Africa, under the aegis of the AfDB and the Global Centre for Adaptation. "Moreover, we consider the financing of adaptation not as aid, but as a contribution by the industrialised countries to a united global partnership, in return for the efforts made by the developing countries to avoid the polluting schemes which have plunged the planet in the current state of climate emergency. Beyond economic emergencies, I have come to convey the message of a continent determined to work with all its partners, in a relational ethic of trusting dialogue and mutual respect. "I have come to say that Africa has borne enough of the burden of history that it does not want to be the focus of a new cold war, but rather a center of stability and opportunity open to all its partners, on a mutually beneficial basis. I came to say that we are not ignoring Africa of the problems, which must be pacified and stabilised. But I also came to say that we also have solutions in Africa, with its 30 million km2, its human resources, more than 60% of the world's arable land, its mineral, forest, water and energy wealth. "Yes, we have the Africa of solutions, with hard-working governments; a vibrant and creative youth who innovate, undertake and succeed; millions of men and women who work hard to feed, educate and care for their families; who invest, create wealth and generate jobs. This Africa of solutions wishes to engage with all its partners in reinvented relationships, which transcend the prejudice according to which whoever is not with me is against me. "We want an open multilateralism that respects our differences; because the United Nations system, born from the ashes of war, can win the support of all only on the basis of shared ideals and not of local values   set up as universal norms. "It is by working together while respecting our differences that we will restore strength and vitality to the purpose of the United Nations: that is to say, to save present and future generations from the scourge of war, to promote peaceful coexistence of peoples and promote progress by creating better living conditions for all."

UN climate talks got a boost yesterday as Brazilian president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva launched the country back into the battle to curb warming and global leaders reaffirmed key pledges. With G20 leaders issuing a final communiqu\'e9 committing to pursue the more ambitious limits on global heating, momentum at the climate meeting in Egypt was generated at the sidelines of the fraught negotiations.  I am here to say to all of you that Brazil is back in the world, said Lula, as he received a hero\' s welcome from hundreds of people applauding him at an Amazon region pavilion in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.  Brazil was not born to be an isolated country, said Lula.  We will put up a very strong fight against illegal deforestation, he said, announcing the creation of a ministry of indigenous people to protect the vast region\' s vulnerable communities. Lula had climate diplomacy meetings with US envoy John Kerry and China\' s Xie Zhenhua. Kerry told a COP27 biodiversity panel yesterday that the US would work with other nations to help protect the Amazon. Under Bolsonaro, a staunch ally of agribusiness, average annual deforestation increased 75% compared with the previous decade.  We need a new sense of hope to build trust and momentum towards a positive outcome at COP27 , said Brazilian climate campaigner, Mariana Paoli, Christian Aid\' s global advocacy lead.  President Lula\' s election victory in Brazil has the potential to breathe new life into this process with his progressive agenda that seeks to bring Brazil back to the table and end the disastrous climate policies of his predecessor. In another boost to the UN climate process, a final communiqu\'e9 from world leaders meeting at the Group of 20 talks in Bali, Indonesia included key promises to  pursue efforts to curb global warming to 1.5\'baC above pre- industrial levels, a safer limit according to scientists. The document, which also reiterated a commitment to phase out  inefficient fossil fuel subsidies over the medium term, was welcomed by observers as a way to galvanise the climate talks as they enter the final days. The G20 meeting was also the stage of a crucial meeting between US President Joe Biden and China\' s Xi Jinping, where the two leaders agreed to resume their climate co-operation. Ani Dasgupta, head of the World Resources Institute, said positive signals from leaders at the G20  should put wind in the sails of negotiators in Egypt. Bolsonaro, who did not attend the G20 summit in Bali, has maintained a low profile. While his government has a pavilion at COP27 , Lula deployed two of his former environment ministers to lay the groundwork for his visit. | AFP \</doc>

A new initiative to expand Africa\' s participation in voluntary carbon markets was launched at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change being held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh yesterday Led by a 13-member steering committee of African leaders, CEOs, and carbon credit experts, the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) was launched to support the growth of carbon credits production, create jobs and protect biodiversity in Africa, according to a press release by the initiative. ACMI announced a bold ambition for the continent to reach 300 million credits offered annually by 2030. This level of supplies would unlock $6 billion (about R106bn) in income and support 30 million jobs, it added. By 2050, the statement said, ACMI is targeting over 1.5 billion credits annually in Africa, leveraging over $120bn and supporting over 110 million jobs. A number of African nations, including Kenya, Malawi, Gabon, Nigeria and Togo, shared their commitments to collaborating with ACMI to scale up carbon credit production via voluntary carbon market activation plans. Gates Foundation Meanwhile, the world\' s development banks need to prioritise helping poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, the chief executive of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told Reuters. Speaking on the sidelines of the COP27 climate talks, Mark Suzman said while investment in so-called  adaptation finance had increased, it was still  far short of what is needed . Adaptation is set to be a central theme of the conference this week. The foundation on Monday pledged $1bn to help smallholder farmers become more resilient, its biggest contribution to adaptation so far. The world\' s biggest multilateral development banks spent $17bn on adaptation finance for poorer countries in 2021, a recent report by the lenders showed. Yet as a global energy and food security crunch in the wake of conflict in Ukraine compounds the worsening impacts of climate change, multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank \- collectively the biggest providers of cheap finance for low and middle income countries \- needed to do more, Suzman said.  That connection between food security and climate adaptation is so clear, no one can contest it, and so what are going to be the action plans and resources to now turn that into real implementation? he asked. His comments come as political leaders including US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for a fundamental restructuring of how MDBs invest, given the need for quicker action on climate. Island nations Meanwhile, a group of small island nations joined calls for a windfall tax on oil companies to compensate developing countries for the damage caused by climate change-induced natural disasters. Developing nations have pressed their case at the UN\' s COP27 climate summit for the creation of a  loss and damage fund, arguing that rich nations are to blame for the biggest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Oil companies have scored tens of billions of dollars in profits this year as crude prices have soared in the wake of Russia\' s invasion of Ukraine.  It is about time that these companies are made to pay a global COP carbon tax on these profits as a source of funding for loss and damage, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, told fellow leaders at the summit. | \</doc>

To end the climate wars globally, those of us with the means to do so need to urgently promote and amplify new stories and narratives that connect to and reflect the values and views of the world's youth.\~ The idea that climate action can encompass a positive vision for the future - not just for the West but everyone - must be central to the stories we tell. Sharing these stories can serve as a catalyst for delivering on the hopes and dreams of billions of people. Fortunately, young people are powerful storytellers and are already using their own experiences to lead movements. They are already being heard and now, they must be listened to. A definitive cliche of HYPERLINK https://mg.co.za/tag/cop26/ COP26 in Glasgow is that it resulted in division, blame sharing, inaction and deadlock. Rich economies failed again to provide the levels of financing promised for so long while simultaneously (and hypocritically) pressuring developing economies to step up.\~ Some emerging economies essentially said they will wait for the "rich world" to push the financial envelope forward before rushing to meet the challenges of a global disaster they refuse to feel - and arguably, historically at least, are not - co-responsible for.\~ And all the while, seemingly abandoned and unheard, the world's most vulnerable societies stand evermore on the precipice of climate calamity with every passing day. The consequences will be most acutely felt by young people.\~ Yet, in town halls and municipal council chambers around the world lively and constructive discussions are taking place on how to accelerate the shift to HYPERLINK cleaner forms of energy Contrary to overused tropes about a "disengaged youth", these conversations are largely prompted by young people, especially those from the world's developing regions, who represent 88% of the global youth. Concern for climate change is something we see in the actions and responses of Global Citizens.\~ Ahead of COP26, we invited individuals on our platform to HYPERLINK https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/connect/climate-change-world-messages/ share their experiences Together with others, their voices formed a rallying cry from the world's youth - one that demanded action for the planet.\~ And yet, for too long, the voices of many of these citizen advocates have been ignored and misrepresented on the global stage by local elites, international leaders and even by advocates and activists in the Global North who too often centred their own perspectives when it came to organising and storytelling. Central to one of the most common narratives we hear, often drowning out all the other stories, is the perception that action on climate change must be a zero-sum game. Too many feel it is a war in which there will inevitably be winners and losers. There are those, primarily in the Global North, who argue the whole world must all move at the same accelerated pace to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\~ Implicit in such assertions is that the development needs, hopes, dreams and aspirations of billions of people in poorer communities is of secondary concern. In effect, these people say to others: "Yes, it is a shame you will not be able to lift people out of poverty in the same way we did, but at least we will keep the planet from burning." At the same time, there are some political leaders who cynically exploit such assertions as an excuse for little action and who don't show up at the negotiating table. After all, it is said, why should they? They are not responsible for the present crisis, so why should the aspirations and needs of their people be relegated to the back seat? Yet such winner-takes-all equations form just one narrative; one that implies young people should put their concerns in life on hold to tackle HYPERLINK climate change . Unsurprisingly, this is out of touch with - and does not speak to nor reflect - the views and stories of many youth in developed and emerging countries.\~ Put simply: a climate narrative focused on limits to economic growth and future pessimism is fundamentally disconnected from their aspirations and values. Neither does it reflect the huge economic opportunities climate action presents, which many young people are among the biggest proponents of.\~ A global survey by research agency Glocalities in 2021 highlights how youth in developing regions have similar high concerns about climate change as those in developed regions. Sixty-four percent of youth from developing regions are strongly concerned about climate change. Yes, their worries about climate change go together with similarly high concerns about poverty, corruption, quality education, and gender equality. And they are twice more concerned about unemployment than they are about climate change.\~ Overall, the research from Glocalities highlights that contrary to the pessimistic presentation of climate action as a zero-sum economic game by many of their leaders, young people in developing regions tend to be much more positive about their future. Bringing to the fore narratives and stories that speak to this alternative outlook could provide a way to finally move beyond the predominantly polarising tone of the so-called climate wars. It would serve as a catalyst for connecting to and mobilising, in huge numbers, a new generation of climate advocates capable of demonstrating to leaders the existence of an overwhelming pro-climate constituency impatient for change.\~ Core to this alternative narrative is that climate action can only be concerned with both the welfare of our planet and the future of our children; the two are not mutually exclusive. The solution to the climate crisis will undoubtedly create new opportunities to improve the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of one's community, creating new jobs and economic opportunities, transforming and improving cities, clean air, supporting families and ultimately raising living standards using new technologies.\~ Data backs these opportunities up. Renewable energy currently creates five times more jobs than fossil fuels. And, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the number of renewable energy jobs grew from 1.7 million in 2004, to 10.3 million in 2017, and 11.5 million in 2019. So-called just energy transition deals are already being set up to enable particular willing countries to shore up the finance needed to do the jump while protecting their peoples' welfare. It is happening in South Africa and this example should be replicated many times more.\~ Viewed in this vein, action on climate change is an integral part of the broader programme of societal and economic change, transition and transformation that young people are hoping their leaders deliver on. It is an enabler, not just to avoid climate disaster, but to fastrack ending poverty altogether. This is the story that needs to be told, indeed is being told and needs to be amplified to a wider audience. It is a sentiment that was eloquently put forth by Brianna Fruean, a young Pioneering Climate campaigner from Samoa and a recipient of the 2022 Global Citizen Prize: Citizen Award. Receiving her prize last month at the Global Prize dinner in New York, Brianna shared her optimistic view that the climate crisis need not be the end, but the beginning, in her words, "of an environmental renaissance that serves as a refresh for humanity". A refresh that consists of transformative action that brings together everyone: from those communities on the frontlines, to those workers affected in the great energy transition to come.\~ There are plenty more stories like Brianna's already being told as a counterpoint to the prevailing pessimistic and antagonistic narratives that tend to dominate global climate discussions. But they need a larger stage to cut through at COP27 in Egypt, G20 in Bali, G7 in Germany and equally important, at home. A citizens conference on global governance that creates space for these stories to be told and disseminated among the highest levels could definitely help.\~ In the end, the surfacing and promotion of alternative narratives and stories on climate action may not only provide the basis for energising new constituencies and movements of climate advocates in communities around the world. It would also prevent the cynical appropriation of young peoples' aspirations as an excuse for inaction on climate change by putting to bed the myth they do not care. And, provided they can be forced to listen to new stories, leaders might finally recognise that they do have a cross-border mandate to move beyond the climate wars of the past, and take urgent action now.

THE COP27 host Egypt scrambled to salvage UN climate talks on Saturday with the EU and Pakistan signalling a breakthrough over the contentious issue of  loss and damage funding for climate vulnerable nations. Nearly 200 countries\' representatives gathered in Egypt for two weeks with the aim of driving forward action to fight climate change as the world faces a worsening onslaught of weather extremes. But the talks stalled over the terms under which wealthy polluters provide  loss and damage funding for countries wracked by climate disasters, as well as over ratcheting up ambition in tackling global warming. After the EU rejected a document shown by Egypt because of concerns it was weak on curbing emissions, a source from the bloc said at least the loss and damage issue was  agreed as far as it was concerned. The agreement was still subject to confirmation at a closing meeting. Pakistan\' s Climate Minister Sherry Rehman said she was  hopeful of a positive outcome .  If that happens today, that will be a historic reminder to vulnerable people all over the world that they have a voice and that if they unite... we can actually start breaking down barriers that we thought were impossible, she said. Pakistan \- struck by devastating heatwaves and floods this year \- chairs the G77 and China bloc of 134 developing nations, which has campaigned strongly for a fund for loss and damage to be agreed at COP27 . But with countries continuing to raise concerns over ambitions on cutting emissions and tackling global warming, the outcome of the climate talks remained uncertain. An informal coalition of  high ambition countries has called for strong language on cutting emissions, moving away from planet-heating fossil fuels and to reaffirm the aspirational goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C from pre-industrial levels. Scientists say this is a far safer guardrail against catastrophic climate impacts, with the world far off track and heading for around 2.5\'b0C of warming under current commitments and plans. A draft decision document on creating a specific loss and damage fund was published by the Egyptian presidency on Saturday. The EU has called for the fund to prioritise the most climate-vulnerable countries as recipients. It also said the money should come from a  broad funder base \- code for countries including China and Saudi Arabia that have become wealthier. China\' s envoy Xie Zhenhua told reporters that the fund should be for all developing countries.  I hope that it could be provided to the fragile countries first. | \</doc>

United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres told countries gathered at the start of the COP27 summit in Egypt yesterday they faced a stark choice: work together now to cut emissions or condemn future generations to climate catastrophe. The speech was intended to set an urgent tone as governments sit down for two weeks of talks on how to avert the worst impacts of climate change, even as they are distracted by Russia\' s war in Ukraine, rampant consumer inflation and energy shortages.  Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish, Guterres told delegates gathered in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. Leaders from countries from Britain to Saudi Arabia were scheduled to speak later in the day. Guterres called for a pact between the world\' s richest and poorest countries to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels and speed up delivery of the funding needed to ensure poorer countries can reduce emissions and cope with the unavoidable impacts of warming that has already occurred.  The two largest economies \- the United States and China \- have a particular responsibility to join efforts to make this pact a reality, he said. Guterres asked countries to agree to phase out the use of coal, one of the most carbon-intense fuels, by 2040 globally, with members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development hitting that mark by 2030. Despite decades of climate talks \- the Egypt COP is the 27th Conference of the Parties \- progress has been insufficient to save the planet from excessive warming as countries are too slow or reluctant to act, he noted.  Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible, he said. We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator. Signatories to the 2015 Paris climate agreement pledged to achieve a long-term goal of keeping global temperatures from rising more than 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. Scientists have set this as the ceiling for avoiding catastrophic climate change. Guterres said that to keep any hope alive of meeting that goal means achieving global net zero emissions by 2050.  It is either a Climate Solidarity Pact \- or a Collective Suicide Pact, he said. Meanwhile, campaign group Greenpeace has called Egypt\' s choice of the soft drink giant  appalling , blaming the company for much of the  plastic pollution in the world . Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is skipping COP27 , slamming it as a forum for  greenwashing and saying the  space for civil society this year is extremely limited . | Reuters and AFP \</doc>

UN climate summit opens with dire warnings Each of the last eight years, if projections for 2022 hold, will be hotter than any year prior to 2015, the UN said yesterday, detailing a dramatic increase in the rate of global warming. Sea level rise, glacier melt, torrential rains, heat waves \- and the deadly disasters they cause \- have all accelerated, the World Meteorological Organization said in a report as the COP27 UN Climate Summit opened in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.  As COP27 Earth has warmed more than 1.1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, with roughly half of that increase occurring in the past 30 years, the report shows. This year is on track to be the fifth or sixth warmest ever recorded despite the impact since 2020 of La Nina \- a periodic and naturally occurring phenomenon in the Pacific that cools the atmosphere.  The greater the warming, the worse the impacts, said WMO head Petteri Taalas. Surface water in the ocean \- which soaks up more than 90% of accumulated heat from human carbon emissions \- hit record high temperatures in 2021, warming especially fast during the past 20 years. Marine heat waves were also on the rise, with devastating consequences for coral reefs and the half-billion people who depend on them for food and livelihoods. Overall, 55% of the ocean surface experienced at least one marine heatwave in 2022, the report said. Driven by melting ice sheets and glaciers, the pace of sea level rise has doubled in the past 30 years, threatening tens of millions in low-lying coastal areas.  The messages in this report could barely be bleaker, said Mike Meredith, science leader at the British Antarctic Survey.  All over our planet, records are being shattered as different parts of the climate system begin to break down. Greenhouse gases accounting for more than 95% of warming are all at record levels, with methane showing the largest one-year jump ever recorded, the WMO\' s annual State of the Global Climate found. The increase in methane emissions has been traced to leaks in natural gas production and a rise in beef consumption. In 2022, a cascade of extreme weather exacerbated by climate change devastated communities across the globe. A two-month heatwave in South Asia in March and April bearing the unmistakable fingerprint of man-made warming was followed by floods in Pakistan that left a third of the country under water. At least 1 700 people died. \</doc>

A scheme to give speedy financial support to communities battered by climate disasters was launched yesterday by a group of rich and developing nations at the UN COP27 summit in Egypt. The  Global Shield against Climate Risks comes as many of the most vulnerable nations are also demanding wider compensation for the  loss and damage they have already suffered from a heating planet. The initiative, backed by the G7 and launched with initial funding of more than $200 million (about R3.4 billion) , aims to provide  pre- arranged financial support designed to be quickly deployed in times of climate disasters . The Global Shield project  is long overdue , said Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghana\' s finance minister and chairperson of the V20 group of nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.  It has never been a question of who pays for loss and damage, because we are paying for it, he said in recorded remarks at the summit.  Our economies pay for it in lost growth prospects, our enterprises pay for it in business disruption, and our communities pay for it in lives and livelihoods lost. He said he hoped the project would help the most vulnerable communities but also aid wider understanding of the challenges emerging economies face as they are being hammered by climate-induced floods, heatwaves or droughts. A first group of nations that will benefit from the scheme includes Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Fiji, Ghana, Pakistan, the Philippines and Senegal. Nations at the COP27 agreed this year for the first time to include the thorny topic of loss and damage on the formal agenda, after years of reluctance from richer polluters wary of creating open-ended liability. Germany said the Global Shield scheme, largely in the form of insurance that pays out immediately after, or even before, a climate disaster, would be part of a broader effort to respond to loss and damage. Svenja Schulze, Germany\' s minister of economic co-operation and development, stressed the scheme was not  a tactic to sidestep calls for a specific loss and damage funding mechanism.  The Global Shield isn\' t the one and only solution for loss and damage, certainly not, she said, adding that more funding will be needed to cover more countries.  Those most affected by climate impacts need practical action now. The Global Shield is designed to provide financial, social and credit protection and insurance for loss of crops, livestock, property and other goods. It also promises to support the swift delivery of funds for humanitarian agencies responding to disasters. A formal loss and damage funding stream would likely go further, also covering longer-onset climate impacts such as sea level rise and threats to cultural heritage.

When Egypt hosts a global climate summit in November, it will seek to represent Africa, which shares little of the blame for global warming but suffers many of its worst impacts, its environment minister says. Yasmine Fouad said this week that Egypt will also remind rich countries of the industrialised world of their unfulfilled aid pledges at the COP27 summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Part of Egypt\' s role as host is to  represent the African continent and its needs clearly and explicitly: we were not the cause of these emissions, but it is us, our people and our natural resources, that are affected, Fouad said. She was speaking on the sidelines of an international conference in Cairo aimed at highlighting  Africa\' s needs and ambitions in fighting and adjusting to climate change. African countries are among the most exposed to the impacts of climate change, especially worsening droughts and floods, but responsible for only about 3% of global CO2 emissions, former UN chief Ban Ki-moon said this week. He was speaking at an Africa-focused summit in the Dutch city of Rotterdam, where African leaders lashed out at industrialised nations for failing to show up. Egypt\' s environment minister said that  at this point, a stance must be taken on the international community level to say that everyone must fulfil their obligations, as set out in the Paris Agreement . In 2015, 196 UN members meeting in Paris set the goal of keeping warming below 2\'baC over pre-industrial levels, and preferably 1.5\'baC, but surging carbon emissions have since endangered the targets. The Paris Agreement also stipulated that developed countries  shall provide financial resources to assist developing country parties in curbing their emissions and strengthening resilience. Already in 2015, a promise made at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 \- to spend $100 billion a year by 2020 on helping vulnerable nations adapt to climate change \- was receding in the rear-view mirror. COP27 , such as this week\' s in Egypt and the Netherlands as well as another last week in Gabon, signal that funding could become a key flashpoint in Sharm el-Sheikh. Fouad said environmental concerns had until recent years been regarded  as an obstacle to investment and a  luxury that Egypt could not afford. Drumming up support for environmental efforts was an uphill battle, until the tide turned and the world became increasingly aware that climate change was a matter of  human survival on planet earth , she said. The key to securing financing for efforts to combat climate change, she said, was to zero in on  basic human needs on earth: food, water, energy . In focusing on  bankable projects that can turn a profit, Fouad said Egypt hopes to  use new and renewable energy to provide food and water, such as through desalination . | AFP \</doc>

Egypt hosts next month\' s COP 27 climate summit at a Red Sea resort where climate change and human activity are threatening one of the world\' s most prized coral reefs. A key attraction for tourists and habitat for fish nurseries, Egypt\' s corals fringe coastal towns including Hurghada, Marsa Alam and Sharm el-Sheikh \- where the UN conference takes place from November 6 to 18. These Red Sea reefs, which make up about 5% of the global reef cover, contain the most diversity of species outside of South-east Asia. But many of the world\' s reefs now face an  existential crisis , with 14% lost between 2009 and 2018 as climate change warms the ocean\' s surface and increases acidification while human development drives tourism, overfishing and coastal construction that can foul waters, according to the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network. As invertebrates, corals secrete calcium carbonate to build up their protective skeletons, where algae take up residence, giving the corals brilliant colour. But corals are also temperature-sensitive, and a change of just 1\'b0C to 2\'b0C can cause them to expel their algae, leaving behind the white skeletons seen in  bleaching events. Egypt\' s corals seem to be adapting better than those elsewhere, possibly because they have become conditioned to big swings in temperature due to seasonal shifts in the gulfs of Aqaba and Suez. | Reuters \</doc>

The family of Egyptian-British hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah said yesterday that they were told by prison authorities that medical intervention was taken to maintain his health, four days after an escalation of his protest. Abd el-Fattah, who has been on hunger strike since April 2, had said he would stop drinking water on Sunday to coincide with the opening of the COP27 climate change talks Egypt is hosting in Sharm el-Sheikh. His strike has loomed over the UN talks, with one of his sisters, Sanaa Seif, flying in to campaign for his release, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak raising the issue with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Abd el-Fattah\' s mother has been making daily visits to the prison where he is being held north-west of Cairo. She has received no news from her son, but said prison officials spoke to her outside the gates yesterday.  They said medical procedures were implemented to maintain his health and that legal entities have been informed, Laila Soueif said.  Nobody has officially notified us with any action that has been taken. Without water, Abd el-Fattah\' s health could rapidly deteriorate and the UN\' s rights agency has expressed concern for his life. Egyptian officials have not responded to Reuters requests for comment. They said previously that Abd el-Fattah was being given meals. The activist rose to prominence in Egypt\' s 2011 uprising before being swept up in a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent after Sisi, then army chief, led the 2013 ouster of Egypt\' s first democratically elected president, Mohamed Mursi. Rights groups say tens of thousands of people have been arrested since then, including Islamists, leftists and liberals. Sisi and his supporters say security and stability are paramount. Abd el-Fattah was sentenced most recently in December 2021 to five years on charges of spreading false news, the same month he gained British nationality through his mother. He is on hunger strike against his detention and prison conditions. British officials have unsuccessfully sought consular access to visit him in prison. Soueif said she was not told the nature of the medical intervention.  They say he\' s still in prison, she said yesterday.  They refused to allow me to wait outside prison, refused to receive any letters from me. Abd el-Fattah\' s family said:  We are demanding information on the substance of the \' medical intervention\' and demanding that with the utmost urgency he is moved to hospital where lawyers and family can reach him. The family\' s campaign for his release has triggered a backlash from pro-government figures and media. Local media have reported that an Egyptian lawyer submitted a legal case calling for Sanaa Seif\' s arrest. | Reuters \</doc>

Republicans edged closer yesterday to securing a majority in the US House of Representatives while control of the Senate hinged on a few tight races, two days after Democrats staved off an anticipated  red wave of Republican gains in midterm elections. Republicans have captured at least 210 House seats, Edison Research projected, eight short of the 218 needed to wrest the House away from Democrats and effectively halt US President Joe Biden\' s legislative agenda. The party in power historically suffers heavy casualties in a president\' s first midterm election and Tuesday\' s results suggested voters were punishing Biden for the steepest inflation in 40 years. But Democrats were holding on in the close Senate battles in Nevada and Arizona. Tuesday\' s results also suggested voters were lashing out against Republican efforts to ban abortion and to cast doubt on the nation\' s vote-counting process. Biden had framed the election as a test of US democracy at a time when hundreds of Republican candidates embraced former president Donald Trump\' s false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker both failed to reach 50% on Tuesday, forcing them into a one-on-one battle on December 6. Even a slim House majority would allow Republicans to shape the rest of Biden\' s term, blocking abortion rights and launching investigations into his administration and family. Biden, who travelled to Egypt yesterday for the COP27 UN climate change summit, said he was prepared to work with Republicans. Republicans are expected to demand spending cuts in exchange for raising the nation\' s borrowing limit next year. Control of the Senate would give Republicans the power to block Biden\' s nominees for judicial and administrative posts. Thousands of votes still remained uncounted in the two closely competitive states of Arizona and Nevada. Trump, who took an active role in recruiting Republican candidates, had mixed results. He notched up a victory in Ohio, where Hillbilly Elegy author JD Vance won a Senate seat to keep it in Republican hands. But several other Trump-backed candidates suffered defeats. Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who could challenge Trump in 2024, won re-election by nearly 20 percentage points. | Reuters \</doc>

Despite Vietnam\' s solar boom and ambitious climate targets, the fast-growing economy is struggling to quit dirty energy \- leaving one of the world\' s biggest coal power programmes largely intact. During the COP26 climate summit last year, the government boldly promised to end the construction of new coal plants and phase out the dirtiest of those already running, even as energy demands soar in the manufacturing powerhouse.  But this is not actually what Vietnam is doing at a national level, said Nandini Das, an energy research and policy analyst at Climate Analytics. Vietnam pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but with coal and gas still a major part of its energy mix one year later, that commitment is on shaky ground, she said. The authoritarian communist state has also jailed four green activists this year, including anti-coal campaigner Nguy Thi Khanh, alarming environmentalists who argue it will be even harder for Vietnam to banish dirty energy without them.  With the climate leaders in prison I think there\' s grave doubt about the country\' s ability to achieve its goals, said Michael Sutton, director of the Goldman Environmental Foundation. After China and India, Vietnam has the world\' s third-largest pipeline of new coal power projects. But at COP27 The rise of solar energy in the Southeast Asian nation has also been meteoric. The share of electricity generated by solar saw the biggest rise in the world in 2021, jumping to 10 percent from two percent a year earlier, according to independent energy think tank Ember. Last year, the country ranked in the top 10 globally for solar energy capacity. The problem, Das argued, is that the new policies have yet to be implemented.  We\' ll give it six months to see, she said. Although there is little time to waste for Vietnam, one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change due to its long and densely populated coastline, researcher Thang Do believes there is no choice but to be patient.  The whole economy is now dependent on coal so that makes it very challenging to change, he said.  It\' s not an easy decision to make to just close a coal power plant and tomorrow we\' ll open a solar and wind, it takes a lot of time and resources and also mindsets to be changed. | AFP \</doc>

An Iranian Revolutionary Guards general claimed yesterday that the Islamic republic has developed a hypersonic missile capable of penetrating all defence systems, raising concerns from the UN nuclear watchdog. Hypersonic missiles, like traditional ballistic missiles which can deliver nuclear weapons, can fly more than five times the speed of sound.  This hypersonic ballistic missile was developed to counter air defence shields, General Amirali Hajizadeh, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps aerospace unit said, quoted by Iran\' s Fars news agency.  It will be able to breach all the systems of anti-missile defence, said the general, adding that he believed it would take decades before a system capable of intercepting it is developed.  This missile, which targets enemy anti-missile systems, represents a great generational leap in the field of missiles. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said:  We see that all these announcements increase the attention, increase the concerns, increase the public attention to the Iranian nuclear programme. He was speaking on the sidelines of the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. But he said he did not see this as  having any influence on negotiations over the Islamic republic\' s nuclear programme. The announcement comes after Iran admitted on Saturday that it had sent drones to Russia, but said it had done so before the Ukraine war. The Washington Post reported on October 16 that Iran was preparing to ship missiles to Russia, but Tehran rejected the report as  completely false . It also comes at a time of protests that have rocked Iran since the September 16 death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly flouting the Islamic republic\' s dress code for women. Unlike ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles fly on a trajectory low in the atmosphere, potentially reaching targets more quickly. North Korea\' s test of a hypersonic missile last year sparked concerns about the race to acquire the technology, which is currently led by Russia, followed by China and the US. Both Iran and Russia are targeted by stringent sanctions \- Iran after the US unilaterally pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal, and Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February. The two countries have responded to the sanctions by boosting co-operation in key areas to help prop up their economies. Iran this week hosted Russia\' s security chief, Nikolai Patrushev, for talks on subjects that the Russian side said included  the fight against terrorism and extremism as well as measures to counter Western interference. While countries like the US have developed systems designed to defend against cruise and ballistic missiles, the ability to track and take down a hypersonic missile remains a question. Yesterday\' s announcement comes against a backdrop of stalled talks on reviving the 2015 nuclear deal giving Iran relief from sanctions in return for guarantees it could not develop an atomic weapon. Iran has always denied wanting a nuclear arsenal. The deal collapsed after the US\' s unilateral withdrawal in 2018 under then president Donald Trump. | AFP \</doc>

AN environmental activist has criticised government\' s decision to seek more than a trillion rand in funding for its energy transition plan, saying it may become a debt burden to the poor and lead to corrupt tender processes that will only benefit the elite. President Cyril Ramaphosa handed over the investment plan, which seeks an amount of R1.5 trillion over five years, to the International Partners Group, which includes the UK, US, Germany, France and the EU, at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt on Monday. The countries had initially pledged $8.5 billion (about R151bn) to assist South Africa shift from coal to renewable energy and there are also plans to make an additional R10bn available. However, according to the plan presented by Ramaphosa, much more money is needed. Ramaphosa said South Africa was speaking to international partners to identify additional funding sources, calling for  a significantly larger grant component in support pledges. During the event, Ramaphosa said:  As a country, we are guided by a Just Transition Framework and an Investment Plan that outlines the enormous scale and nature of investments needed to achieve our decarbonisation goals over the next five years.  We are already scaling up investment in renewable energy and are on course to retire several of our ageing coal-fired power plants by the end of 2030. Environmental activist Desmond D\' sa, from the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance, said the organisation had warned the country about corruption regarding the building of coal-fired power plants Kusile and Medupi, and this had become a reality that had affected the economy and its ability to maintain energy security. He added that this could happen again with the energy plan.  Here again we are going to see that the money will not benefit the people of the global south, including South Africa, and instead will see the rich get richer and inequality continue to grow. D\' sa said big infrastructure projects only benefited the elite and the organisation was holding a protest tomorrow at Durban\' s promenade to highlight the environmental issues affecting the country.  We knew which plants had to be decommissioned and when, and now with the R8.5bn transition fund we are taking out loans from international partner groups as well as climate investment funds to transition faster for ultimately their benefit, but no one has clearly outlined what South Africa\' s benefit is in transitioning faster.  We do have transition and decommissioning plans that are in place, all we are going to be doing is moving this up to a quicker date. We are going to have to pay for this in concessional as well as commercial funding. Mashele added that while the focus was on the transition plan, it was not clear whether it would lead to the country having energy security.  Global capital markets are basically saying they are not willing to fund coal and are only willing to fund renewables.  Whether we like it or not, we will have to transition, but whether that will ensure energy security for South Africans is another topic. She added that there needed to be more transparency about how the money would be used.  The key thing is let us have a detailed plan on where the money is going to be coming from, where it is going to, but also who is going to pay back this money.  The question is how long is this money going to be required, what is it going to be used for?  That is what we do not have, said Mashele. Lebogang Mulaisi, Cosatu head of policy and Presidential Climate Commission commissioner, said there was increasing anxiety about job displacement among people who worked in fossil fuel industries. Mulaisi said they needed to address what these plans, deals and concepts meant in terms of bread and butter needs of the ordinary workers that relied on these sectors for generations and only have skills in these sectors \- which may become displaced if the Just Transition is not carried out holistically.  Policymakers and decision-makers in the room need to take this into account when crafting these investment plans, financing decisions and conditions of how these finances are used. Political analyst Professor Sipho Seepe said he was concerned that Ramaphosa had said private capital must come to the party in terms of the energy transition.  Effectively, we are outsourcing the responsibilities of government to the private sector and philanthropic sectors.  This is going to give control to the future of the country to external players and the private sector. Seepe said the countries that were offering the loans were doing so in the interests of their own people. A statement from the German embassy said South Africa, France and Germany had signed loan agreements for the two European nations to each extend \€ 300 million (about R5.3bn) in concessional financing to South Africa to support the country\' s efforts to reduce its reliance on coal through a just transition to cleaner energy sources.  The loans are provided by the French and German public development banks, AFD and KfW, directly to the South African government via its National Treasury. The statement said the signing represented a significant milestone in the implementation of the Just Energy Transition Partnership announced at COP26 last November. \</doc>

THE UN climate talks that were supposed to end on Friday were extended by another day as negotiators sought to break a deadlock over creating a fund for nations hard hit by global warming impacts.  Today we need to shift gears again, time is not on our side, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who chairs the COP27 talks, told delegates, adding:  I remain committed to bringing this conference to a close tomorrow in an orderly manner. | \</doc>

The following information was released by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP): NAACP thought leaders join world leaders to engage in proactive planning for climate change. This week, America's preeminent civil rights organization, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), joins world leaders at the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) to partake in thoughtful dialogue on the importance of environmental and climate justice. Action on environmental justice and climate change is more important than ever. The NAACP will highlight and further emphasize our stance on environmental and climate justice at COP27 . "We have known for years that Black people across the diaspora are more likely to experience environmental racism in their communities. Additionally, industries such as fossil fuel, coal, and other industries create toxic footprints in Black communities that exacerbates long-term health issues for Black communities," said NAACP Director of Environmental Climate Justice Abre' Conner. "We must continue to center Black communities and communities of color in global conversations and negotiations regarding any solutions and investments about environmental injustices." The NAACP will partake in discussions throughout COP27 , which include hosting a panel in the Blue Zone on Water Day, November 14, 2022, in the Climate Justice Pavilion. These conversations are to ensure international leaders have insight on the disproportional environmental issues faced in America and how the Association can continue its efforts to secure environmental justice. \</doc>

Nov 05, 2022( APO (African Press Organization): HYPERLINK https://www.africa-newsroom.com The Commonwealth ( HYPERLINK https://TheCommonwealth.org https://TheCommonwealth.org United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). The Secretary-General will head a delegation to attend the world's largest annual gathering of leaders around the issue of climate change, which takes place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egyptfrom 6 to 18 November. At the summit, Secretary-General Scotland will advocate for ramped-up climate action through more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), national plans and targets. She will also seek to amplify the shared concerns of the 56 Commonwealth countries, including crucial issues around climate finance, sustainable energy transition, loss and damage, and partnerships and coordinated action. Ahead of her arrival in Egypton 5thNovember, the Secretary-General stated: ' COP27 takes place in the midst of overlapping, interlinked and accelerating global challenges. The lasting impacts of COVID-19 combine with the effects of conflict, including in Ukraine, to destabilise global economic, energy and food systems. Against this backdrop, the climate crisis has continued to worsen, and its profound impacts are being felt by families, communities and countries across the Commonwealth. 'I understand the pressure world leaders are under, but I urge all decision-makers, advocates and allies at COP27 to ensure the promises already made are delivered, and accelerate efforts to mitigate and adapt to the urgent threat of climate change. We must never lose sight of the crushing consequences of inaction, for the for the millions who face the dangers of climate change every day, and for generations to come. We need urgent action now.' Thirty-two of the total 56 Commonwealth member countries are small states, including 25 small island developing states, while 14 are classified as least developed countries - among the poorest and most vulnerable in the world. Commonwealth heads of government recognise that developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing states are particularly at risk of their development gains being reversed by the impacts of climate change. During theirmeeting ( HYPERLINK https://bit.ly/3U7jWRt https://bit.ly/3U7jWRt The Secretary-General added: 'We must build on the substantive progress made at the previous COP26 summit, and urgently translate these commitments into action. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. But to achieve this, developing countries will need enhanced support.'

The European Council issued the following remarks on Nov. 8, 2022, by President Charles Michel at the United Nations Climate Change Conference : We have a climatic gun to our head. We are living on borrowed time, and Russia's war against Ukraine has made the challenge the world is facing even more complex. I am pleased that in a few moments we will have the opportunity to listen to President Zelenskyy's online message. The Kremlin has chosen to make energy a weapon of mass destabilisation. It is pointing this weapon directly at Europe and at Europe's global energy markets. In the same vein, it has chosen to weaponise food and fertilisers. And, with utter cynicism, that weapon is being pointed at the most vulnerable and at developing countries. The war in Ukraine is teaching us a paradoxical lesson: it vindicates our decision to phase out fossil fuels, but it is disrupting and leading to a sudden upheaval in supply chains, along with increased competition for fossil fuels. There is not the shadow of a doubt: this crisis further strengthens the European Union's resolve. We are, and will remain, champions of climate action, and we are determined to step up the pace of change. We are committed to protecting nature, the oceans and forests, which are the lungs of the planet, sustaining biodiversity and human life on earth. By its very nature, the European Union is a project based on cooperation and solidarity, and so we have an obligation towards people in developing countries. We built our prosperity partly by overusing fossil fuel resources and by mistreating the natural world. We must therefore shoulder our share of the burden, and we are doing so. The European Union is the largest provider of climate funds, allocating more than EUR 20 billion in 2021. We are also striving to contribute actively to the decarbonisation of industry around the world by creating effective, tangible partnerships for a fair and just energy transition, together with the G7 and developing countries. We know we also have an obligation towards the next generation, towards the young people who are protesting, making their voices heard and appealing to our conscience. We have an obligation to all citizens in our countries: we owe them the truth and we owe them lucidity. In Europe, we had built our climate transition on a model based on easily available and affordable gas. Today, our objective remains the same: namely, climate neutrality by 2050 with net-zero emissions. However, we need to be realistic, and this means adapting our energy transition strategy to the new geopolitical context. We are stepping up investment in renewable energy sources, but we will need to rely on all energy sources in making the transition. We need to diversify as much as possible to ensure security of supply, while also recognising that developing countries need gas for their development and their energy transition. We want a just, fair and inclusive transition: we aim to succeed! Yesterday, Antonio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, did not mince his words and summarised very well the choice we are facing: collective suicide or solidarity. We choose solidarity; we choose life. There is no more time for pledges and promises. It is now time for action and results. You can count on the European Union.

Gabriela Hearst continued to push her message on the critical role fusion power has in the fight against climate change at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( CoP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Tuesday. The designer joined David W. Livingston from the office of the Special Presidential Envoy, Dr. Tim Bestwick from the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), Jennifer Ganten from the Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), and Jessie Barton from Helion Energy on a panel that discussed importance of fusion power, an emerging clean energy source that hastremendous potential to revolutionize the energy industry. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, fusion is among the most environmentally friendly sources of energy. There are no CO2 or other harmful atmospheric emissions from the fusion process, for instance, which means that it does not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Fusion energy is produced by combining atoms to create heavier ones - it's also the technology that uses the same reaction that powers the sun. Once developed, fusion will use a combination of lithium and hydrogen as fuel. It will also provide a combined source of thermal energy and power for hydrogen production, industrial heat, carbon capture, and desalination, per scientists. In September, Hearst used her runway presentation for Chlo\'e9's spring '23 collection to bring awareness to the future of fusion energy where looks were inspired by isotope compositions and the runway was designed to resemble a tokamak reactor, which is the doughnut-shaped device that produces energy through the magnetic fusion of atoms. Hearst also conducted extensive research, speaking to engineers and scientists, as well as visiting Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Helion Energy and ITER. "Fusion has become my Holy Grail since I believe in the possibility of fusion as one of the large scale solutions to our fossil fuel dependency. Any faculty or time I possess dedicated to Fusion makes me feel useful," Hearst said during the panel on Tuesday. "To be in CoP27 among brilliant minds, from the public and private sector, seeing the engagement of these both sides, makes me hopeful that the commercialization of fusion will happen sooner than we think. That the engineering and plasma physics challenges that still need to be overcome have finally the support to breakthrough. All of this is good news." Ganten added: "We are closer than most people realize to developing and scalingthe critical solutions we need to reach net-zero emissions for the world to enjoy affordable, abundant clean energy."

(TNSconf) -- Texas Southern University issued the following news: The Deep South Center for Environmental Justice (DSCEJ), WE ACT for Environmental Justice (WE ACT), and the Bullard Center for Environmental & Climate Justice at Texas Southern University will debut the first-ever Climate Justice Pavilion inside the Blue Zone at COP27 , the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, November 6-18, 2022. The pavilion will bring together representatives from the Global South, the U.S. Environmental Justice Movement, and Indigenous peoples to spotlight the voices of communities disproportionately impacted by climate change. The IPCC reports consistently raise the alarm about the worsening impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable communities, countries, and island states. Yet, the voices, stories, and perspectives of residents of these localities are rarely heard, communicated, or promoted - despite the increasing incidence of climate migration due to extreme weather events that cause flooding, destruction, drought, and soil and coastal erosion. The Climate Justice Pavilion will help to bridge that gap by serving as a space for productive conversations in the Blue Zone, which is where the majority of diplomats, policymakers, business, and professional advocates convene at COP27 . Connecting the people of the global migrating south forced to flee their homes because of unsafe communities due to outsized natural disasters or life-taking pollution; The risk of carbon capture and storage technology to front-line communities and the need for just solutions to reduce carbon; Climate Finance and the need to support communities with mitigating and adapting policies that will address climate change; Loss and damage to underserved communities due to years of colonialism and environmental racism; The need for energy justice, including equitable reparations for communities historically harmed by climate change; and climate reparations for poor communities burdened by the world's richest people. COP27 "Women, children of color and the communities where they live are too often an afterthought when talking about climate justice. The first-ever Climate Justice pavilion will provide a global stage to highlight their stories and others, encouraging governments to develop policies and clean energy transition plans that are inclusive, equitable, and reflect research on the effects on our communities." said Dr. Beverly Wright, Executive Director, Deep South Center for Environmental Justice. "The Global South from the United States to Africa is bearing the brunt of our climate crisis. Natural disasters coupled with centuries of colonialism and racism that underpin global environmental policy have devastated countless communities. This pavilion will challenge the world's best and brightest to reimagine how to tackle climate change and protect the most vulnerable all around the world." "You cannot talk about solving the climate crisis if the people most impacted are not at the table," said Peggy Shepard, Co-Founder and Executive Director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice. "The historic nature of the Climate Justice Pavilion cannot be understated, as it creates a space for those voices, their stories and perspectives, to be heard by decision makers on the international stage. We look forward to elevating the discussion of climate migration, energy justice, and the risk of false solutions to our communities as well as the need to center equity when addressing climate change." A delegation of over 40 representatives of grassroots communities; Students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); and staff support will accompany the collaboration to manage logistics, travel, programming of the pavilion, and relevant research. The COP 27 Sponsors Include: Bloomberg Philanthropies, Environmental Defense Fund, Earthjustice, Union of Concerned Scientists , The Kresge Foundation , National Wildlife Federation, Center for American Progress, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Columbia Climate School.

Nov 11, 2022( Crypto Breaking News: HYPERLINK https://cryptobreaking.com https://cryptobreaking.com The Climate Change Coalition (CCC), a network of organizations dedicated to leveraging blockchain technology for effective climate action, including Cointelegraph[1] as a member, delivered on Nov. 11 its stock take report at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 , in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Founded five years ago, the coalition has been working on initiatives related to the consumption accounting system and greenhouse gas emissions accounting. Tom Baumann, chair and founder of the Climate Change Coalition, stated: 'During those years, the Coalition has grown from 12 founding organizations to over 360 organizations in 69 countries. The coalition was founded on the ethos of blockchain and emerging technologies as an open distributed network where members self-organize into member-driven initiatives.' Climate Change Coalition (CCC) members at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 27 , in Egypt. The coalition's mission is to resolve issues and challenges needed to advance transformative digital climate innovations by creating resources to support a shared data and digital infrastructure, as well as supporting networking and capacity building, as well as partnering between digital and climate communities. Related:How blockchain technology is transforming climate action[2] Cointelegraph[1] editor-in-chief Kristina Lucrezia Cornr speaking at the COP 27 on blockchain relevance on fighting climate change. Speaking at the panel, Cointelegraph[1] editor-in-chief Kristina Lucrezia Cornr commented: 'Education is key here, and media responsibility is incredibly high. We consider it our biggest mission to talk not only about what is intrinsic to the blockchain industry, but what's going on beyond. And because it's out of the box that things are uniting us because this conference is about climate action and climate is so much more about just climate change. It's about sustainability, and it's about our future.' Also participating in the panel, Alexey Shadrin, co-founder and CEO of Evercity, a platform for management, issuance and monitoring of sustainable finance, highlighted how the coalition's efforts are supporting organizations with use cases on implementing blockchain technology, as well as guidance to the new projects that are rapidly emerging right now on the markets. 'We want to make sure that those projects are not only innovative and cool, but also aligned with core UN values and standards that currently exist there and that were developed by many, many experts within the UN process and beyond.' Even though digital assets have been criticized for their high-energy consumption, such an accusation is inaccurate. There is a need to distinguish between cryptocurrencies and underlying blockchain platforms that are energy efficient and support climate initiatives.

Nov 09, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com [co-author: Kerry Mackenzie] Talks during the second day[1] of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) focused on climate finance. Here's what business leaders need to know to keep up-to-date on event proceedings: U.S. Climate envoy John Kerry stated[2] that on Wednesday, he will propose a new billion-dollar carbon credit program that will allow developed countries to help developing countries cut back on fossil fuel emissions. The announcement came soon after the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, called upon developed countries to contribute to green financing for developing countries. A German senior official expressed[3] skepticism regarding the proposal, worrying that it would duplicate European efforts regarding carbon credit markets. This may provide an elegant strategy for the United States to incentivize the transition away from coal and oil based energy while mobilizing climate financing to developing economies. The African Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) was launched by a report that set out plans to create a $1.5 billion a year voluntary carbon market by 2050. United Nations (UN) experts warned[4] against 'greenwashing.' The group set out a report[5] detailing strict expectations for nongovernmental entities making net-zero pledges. Developing countries excluding China released[6] a UN-backed report that calls for over $1 trillion from developed countries to combat and adapt to global warming. Scotland, Austria and New Zealand pledged[7] around $50, $5 and $12 million respectively to climate loss and damage projects. Their announcements followed recent loss and damage pledges by Denmark and Belgium. Although these investments fell short of expectations, they represent a commitment to seriously consider the issue. This came as loss and damage funding was repeatedly highlighted[8] by developing countries in the COP 27 high-level segment today and voted on to the official agenda on Monday. Tuvalu became[9] the first country to call for a global 'Fossil Fuels Nonproliferation Treaty.' The country's Prime Minister (PM) Kausea Natano built on the proposal first suggested by the Vatican and scientists by contending 'there is very [little] time to slow and reverse the increasing temperature.'

November 10, 2022 Pelosi Statement on Conclusion of First Day of COP27 Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt - Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued this statement on the Congressional delegation's engagements on the first day of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (" COP27 "): United Nations Climate Change Conference to make crystal clear that America is all in for climate action. Our participation in COP27 comes just months after Democrats proudly enacted the most consequential climate action in history with the Inflation Reduction Act: putting America on a path to meet our obligation to future generations and beat our Paris goals. "The highlight of our first day was a meeting with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry and other senior Egyptian officials. We thanked them for their leadership in our common fight to address the global climate crisis. Our Members reaffirmed the strong, century-old ties between our two nations and discussed our strategic security partnership to ensure stability in the region. We also discussed our concerns regarding human rights, a key priority for our delegation and our nation. "It was my honor to begin our visit by participating in a moderated conversation with Kathy McLeod, Director of the Atlantic Council's Arsht-Rockefeller Resilience Center. With our Chair of the House's Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor, we discussed how, under President Biden, America is strategically investing in community resilience to help protect families amid the climate crisis. "Members of our delegation also met with parliamentarians from the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), the CVF Global Parliamentary Group and the Vulnerable 20, where we heard firsthand how climate disasters around the globe are hitting hardest those communities already endangered or left behind. We discussed the necessity of assisting developing nations in their efforts to address the climate crisis and protect vulnerable communities around the world. "Members of our delegation also held meetings with key U.S. officials who are unifying our nation and the world behind climate action. We received a timely update from Special Presidential Envoy John Kerry on how the Biden Administration's leadership is strengthening global partnerships and addressing the world's climate ambitions. It was a pleasure to discuss the EPA's work advancing clean air and clean water for all of the world's children with Administrator Michael Regan - an innovative leader at the helm of realizing President Biden's vision for environmental justice. Their vision and determination left us inspired to continue our fight for more bold climate action. Our delegation is also deeply grateful to Charge d'Affaires Daniel Rubinstein and the U.S. Embassy Cairo team for their insights, support and service to our nation. "In the days ahead, our delegation will continue to reiterate that America continues to stand with our global partners 'Together For Implementation...' as we work to build a cleaner, greener future for all of our children." \</doc>

One of the highlights of the event for Dr. Farooque was speaking at an event organized by the World Federation of Engineers, the Engineering Institute of Canada, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The theme of the event was "The Global Engineering View: Delivering an Equitable, Sustainable and Low Carbon Resilient World." His talk was titled "Development of Climate Smart Technologies to Ensure Food Security and Mitigate Climate Change: A Sustainable Approach." He also participated in a panel discussion organized by these organizations and represented the UPEI's Canadian Centre for Climate Change and Adaptation. "It was a great experience to be presenting at the COP27 ," said Dr. Farooque. "I also had the opportunity to meet with the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister for the Environment and Climate Change for Canada. We had a good discussion about the research being conducted at the Canadian Centre for Climate Change and Adaptation." In addition to this event, Dr. Farooque also served as a panelist on a session titled, "The Interchangeable effect of Education, Research, and Climate Change."

WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi issued the following news release: Contact: Speaker's Press Office, 202-226-7616 Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt - Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued this statement on the Congressional delegation's engagements on the first day of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (" COP27 "): United Nations Climate Change Conference to make crystal clear that America is all in for climate action. Our participation in COP27 comes just months after Democrats proudly enacted the most consequential climate action in history with the Inflation Reduction Act: putting America on a path to meet our obligation to future generations and beat our Paris goals. "The highlight of our first day was a meeting with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry and other senior Egyptian officials. We thanked them for their leadership in our common fight to address the global climate crisis. Our Members reaffirmed the strong, century-old ties between our two nations and discussed our strategic security partnership to ensure stability in the region. We also discussed our concerns regarding human rights, a key priority for our delegation and our nation. "It was my honor to begin our visit by participating in a moderated conversation with Kathy McLeod, Director of the Atlantic Council's Arsht-Rockefeller Resilience Center. With our Chair of the House's Select Committee on the Climate Crisis Kathy Castor, we discussed how, under President Biden, America is strategically investing in community resilience to help protect families amid the climate crisis. "Members of our delegation also met with parliamentarians from the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), the CVF Global Parliamentary Group and the Vulnerable 20, where we heard firsthand how climate disasters around the globe are hitting hardest those communities already endangered or left behind. We discussed the necessity of assisting developing nations in their efforts to address the climate crisis and protect vulnerable communities around the world. "Members of our delegation also held meetings with key U.S. officials who are unifying our nation and the world behind climate action. We received a timely update from Special Presidential Envoy John Kerry on how the Biden Administration's leadership is strengthening global partnerships and addressing the world's climate ambitions. It was a pleasure to discuss the EPA's work advancing clean air and clean water for all of the world's children with Administrator Michael Regan - an innovative leader at the helm of realizing President Biden's vision for environmental justice. Their vision and determination left us inspired to continue our fight for more bold climate action. Our delegation is also deeply grateful to Charge d'Affaires Daniel Rubinstein and the U.S. Embassy Cairo team for their insights, support and service to our nation. "In the days ahead, our delegation will continue to reiterate that America continues to stand with our global partners 'Together For Implementation.' as we work to build a cleaner, greener future for all of our children." # # # For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at mailto:contentservices@htlive.com \</doc>

WASHINGTON, D.C. --Today, Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) led a letter to Special Envoy John Kerry urging the U.S. to support loss and damage (LandD) funding to help developing countries recover from climate disasters. This fund should channel new public funding from developed to developing countries to help them recover from climate disasters. This LandD proposal could be a small yet important first step in pushing U.S. policy towards transformative climate and economic justice globally. "The United States is the world's largest historical contributor to climate change," the Members wrote. "Yet as we've seen with the historic flooding in Pakistan, the fourth consecutive drought in the Horn of Africa, the painfully slow recovery from hurricane damage in Central America, among many other examples, it is the Global South that disproportionately suffers the harms. We have both a moral and a strategic responsibility to provide comprehensive support for countries facing climate disaster, including debt forgiveness and reparations." In October, the Biden administration accepted formal discussions of loss and damage at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 . In his speech at United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), President Biden pledged to work with Congress to increase U.S. international climate finance and urged accelerating new and expanded domestic and global efforts in supporting developing countries. Developing countries often pay the highest price for climate change while contributing very little to greenhouse gas emissions. The letter is also signed by Reps. Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Steve Cohen, Jesus G. "Chuy" Garcia, Raul M. Grijalva, Andy Levin, Betty McCollum, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Pocan, Jan Schakowsky and Rashida Tlaib HYPERLINK https://bowman.house.gov/press-releases?ID=766049BD-FA7F-420C-8AD0-0CF807F8DD82 https://bowman.house.gov/press-releases?ID=766049BD-FA7F-420C-8AD0-0CF807F8DD82 \</doc>

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, issued the following statement after the Congressional delegation concluded its participation in the United Nations Climate Change Conference :    "Our Congressional delegation concluded a productive visit to COP27 , where we delivered an unmistakable message: America is all in to fight the climate crisis. "Our delegation salutes President Joe Biden - under his visionary leadership, America is accelerating our transition to a clean energy future and making progress on our commitment to future generations: that we will pass on the planet in a responsible, sustainable way. President Biden's well-acclaimed address to the conference offered a unifying call for collective action to save the planet - renewing optimism in our nation and around the world. "Our Members had the opportunity to meet again with Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry of Egypt, expressing our gratitude for his leadership in convening this extraordinary gathering. In addition to discussing governance and regional, economic and water security, we discussed the importance of COP27 in strengthening global partnerships to extinguish the existential threat of the climate crisis. "It was a privilege to meet with leaders from international and U.S. NGOs and civil society to discuss climate action and human rights. Many meeting participants highlighted the impacts of climate disaster in their communities and offered valuable insight that will help guide future domestic and international climate action. "Our delegation returns to Washington re-energized to continue our fight for the ambitious and necessary climate action our world needs now. Nothing can deter House Democrats from our urgent mission to save the planet."

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, EGYPT, Nov. 12 -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued the following press release: At the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 "As we face down the dual crises of climate change and food insecurity, USDA recognizes that changes to our agriculture and food systems can only happen at the needed scale and speed if farmers are at the center of our solutions," Vilsack said. "Under the Biden-Harris Administration, the United States is making unprecedented investments in innovative approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation. USDA is proud to play a pivotal role through our new Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, once-in-a-generation investments through the Inflation Reduction Act, and other initiatives that position American agriculture as a leader in delivering climate solutions through voluntary, incentive-based, market-driven and collaborative approaches. It was an honor to highlight at COP27 the Administration's leadership role, and that of American agriculture, in tackling the climate crisis."

Nov 16, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com In the middle of the consultations with the Mexican government regarding Mexico's energy policy under the USMCA and the legal fight the private sector is facing against the legislative and administrative measures the Mexican government has implemented in Andres Manuel L\'f3pez Obrador administration, the Mexican government announced aggressive renewable energy targets to fight climate change during the United Nations climate change conference , known as COP27 , in Egypt. The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard and U.S. Special Presidential Envoy John Kerry, in a joint news conference at COP27 , announced that Mexico intends to deploy more than 20 additional gigawatts of renewable power generation capacity (wind, solar, geothermal and hydropower) by 2030, in order to reach more than 40 gigawatts of renewable generation capacity. Mexico and the National Oil Company, Pemex, will eliminate routine flaring and venting on its oil and gas operations, and an investment plan of close to $2 billion USD to achieve 50% sale share of zero-emission vehicles in 2030. The target is to reduce emissions by 35% from business-as-usual levels by 2030. Mexico is lifting Mexico's previous target of 22%. Mexico is the second largest greenhouse gas emitter in Latin America. Although the announcement made by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign affairs constitutes a formal commitment by the Mexican government, it seems to be difficult that such commitment will be achieved. This because the federal budget for the fiscal year 2023, recently approved by the Mexican Congress, does not contain the necessary funds to support this commitment. More importantly, the Mexican energy regulator, the Energy Regulatory Commission, continues with its mission to block the private investment in the sector by not granting power generation permits for renewable energy sources or facilitating the modifications to the ones already granted. The Mexican government will be required to drastically change its energy policy in order to achieve the commitments made in the COP27 conference.

King Charles is to host a special pre-conference reception ahead of the COP27 summit in Egypt. It was previously confirmed the monarch will not be attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference in in Sharm el-Sheikh but it's now been revealed he will bring together around 200 international business leaders, campaigners and politicians at Buckingham Palace in London for an event to mark the end of the UK's presidency of COP26. It will take place on November 4 - two days before COP27 kicks off on November 6. Guests at the reception will include UK Prime Minister Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - who has also confirmed he does not plan to attend COP27 - as well as COP26 President Alok Sharma and John Kerry who is America's special envoy on climate change. There had been speculation King Charles would head to the event in Egypt in his first official overseas trip since becoming monarch as he has previously attended in his role as Prince of Wales and even gave one of the key note speeches at COP26 in Glasgow last year. However, Buckingham Palace later confirmed the King - who is a longtime campaigner on environmental issues - would not be going. In his speech at the 2021 Glasgow conference, King Charles called for "a vast military-style campaign" to "marshal the strength of the global private sector" in an effort to bring about changes needed to save the planet. He added: "I can only urge you, as the world's decision-makers, to find practical ways of overcoming differences so we can all get down to work, together, to rescue this precious planet and save the threatened future of our young people." \</doc>

Citi today announced the release of three Global Perspectives & Solutions (Citi GPS) reports that highlight a range of challenges and opportunities related to the climate crisis. The new research, which underscore the importance of increased private and public sector engagement to address complex global issues, will be discussed at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.citivelocity.com%2Fcitigps%2Fclimate-finance%2F&esheet=52962123&newsitemid=20221107005445&lan=en-US&anchor=Climate+Finance+%26%238211%3B+Mobilizing+the+Public+and+Private+Sector+to+Ensure+a+Just+Energy+Transition&index=1&md5=8a0a19ea3d819919f22232f8bf5ef96e Climate Finance - Mobilizing the Public and Private Sector to Ensure a Just Energy Transition A cumulative total of $125 trillion in capital investment is needed for the global economy to reach net zero by 2050. This translates into $2.6 trillion per annum over the next five years, increasing to $3.6 trillion per annum from 2026-2030. An estimated $600-900 billion was invested in 2020, which is substantially lower than what is needed to limit the negative impacts of climate change, and shows the need for all regions to scale up their climate investment flows. This report analyzes the key private and public sector institutions involved in climate financing and the various financial mechanisms that can be used to mobilize finance in developed countries, mature emerging markets and developing countries. This research will be launched at COP27 on November 9.

This report examines a range of economic and political challenges, within and among countries, that continue to impact the reliance on fossil fuels and the global energy transition. In addition to these GPS reports, Citi will host a panel event at COP27 on November 10 to present new research focused on the importance of a sustainable ocean economy. Often overlooked, ocean health plays a critical role in maintaining the global climate and tackling biodiversity loss, and the event will explore how the public and private sectors can work together to better manage ocean resources and address these interconnected issues. Citi's presence at COP27 includes a delegation of senior leaders representing businesses across the firm that are working to accelerate the transition to a net zero economy. Citi's engagement this year includes its ongoing work with the Government of Egypt across Ministries as it prepares to host COP27 , advising on best practice solutions for the energy transition, climate funding structures, and strategies for Egypt's national Nexus of Water, Food and Energy (NWFE) platform. This work builds on Citi's continued commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and help support a responsible and inclusive transition, particularly in emerging markets, and to engage with key climate stakeholders on strategies for global climate action.

The Inter-American Development Bank issued the following news release: At 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Brazil inaugurated the second phase of the Sustainable Rural Project - Amazon (PRS Amazon) to promote low-carbon agriculture in the biome. Over the next four years, the project will operate in three Brazilian states to support six sustainable production chains: acai, cacao, Brazil nut, pirarucu fish, round fish and coffee. The launch event was held at the Legal Amazon Consortium hub. The event was attended by specialists from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and representatives of the project's partner institutions: the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply; the Government of the United Kingdom; and the Brazilian Institute for Development and Sustainability. Representatives of the governments of the three states where the project will be implemented also participated. The project is part of the Sustainable Rural Program PRS - Amazonia is part of the Sustainable Rural Program (PRS), which encompasses more than 20% of Brazilian territory. The project's first phase focused on the Atlantic Forest and the Amazon. The current second phase targets the Caatinga and Cerrado biomes and returns to the Amazon. PRS has been implemented in Brazil for over a decade and aims to improve how farmers manage land and forests to achieve sustainable rural development, reduce poverty and conserve biodiversity. Around $84 million has been disbursed through UK climate finance, benefitting an area of 1.7 million square kilometers in over 250 Brazilian municipalities.

Twenty-six times, the United Nations Climate Change Conference didn't take a hard look at the world's food system and its role in climate change.This year, that finally changed. COP27 , as the conference is known, featured several food and agriculture pavilions dedicated to increasing awareness of the relationship between food and climate change. In 2021, as many as 828 million people experienced hunger a 22% increase since 2019, according to the HYPERLINK https://www.who.int/news/item/06-07-2022-un-report--global-hunger-numbers-rose-to-as-many-as-828-million-in-2021 United Nations State of Food Security and Nutrition Report . In addition, nearly 30% of the world's people were moderately or severely food insecure last year, Clean Technica https://cleantechnica.com/2022/11/19/food-security-solutions-at-cop27/ reported .The system must be completely overhauled to become truly equitable. That means paying farmers enough to make ends meet and ensuring consumers can afford food. If we don't mitigate climate change, food will continue to become more expensive and both farmers and consumers will suffer.One way to reduce hunger is to bring beans and legumes to the center of more consumers' plates. While beans are a sustainable alternative to animal proteins, they also contain carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. In addition, beans have a low carbon footprint: Per kilogram (2.2 pounds), beans produce just 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide, while beef produces 27 metric tons of the greenhouse gas, according to HYPERLINK https://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html GreenEatz.com .Reducing food waste is another way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The WWF, a conservation organization, says food waste is responsible for about 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions four times as much as the global airline industry creates. The food we lose on farms alone could feed the world\' s undernourished population almost four times over," according to the organization.How COP27 became the food systems COP We can phase out fossil fuels, but we can\' t phase out food, so we have to transform food systems," said Jo\'e3o Campari, global leader of food practice at the WWF.  We\' re today where energy was 30 years ago, yet we don\' t have 30 years to make the change."It's only been 14 months since last year's Food Systems Summit, but food systems penetrated this year's COP27 . For the first time, heads of state and delegates spent an entire day of negotiations focusing on agriculture. Next, they'll need to discuss emission throughout the food chain.The dedicated conversation on food and agriculture in five COP pavilions is also a significant move. [It] acknowledges that without transformations of food systems, which account for approximately one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions and the vast majority of biodiversity loss, we will be unable to achieve a stable climate, feed people and save biodiversity," says Deborah Bossio, lead scientist for food systems at The Nature Conservancy.Read more at HYPERLINK https://www.greenbiz.com/article/how-cop27-became-food-systems-cop GreenBiz.com How COP27 became the food systems COP If we really want to stop climate change, we have to stop the farming of animals," said Josh Tetrick, host of the dinner and chief executive of the  slaughter-free" Bay Area meat company Good Meat. Of the lab-grown meat, he said,  This lets us enjoy real meat without the issues."Lab-cultured meat was one proposal offered at COP27 to reduce the food industry's gigantic carbon footprint. But it wasn't the only one: sustainable, plant-based meat and a large gene bank that focuses on climate-resilient seeds were among the others.Any discussion of food systems is a notable move at a United Nations Climate Change Conference HYPERLINK https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/11/18/cop27-food-agriculture-climate/ The Washington Post COP27 became the food systems COPAgriculture Innovation Mission for Climate, an $8 billion initiative launched a year ago, addresses climate change through the use of artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and robotics. Of those funds, $1 billion will be dedicated to advancing small-holder farmers' access to technology.Not everyone agrees with the initiative, however. The International Coalition on Climate and Agriculture calls the move a distraction from the bigger issue. Agritech and the industrial agribusiness model it furthers are not a solution to the climate crisis, but rather a significant part of the problem," Andrew Kimbrell, ICCA co-founder, said in a news release.A group of 14 agricultural commodity companies announced a plan to end deforestation by 2025. Forests are often cleared for the production of palm oil, beef, cacao and soy. Because trees sequester carbon, removing them for cattle grazing both reduces the amount of atmospheric carbon captured and increases emissions of greenhouse gases. Companies involved include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and JBS.However, critics say the timeline is too slow and the plan allows too many loopholes to be effective.Read more at HYPERLINK https://modernfarmer.com/2022/11/cop27-agriculture-initiatives/ Modern Farmer . \</doc>

The following information was released by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA): PETA Asia's scantily clad "lettuce ladies" headed to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) today to bare their skin and lay bare the summit's hypocrisy of serving meat, dairy, and other planet-killing foods. According to the UN's own recommendations, going vegan is necessary if we are to avoid the worst effects of the climate catastrophe, since animal agriculture is responsible for nearly one-fifth of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Photos are available here. "Would an oncologist take puffs of a cigarette while administering chemotherapy? Because that's exactly how leaders look when they talk about saving the planet in between bites of meat," says PETA Director of Outreach Ashley Byrne, who traveled to Egypt to volunteer as a lettuce lady (pictured above, left). "Double standards are on full display at COP27 , and PETA is calling on the UN to go vegan or go home." By some estimates, animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all the world's transportation systems combined. The meat, egg, and dairy industries also use an enormous amount of waterit takes more than 2,400 gallons to produce just 1 pound of beefwhile polluting waterways with manure runoff, and more than 90% of all Amazon rainforest land cleared since 1970 is used for grazing livestock, exacerbating the climate catastrophe. In addition to helping save the planet, each individual who goes vegan saves nearly 200 animals every year from daily misery inside a dark shed or on a squalid feedlot and a terrifying death under the slaughterhouse knife. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Inter-American Dialogue: The 27th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 , was held in Egypt on Nov. 6-18. The world's largest climate event with more than 190 participating countries, it brought together heads of state, ministers, civil society, and private sector representatives to discuss mitigation efforts and adaptation to climate change. What are the biggest takeaways from COP27 for Latin America and the Caribbean? What new climate mitigation innovations and financing mechanisms have the most promise for helping nations in the Western Hemisphere that are struggling with climate change? How much of a voice was Latin American and Caribbean nations given in leading the international negotiations? Daniela Stevens and MK Vereen, director and assistant, respectively, in the Inter-American Dialogue's Energy, Climate Change and Extractive Industries Program: At COP27 , Latin America rallied around increased adaptation finance and Amazon conservation but remained split regarding the future of fossil fuels. In a historic win for adaptation, wealthy nations agreed to establish a 'loss and damage' fund to compensate vulnerable countries' climate-linked losses. While details of the deal will not be finalized until the next COP, the decision is a lifeboat especially for Small Island Developing States, many of which are in the Caribbean. Member states also called on Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to alleviate climate impacts and debt burdens in developing countries by providing loans at lower interest rates, pausing debt repayments for poorer nations hit by climate disasters, and expanding and standardizing debt for nature swaps. While the parties ratified this proposal, the agreement is non-binding for MDBs. On the mitigation side, the region remains divided regarding the phaseout of fossil fuels; however, clean energy commitments increased. Despite doubling down on fossil fuels, President Lpez-Obrador of Mexico vowed to dramatically increase renewable energy production, although it is dubious whether the country will find financing for these projects. Since COP26, major methane emitters like Brazil, Colombia and Mexico are taking concrete action to bring down methane emissions. Presidents Petro of Colombia, Lula of Brazil, and even Maduro of Venezuela rallied around increased Amazon protection. Overall, despite calls for regional unification, Latin American nations still lack \</doc>

Dec 05, 2022( globalEDGE Blog: HYPERLINK https://globaledge.msu.edu/blog https://globaledge.msu.edu/blog COP 27 One of the most talked about results from COP 27 is the implementation of'loss and damage[5]' funding. This fund creates a funding source forlosses and damages[6]when natural disasters occur in developing countries, partially as a result of environmental damage caused by large, non-developing countries. Governments willdevelop committees[5]to help with the transition to implement this funding and to provide suggestions on how to delegate funding. Funding for this is expected to come from the 'Adaptation Fund[7]' which helps finance projects in developing countries thathelp adapt[5]communities to climate change. While the Adaptation Fund gained$230 million[8]in pledges at COP27 , some officials fear that this is still not enough funding, especially as the fund hasnot seen pledges[6]from several large countries yet. Typically, the costs of preventing climate change are significantly cheaper than what it would cost to clean up or fix a climate disaster. If the Adaptation Fund does not see an increased number of pledges, vulnerable communities could go bankrupt and even extinct trying to clean up or flee intense natural disasters that could occur as a result of climate change. Another large theme seen throughout the conference was therole of technology[9]in nature. From creating more transparency about the environmental effects of supply chains totracking deforestation[10], and much more, technology provides a newfound level of transparency with regard to how our earth is doing, and how much damage humans are causing. In line with the theme of technology, severalnew partnerships[9]with tech companies are forming as a result of COP 27 to better our environment. Vera, a company that runs thelargest greenhouse gas crediting program[11], and Pachama, a company that hascreated technology[12]to evaluate carbon levels in forests, have joined forces to create anew technology platform[9]that will measure, report, and verify carbon levels in forests. This aligns with the newly createdForest Data Partnership[13], in which companies, non-profits, and governmental departments work together to gather better data on forests across the world. TheUnited States[14]Department of State, NASA, and Google are just a few of the groups[13] in this partnership. In recent years, we have seen many companies placing a larger emphasis on sustainability and 'green' business practices. These partnerships continue to emphasizesustainability, and we could see other companies across the world join this movement. One final primary theme of the conference was the importance of keeping the planet under1.5 degrees Celsius[5]above pre-industrial levels. Several packages were created at COP 27 to continue committing to this goal. Items in the package, like the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan[5], actively note the importance of keeping the temperature under that 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold. Additionally, many of the items in the package help strengthen actions other countries are taking to lower greenhouse gas emissions[5] while working to adapt their countries to the impacts climate change has already made on our world. COP 27 was a monumental event for several reasons, and the actions and ideas formulated at this event are likely to impact the globe for years to come.

The government of Israel issued the following news release on Nov. 2, 2022: President Isaac Herzog hosted today (Wednesday, 2 November 2022) the Israeli delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , which will take place next week in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. The President is expected to lead the delegation to COP27 in Egypt, with the participation of ministers, climate experts, academics and others, as part of his efforts to protect the environment and combat climate change, including his establishment of the Israeli Climate Forum. Also attending the reception at the President's Residence were Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg, Science and Technology Minister Orit Farkash Hacohen, representatives of the Israeli COP27 delegation from the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Israeli Climate Forum Chairman Dr. Dov Khenin, and the managers of the Climate Forum working groups. The President opened his remarks: "There is no more important issue to humanity, there is no other issue with such far-reaching local and international dimensions, and there is no issue that besides being so important transcends all disagreements and political events as the climate crisis. The President added: "I see an unparalleled opportunity in this delegation to make a firm statement about the magnitude of the challenge, to present our accomplishments and capabilities and of course to extend a hand to our neighbors and partners so that we may fight together for the future of Planet Earth and of our environment." Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg: "Next week we will go to the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh. Over the past year, since COP26, we have made tremendous progress in preparing for and grappling with the climate crisis in Israel. We advanced the climate law, formulated preparatory plans, and built a curriculum that educates every student in Israel about climate change. Still, there is much more to be done. We have no time to waste, and I hope that environmental protection will not fall victim to political polarization." Dr. Dov Khenin: "The challenge of the climate crisis requires us to cooperate in unimaginable ways. We will continue to develop connections in every aspect of Israeli politics, with every sector of the Israeli society, in order to recruit everyone for unified response. This response can make Israel an integral part of the global solution, and simultaneously improve the lives of Israeli citizens in a very real sense. In transportation, the cost of living, quality of life, and health--for all of us."

Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-New York, issued the following news release and letter: Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) led a letter to Special Envoy John Kerry urging the U.S. to support loss & damage (L&D) funding to help developing countries recover from climate disasters. This fund should channel new public funding from developed to developing countries to help them recover from climate disasters. This L&D proposal could be a small yet important first step in pushing U.S. policy towards transformative climate and economic justice globally. "The United States is the world's largest historical contributor to climate change," the Members wrote. "Yet as we've seen with the historic flooding in Pakistan, the fourth consecutive drought in the Horn of Africa, the painfully slow recovery from hurricane damage in Central America, among many other examples, it is the Global South that disproportionately suffers the harms. We have both a moral and a strategic responsibility to provide comprehensive support for countries facing climate disaster, including debt forgiveness and reparations." In October, the Biden administration accepted formal discussions of loss & damage at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 . In his speech at United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), President Biden pledged to work with Congress to increase U.S. international climate finance and urged accelerating new and expanded domestic and global efforts in supporting developing countries. Developing countries often pay the highest price for climate change while contributing very little to greenhouse gas emissions. The letter is also signed by Reps. Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Steve Cohen, Jesus G. "Chuy" Garcia, Raul M. Grijalva, Andy Levin, Betty McCollum, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mark Pocan, Jan Schakowsky and Rashida Tlaib November 14, 2022 To: The Honorable John F. Kerry, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20520 Dear Special Envoy Kerry, As you know, the United States is the world's largest historical contributor to climate change. Yet as we've seen with the historic flooding in Pakistan, the fourth consecutive drought in the Horn of Africa, the painfully slow recovery from hurricane damage in Central America, among many other examples, it is the Global South that disproportionately suffers the harms. We have both a moral and a strategic responsibility to provide comprehensive support for countries facing climate disaster, including debt forgiveness and reparations. While we work toward those crucial goals, there are also smaller but no less important mechanisms we should be supporting. One specific step we urge you to take immediately is to throw the United States' support behind the establishment of a Loss & Damage Finance Facility under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the purpose of channeling new, grant-based public finance from developed to developing countries to help them recover from climate catastrophes. We are encouraged that the Biden administration has accepted formal discussions of Loss & Damage at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 . We hope you will build on that commitment and continue engaging in good faith discussion to ensure the world's most vulnerable communities receive life-saving resources in times of crisis. Ad hoc humanitarian assistance flows, insurance schemes, debt-based financing, and neglected existing funds under the UNFCCC are wholly insufficient to address the current reality in which countries are facing billions of dollars in loss and damage needs. A collaborative international effort is needed to make more high-quality, accessible, and fit-for-purpose financing available, especially to account for losses and damages caused by climate emergencies. Such financing must be supplementary to climate financing for mitigation and adaptation and should be unconditional public funding that does not deepen the debt crises faced by many vulnerable countries. We believe that a new L&D fund that is carefully designed and negotiated could both urgently address such funding gaps and fully embrace a transformative global climate justice framework. We have a momentous opportunity to bring other partner countries to the table and shape an equitable path forward - as you know and have proven repeatedly in your own career, when the United States leads, others follow. Our leadership in supporting loss and damage financing would pave the way for transformative improvements in the global response on climate. We look forward to working with you, your team, and the rest of the Administration in pushing for the most effective global climate action, beginning with U.S. leadership on a loss & damage framework. Sincerely, Ilhan Omar, Member of Congress Jamaal Bowman, Ed.D., Member of Congress CORI BUSH, Member of Congress Andre Carson, Member of Congress Jesus G. "Chuy" Garcia, Member of Congress Raul M. Grijalva, Member of Congress Andy Levin, Member of Congress Betty McCollum, Member of Congress Mark Pocan, Member of Congress Jan Schakowsky, Member of Congress Rashida Tlaib, Member of Congress    Original text here: HYPERLINK https://bowman.house.gov/press-releases?ID=766049BD-FA7F-420C-8AD0-0CF807F8DD82 https://bowman.house.gov/press-releases?ID=766049BD-FA7F-420C-8AD0-0CF807F8DD82 Copyright Targeted News Services T40-MgEditor-7999386 T40-MgEditor \</doc>

Namibia has secured over \â¬ 540mn ($544mn) in climate finance from the Dutch government and European Investment Bank (EIB) at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. The Dutch grant is from infrastructure funding vehicle Invest International, while the facility from the EIB is to build green hydrogen and renewable energy projects in Namibia, Reuters reported on November 8. One of the world's sunniest countries, Namibia has the potential to produce green hydrogen and position itself as a renewable energy hub in Africa. The country's first hydrogen power plant is expected to be up and running in 2024. Hydrogen is categorised "green" when it is made with renewable power and is seen as key to help decarbonise industry, though the technology remains immature and relatively costly, writes Reuters. In May, the EU's energy strategy set a goal of importing at least 10mn tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, with another 10mn tonnes to be produced within the bloc. Namibia has been identified as a strategic enabler of the EU's decarbonisation agenda through its ability to export clean energy to Europe. According to Reuters, Namibia on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding with the European Union on renewable hydrogen and rare raw materials. President Geingob gave no specifics on the agreement but said experts from both sides would soon meet to outline joint plans. \</doc>

BEEAH Group, the Middle East s pioneer in sustainable, smart solutions for future-ready cities, has signed the ZEV Declaration at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. Around 200 signatories to the declaration, initiated by the UK Presidency, [...] BEEAH Group, the Middle East s pioneer in sustainable, smart solutions for future-ready cities, has signed the ZEV Declaration at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. Around 200 signatories to the declaration, initiated by the UK Presidency, are now setting a roadmap so that by 2040, all new van and car sales will be zero-emissions vehicles (ZEV). By signing the ZEV Declaration, BEEAH Group is taking definitive steps within its own operations and is joining the call to action for governments, businesses, and organisations to rapidly accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles and achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Following the signing, Khaled Al Huraimel , Group CEO of BEEAH Group, said: As a pioneer for sustainability in the Middle East, we have been committed to setting the pace for sustainable action. Through our businesses and innovations, we have demonstrated several models to advance net-zero emissions and zero-waste-to-landfill strategies. Now, as the first organisation in the UAE to sign the ZEV declaration, we are hoping to lead by example and showcase tangible business benefits to using emissions-free fleets for operations, combining electric and hydrogen fuel solutions. In line with the UAE s sustainability roadmap and the Net-Zero by 2050 strategic initiative, BEEAH Group has already made advancements to lower emissions across its businesses and projects. Within its holding group structure, one of BEEAH Group s major businesses is its waste collection and city cleaning business, BEEAH Tandeef. Its fleet of thousands of vehicles comprises electric models, which enable operations across the UAE, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt, including in the city of Sharm El Sheikh where COP27 is being held. BEEAH Tandeef s services in Sharm El Sheikh began a few days prior to COP27 . A digitally enabled fleet, hundreds of innovative bins, as well as a large skilled workforce have been deployed to tourist hotspots, public spaces and residential areas in Sharm El Sheikh. Cleaning personnel and bins are also serving the Sharm El Sheikh International Convention Centre, where COP27 is being held. Following the conference, BEEAH Tandeef will continue to deliver its services as part of a 10-year contract in the city. BEEAH Group has also placed the Middle East s largest order for fully electric Tesla Semis, which once developed will be one of the fastest and safest freight trucks in the world. Through its green and autonomous mobility business, BEEAH Transport, the Group has been exploring next-generation innovation in sustainable mobility and testing models for smarter, emissions-free transport. Zero-emissions vehicles will be essential to creating accessible, hyperconnected transport networks in the smart, sustainable cities of the future. Through BEEAH Transport, our dedicated business driven towards the green mobility transition, we will continue to drive the adoption of zero-emissions vehicles across industries, as well as solutions that support the need for green mobility infrastructure in the region, the BEEAH Group CEO added. The UK Presidency initiated the ZEV Declaration at COP26 in Glasgow last year and has since had many governments, companies, automobile manufacturers and fleet operators sign on to the pledge. Speaking on the development, Nigel Topping, UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP26, said: BEEAH Group is our first\~Race to Zero\~signatory in the UAE to sign on to the ZEV Declaration, which is a critical development as countries in the Middle East\~region\~have high vehicle densities. By making the switch to zero-emission vehicles, BEEAH Group is taking a decisive step towards achieving\~the\~net-zero\~ambition\~and contributing to the local, regional, and global sustainability agenda.\~During\~ COP27 , we expect\~that more governments and\~non-state actors\~in the Middle East will be inspired to act towards an\~emission-free mobility\~sector\~in the region. Representing UAE at COP27 , BEEAH Group is exhibiting its milestone projects that have contributed to a future of net-zero emissions, zero-waste to landfill and infrastructure for sustainable, smart cities. One of the key projects being showcased is the Sharjah Waste to Energy Plant, the region s first commercial-scale plant of its kind. The plant is equipped to divert 300,000 tonnes of waste away from landfill every year while meeting the power needs of approximately 28,000 homes in Sharjah. The plant is the inaugural project of the Emirates Waste to Energy company, a joint venture between BEEAH Group and Masdar, the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company. The Group is also highlighting its state-of-the-art Waste Management Centre, which has been the driving force for the emirate of Sharjah in achieving 76% landfill waste diversion. The complex is managed and operated by BEEAH Recycling, the Group s recycling, and material recovery business. It comprises ten specialised facilities equipped with digital technologies and advanced machinery, which help automate waste sorting and processing to recover valuable material for reintroduction into the circular economy. The BEEAH Group Headquarters building is also being displayed at the pavilion as a model for offices of the future and infrastructure in tomorrow s sustainable, smart cities. Integrated with future AI and digital twin technologies, the Headquarters is built to operate at net-zero, LEED Platinum standards. Featuring the iconic design of the late Dame Zaha Hadid, one of the world s most influential architects of her time, the building also offers an unparalleled environment for employee comfort and productivity. Speaking about BEEAH Group s participation, Al Huraimel added, We are proud to be part of the UAE delegation to COP27 . It is great to be part of the global conversation on planning and taking climate action. By showcasing the projects that are contributing to the UAE s sustainability agenda, we hope to offer models for success in achieving a sustainable quality of life for all. Following the ZEV declaration, we also look forward to the next chapter of collaboration and innovation to solidify our efforts and impact towards a future of net-zero emissions.

PR Newswire Heaven and Hell in the Anthropocene immerses decision makers at the UN Climate Change Conference in two competing scenarios for the future\~ To heat things up for world leaders gathered at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 The creatives turned this insight into an impactful artistic experience to raise questions around responsibility, participation and action. Since they couldn't literally heat up COP27 's plenary rooms, they created an immersive public art installation at COP27 andinvited decision-makers to experiencetwo 'scenarios of eternity'. "Many governments, companies and individuals are still insensitive to scientific facts and numbers. Thus, a more physical and visceral experience is needed," says Yana Buhrer Tavanier, co-founder and executive director of Fine Acts. The installation is composed of two adjacent rooms: one representing heaven and the other \- hell. Participants do not know which of the two 'scenarios of eternity' they will be engaging with, as from the outside the rooms look entirely identical. Before entering, each visitor is prompted to make a series of choices, which send them to either 'heaven' or 'hell'\- where all their senses are targeted by different sights, sounds, temperatures, and smells. "For many the perception of eternity is divided between the two poles of heaven in hell. Living in the Anthropocene \- the most recent period in Earth's history when human activity started to have a significant impact on the planet's climate and ecosystems \- we need to ask ourselves, what's our eternity really going to look like? Are we going to heaven, or are we going to hell?" says artist Bahia Shehab. The aim of the installation is to make people feel like stakeholders in our collective future and drive action towards making change possible. The artwork is displayed on site in the Green Zone at COP27 (November 6-18).

The following information was released by the Government of Canada: As the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) winds up, Canada is urging the international community to continue collaborating to address the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Today, during Biodiversity Day COP27 , the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, announced that Canada is investing up to $855,000 to ensure that not-for-profit environmental groups and Indigenous partners can fully participate in the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15), taking place in Montreal from December 719, 2022. Over fifty groups will receive the funding, which is being coordinated by the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, to support their participation in the lead up to the Nature COP and facilitate many important events that will be accessible to the general public. The announcement comes as the Minister has been actively engaged in a number of high-profile events at COP27 dealing with nature and biodiversity, including a Canadian co-hosted ministerial meeting, Biodiversity Action (MoBA) at COP27 | A Final Push on the Road to COP15, attended by representatives from over twenty-five countries. Minister Guilbeault has also been conducting many bilateral meetings with partner countries with the message that conserving nature and halting the alarming biodiversity loss are fundamental in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Canada is taking a strong leadership role, along with international partners, in championing the development of an ambitious framework with clear targets and actions that also recognize the important role Indigenous peoples and communities play in conservation and biodiversity. Delegates from 196 countries are expected to gather in Montreal for COP15. Canada continues to make progress on the goal toward thirty percent by 2030, having launched the largest conservation campaign in the country's history, backed by multi-billion dollar investments in Budget 2018 and Budget 2021, available to the provinces and territories. Canada has also committed to ensuring that at least twenty percent of its $5.3 billion climate finance commitment supports projects that leverage nature-based climate solutions and contribute biodiversity co-benefits in developing countries over the next five years. \</doc>

Storms,\~wildfires, energy disruptions and inflation are among the stressors facing government leaders as HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/cop27 COP27 , the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , gets underway in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.  Cities are really feeling vulnerable around these things. There\' s a lot of heaviness going into this COP; a lot of fear, said first-time COP participant Heather Rosenberg, Americas resilience discipline leader at engineering and consulting firm Arup, in an interview ahead of the conference. And when considering economic and geopolitical unrest,\~ climate is a threat multiplier, said World Resources Institute President and CEO Ani Dasgupta during a press briefing last week. In recent years, these UN conferences, or \' COPs\' \~ \~referring to Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  \~have been a forum to set carbon reduction targets and plans. This year, as government leaders and a range of other climate partners from around the world gather, their focus is on HYPERLINK https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1130242 implementation .\~The summit\' s HYPERLINK https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/10/cop27-why-it-matters-and-5-key-areas-for-action/ key goals \~surround climate mitigation (taking urgent action to reduce emissions), adaptation (enhancing resilience, particularly in vulnerable communities), finance (particularly toward assisting developing countries), and collaboration, according to the World Economic Forum. Despite the global nature of COP27 \' s questions  including around HYPERLINK https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/07/climate-cop27-opens-with-a-rallying-call-for-rich-nations-to-pay-up.html  climate reparations HYPERLINK loss and damage linked to the emerging impacts from climate change could be translated in the U.S. to how it deals with the National Flood Insurance Program, said Robert Kay, Americas climate services and sustainability leader at Arup. When it comes to implementation, cities have to be prepared to have hard conversations about tough challenges. They\' ve already gone after a lot of the low-hanging fruit around energy efficiency, for example,\~Rosenberg explained.  Now it is the stuff that people wanted to not touch like \' how do we move away from natural gas in buildings?\' That's a big lift. The variety of stakeholders at COP27 mirror the range of partners needed in U.S. cities to make implementation a success. While climate finance remains a huge question worldwide, U.S. cities and states will \~ experience this conference in the wake of federal climate funding commitments included in the HYPERLINK http://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/Inflation-reduction-act-city-climate-plans-equity-plans-funding/630067/ Inflation Reduction Act COP27 overlaps with midterm HYPERLINK elections in the United States, which could change the balance of power in Congress.

The following information was released by the Office of Electricity (OE): U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm held a panel discussion showcasing the DOE Energy Earthshots at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or Conference of the Parties ( COP ) 27 , in Egypt. In her opening remarks, Secretary Granholm featured a video that highlights how the OE-sponsored Grid Storage Launchpad (GSL) will support DOE's Long-Duration Energy Earthshot to achieve affordable grid storage for clean power anytime, anywhere by reducing the cost of grid-scale energy storage by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of duration within the decade. The new GSL will help to overcome challenges in battery RandD capabilities, including: Independent testing and validation for next-generation energy storage materials, devices, and prototype systems under grid operating conditions; Characterization abilities focused on technologies with grid applications; and Integration of existing materials development and collaboration with industry and universities. DOE and PNNL celebrated the groundbreaking of the facility on April 21, 2022. The building is expected to be ready for occupancy and start of operations in 2024. The GSL will help ensure the Department succeeds in strengthening the resilience of the grid to withstand the tests and challenges of the future, while ensuring that Americans continue to enjoy the benefits of our Nation's energy abundance. Long-Duration Storage Shot Overview The Long-Duration Storage Shot establishes a target to reduce the cost of grid-scale energy storage by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of duration within the decade. Energy storage has the potential to accelerate full decarbonization of the electric grid. While shorter duration storage is currently being installed to support today's level of renewable energy generation, longer duration storage technologies are needed as more renewables are deployed on the grid. \</doc>

The following information was released by Rochester Institute of Technology: by Rich Kiley Nabil Nasr joined delegates from around the world in Egypt this week for COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Nabil Nasr, associate provost and director of RIT's Golisano Institute for Sustainability (GIS), joined delegates from around the worldincluding more than 100 heads of statein Egypt this week for COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference . Held annually in the fall since 1995, COP stands for Conference to the Parties. A party is one of the 198 nations that has ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which aims to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent dangerous global warming. This year's conference, which runs through Nov. 18, is taking place in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt. Nasr, who also serves as CEO of the REMADE Institute, where RIT is the consortium's lead member, called it an "incredible gathering of people from across the globe all focused on sustainability and climate change" as well as other important related topics. "This has been a fantastic event in showing the incredible demand for what we do both at GIS and the REMADE Institute," he said. Nasr participated in several COP27 events involving the International Resource Panel (IRP) of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)for which he serves as a U.S. memberin addition to collaborating with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, where he serves as a trustee. Among the dignitaries he met at the conference included John Kerry, the first U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, a position President Biden appointed him to last year. "John Kerry talked about our goal of net zero by 2050 and the fact that we cannot reach this goal without bold actions," Nasr observed. "The war in Ukraine certainly cast a shadow of doubt that actions might be less than expected." The yearly COPs include reviewing the emissions and emissions reduction plans of each country, determining whether or not existing plans are sufficiently effective, and negotiating additional plans to reduce emissions. The COPs are considered vital because they are the main forum for the world's nations to come together and make important decisions about how to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis. COP27 comes at a time when the impacts of climate change are more apparent than ever, from a spring and summer of record-breaking heat waves to powerful hurricanes in the U.S. and flooding in Pakistan that left a third of the country underwater. The REMADE CEO was invited to Washington, D.C., late last month to participate in the White House Manufacturing USA Summit. The conference marked the latest in a series of important events Nasr has attended or hosted during recent weeks. In late October, the REMADE CEO was invited to Washington, D.C., to participate in the White House Manufacturing USA Summit. REMADE is part of Manufacturing USA, a national network of 16 federally designated, public-private partnerships united to secure U.S. global leadership in advanced manufacturing through large-scale collaboration on technology, supply chain, and workforce development. The institute is the first for which the university serves as lead member. Prior to that, Nasr attended a UNEP IRP meeting from Oct. 17 to 22 in Paris, where he also presented virtually on the circular economy to the World Trade Organization (WTO). That came on the heels of Nasr co-hosting thought leaders and executives from around the world who gathered in Rochester in mid-October for the fifth RIC-RIT World Remanufacturing Conference. And late September saw Nasr make yet another trip to Washington, D.C., after attending the Global Clean Energy Action Forum in Pittsburgh, Pa. After being back in Rochester for a few weeks, Nasr will attend a strategy session with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in London the first week in December. "With COVID travel restrictions in place for a long time being lifted, many events have now resumed in person," he said. "As the head of my organization, it is very important to stay connected to help bring back valuable information, increase visibility of RIT and GIS, and also help market our capabilities," Nasr added. \</doc>

The following information was released by Northwestern University: Amid the most critical decade for climate action, governments, industries and communities around the world are intensifying efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and halt imminent harm to vulnerable ecosystems. Universities, including Northwestern, are proving to be pivotal partners, developing technological, policy and societal innovations to fuel these efforts. Many of the global collaborations generating solutions to the climate crisis are forged at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) where countries come together to act on achieving the world's collective climate goals and negotiate international agreements intended to stave off climate catastrophes. For the second consecutive year, Northwestern is sending a delegation of faculty and graduate students to COP27 , which this year takes place Nov. 6-18 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Northwestern participants will be among the approximately 40,000 delegates at the event, including government leaders from nearly 200 nations. The delegation is supported by the Northwestern Roberta Buffett Institute for Global Affairs. The Institute for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN) also supported the process for petitioning access to and reviewing proposals for delegate credentials. Representing eight different schools and departments across the University, the delegates have diverse expertise in areas including Indigenous peoples' approaches to sustainability, the Earth's carbon cycle, environmental law and climate finance. At COP27 , they will engage in negotiations, share and conduct research, and build global connections, contributing to the next set of innovations driving climate action. Annelise Riles, executive director of the Buffett Institute and associate provost for global affairs at Northwestern, will lead the delegation. In partnership with the U7+ Alliance of World Universities, for which Northwestern serves as Secretariat, as well as the Worldwide Universities Network, the Italian University Network for Sustainable Development and the University Climate Change Coalition, Riles also will moderate a panel discussion at COP27 focused on universities' role as key co-creators of solutions with governments, community and industry. Northwestern Now spoke with three delegates about their work and what they hope to accomplish at COP27 Niloufar Sarvian "I feel like I'm a software engineer in the early '90s I have an edge on an industry that's about to be world-changing. "I'm a paleoclimatologist, which means I study Earth's past climate. Essentially, I'm an expert on how the carbon cycle works, which is how climate is controlled. I want to work in carbon dioxide removal removing CO2 from the atmosphere, which people have just started thinking about en masse in the last two years. ISEN helped me bridge the space between policy, business and science, so I got to take entrepreneurship classes, and I've been attending workshops with people working on creating American policies to ensure we remove carbon dioxide from the oceans in a safe way. Through COP27 , I want to meet people who are thinking about this problem on a more international scale." Sarvian is a Ph.D. candidate in Earth and planetary sciences at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. After completing her Ph.D., she will join Marble, a climate tech venture studio headquartered in Paris, as a founder-in-residence to build a startup focused on decarbonization. \</doc>

The following information was released by the office of California Rep. Scott Peters: This week, Rep. Scott Peters (CA-52) will travel to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt to participate in COP27 , the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference . Congressman Peters is scheduled to participate in conversations about clean energy and climate resilience and meet with government and business leaders. "Recent extreme weather events, including wildfires, heat waves, floods, and droughts all point to the growing urgency of the climate crisis," said Rep. Peters. " COP27 is great opportunity to help advance new clean technologies, help communities adapt to the effects of climate change, and solidify a global trade network that rewards climate leadership. I'm honored to participate in another international climate change conference to reaffirm the United States' role in international climate policy and learn from representatives from across the globe." Rep. Peters will be traveling to Egypt with a bipartisan delegation including Reps. Stacey Plaskett (Virgin Islands-At Large), Andrew Garbarino (NY-02), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), David Joyce (OH-14), and Brad Schneider (IL-10). This group of Members was invited to COP27 by the Climate Solutions Foundation, an organization working to advance bipartisan collaboration on climate change among elected officials, environmental groups and business leaders. COP27 marks the third international climate conference Rep. Peters has attended as a Member of the House of Representatives. One year ago, he traveled to the United Kingdom for COP26. He also traveled to Madrid for COP25 in 2019 as part of a delegation led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In the 117th Congress, Rep. Peters has successfully advanced several bills to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In June 2021, President Biden signed a resolution introduced by Congressman Peters to reinstate methane emissions regulations. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), signed into law one year ago, included record funding for climate resilience and advanced clean technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture. IIJA also included Rep. Peters' POWER ON Act to expand renewable energy and help accelerate the development of interstate transmission lines. Most recently, Rep. Peters helped secure notable climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act including billions in tax credits and grant programs to support essential climate technologies like solar, wind, and carbon capture. Rep. Peters has also introduced bills to combat the climate crisis including the METHANE ACT to curb dangerous methane emissions, the National Climate Adaptation and Resilience Strategy Act to prepare the nation for climate change-fueled extreme weather, and the Federal Carbon Dioxide Removal Leadership Act to help deploy critical technologies that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. \</doc>

The Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) will promote the attributes of the Island as a global climate risk finance capital at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), which begins today in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, and runs through November 18. The BDA's presence at COP27 builds upon our efforts last year in Glasgow, Scotland when Bermuda's Deputy Premier, Minister of Home Affairs, The Hon. Walter Roban, JP, MP, serving as Chair of the UK Overseas Territories Association at COP26, said any push on the global stage to become a key player of climate risk financing also had to include robust efforts at home to mitigate against the impacts of climate change. BDA CEO, David Hart said, "Last year at COP26, the BDA felt we were in the right place at the right time to share Bermuda's aspirations to serve as the climate risk finance capital of the world. One year on, as we continue to execute on our climate risk initiative, we look forward to conversations at COP27 with asset management leaders, entrepreneurs, tech innovators and NGOs interested in financing mechanisms to build climate resiliency, many of whom we met during our climate risk finance roadshows this past year." At COP26 the BDA hosted a Bermuda luncheon, for a diverse group of 50 climate leaders and potential partners from around the globe. At COP27 we are pleased to once again host a Bermuda climate risk finance reception at Hub Culture's Climate Pavilion. At this reception, the BDA will remind participants of Bermuda's environmental leadership as we continue to address related environmental issues at home, including the future introduction of a Marine Development Act to provide the framework for the management of the Marine Spatial Plan and to introduce the governance structure of the Blue Economy Fund as well as the investment model for the Green Energy Fund. In addition, our guests will hear about the strength of our human capital and how over the last several decades Bermuda has evolved into a globally significant property catastrophe (re)insurance market protecting some of the world's most vulnerable areas from the worst effects of climate change, including floods, hurricanes, and wildfires. Since 1997 Bermuda's commercial (re)insurers have paid out over a half a trillion dollars to policyholders and cedants in the US, EU, and UK.

The following information was released by the European Parliament: Bas Eickhout, Chair of the European Parliament's delegation at COP27 will comment on negotiations in a press conference with Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans. Chair of the European Parliament's delegation to COP27 Bas Eickhout (Greens/EFA, NL) and Executive Vice-President of the Commission Frans Timmermans will brief journalists in Egypt today, Thursday 17 November, at 14.00 EET (13.00 CEST) on the progress of talks at the UN conference on climate change , COP27 . It will take place in press conference room "Cairo". Fourteen MEPs, led by Eickhout and with Peter Liese (EPP, DE) as Vice-Chair, have been in Egypt since 14 November and will leave on Friday. You can watch the press conference live here or here. Background Parliament is a co-legislator on the EU energy and climate legislation which seeks to implement the Paris Agreement and it must give its consent before the EU can enter international agreements . MEPs have been pushing for more ambitious EU climate legislation and declared a climate emergency on 28 November 2019. In June 2021, Parliament adopted the European Climate Law, which transforms the European Green Deal's political commitment to EU climate neutrality by 2050 into a binding obligation for the EU and member states. It also increases the EU's target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 40% to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. MEPs are currently negotiating with member states on the "Fit for 55 in 2030 package" in order to enable the EU to reach the more ambitious 2030-target. A political agreement between Parliament and Council has already been made for stricter rules for member states' greenhouse gas emissions, a zero-emissions target for new cars and vans in 2035 and on the land use, land use change and forestry sector (LULUCF). Negotiations are expected to be finalised on the other files in the coming months. \</doc>

The 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference will include discussions of "loss and damage" funding for some of the poorest and most heavily affected countries in the world. The topic of loss and damage funding has been nothing short of controversial among world leaders and policymakers. On Saturday, and early into Sunday, delegates debated whether it should be discussed at all at COP27 Presidential envoy HYPERLINK http://www.upi.com/topic/John_Kerry/ John Kerry recently told Bronwen HYPERLINK http://www.upi.com/topic/Maddox/ Maddox , chief executive of the British international affairs think tank Chatham House, that the United States would be on board with helping developing nations which are disproportionately seeing the effects of climate change firsthand. "How do we develop the developing world?" Kerry asked. "We've been falling short grossly. We have to help these countries be able to jumpstart." COP27 is being held in Egypt through November 18. There are 45,000 people including delegates from 196 countries and 120 world leaders expected to be in attendance. The resolution to discuss loss and damage was a welcomed one for non-governmental organizations such as the World Resources Institute, a non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. that focuses on issues such as climate change, world food supply, forest conservation and energy sources. "At long last, providing funding to address losses and damages from climate impacts is on the agenda of the UN climate negotiations," said Ani Dasgupta, President and CEO of WRI. "Vulnerable nations have tirelessly appealed for help to cope with the alarming and damaging climate impacts that they hold little responsibility for causing." While the discussion of financial help is encouraging, little progress has been made in the last year after countries agreed to efforts to slow the rise of global temperatures at COP26. Their goal was to prevent global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by cutting emissions. "Only 29 countries had come forward with tightened national plans since Cop26 -- 29 is not 194. So here I am now looking out at 165 countries that are due to be revisiting and strengthening their national pledges this year," said Simon Stiell, U.N. executive secretary. \</doc>

Nov 10, 2022( Global Voices: HYPERLINK http://globalvoicesonline.org http://globalvoicesonline.org Mozambique is suffering severely from climate change Originally published on Global Voices[1] [ Image removed: ] 2019 was marked as the most difficult year in the history of cyclones in Mozambique. Image: Giovana Fleck/Global Voices With the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 Zimbabwe, the Bahamas, Japan, and Malawi, respectively, complete the top five in the 2021 Index, which lists the countries most vulnerable to natural disasters caused by climate change. However, according[6] to the UN Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, Mozambique is Africa's third most vulnerable country to disaster risk. These are two reports that use their own data, but also document the vulnerability suffered by Mozambique. Recently, cyclones have been increasingly severe and common in Mozambique. In 2019, two strong[7] tropical cyclones hit Mozambique during the same season  the first time since record. Tropical Cyclone Idai in March 2019 and Tropical Cyclone Kenneth the next month caused more than 600 deaths and an estimated 2.5 million people in need. In March 2022, Mozambique was hit by another[8] cyclone. This time was Tropical Cyclone Gombe, which entered the country with winds of 165 and 230 km/h, respectively. It reportedly caused more than 60 deaths. Mozambique has been waiting for significant climate action to help the country overcome its vulnerability. In the absence of some international support, the country has been receiving[9] incentives and messages of solidarity, such as in 2019, via the Secretary-General of the United Nations: The Secretary-General is deeply saddened by the loss of life, destruction of property and displacement of people due to the heavy rains and flooding caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai. The Secretary-General extends his condolences to the families of the victims and to the people and Government of Mozambique. The United Nations expresses its solidarity with the Mozambique authorities and stands ready to work with them as they respond to the humanitarian needs resulting from this natural disaster. In 2021, Mozambique joined other world governments at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference 2021, COP26. Speaking at the event, then Prime Minister of Mozambique Carlos Agostinho do Rosrio pledged[10] to achieve 62 percent energy from renewable resources by 2030, but lack of support[11] was posed as the first difficulty: Moambique sozinho, tal como outros pases em desenvolvimento, no conseguir ter os recursos necessrios para financiar ac\'f5es estruturantes para fazer face aos impactos das mudanas climatricas Mozambique alone, like other developing countries, will not have the resources necessary to finance structuring actions to address the impacts of climate change One of the issues that were under discussion at COP26 was the energy transition. Under the Paris Climate Agreement[12], which was adopted at COP21, coal must cease to be used as fuel by 2050. Mozambique has large coal deposits, and just two decades ago, coal was expected to be an important driver of Mozambican development, so the country will not abandon[10] the use of coal in the short term. Moambique prefere uma transio energtica para energias mais limpas e amigas do ambiente que seja gradual e faseada, a fim de minimizar o impacto no processo de desenvolvimento econ\'f3mico do nosso pas. Mozambique prefers an energy transition to cleaner and more environmentally friendly energies that is gradual and phased in order to minimise the impact on the economic development process of our country. In 2021, Mozambique became the first country to receive[13] payments from a World Bank trust fund to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation  commonly known as REDD+. The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) paid[14] Mozambique $USD 6.4 million for reducing 1.28 million tonnes of reduced carbon emissions in 2021. The payments reward[13] efforts to reduce carbon emissions by tackling deforestation and forest degradation. World Environment Day was celebrated on June 5 this year under the slogan, 'One Earth for Climate Resilience,' but the country has been waiting for more than a decade for funding from the Green Climate Fund. It is an initiative that, for the Mozambican authorities[15], has become unmanageably bureaucratic: Moambique est num processo h quase mais de 10 anos de candidatura do Fundo Nacional do Desenvolvimento Sustentvel para aceder aos financiamentos do Fundo Climtico Verde, um processo que n\'f3s consideramos como muito burocrtico, mas pelas \'faltimas informa\'f5es tudo indica que estamos a passos largos de chegar ao fim Mozambique has been in the process for almost 10 years of applying for the National Fund for Sustainable Development to access funding from the Green Climate Fund, a process that we consider to be very bureaucratic, but from the latest information everything indicates that we are a long way from reaching the end Faced with this reality, Mozambique has been weighing what it can to contain the harmful effects of the climate crises that the country is facing. Recently, in October 2022, the creation of a financial fund was announced to help minimize the harmful effects of extreme events caused by climate change. In October 2022, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi called[16] on all countries worldwide, particularly on the African continent, to act immediately to halt catastrophes caused by humanity. Nyusi delivered[16] his speech as the 'African Union Champion for Disaster Risk Management on the continent during the celebrations of the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction.' According[17] to local press, the United Nations Summit on Climate Change ( COP27 ) will have repercussions for the vulnerable, yet low-polluting country Mozambique. Speaking during preparatory activities aimed at agreeing on positions to be defended at COP27 , Mozambique's Minister of Land and Environment, Ivete Maibaze, stressed the country's main areas of interest are: financing in the context of climate change; the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC); Renewable Energy; Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, as well as Gender and Climate Change issues. The Government of Mozambique looks to COP27 as a stage on which to leverage climate finance, in order to achieve the low carbon transition in line with the NDC.

The following information was released by the office of Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar: Today, Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) led a letter to Special Envoy John Kerry urging the U.S. to support loss and damage (LandD) funding to help developing countries recover from climate disasters. This fund should channel new public funding from developed to developing countries to help them recover from climate disasters. This LandD proposal could be a small yet important first step in pushing U.S. policy towards transformative climate and economic justice globally. "The United States is the world's largest historical contributor to climate change," the Members wrote. "Yet as we've seen with the historic flooding in Pakistan, the fourth consecutive drought in the Horn of Africa, the painfully slow recovery from hurricane damage in Central America, among many other examples, it is the Global South that disproportionately suffers the harms. We have both a moral and a strategic responsibility to provide comprehensive support for countries facing climate disaster, including debt forgiveness and reparations." In October, the Biden administration accepted formal discussions of loss and damage at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 . In his speech at United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), President Biden pledged to work with Congress to increase U.S. international climate finance and urged accelerating new and expanded domestic and global efforts in supporting developing countries. Developing countries often pay the highest price for climate change while contributing very little to greenhouse gas emissions. The letter is also signed by Reps. Bush, Carson, Cohen, Garca, Grijalva, Levin, McCollum, Ocasio-Cortez, Pocan, Schakowsky, and Tlaib. You can read the full letter here and below. November 16, 2022 The Honorable John F. Kerry Special Presidential Envoy for Climate U.S. Department of State 2201 C Street N.W. Washington, D.C. 20520 Dear Special Envoy Kerry, As you know, the United States is the world's largest historical contributor to climate change. Yet as we've seen with the historic flooding in Pakistan, the fourth consecutive drought in the Horn of Africa, the painfully slow recovery from hurricane damage in Central America, among many other examples, it is the Global South that disproportionately suffers the harms. We have both a moral and a strategic responsibility to provide comprehensive support for countriesfacing climate disaster, including debt forgiveness and reparations. While we work toward those crucial goals, there are also smaller but no less important mechanisms we should be supporting. One specific step we urge you to take immediately is to throw the United States' support behind the establishment of a Loss and Damage Finance Facility under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the purpose of channeling new, grant-based public finance from developed to developing countries to help them recover from climate catastrophes. We are encouraged that the Biden administration has accepted formal discussions of Loss and Damage at the UnitedNations Climate Change Conference COP27 . We hope you will build on that commitment and continue engaging in good faith discussion to ensure the world's most vulnerable communities receive life-saving resources in times of crisis. Ad hoc humanitarian assistance flows, insurance schemes, debt-based financing, and neglected existing funds under theUNFCCC are wholly insufficient to address the current reality in which countries are facing billions of dollars in loss and damage needs. A collaborative international effort is needed to make more high-quality, accessible, and fit-for-purpose financing available, especially to account for losses and damages caused by climate emergencies. Such financing must be supplementary to climate financing for mitigation and adaptation and should be unconditional public funding that does not deepen the debt crises faced by many vulnerable countries. We believe that a new LandD fund that is carefully designed and negotiated could both urgently address such funding gapsand fully embrace a transformative global climate justice framework. We have a momentous opportunity to bring other partner countries to the table and shape an equitable path forward as you know and have proven repeatedly in your own career, when the United States leads, others follow. Our leadership in supporting loss and damage financing would pave the way for transformative improvements in the global response on climate. We look forward to working with you, your team, and the rest of the Administration in pushing for the most effectiveglobal climate action, beginning with U.S. leadership on a loss and damage framework. \</doc>

(TNSres) -- Royal Roads University issued the following news release: Climate change is a big problem that requires big solutions. Climate justice is a big, related issue that requires small solutions -- thousands of them. At the recent COP27 United Nations climate change conference Deb L. Morrison, who teaches classes in the Faculty of Environment and Sustainability runs her own consultancy, CLEAR Environmental, and her noteworthy background includes collaborating with the UN, consulting with governments and corporations, and advising the U.S. government on action for climate empowerment. Organizing the pavilion, Morrison worked with a variety of international colleagues, including several American academics who advise the White House. The result was a space where those working for climate justice could share their stories, learn from peers, bend the ear of politicians and network. Climate justice is defined as an equitable distribution of both the burdens of and responsibilities for dealing with climate change. But what does it look like in practice? Morrison says, "When we have power sharing, when we really think carefully to make sure everyone impacted is at the table, everyone can contribute to decisions at the table, then, to me, you're getting toward climate justice." The COP27 More importantly, Morrison notes that the pavilion hosted and provided exposure for a variety of grassroots organizations addressing climate justice, for example, through a feminist lens or discussing community-driven solutions to financial issues. "It became this gathering place for Indigenous groups, communities of colour, a lot of the African nations." "They're most responsible and accountable to their own communities," Morrison says of the organizations that interacted in the Climate Justice Pavilion, "and then they want to learn from each other how to do better for their communities. "To me, that's what action for climate empowerment is. I'm not trying to educate the world en masse about climate change or solutions, I'm trying to share knowledge community to community, share learning, share values. Morrison says the reaction to the pavilion was enthusiastic and plans are in the works to host another next year to extend and expand the learning and collaboration between grassroots groups and large, global organizations such as the Office for Climate Education. Asked what she learned, she says: "I learned that organizations that have a lot of power and clout can learn to be humble and learn to collaborate well if they're brought along in a relationship with one another."

(TNSgov) -- The Joint Commission issued the following news release on Nov. 10, 2022: The Joint Commission was today recognized by the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) for its ongoing action to decarbonize the healthcare sector and make healthcare facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. The Joint Commission formally pledged to achieve the White House's climate goal to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero admissions by 2050. Joint Commission President and Chief Executive Officer Jonathan B. Perlin, MD, PhD, MSHA, MACP, FACMI, has targeted climate change among his top strategic priorities. The Joint Commission is currently conducting a Technical Advisory Panel with nationally recognized experts to evaluate the inclusion of climate-related standards. The Joint Commission also is reviewing its current standards and survey methods to ensure they do not inadvertently contribute to excess consumption of materials and energy. The HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge to help focus industry response to climate challenges. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities for both chronic and acute catastrophic climate impacts. One hundred two prominent U.S. health companies have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including organizations representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies and more. Federal systems like the Indian Health Service (IHS), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Military Health System (MHS) also are working together to meet similar climate goals. Combined, this means that more than 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, representing over 15% of U.S. hospitals.

"The Office" star HYPERLINK https://variety.com/t/rainn-wilson/ Rainn Wilson has changed his name to Rainnfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson to protest climate change. The actor made the announcement via a Twitter video on Wednesday (Nov. 9), timed to the United Nations climate change conference COP27 in Egypt this week. Wilson, a board member of Arctic Basecamp, changed his name via a website called Arctic Risk Name Generator which encourages visitors to become an "Artctic name changer." Although Wilson said of his name change "This is not a joke," it is unclear whether the actor and activist plans to officially change his name on government documents. Currently his Twitter and Instagram handles remain @RainnWilson. His full given name is Rainn Percival Dietrich Wilson.

(Photo: Business Wire) "On the same day, we held great celebrations both in Yangzhou, a major city along the ancient China's Grand Canal, and in Cairo, one of the most famous cities along the Nile, the longest river worldwide," said Feng Nan, president of Deep Dive Sports and Health of China and the organizer of the action. "The two cities thousands of kilometers apart, together with other cities participated and witnessed the successful action, making a clear sign that action has won wide endorsement." The Deep Dive Action, initially co-organized by the World Historic and Cultural Canal Cities Cooperation Organization (WCCO), an international organization headquartered in Yangzhou, and the Shenzhen Foundation for International Exchange and Cooperation (SFIEC) of China, is aiming to promote the idea of sports, health and environmental protection by holding rowing events in canal cities around the world. "It's a milestone in the history of rowing. It's also a great worldwide environmental awareness campaign," Feng stressed. Starting from China's Grand Canal in September 2021, the campaign has been held successfully on the Potomac River in Washington, the Thames in London, the Seine in Paris, the Donau in Vienna, etc., attracting more than 2,000 international paddlers. Jean-Christophe Rolland, World Rowing Federation president, highly praised the event. "More important was the powerful message carried out by this mission, which connected and inspired the rowing family to make a difference in this regard," he stated in a signed letter. At a side event held in Sharm El-Sheikh during the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 "The action connected different cities and different cultures, and raised environmental awareness of many people under the slogan of 'zero carbon, zero waste and clean water'," Feng added, "A new plan of the campaign for the next year is in the pipeline."

(TNSrpt) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency issued the following news release on Nov. 9, 2022: United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ) in Egypt, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a comprehensive report on Nuclear Technologies and Climate Adaptation in Africa, describing how these technologies are already being widely used to build resilience on the continent. Africa has contributed very little to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and yet key sectors are already experiencing the damaging consequences of climate change. The United Nations has observed that increased temperatures or drought have sharply reduced agricultural productivity growth in Africa in the past six decades and caused regional economic losses of $70 billion in the past 50 years. "In nuclear science and its applications we have the tools to adapt to climate change conditions," said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. "The IAEA is at the centre of global efforts to make sure no one is left behind when it comes to benefiting from these indispensable assets." Over the past ten years, the IAEA has carried out almost 50 per cent of its climate change adaptation projects in Africa, more than in any other continent, aimed at increasing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities in multiple sectors. This includes land use management, soil erosion, climate-smart agriculture, food production systems, improved crop varieties, analysis of GHG emissions, water resource management, coastal protection and ocean change monitoring. The report describes various areas of intervention, supported by case studies offering concrete examples of how nuclear science and technology have benefitted Africa. Ocean, food, water: How nuclear technology helps Africa adapt to climate change The report highlights IAEA projects that support countries in Africa in cultivating and exporting food, including growing drought-tolerant crops and applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eradicate insect populations, such as tsetse flies, fruit flies and mosquitoes, that harm both human health and the economies. IAEA projects have also strengthened Africa's capacity to collect and analyse data on the quality of water in river basins and the ocean, allowing policymakers to put measures in place for better resource management, including water security in the Sahel and adapting to ocean acidification in coastal areas, which aims to protect the African fishing industry, and thus prevent environmental and social crises. The report emphasises the importance of partnerships in upscaling such projects. COP27 is an opportunity to forge and strengthen partnerships, and to raise awareness in decision making bodies, development organizations and financial institutions of the potential of nuclear science and technology to feature in national strategies, plans and programmes, including agri-food strategies and disaster risk reduction planning. IAEA experts will be available to discuss IAEA climate adaption projects as well as the use of nuclear power, not only for climate change mitigation but as a reliable, secure source of energy with stable costs that can enable the clean energy transition, at the IAEA COP27 pavilion, #Atoms4Climate, which will be open throughout the two-week event, until 18 November.

In Schneider's case, the plea was backed up by a bit of action, adding its signature to the Action Declaration on Climate Policy Engagement and pledging the company to new initiatives meant to close gaps in emissions reductions. As part of this, Schneider will support climate action in line with the Paris Agreement, work to advance it among industry and trade associations, and both monitor and disclose climate policy alignment for companies and their major industry/trade associations. As to the letter-based lead-up to these pledges, CEO and chairman Jean-Pascal Tricoire and his fellow CEOs called for new, science-based targets aligned with the Paris Agreement to paint a clear roadmap for various sectors to follow, collaboration between and within sectors to private transparency, advocacy and action, and the development of central, international reporting standards. 'We recognize the positive progress to date,' the company leaders wrote. 'Emissions under current policies are projected to reach 58 GtCO2e in 2030, 2 GtCO2e lower than what it was in 2019, but still 25 GtCO2e higher than what is essential to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This gap is equivalent to the annual emissions of 5.4 billion cars. Unfortunately, assuming full implementation of unconditional NDCs still results in a 23 GtCO2e gap (2019 and 2022 UNEP Emissions Gap Report). Governments must raise their ambitions and enact policy changes to close this gap, otherwise, we face a significant threat to the existence of human life and nature.' Earlier this year, Schneider Electric made waves as the first company with net-zero commitments to be validated by the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) Corporate Net-Zero Standard. COP has been an annual occurrence since 1992 when the UN released its first climate agreement. Governments worldwide use it as a forum to discuss and agree to policies meant to limit global temperature rises and adapt to ongoing climate change.

PR Newswire \~The global PV and smart energy total solutions provider Trina Solar was among those whose voices were heard at the recent United Nations climate change conference , COP27 , as the company put forward its views and vision on low-carbon practice in the supply chain. Topics related to low carbon emissions were a central focus of the conference, held in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, from November 6 to 18, at which there were 35,000 attendees, including more than100 heads of state and government. About 2,000 speakers led in-depth discussions on climate change. Zeng Yi, Trina Solar's assistant vice-president of strategy and marketing, delivered a video speech titled "Achieving synergy between pollution and carbon reduction and improvement of the eco-environment: balancing environmental, climate and economic gains". Zeng cited what Trina Solar calls its Qinghai strategy in the speech. The strategy includes locating the whole value chain of the solar PV industry in Qinghai, the province with the highest proportion of green electricity in China, and developing utility-scale solar PV stations on its vast drylands. The strategy enables the deep decarbonation in the upstream supply chain of Trina Solar, avoiding carbon emission by almost 95%. It also creates added benefits of preventing desertification and stimulating growth for the underdeveloped local economy. Foreshadowing the conference, Trina Solar attended the\~Zero-Carbon Mission International Climate Summit in Beijing in early November and was honored with a Climate Solver Award, the only PV company among the winners. The continuous innovation of low-carbon technologies is the core driving force of the global response to climate change. Trina Solar is committed to leading the way in smart solar energy solutions for a net-zero future. Its 600W+ high-power modules can effectively reduce the LCOE for PV power stations with high power, high efficiency, high energy yield and high reliability. In May, 2022, Trina Solar received LCA certificate for its 210mm Vertex modules from the independent testing and certification authority T\'dcV Rheinland,\~becoming the first solar company to receive LCA certification for 210mm modules. T\'dcV Rheinland issued a Carbon Footprint Certificate for Trina Solar's Vertex modules in October. The products cover a full range of 210mm p-type solar modules\~from Vertex S 410W to Vertex 670W, with an industry-leading ability to\~reducecarbon emissions. Trina Solar joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in July last year, contributing to the common goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 C. It also initiated the campaign Clean Energy for Earth with WWF China, which promotes efforts to create a carbon-neutral future.\~ Trina Solar has pledged that it will strive to achieve 100% use of renewable energy in its manufacturing and operations by 2030, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7.

Topline As hundreds of world leaders descend on Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , officials are calling on rich nations to do more to stop climate change, issuing strong warnings from the first day of the summit. <figure> <figcaption> United Nations Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres speaks to media at the Auckland War Memorial Museum on May 13, 2019, in Auckland, New Zealand. Getty Images </figcaption></figure> During the opening of the climate summit on Monday, UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres told world leaders that the Earth is on a highway to climate hell withour foot on the accelerator. Guterres said the world is in the fight of our lives, and we are losing, adding that the Earth is fast approaching tipping points that willmake climate chaos irreversible. During a Monday speech, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said world leaders have a credibility problem when it comes to addressing climate change, saying We re talking and we re starting to act, but we re not doing enough. Gore slammed wealthy nations where leaders say sustainability is important while they attempt totake advantage ofgas resources in Africa, saying, We have to move beyond the era offossil fuel colonialism. French President Emmanuel Macron called on wealthy countries outside of Europe like the U.S. and China to step up and pay their share to help poorer nations of the world deal with climate change, he told reporters Monday, according toBloomberg. What To Watch For At this year s summit, one of the most contentious issues up for debate is the implementation ofa loss and damage fundto help poorer countries recover from catastrophic effects of climate change, like typhoons and droughts. Developing countries argue that, despite putting out fewer greenhouse gas emissions than other countries, they aremore vulnerableto the effects of climate change and should be compensated. Wealthy countries have agreed todiscuss the proposition. Tangent A study released by Oxfam on the opening day of the summit found that billionaires releasea million times more greenhousegases than the average person. The study, based on 125 of the wealthiest billionaires, found that70%of those emissions are tied to the billionaires investment portfolios. Key Background COP27 began November 6, 2022, and will last until November 18, 2022. During the 2015 meeting, countries signed the Paris Agreement and agreed to slash emissions in order to keep catastrophic effects of climate change at bay. However, the majority of nations havefallen far behindtheir promises.

The following information was released by the United Nations System Staff College (UNSSC): One of the most awe-inspiring things about the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) is its convening power. This year COP 27 brought together tens of thousands of people from all over the world who represent the voice of countless others from governments to industry to civil society and citizen groups. The COP provides a platform for dialogue, for the sharing of perspectives and the co-creation of solutions. It demands that we not only SPEAK on behalf of the people and organizations we represent but also LISTEN on their behalf. Fostering meaningful youth participation At the conference which took place in Sharm el-Sheikh, we had the opportunity to interact with representatives of children and youth groups and it made us reflect about how we could genuinely engage with youth and children in creating learning to support climate transformations. Often the word 'youth' subsumes children, but those who are below 18 are rarely included in the conversations and the decisions. Engaging effectively with youth requires that we understand how they produce knowledge and how they learn. There is a wealth of evidence that children learn through play, learning how to relate to each other and the world around them. But it's not just children who learn through play research shows that people learn best when, together with a sense of agency, the experience is joyful, and meaningfully connects with their lives. And this is why we introduced a lot of play in our sessions at the Resilience Frontiers Pavilion, where we used games, visual aids, and virtual reality tours to stimulate playful discussions as participants "stepped inside" a city in the midst of transformative change. Understanding intergenerational engagement Being at COP 27 This is not to negate the role of adult authority and experience. Adult guidance can help strengthen and guide children's actions for the planet. But importantly, adults need to learn to support youth and children in achieving a sustainable future by providing an enabling environment where they can co-create solutions and co-own decisions. We need to not only demonstrate that can they trust us, the adults, but also show that we trust them, the children who will inherit the impacts of our actions, and that we truly believe in their capacity to make good decisions for the planet and for their future. \</doc>

(TNStalk) -- Lightsource bp, a subsidiary of BP plc, issued the following agency statement on Nov. 7, 2022:    Lightsource bp, one of the world's largest solar power companies, will be attending the United Nations climate change conference in Sharm el-Sheikh this month to demonstrate solar's essential role in urgent decarbonisation and in deeper, long-term emissions reductions across key sectors. Solar power at scale is foundational to the global effort to limit average temperature increases to 1.5 C -- an objective set at the previous COP negotiations in Glasgow last year. Our aim at COP27 is to amplify the solar industry's voice and demonstrate practical pathways to delivering significant energy at the speed required to avert a climate catastrophe. Business as usual is not enough. To achieve that goal the global deployment of wind and solar needs to accelerate by a factor of four this decade and a factor of ten by 2050, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). Solar is now well-established as the cheapest source of electricity in history, cheaper than coal and without the additional costs to human health and nature. Lightsource bp is targeting the development of 25GW of solar power projects around the world by 2025, a fivefold increase on our total as of 2021. This is the pace and direction of change required. Delivering it around the world at the scale required will need a huge effort from policymakers, investors and the energy sector itself. 2022 - a year of changed climate Climate change has left a deep impression on 2022. The urgency of greater action has been laid bare by a series of grim milestones and exacerbated disasters. In January, Australia matched its highest ever recorded temperature. In July, the UK topped 40 C for the first time. From June onwards flooding devastated Pakistan displacing one in seven of its population. Wildfires, floods and famines are uncompromising. They do not negotiate. So we must. Last year's COP26 in Glasgow saw nations agree to close the gap between existing climate pledges and what is required to cap warming to 1.5 C. Emissions reductions need to be 45% lower than they would be under existing policies. Delivering on that faster pace requires immediate action and bold collaboration across the private sectors. Renewable energy will have a huge part to play in decarbonising the ways we travel, eat, make things and how we heat and cool our homes. The technologies exist but the opportunity will be missed without rapid action. As well as enabling others to take advantage of low-cost, low-carbon electricity, Lightsource bp is also working to reduce its own impact. We're working to set out science-based targets for our own greenhouse gas emissions. We want to lock-in biodiversity successes we've enjoyed with our projects across our portfolio. And we want our teams delivering our success to be diverse and motivated for the race to stay below 1.5 C.

Nov 15, 2022( Naked Capitalism: HYPERLINK http://www.nakedcapitalism.com http://www.nakedcapitalism.com By Adnan A Hezri, an environmental policy analyst,Fellow of the Academy of Sciences, Malaysia, and author ofThe Sustainability Shift: Reshaping Malaysia's Future and Jomo Kwame Sundaram, former UN Assistant Secretary General for Economic Development. Originally published atJomo's website[1] The latest annual climate conference has begun in the face of a worsening climate crisis and further retreats by rich nations following the energy crisis induced by NATO sanctions after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is nowmeeting[2]in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, from 6 to 18 November 2022. COP27 takes place amidst worsening poverty, hunger and war, and higher prices, exacerbating many interlinked climate, environmental and socio-economic crises. The looming world economic recession is likely to be deeper than in 2008. The likely spiral into stagflation will make addressing the climate crisis even more difficult. Invoking the Ukraine war as pretext, governments and corporations are rushing to increase fossil fuel production to offset the deepening energy crisis. Resources which should be deployed for climate adaptation and mitigation have been diverted for war, fossil fuel extraction and use, including resumption of shale gas 'fracking' as well as coal mining and burning. War causes huge social and economic damage to people, society and the environment. The wars in Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere impose high costs on all, disrupting energy and food supplies, and raising prices sharply. The Future Is Already Here Crossing it, the world faces risks of far more severe climate change effects on people and ecosystems, especially in the tropics and sub-tropical zone. But the future is already upon us. Accelerating warming is already causing worse extreme weather events, ravaging economies, communities and ecosystems. Recent floods in Pakistan displaced 33 million people. Wildfires, extreme heat, ice melt, drought, and extreme weather phenomena are already evident on many continents, causing disasters worldwide. In 2021, the sea level rose to a record high, and is expected to continue rising. UN reports estimate women and children are 14 times more likely than adult men to die during climate disasters. Popular sentiment is shifting, even in the US, where 'climate scepticism' is strongest. Devastation threatened by Hurricane Ida in 2021 not only revived painful memories of Katrina in 2005, but also heightened awareness of warming-related extreme weather events. Stronger Climate Action Needed In international negotiations, rich nations have evaded historical responsibility for 'climate debt' by only focusing on current emissions. Hence, there is no recognition of a duty to compensate those most adversely impacted in the global South. Last year's COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact was hailed for its call to 'phase-out' coal. This has now been quickly abandoned by Europe with the war. And for developing countries, Glasgow failed to deliver any significant progress on climate finance. At COP27 After failing to even meet its modest climate finance promises of 2009, the rich North is dithering, pleading for further talks until 2024 to work out financing details. Meanwhile, the G7 has muddied the waters by counter-offering its Global Shield Against Climate Risks - a disaster insurance scheme. Get Priorities Right What the world needs, instead, are rapidly promoted and implemented measures as part of a more rapid, just, internationally funded transition for the global South. This should: replace fossil fuels with renewable energy, including by subsidizing renewable energy generation for energy-deficient poor populations. promote energy-saving and efficiency measures to reduce its use and greenhouse gas emissions by at least 70% (from 1990) by 2030. implement a massive global public works programme, creating 'green jobs' to replace employment in 'unsustainable' industries. develop needed sustainable technologies, e.g., to replace corporate agricultural practices with Â£groecological[3]' farming methods, investment and technology. Another World Is Possible Another world is possible. A massive social and political transformation is needed. But the relentless pursuit of private profit has always been at the expense of people and nature. Greed cannot be expected to become the basis for a just solution to climate change, let alone environmental degradation, world poverty, hunger and gross inequalities. The COP27 conference is now taking place in Sharm-al-Sheikh, an isolated, heavily policed tourist resort. Only one major road goes in and out, as if designed to keep out civil society and drown out voices from the global South. The luxury hotels there are charging rates that have put COP27 beyond the means of many, especially climate justice activists from poorer countries. The rich and powerful arrived in over 400 private jets, making a mockery of decarbonization rhetoric. Thus, the COP process is increasingly seen as exclusive. Without making real progress on the most important issues, it is increasingly seen as slow, irrelevant and ineffective. Generating inadequate agreements at best, the illusion of progress thus created is dangerously misleading at worst. By generating great expectations and false hopes, but actually delivering little, it is failing the world, even when it painstakingly achieves difficult compromises which fall short of what is needed. Multilateralism at Risk Multilateral platforms, such as the UNFCCC, have long been expected to engage governments to cooperate in developing, implementing and enforcing solutions. With the erosion of multilateralism since the end of the Cold War, these are increasingly being bypassed. Instead, self-appointed private interests, with means, pretend to speak for world civil society. Strapped for resources, multilateral platforms and other organizations are under pressure to forge partnerships and other forms of collaboration with them. Thus, inadequate ostensible private solutions increasingly dominate policy discourses. Widespread fiscal deficits have generated interest in them due to the illusory prospect of private funding. Private interests have thus gained considerable influence. Thus, the new spinmeisters of Davos and others have gained influence, offering seductively attractive, but ultimately false, often misleading and typically biased solutions. Meanwhile, global warming has gone from bad to worse.

The Council of the European Union issued the following news release on Oct. 24, 2022: The Council today approved conclusions that will serve as the EU's general negotiating position for the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to be held from 6 to 18 November 2022. In its conclusions, the Council underlines the opportunities that ambitious climate action brings for the planet, the global economy and the people, and the importance of ensuring a just transition towards sustainable climate resilient economies and societies, that leaves no one behind. All eyes will be on us in Sharm El-Sheikh. The EU has always been at the forefront of climate action and we will continue to lead by example. Protecting our planet for future generations requires a strong common global action. I am glad the EU has proved today that it is serious in its ambitions. Anna Hubackova, Czech minister of the environment COP 27 . The Council recalls the EU member states' continued commitments as agreed with social partners, and also calls on all Parties, to close the book on unabated coal through a phasedown and ending inefficient fossil fuel subsidies to accelerate their energy transition, and to deliver on the Glasgow Climate Pact in a way that benefits workers and communities. The Council acknowledges that all countries must enhance adaptation efforts while urgently reducing emissions. They underline that a clear progress towards the Global Goal on Adaptation is key and thus the EU will continue to support and constructively engage in the two-year Glasgow-Sharm-el-Sheikh work programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation. The Goal's purpose is to achieve a better understanding of how to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to protect people, livelihoods and ecosystems. The Council calls on all countries to scale up their efforts to mobilise finance from all sources to support climate action and to mainstream climate in all financial flows. It recalls that the EU and its Member States are the largest contributor to international public climate finance. It renews the strong commitment made by the EU and its member states to continue scaling up their international climate finance towards the developed countries' goal of mobilising at least USD 100 billion per year as soon as possible and through to 2025 from a wide variety of sources. The Council expects the goal will be met in 2023. The Council looks forward to the continuation of the Glasgow Dialogue to discuss arrangements for funding of activities for averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. It reiterates its readiness to engage constructively with partner countries, including through a new agenda item that would make full use of the Glasgow Dialogue to promptly strengthen the existing institutions providing support towards averting, minimising and addressing the risk of loss and damage, and to deliver concrete solutions to the challenges faced by most vulnerable countries. In this context, the Council welcomes the 'Early Warnings for All' initiative launched by the UN Secretary General with the objective to cover everyone on Earth with early warning systems within 5 years. It welcomes the G7 Leaders' commitment to work towards a Global Shield against Climate Risks for poor and vulnerable countries and people and commits to support these efforts including through the Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance (CDRFI). In addition, the EU is determined to work with all Parties to: - Foster the discussion on the future of UNFCCC; - Discuss ways forward to implement climate action in the agricultural sector sustainably, - Enable the ambitious implementation of the Glasgow Work Programme on Action for Climate Empowerment - Address the gender dimension. Background COP27 will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on 6-18 November 2022. The Egyptian Presidency has set 4 goals: - Adaptation: progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation, adaptation at the forefront of global action - Finance: follow-up on the existing commitments and pledges, progress on delivery of the annual USD 100 billion - Collaboration: between governments, the private sector and civil society. The Paris Agreement (PA) was adopted in 2015 at the 21st UN Climate Change Conference (COP 21) and entered into force on 4 November 2016. It counts to date 186 parties. It sets out the dual goals of mitigation (limiting the global average temperature increase to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 C) and adaptation (increasing Parties' ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development).

Aug 16, 2022( International Business Times News: HYPERLINK https://www.ibtimes.com https://www.ibtimes.com Caribbean countries should pressure developed nations to provide more financing to mitigate the effects of climate change at the upcoming COP27 climate talks, the prime minister of The Bahamas said at a summit of regional officials on Tuesday. The members of the Caribbean community need to ensure that developed countries honor past pledges for climate assistance and create new criteria for determining which countries can obtain such aid at the November climate talks in Egypt, Bahamian PM Philip Davis said in a speech. "If we advance our interests merely as individual Small Island Developing States, our voices will be dispersed, unable to be heard above louder, wealthier, carbon-producing interests," he said. Eighteen Caribbean countries were invited to the two-day gathering in Nassau, which is expected to yield an "outcome paper" that will be presented at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , commonly referred to as COP27 . But he added that "we are commitment-fatigued and we are pledge-fatigued," noting that rich nations had not met a promise to provide $100 billion in climate aid to poor countries by 2020. Caribbean leaders have for years said their countries' per-capita income is too high for them to qualify for aid, a metric many say does not take into account heavy debt burdens generated by paying for the effects of climate change. Davis said Caribbean countries should back a new index based on vulnerability to climate shocks, which could help provide new resources to the region. Caribbean nations are among the world's most vulnerable to climate change due to the outsized impact of tropical storms, as well as growing problems caused by droughts and flooding. \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 26 -- The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization issued the following news release: The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), CGIAR and The Rockefeller Foundation announced today that they will host the official Food and Agriculture Pavilion at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) to be held from 6 to 18 November in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. This marks the first time that such a pavilion has been set up COP. As world leaders gather for COP27 , communities around the world are grappling with the compounded impacts of a global pandemic, growing pressures from the climate crisis, high energy and fertilizer prices, and protracted conflicts, which have disrupted production and supply chains and dramatically increased global food insecurity, especially for the most vulnerable. Some 193 million people faced crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity across 53 countries or territories in 2021 undermining decades of progress, according to the 2022 Global Report on Food Crises. Set against this backdrop, the official Food and Agriculture Pavilion will put the transformation of agrifood systems at the heart of the COP agenda for the first time as an important part of the solution to the climate crisis. Endorsed by the UN System and located in the "Blue Zone", the Pavilion will bring together community leaders alongside government, philanthropic, youth and academic partners. The aim is to advance a shared understanding of the most pressing food and agriculture issues facing people and planet and share knowledge and innovative solutions. A rich programme of events will showcase innovative solutions to help countries take effective climate action to protect agri-food systems. QU Dongyu, FAO Director-General, said: "We are proud to have our first ever Food and Agriculture Pavilion at COP27 , which is timely with the launch of the two new thematic FAO Strategies on Climate Change, and on Science and Innovation, to be implemented in synergy. The Pavilion will convene local, national, and global actors including farmers and youth to seek solutions for transforming agrifood systems to make them more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable, and ensuring that no one is left behind in our efforts to eradicate hunger and malnutrition." Claudia Sadoff, Executive Managing Director, CGIAR said: "Supporting the transformation of food, land and water systems in a climate crisis is CGIAR's mission and the stakes have never been higher. Millions more people are on the brink of food insecurity and threats to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers are increasing. We are honored to collaborate with FAO and The Rockefeller Foundation to ensure that these important issues are firmly on the agenda of this year's COP." Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation, said, "Climate change is a singular threat to humanity, and we cannot fully address it without building equitable, resilient, and sustainable food systems that nourish both people and planet. Good ideas and actions for transforming our food systems can come from anyone, and we are proud to support a space where knowledge can be shared." The 250m2 Pavilion includes a conference room, a meeting room for delegations and an office for bilateral meetings, as well as a Fairtrade stand providing free low carbon and organic tea and coffee. Using state-of-the-art digital and interactive technology, Pavilion will allow delegates, participants and media to browse and download information on projects and programmes developed by FAO, CGIAR and The Rockefeller Foundation.

World leaders must focus more on controlling demand for fossil fuels if they want to prevent devastating global warming, according to a new report. COP27 , a https://www.newsweek.com/topic/united-nations?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships United Nations Climate Change Conference , is currently ongoing in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. President Biden attended the conference on Friday, where he argued action to contain climate change is "a duty and responsibility of global leadership." However, according to a report from Danish engineering company Danfoss, the world needs to pay more attention to surging demands for energy if it wants to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (35 degrees Fahrenheit), as required by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The report, titled 'The neglected demand side of the green equation,' salutes the growth of clean renewable energy sources, but argues humanity must also put more focus on containing demand as populations continue to grow across the world. Speaking to Newsweek J\'fcrgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danfoss, said: "In short, energy efficiency and renewable energies need to go hand in hand. We are seeing massive build out of renewable energy. This is indeed necessary and we need even more. "But if we don't at the same time pay attention to the demand side of the green equation, and massively increase energy efficiency, the build out of renewables will not be sufficient. "As U.S. President Biden said in Glasgow at HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cop26?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships COP26 , the eyes of history are watching. COP27 is a make it or break it moment for global action on global climate change. The world is still not on track to keep warming within the 1.5C target. "Governments have made headlines with mid-century targets but to a large extent are struggling to implement the immediate solutions we have at hand. It's time to step up, act and implement energy efficiency into law." The Danfoss report focuses in particular on energy use for cooling, noting the International Energy Agency expects the number of air conditioning units to increase from less than 20,000 million in 2015, to more than 50,000 million in 2050. Much of this growth is forecast to take place in developing economies such as China and India, with the report noting global warming itself is likely to increase demand for air conditioning units. Fischer said: "Individual air-conditioners are not the only solution to provide cooling. "District based approaches can offer a very attractive alternative that is not getting enough attention although it is more efficient, takes up less space and avoids so-called heat islands in cities, a side-effect that comes from the outdoor units of individual air-conditioners." The report says the world could almost halve global energy consumption for cooling simply by choosing efficient options, with the energy performance of air conditioning units varying by up to 70%. https://www.newsweek.com/newsweek-com-just-stop-oil-explains-why-throwing-food-art-1754582?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships Vincent van Gogh's painting HYPERLINK "work in a coal mine...for a year."

WASHINGTON, D.C. - This week, Rep. Scott Peters (CA-52) will travel to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt to participate in COP27 , the United Nations ' Climate Change Conference . Congressman Peters is scheduled to participate in conversations about clean energy and climate resilience and meet with government and business leaders. "Recent extreme weather events, including wildfires, heat waves, floods, and droughts all point to the growing urgency of the climate crisis," said Rep. Peters. " COP27 is great opportunity to help advance new clean technologies, help communities adapt to the effects of climate change, and solidify a global trade network that rewards climate leadership. I'm honored to participate in another international climate change conference to reaffirm the United States' role in international climate policy and learn from representatives from across the globe." Rep. Peters will be traveling to Egypt with a bipartisan delegation including Reps. Stacey Plaskett (Virgin Islands-At Large), Andrew Garbarino (NY-02), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), David Joyce (OH-14), and Brad Schneider (IL-10). This group of Members was invited to COP27 by the Climate Solutions Foundation, an organization working to advance bipartisan collaboration on climate change among elected officials, environmental groups and business leaders. COP27 marks the third international climate conference Rep. Peters has attended as a Member of the House of Representatives. One year ago, he traveled to the United Kingdom for COP26. He also traveled to Madrid for COP25 in 2019 as part of a delegation led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In the 117th Congress, Rep. Peters has successfully advanced several bills to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In June 2021, President Biden signed a resolution introduced by Congressman Peters to reinstate methane emissions regulations. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), signed into law one year ago, included record funding for climate resilience and advanced clean technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture. IIJA also included Rep. Peters' POWER ON Act to expand renewable energy and help accelerate the development of interstate transmission lines. Most recently, Rep. Peters helped secure notable climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act including billions in tax credits and grant programs to support essential climate technologies like solar, wind, and carbon capture. Rep. Peters has also introduced bills to combat the climate crisis including the METHANE ACT to curb dangerous methane emissions, the National Climate Adaptation and Resilience Strategy Act to prepare the nation for climate change-fueled extreme weather, and the Federal Carbon Dioxide Removal Leadership Act to help deploy critical technologies that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

PR Newswire Lemu Ecosystem Adoption Plan will channel up to $3 Billion to Conservation Organizations by 2033 At COP 27 United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 27 and presenting the startup's\~strategy to finance conservation through its app. "Nature already has the best solutions needed to reverse the environmental crisis, and with the scientific knowledge and technological tools we have today, we can help boost these nature-based solutions to our man-made crisis," said Prieto. "For centuries, stewards of ecosystems all over the world have ensured that nature provides these vital services, yet they struggle to obtain resources for their critical work and have lacked tools to measure the outcomes of these actions. Meanwhile, more and more people want to do something about the climate and biodiversity crisis, but they don't know which actions achieve the required impact. Lemu bridges this gap by allowing individual and institutional users to adopt and protect parts of our biosphere through these organizations while providing the tools and methodology to monitor environmental investment. Like never before, we can band together as a global online community to invest in and protect our planet, at a scale that allows Lemu to commit to a goal as ambitious as funding the protection of 1% of the Earth in the next decade." Lemu's process begins by selecting and working with global conservation organizations, ranging from big international NGOs to small local communities, supporting them in the use of verifiable, evidence-based conservation methodologies for their projects. These curated protected areas are made available on Lemu's mobile app so that anyone can explore these ecosystems, learn about their conservation and restoration programs, including expected outcomes and monitoring methods, and use that information to adopt an individual cell and witness the progressive impact of these efforts. Lemu was launched this month for early adopters on iOS and Android and will become an open platform early in 2023. The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration initiative has committed to rallying the resources needed to designate 30% of the Earth's land and oceans as protected areas by 2030. Using the startup's app to create an online conservationist community, Lemu expects to finance the protection of 1% of land on Earth or 130 million hectares, making it responsible for an important part of the 2030 global commitment. The founding team's past experience building massive online communities allows them to project that during this decade, they will channel up to $3 billion in funding to conservation organizations worldwide. Although this is not a small amount, it is still a fraction of the resources required annually to enable effective conservation programs  estimated to be between $722 and $967 billion globally (Deutz et al, 2020). This underlines the urgency of ensuring the most efficient use of capital so that each dollar invested in conservation can have the highest impact, which can only be achieved by evidence-based methodologies. Last year at COP 26 in Glasgow, Lemu introduced itself to the world at the Futures Lab panel in the Blue Zone's Action Hub. This kickstarted its global network of collaborators, which currently includes over 80 conservation organizations in 15 countries representing over 2 million hectares of protected areas.

The following information was released by the American Nuclear Society (ANS): Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm (in purple blazer) and the ANS-sponsored delegates pose in front of the Nuclear for Climate booth at COP27 . COP27 , the United Nations climate change conference held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18, pronuclear advocates were everywhereand they were talking to everyone. They populated the International Atomic Energy Agency's #Atoms4Climate pavilion, the first-ever nuclear pavilion in the 27-year history of the negotiations. Echoing such strong representation, the final statement issued by the conference used language that included nuclear power. Taking place during the worst energy crisis of this generation, COP27 pivoted toward climate resilience as a necessary pillar of global climate action, with particular focus on serving the needs of the developing world. Nuclear supporters took the opportunity to emphasize that nuclear energy has a clear contribution to make toward these goals. Madison Hilly, an environment and climate science expert and founder of the Campaign for a Green Nuclear Deal, pointed out in a series of tweets that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to devastating power shortages not only in Europe but also in developing countries. As leaders from those countries would be convening to figure out a way forward, she wrote, "Nuclear is on the table in a big way. Last COP, nuclear might've been a 'quiet controversy' . . . . Leading into this year, we've seen major reversals in antinuclear policy and announcements for new nuclear plans." Hilly was one of the American Nuclear Societysponsored volunteer delegates at the European Nuclear Society's Nuclear for Climate booth sharing the message #NetZeroNeedsNuclear. The delegates, who hailed from countries around the world, engaged in conversations about nuclear power with conference goers. They reported overwhelmingly positive interactions. "Nuclear power supporters were out in force at COP27 . Many people I met there had already spoken with at least one other supporter of nuclear energy," said delegate Seth Grae, president and chief executive officer of Lightbridge Corporation. Delegate Matt Sunseri, founder and CEO of nuclear consulting firm Zeus Enterprises, said, "Good conversations are happening with people interested in finding solutions. They say things like, "I'm not attacking the waste issue, I'm just trying to understand." Special visitors to the booth included MP Graham Stuart, U.K. minister of state for climate; Jennifer Granholm, U.S. secretary of energy; and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington state. ANS-sponsored delegates at the Nuclear for Climate Booth. From left, Paris Ortiz-Wines, global director of Stand Up for Nuclear; Madison Hilly, founder and executive director for Campaign for a Green Nuclear Deal; and Anna Schafer, a nuclear and radiological engineering student and social media manager for the ANS student section at Georgia Tech. Nuclear for Climate hosted a slew of side events and livestreamed conversations, and delegates participated in panel discussions with representatives from environmental nongovernmental organizations, the IAEA, and national delegates. Grae was a panelist alongside Dr. Kathryn Huff, U.S. assistant secretary of energy in the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy, in the discussion "Energy Security," about how nuclear energy can help the U.S. achieve energy security while meeting its climate goals. The economic development without fossil fuels panel noted the enormous need for access to reliable power and the role that small modular reactors (SMRs) can play. Nearly 1 billion people, including 600 million Africans, still lack reliable electricity access. Diane Cameron of the Nuclear Energy Agency said, "Energy is required for development; let's prove that fossil fuels are not necessary for development." Busting nuclear myths: Several events addressed common misconceptions about nuclear and welcomed audience members of all opinions to engage. Nuclear for Climate hosted an interactive "nuclear mythbusting" event where the audience was asked nuclear trivia questions and the panelists explained the correct answers. Mark Nelson of the Breakthrough Institute engaged in a lively IAEA-hosted debate with Tobias Holle, a German Fridays for Future activist about whether nuclear power is a viable low-carbon source. Nelson said, "Already in Germany, one of the most antinuclear countries, the shut-off [of the country's three nuclear plants] is being seen as a mistake." Generation Atomic was also on the scene at COP27 , contributing to panel discussions and collaborating with Nuclear for Climate in advocacy activities. Gen A project manager Matt Meyer said, "This was the first year our organization had its own mini booth, and we were able to use this as a platform to have tons of conversations with people who were all over the spectrum on their feelings for nuclear." The organization also seized the opportunity for some unconventional fun: Meyer led a nuclear fitness flash mob performance, themed "climate fitness needs nuclear." Climate rap artist Baba Brinkman performed freestyle rap about the benefits of nuclear energy to music while the team led fitness moves. The organization's lovable mascot Melty the Bear danced alongside them to bust the old myth that nuclear is scary. Nuclear wins in final COP27 statement: In a win for nuclear, COP27 issued its final statement on November 19 with technology-inclusive language in its call for decarbonization of the global energy system, calling for an "increase in low emission and renewable energy" as part of "diversifying energy mixes and systems." This language aligned with Nuclear for Climate's COP27 position paper, which calls for a technology-neutral approach. The statement also included a breakthrough agreement to provide "loss and damage" funding for countries that are the most vulnerable to climate disasters. A low-carbon energy approach that includes nuclear energy could allow the United States to assist countries dealing with loss and damages by providing SMRs or large reactors, as well as other nuclear services. There's still work to do: ANS delegate Paris Ortiz-Wines of Stand Up for Nuclear walked around to different country booths and found that their references to nuclear were few and far betweenan observation she took to Twitter. But showing up is the real first step. ANS President Steven Arndt attended the first week of COP27 and observed "how enthusiastic people were to say 'we need to build things, we need to solve problems, and nuclear has got to be part of that.'" As Secretary Granholm said on a panel: "Nuclear is finding its way back to acceptance and real enthusiasm." \</doc>

OLYMPIA, Wash., Nov. 9 -- Gov. Jay Inslee issued the following news release: Gov. Jay Inslee will attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt between Nov. 13 and Nov. 16. The conference is happening at a particularly critical point in time. Scientists say the planet has reached "code red" with several climate indicators reaching record extremes ranging from heat-related deaths to drought-related malnutrition. Inslee has established Washington state as a global leader of subnational governments dedicated to climate action. He co-founded the bipartisanU.S. Climate Allianceand internationalOcean Acidification Alliance, and helps leadAmerica Is All In, thePacific Coast Collaborativeand globalUnder2 Coalition. In recent years, Washington state has adopted a suite of aggressive policies to transition to 100% clean power, decarbonize buildings and transportation, and establish a new cap-and-invest program. Just last week, Washington state became the first and only state in the nation torequire heat pumps in all new buildings, including homes and apartments. State leaders have emphasizedenvironmental justiceand worker standards in new policies and investments. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration successfully passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant federal legislation to date that addresses climate change. The U.S. generates an estimated15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning any significant global progress will require bold U.S. action. The IRA aims to reduce U.S. emissions 40% by 2030. America Is All Inissued a report yesterdayshowing the IRA will empower states and local jurisdictions to take the U.S. beyond 50% emission reductions by 2030. Inslee's itinerary will include press conferences, panel discussions, and roundtables with various organizations including the U.S. Green Buildings Council, The Climate Registry, Transportation Decarbonization Alliance, Ocean Acidification Alliance, and Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance. The governor's itinerary also includes bilateral meetings with countries and subnationals such as New Zealand and Quebec. Inslee's priority is promoting the importance of federal-state coordination and state efforts to implement the Inflation Reduction Act. This will be the third COP Inslee has attended. His attendance is financed in part with the support of The Climate Registry.

The following information was released by the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group: In advance of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) next month, public development banks meeting in Abidjan agreed on action points to tackle Africa's climate finance gap. The third Finance in Common summit ended on Thursday amid calls on the delegates to turn their commitments to do more in development financing for Africa into actions. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank co-organized the summit under the theme; Green and Just Transition for a Sustainable Recovery. It highlighted the role of public development banks in Africa's recovery as the continent faces impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and Russia's war in Ukraine. In his closing speech, African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina said as Africa looks towards COP27 , development partners should collectively ensure that countries, especially the vulnerable ones in Africa, get the resources to adapt to climate change and support just energy transitions. "As we leave Abidjan, let us keep our determination strong. The world needs actions, not words. Let us turn our ideas into strong commitments, and let's turn those strong commitments into actions," urged Adesina. The Bank chief noted that the role of public development banks and public financial institutions, which collectively deploy $2.3 trillion in annual lending per year, is crucial. Adesina mentioned plans to launch the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa, saying it would be a 'game-changer' in bridging the investment gap for green infrastructure. Remy Rioux, CEO of the French development agency, AFD and chair of the Finance in Common executive board, expressed satisfaction with delegates' zeal to move forward with climate mitigation and adaptation in Africa for impact. However, he said, a lot needs to be done. "We demonstrated our collective firepower on climate finance -- but my feeling is that we are only scratching on the surface of what we can do, and to do together against environmental disruptions," Rioux stated. In a summary of the summit's outcome, he said it showcased a shared vision among Finance in Common members in favor of a sustainable investment policy for development. Thomas -stros, Vice President of the European Investment Bank, said the three-day summit met its goals. Still, work must continue. "Thanks to this unique forum and the movement it represents - I feel confident that we, as public development banks, are more united than ever and heading in the same direction. The challenges are big, and so is our determination to work together," he said. He said public development banks are in a strong position to deliver a coherent message at the 2022 COP in Egypt. "This allows us to have an even greater impact in efforts to mobilize private sector finance for climate, environmental and social challenges, and for the Sustainable Development Goals." Dr. Hyginus 'Gene' Leon, President of the Caribbean Development Bank, said, "our greatest need is for a multilateralism that assures the equitable distribution of socio-economic benefits to meet diverse needs and a just transition towards development." In a video message, International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva stressed the role of public development banks in accelerating climate adaptation to save millions of lives and reduce the cost of natural disasters. She said: "Public development banks bring vital resources to build resilience to current and future shocks. They also connect the private sector and governments in leveraging concessional resources for sustainable development." There were messages from youth groups calling on delegates to deliver on their climate commitments and the respect for human rights across workplaces. "We would like to see you walk the talk with concrete actions by involving the youth and organizations working on the field," said youth leader Tatiana Houndjo. The 2023 summit will take place in Latin America. Load-Date: \~October 22, 2022 \</doc>

Nov 13, 2022( The Hindu Business Line: HYPERLINK http://www.thehindubusinessline.com LOGISTICS Tackling pollution. Maritime and aviation sectors have promised to take action at the global event A galaxy of global leaders gathered at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , commonly called Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, or COP27 , are discussing on achieving the world's collective climate goals as agreed under the Paris Agreement. The transport sector, which is one of the top polluters globally, is on the top of their agenda. While the transition towards low-carbon transport is obviously a priority, there is a need to develop solutions that also meet the other goals of transport, including access for all, efficiency, and safety. So, what's the promise given by major stakeholders in the transport sector? The Union Internationale des Transports Publics (UTIP), an international association of public transport, expects COP27 to bring sustainable transport to the forefront of this year's climate talks. COP27 can pave the way for accelerating action which can provide direct and cross-cutting impact on climate change, pollution, quality of living and efficiency, the association says. Ambitious but realistic goals Ahead of COP27 , the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has committed to reduce GHG emissions from shipping. The organisation's strategic plan for 2018-2023 firmly supports the implementation of the United Nations' Sustainable Developments Goals and identifies them as one of IMO's main directions - the need to develop ambitious and realistic solutions to minimise shipping's contribution to air pollution in response to climate change. Shipping contributes to almost 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. It is, however, critical for the global economy with about 90 per cent of trade carried on ships. For the industry to meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius target in-line with the Paris Agreement, the sector must meet its 2030 breakthrough goal of having scalable zero-emission fuels that make up 5 per cent of the international shipping fuel mix, according to the World Economic Forum's website. The IMO's commitment is to reduce carbon intensity per transport work by at least 40 per cent by 2030, pursuing efforts towards 70 per cent by 2050, and total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50 per cent by 2050. To anticipate the uptake of alternative fuels in the near future, a correspondence group was established by MEPC 78 to develop draft guidelines on the lifecycle GHG intensity of marine fuels (LCA Guidelines). This covers various issues including fuel production pathways and sustainability criteria issues. In October this year, the International Civil Aviation Organisation's assembly reached a historic agreement on a global aspirational goal of 'net-zero carbon emissions by 2050' in support of the Paris Agreement's temperature goal. SAF commitments From COP26, a major decision was taken by a group of nations to sign the International Aviation Climate Ambition Declaration. Its key aims are to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), and development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Global airlines have shown commitments on SAF in the run-up to the COP27 with British Airways, Air France-KLM and Qatar Airways leading the way. British Airways, LanzaJet and Nova Pangaea Technologies have signed an agreement to accelerate Project Speedbird initiative to develop cost-effective SAF for commercial use. Air France-KLM signed multi-year contracts with SAF providers Neste and DG Fuels for a total volume of 1.6 million tons. These contracts represent a first step by the Group towards achieving its 10 per cent SAF incorporation targets by 2030 and will cover approximately 3 of those 10 per cent. First deliveries are expected in 2023, the airline said. Hopes are high among various stakeholders that COP27 will come out with a strong roadmap for a sustainable global transport system.

The following information was released by the World Trade Organization (WTO): The 2022 edition of the WTOs World Trade Report presents new analysis and recommendations on how international trade and greater cooperation can amplify global efforts to address climate change and put the planet on a sustainable trajectory. The WTOs flagship publication, released on 7 November at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, also examines the consequences of climate change on trading patterns and future prosperity. "This report is being launched at the same time as COP27 . What I hope to see emerge there and elsewhere is a trade and investment facilitation pathway in support of a just transition to a low-carbon economy, Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who is participating in the climate summit, said in her foreword to the report. The report argues that trade is a force for good for climate and part of the solution for achieving a low-carbon, resilient and just transition, she said. The Director-General will present the report at a high-level event for world leaders at COP27 on 8 November titled Time to Act: Implementing Trade-Related Contributions to the Global Response to Climate Change. The report conveys four main messages: first, climate change is a major threat to future growth and prosperity due to potential productivity losses, production shortages, damaged transport infrastructure and supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, without significant reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, many countries are likely to find their comparative advantages changing, with agriculture, tourism and some manufacturing sectors particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. Second, trade is a force multiplier for countries' adaptation efforts in the face of climate disruptions, reducing costs of technologies and critical goods and services. In the longer-run, open international markets would help countries achieve necessary economic adjustment and resource reallocation. This is particularly relevant for the most vulnerable economies least-developed countries, small-island developing states and landlocked developing countries. Third, trade can reduce the cost of mitigating climate change by supporting the reduction or prevention of GHG emissions and speed up the transition to a low-carbon economy and the creation of green jobs. WTO simulations presented in the report suggest that eliminating tariffs and reducing non-tariff measures on a subset of energy-related environmental goods could boost exports by 5 per cent by 2030, while the resulting increases in energy efficiency and renewable uptake would reduce global emissions by 0.6 per cent. Finally, the report emphasizes that international cooperation on trade-related aspects of climate policy is vital for making climate actions more effective, and the low-carbon transition more just, minimizing trade frictions and investor uncertainty. The report shows that, without global cooperation on ambitious climate policies, the world will not achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The report can be downloaded here. Printed copies are available through the WTO Online Bookshop. An executive summary of the report is available here. \</doc>

The following information was released by Human Rights Watch: Countries attending the 27th annual United Nations climate change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) in Egypt should reject newly proposed recommendations for removals in a global carbon market, Human Rights Watch said today. The proposal fails to establish baseline human rights safeguards or ensure effective climate action. On the eve of COP27 , in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, a technical body proposed recommendations for regulating removals as part of a new global carbon market. By failing to establish baseline human rights safeguards for carbon offsetting projects involving removals, the proposal would give national governments considerable leeway to establish their own rules. Further, the proposed recommendations, which would have to be approved by consensus by states parties, fail to guarantee trades in the market represent permanently removed carbon. "State parties have been experimenting with carbon offsetting for nearly two decades, with a deplorable record for people and the planet," said Richard Pearshouse, environment director at Human Rights Watch. "If carbon markets are to continue, governments negotiating them need to ensure that they adopt strong rules that confront climate change and protect human rights." Carbon markets refer to trades in carbon credits, which are supposed to represent carbon dioxide that has been removed from (removals) or prevented from being emitted into (reductions) the atmosphere by forest conservation or clean energy projects, among others. Many corporations and governments purchase carbon credits to claim they 'offset' their own pollution, despite damaging environmental and social impact of carbon offsetting projects. Drafters of the 2015 Paris climate agreement put forward the idea for a "Sustainable Development Mechanism" to certify the validity of carbon credits and link the numerous national and subnational markets into one global carbon market. These existing markets, which are worth billions of dollars, are plagued by problems, including carbon offsetting projects that violate the rights of Indigenous peoples and local communities by displacing them from their lands. Many carbon credits traded in those markets do not actually represent permanently removed carbon or avoided emissions. These "hot air" credits undermine climate action when they are used to "offset" pollution, as no overall emissions reductions actually take place. At COP26 in 2021, the Paris Agreement state parties tasked a technical body to draft rules for the operations of the Sustainable Development Mechanism and mandated them to begin by proposing recommendations for removals, including how these may avoid "negative environmental and social impacts." This was the proposal the technical body put forward, on November 6, 2022. Instead of requiring carbon offsetting projects to meet a baseline of human rights or environmental standards globally, it would allow considerable leeway for national governments to write their own rules. This proposal risks driving a "race to the bottom," Human Rights watch said. Jurisdictions with fewer or no human rights or environmental requirements for carbon offsetting projects involving removals would be able to lure in investors, who are already pledging substantial sums towards carbon markets. Safeguards should serve as a robust baseline applicable to all carbon offsetting projects globally, with national governments able to impose additional but not fewer conditions, Human Rights Watch said. The proposal will be put to government representatives of countries that are party to the Paris Agreement, who will consider them and decide by consensus on next steps. States parties should reject this proposal and review the mandate they created for the technical body, requiring the technical body to instead propose rules for the overall operations of the Sustainable Development Mechanism, Human Rights Watch said. "These recommendations ignore the lessons we have learned from preceding carbon markets that have undermined efforts to cut emissions and failed to protect rights, and should be rejected," Pearshouse said. "Governments at COP27 should require the technical body to recommend a solid architecture for this new global carbon market including substantial human rights safeguards and an effective grievance redress system, if it is to come into existence." \</doc>

(WASHINGTON, D.C.) - NEWS: n an effort to increase diversity at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, the HBCU Green Fund and the Harambee House/Citizens for Environmental Justice (HH/CFEJ) partnered to lead a delegation of 27 persons from the United States, Africa and the diaspora to participate in the global summit touted as "COP Africa." The group is pleased about the historic agreement made to create a loss and damage fund for vulnerable nations most impacted by the effects of climate change and they are working to help advance projects in Africa among the delegation. "During a COP26 presentation in Glasgow, Scotland, we pledged to expand Black participation at COP27 Dr. Mildred McClain, executive director of the legendary Harambee House, expressed during a meet-and-greet for the delegation, "We are linking a continent, central and south America, and wherever we at. Our name is Harambee!" The Environmental Justice pioneer known as "Mama Bahati," continues, "The climate change impacts are so incredible that even us, we don't understand the fullness. It is our responsibility to become subject matter experts and insinuate ourselves everywhere; from the local all the way to international arenas." The delegation included representatives from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Uganda alongside representatives from the United States to highlight climate work underway in frontline communities and prepare for the United Nations conference. With encouragement from local organizers and friends at Microsoft and Nike, the Green Fund hosted a PreCOP27 Virtual Summit this past September, "A Sustainable Future for Africa and the Diaspora." The event convened young leaders from the diaspora, featured local climate solutions already underway in Africa, mobilized support for projects, and helped raise funding for African youth participation in COP27 in Egypt. "Climate change is already devastating communities throughout Africa," said Illai Kenney, managing director of HBCU Green Fund. "Our delegation included young leaders from areas most impacted by climate change and for global meetings to produce real solutions their voices must be included. We are glad to have played a small part in making that happen." During the meeting the HBCU Green Fund announced a new partnership with REDES Ecovillages that features an annual HBCU EcoVillage Spring Break Tour. Twelve students attending historically black colleges and universities will meet with 12 Senegalese students in a service-learning experience. REDES is a grassroots community association dedicated to developing a mutual support network of ecovillages in the Sahel region of Africa. Founded by Dr. Ousmane Pame, REDES has expanded to 141 villages across Senegal and Mauritania.

The following information was released by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA): African Ministers of Finance, Economy, Development and Environment are expected to meet ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), and to participate in Egypt International Cooperation Forum to ensure an African led position at the global meeting. Egypt is the host of COP27 and the Finance Day that will take place in November 2022. Ahead of these events, a high-level meeting of African Ministers with related mandates is expected to take place beforehand to deliver an articulate and strong African position. The ministers' meeting scheduled for 7-9 September 2022, in Egypt, is being organised by the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt with the support of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Key international and regional partners will be invited to engage in the discussion and contribute to the development of key messages to be taken to COP27 . The main objective of the ministers' meeting is to amplify and raise Africa's voice as well as enhance coordination between the African countries ahead of the COP27 and the Finance Day to be organized alongside COP27 , with the aim of encouraging intra-African exchange and cooperation to accelerate the transformation towards green and blue economy and/ or by showcasing of successful and potential cross-border green and blue projects. The meeting will also expand coherence of African climate finance positions with needs and prioritise actions that can be led by African countries with targeted support to increase the climate finance available for implementation. "We want to illustrate that African countries are systematically contributing to fight against climate change. We all know how vulnerable Africa is to climate change, but we are also determined to reset our economic models built on climate resilience. For this, we need transparent level playing field market mechanisms. This meeting will showcase African initiatives which contribute towards implementation of the Paris Agreement, and the urgency of mobilising additional resources. In particular, it will provide a platform for initiatives which can be upscaled based on the positive impact derived at community level" said Vera Songwe, Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. The meeting is an opportunity to address the continent's specific challenges, potential, financing needs and innovative instruments for its development. African ministers will discuss Africa's needs, ambitions and challenges regarding climate finance which is paramount to face challenges prevailing in the global environment. Egypt has already explored numerous innovative financing initiatives- we need to ensure that we can deliver a framework which allows new and additional resources to be invested in climate resilience from both public and private sources" said Mohamed Maait, Minister of Finance of Egypt. "The second edition of Egypt International Cooperation Forum (Egypt ICF) this year, presents an ideal opportunity for African Ministers of Finance and Environment to engage in a constructive dialogue with the international community and the private sector on the road to COP 27 . The three-day event will conclude with a communique to voice Africa's ambitions and demands to explore innovative solutions for just access to finance and technology in support of the climate and development agenda through fostering effective and inclusive partnerships" said Rania Al-Mashat, Minister of International Cooperation, Egypt African negotiators have noted that there is a clear need for greater and more predictable financing for Africa's sustainable development agenda, addressing recurring debt issues, and building resilience to shocks such as witnessed due to COVID and the war in Europe. The key issues to be discussed by the ministers are Africa's financial needs for climate action and the financial gap facing Africa in tackling climate change; promoting country ownership of NDCs; proposed initiatives regarding Climate Change adaptation and mitigation; in addition to just energy transition and sustainable infrastructure, among others The ministers' meeting will highlight the coherent voice of African leaders for greater international support for a green and resilient recovery in Africa; crystalise African common positions and key messages on climate finance, including innovative financing and the need to catalyse private sector investment. The meeting will also explore concrete actions for a sustainable African transition to net zero and nature positive future which does not compromise the development goals of the continent. The expected outcomes of the meeting include improved coordination of African initiatives to scale up and accelerate implementation; strengthened joint planning and implementation through the African Union's Climate Change Strategy. COP27 will bring governments together to accelerate global efforts to confront the climate crisis. \</doc>

AstraZeneca is teaming up with a host of African organizations to help patients across the continent gain better and more fair access to cancer care. The so-called Accelerating Change Together for Cancer Care in Africa (ACT;CCA) aims to tackle the growing burden of cancer across continent and improve patient outcomes, the British Big Pharma said in a press release. United Nations Climate Change Conference 2022 ( COP27 This provides a platform for partners to co-create cancer care solutions that close the gaps in existing patient care pathway, from diagnosis through to treatment and beyond, AZ added in the release. The program is led by a steering committee of doctors, oncology institutions and advocacy groups to guide policy intervention, share lessons across borders and put cancer patients at the center. Members will meet on a regular basis to drive progress on cancer initiatives. And there is a need to act: AZ released figures that found more than 700,000 deaths occurred due to cancer across the region in 2020, and, across sub-Saharan Africa, the current mortality rates are reaching 70% in diagnosed cases. The ACT;CCA focuses on driving impact in lung, breast and prostate cancers through capacity building, early screening and diagnosis and patient empowerment. Over the next three years, ACT;CCA aims to drive screening and diagnostics covering 1 million people across cancer types and to provide training for more than 10,000 healthcare professionals across 100 oncology centers. While cancer treatment developments are moving quickly, equitable access to these innovations is not there for all, said Pelin Incesu, area vice president for the Middle East and Africa at AstraZeneca, in the release. We need joint action to reverse the alarming increase in Africas cancer burden, by addressing the unique barriers to cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as building capacity that helps to make innovative care accessible to patients. Launch events are planned over the coming months in Algeria, Morocco and Kenya focused on local initiatives under the ACT;CCA umbrella. AstraZeneca markets a number of cancer drugs around the world including Imjudo, Imfinzi, Faslodex, Lynparza and Tagrisso for a range of oncology indications including liver, lung, breast and skin cancers. The company has several other initiatives in Africa predominately involving boosting vaccination rates. Most recently, it teamed up with supporting mobile health clinics in Kenya, launching in June. \</doc>

(TNStalk) -- The Federation of Canadian Municipalities issued the following statement on Nov. 18, 2022:    The President of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), Taneen Rudyk, issued the following statement at the close of the United Nations climate change conference ( COP27 ). "FCM was pleased to be part of Canada's representation at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt, where Canadian municipal leadership on climate adaptation and GHG emissions reduction was at the core of critical international conversations. "FCM has been consistent in our call for greater cooperation between all orders of government in the fight against climate change. With Canadian local governments having influence over half of the country's greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), municipalities are key to meeting Canada's climate goals. Across the country, communities of all sizes are on the front lines of climate change, but they are also at the forefront of climate action. That message was also delivered from a cities perspective at COP27 this year by the chair of the Big City Mayors' Caucus, Halifax mayor Mike Savage. "As 2022 comes to close, and Canadians across the country reflect on the effects extreme weather resulting from climate change has had on our communities--from wildfire to flooding to hurricane damage--people are looking to their local leaders to plan and strengthen resilience on the ground for the long term. That's why FCM has put forward recommendations for the federal government's planned National Adaptation Strategy. Those recommendations include a crucial focus on scaling up investment in resilient public infrastructure and nature-based solutions, investments in climate data and risk assessments, integration of climate risks into public sector decision making, and improved collaboration across governments. "In both our delegation's message to COP, and in our action at home, FCM is also prioritizing local capacity building on climate, transitioning to net zero, as well as expanding the federal-municipal collaboration on climate action in our shared mission to meet Canada's 2030 emissions reduction target. Thanks to groundbreaking programming delivered through the Green Municipal Fund (GMF), municipalities are reducing emissions and creating greener communities by supporting home energy retrofits, bringing low-carbon solutions to scale, helping local affordable housing providers to retrofit existing building and construct energy-efficient new builds, and more. "Municipal leaders play a critical role in the mission to meet Canada's emissions reduction target and set the country on a pathway to net-zero by 2050. FCM's representation at COP27 continued building strong relationships with key partners such as Canada's Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault, and by meeting with leaders such as the US Conference of Mayors, Canada's Net-Zero Advisory Body, and Canadian Climate Change Institute. "Deepening alignment on national and municipal climate action was at the core of these discussions. All orders of Canadian government are committed to being world leaders on the effort to build more sustainable and resilient communities, and FCM is proud to have brought the full force of Canada's municipal governments to these important international discussions. We know there is much work to be done, and local leaders are already taking up the challenge, and advancing solutions." The Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) unites more than 2,000 local governments at the national level, representing more than 90 per cent of Canadians in every province and territory.

This November, at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, leaders from around the world are gathering to build on previous climate agreements and accelerate collective action towards addressing the global threat of climate change. The decision to hold the conference in Egypt demonstrates a renewed commitment to moving away from Western-dominated conversations on climate change, but also raises questions about accessibility and representation at an individual and civil-societal level. These questions are especially relevant in the context of Egypt's high production of and reliance on natural gas and Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's\~ poor record on human rights. Together, these conditions raise concerns about how COP27 will accommodate stakeholders at all levels and uphold its commitment to inclusion and transparency. A key goal of last year's COP26-held in Glasgow, Scotland- was to recognize the collective threat of climate change to the enjoyment of basic human rights, specifically rights to security and subsistence. However, many activists, students, and civil society leaders were barred from high-level discussions due to the hierarchical and bureaucratic structure of the conference.\~ Abbey Krulik, a student at Indiana University , had the opportunity to travel with IU's delegation as an official observer; however, she found that there was a lack of transparency between negotiations occurring behind closed doors and what observers were able to see and participate in. Further, Krulik shared that although efforts were made to include previously underrepresented groups, such as youth and Indigenous populations, many felt that they were not there to meaningfully participate but help the COP check diversity requirements.\~ In response to past criticisms about the inaccessibility of the conference for young people, COP27 has dedicated a specific pavilion to children and youth that will be located within the zone where the UN hosts global negotiations. Representatives from the COP27 Youth Envoy promise this space will provide youth with a platform for discussion and policy briefings. However, it is unclear whether creating more dedicated spaces will bridge the divide between elite politicians and youth or further isolate the ideas and conversations shared amongst young people.\~ Another access issue that arose at COP26 was that many stakeholders were not even able to get inside the door due limited invite lists. As a result, much of the activism and support for environmental protection as a human right occurred on the streets of Glasgow where Scottish citizens, students, and prominent climate activists, including Greta Thunberg, protested to demand collective action on climate change and criticized the conference for becoming "a PR event."\~ COP27 has been tasked with overcoming past criticisms while also dealing with new challenges that are arising inside a country with high levels of censorship and repression. According to Human Rights Watch's World 2022 Report, despite Egypt's efforts to create an impression of respect for human rights in the international sphere, the country continues to repress activism and regime dissent through the arbitary arrests, torture, and extrajudicial killings of human rights activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens. In response to concerns from the global community, Wael Aboulmagd, Egypt's special representative for COP27 , has promised that civil society will be represented at the conference. However, with the conference's focus on major power relations (i.e. Russia and the US), the healthy protests and activism that have characterized past COPs, will not look the same. Leading up to the conference, signs of repression were already visible; in the last week of October, Indian climate activist, Ajit Rajagopal, who planned an eight day walk from Cairo to Sharm El-Sheikh to raise awareness about the climate crisis, was arrested by Egyptian security forces. While structural changes and the location of COP27 in Egypt point to an opportunity to improve the accessibility of conversations on climate justice for both youth and the world's poor, the choice to hold COP27 five hours away from Cairo not only reflects an attempt to shield the conference from popular protests and youth activism, but will also further isolate elite-level conversations from the needs of the world's most vulnerable. As a result, for the 23 million people living in Cairo alone, a climate conference in the Sinai peninsula is unlikely to have an impact on a population struggling to buy state subsidized bread. For the tourism industry still recovering from a drop in tourists after the Arab spring and COVID-19 pandemic, COP27 presents the opportunity to boost a struggling economy. Yet, for many Egyptians, COP27 will go unnoticed. As Egyptians around the country are plagued by pollution, food insecurity, water scarcity, leaders from around the world will enjoy the resorts and hospitality industry of Sharm El-Sheikh. Despite continued challenges and imperfect answers, students and youth must continue to call attention to hypocrisy within UN Climate Conferences and play an active role in alerting the elites and the masses to the future impacts and the needs of those most vulnerable in our society. The inclusion of young people, in particular, is not only important for orienting discussions to future impacts, but also because young people are often the best listeners to and voices for the world's most vulnerable populations. By isolating youth voices from elite conversations, the needs of the world's poor and future generations continue to be brushed aside.\~ With no undergraduate delegation to COP27 and few course offerings in environmental studies, Georgetown students are especially isolated from both political and academic conversations on climate justice. Although distance and history may leave students feeling disaffected about the efficacy of climate conferences and their own activism, students must recognize that the effective advancement of human and environmental rights is not a task for a elite level politicians alone but will rely on the ongoing interaction between activists, NGOs, and local and international institutions that pursue climate justice on both the micro and macro-scale.\~ For students at Georgetown looking to add their voice to efforts for climate justice, I urge you to begin at the micro-level finding opportunities to engage locally or virtually, supporting the most vulnerable in our community. Consider joining student organizations such as The Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network (GREEN) or Students Advancing Food Equity (SAFE); volunteer with local NGOs like Dreaming Out loud or FoodPrints; pursue opportunities with the new Earth Commons Institute at Georgetown; or use social media to amplify the voices of those impacted by climate change or sustainable development projects that fail to take into account vulnerable populations. Lastly, consider petitioning the Georgetown administration for an undergraduate delegation to subsequent UN Climate Conferences. Together, our efforts can help support and put pressure on politicians and elites for the protection of our collective right to the health and sustainability of our environment. \</doc>

Nov 07, 2022( Google Cloud Blog: HYPERLINK https://cloud.google.com/blog https://cloud.google.com/blog Editor's note: At Google Cloud we're working with global organizations to help them use technology to build a more sustainable future. We're excited about the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference [1], or COP27 , when representatives from countries and organizations around the world  including Google Cloud  are gathering in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt[2] from November 7 - 18, 2022 for the latest round of climate talks. Bookmark this blog as we bring perspectives from onsite, thoughts from Google experts and customers, curated content and announcements. Catch the event for yourself on Youtube[3]. Day 1: Measurement, materiality, equity: the conversations we're looking for at COP27 Author: Chris Talbott, Cloud Sustainability Lead It's a wrap on day 1 of COP27 [2], where nations, corporations, NGOs and individuals have all come to discuss what we collectively need to do in order to avert the worst consequences of climate change. Incoming COP president Sameh Shoukry recognized the massive mobilization of communities, young people, women, and local governments, underscoring that we still have a chance to overcome this threat. In the opening address, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Steill, asked governments to focus on three critical areas to be successful: Accelerate the shift from negotiations to implementation Enhance transparency and accountability At Google Cloud, we've been working with our customers[4] to accelerate sustainable transformations using cloud technology. In the past year, it's been incredible to see the momentum in every industry to turn commitments into real actions. But as we learned in our recent survey of global business leaders[5], while there is widespread ambition to combat climate change, they still face significant challenges in understanding whether their efforts are having an impact. While 96% of organizations had at least one program in place related to sustainability efforts, only 36% had measurement tools to track their impact. Measurement is an especially big challenge in the face of increased scrutiny over greenwashing and demands for transparency. Which is why I'm looking forward to hearing from those leaders who can demonstrate the benefits of definitive climate action, and set an example for others to follow. At Google Cloud we're proud to partner with industry leaders who are actively measuring the impact of cloud technologies against their climate goals. For example, Salesforce[6] has reduced its cloud carbon emissions for certain workloads by up to 80%; Carrefour[7] reduced energy consumption by 45% by moving from on-premises data centers to our public cloud infrastructure; and Lufthansa[8] cut Co2 emissions by an estimated 7,400 tons per year, by building a AI-enabled data platform to increase operational efficiency. Another part of COP that I really appreciate is the daily themes [9] from finance to adaptation, energy to biodiversity. These days highlight how the climate challenges faced by each industry are unique, how solutions will need to be industry-specific and why we need to focus our efforts on where the impact will be the greatest. In our work with cloud customers, this often shows up in materiality[10] discussions, which ensure that we apply cloud technology to the parts of their business where it will have a significant positive impact. The work with Lufthansa, Carrefour and Salesforce are great examples of projects that would score well on a materiality assessment, and I look forward to learning about the successes that other companies, NGOs and nations have achieved. Last week, Google shared our efforts[11] to use AI to address the climate crisis and announced the new FloodHub[12], a platform that displays flood forecasts to help at-risk communities prepare. The effects of climate change will be felt disproportionately throughout the globe, and increasingly by underrepresented and underdeveloped communities. AI running in the cloud is illuminating potential disparities, like local air quality differences across New York State[13], and helping leaders craft policies to address them.

PR Newswire Cigarette filters are the most abundant form of single-use plastic waste in the world, with some 4.5 trillion individual butts polluting our global environment every year. Since 2010, Greenbutts has worked with R&D institutions, multinational cigarette manufacturers, and industry experts to develop biodegradable filter technology - a viable solution to the global problem of plastic cigarette butt pollution. Greenbutts LLC ("Greenbutts" or "the Company"), a scientific leader in biodegradable material technology that has developed and patented a viable alternative to cellulose acetate filters, announces today they will be joining the official Canadian delegation at COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference of 2022. The Company will bring attention to the issue of this massive source of plastic pollution and highlight its ability to assist in the transition away from cellulose acetate filters used in the global tobacco industry; a problem theUN describes as"the most discarded waste item worldwide". Greenbutts' message will speak to why nations need to address this plastic crisis, now, to mitigate the ongoing damage to our oceans, marine life, and ultimately, our lives. "We are honoured to be invited to participate in COP27 as part of the official Canadian delegation, where we intend to shed meaningful light on the global crisis of single-use plastic cigarette filters and offer an impactful solution," said Luis Sanches, Chief Strategy Officer of Greenbutts. "Greenbutts is in a unique position to deliver a sustainable innovation that can drastically decrease the amount of harmful plastic that is discarded every day and ends up in our oceans. Our IP and technology have advanced greatly, and we believe that we can now offer this solution to the global tobacco industry for mass implementation, effectively ending the reliance on single-use plastic filters," said Tadas Lisauskas, CEO of Greenbutts. "We will have a very receptive audience including world leaders, policy makers, and members of the media at COP27 . We are optimistic our solution-focused proposal will contribute to meaningful and verifiable actions towards ending the plastic crisis," Lisauskas continued. The Climate COP is an annual meeting of delegates from nearly every country on Earth to negotiate global goals for tackling our planet's most pressing issues. This year's 27th annual COP is hosted in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt and takes place November 6-18. About 35,000 worldwide have so far registered on the UN website for COP27 , putting the upcoming UN climate change conference in Sharm El-Sheikh on track to possibly become one of the most attended COPs in history, the Egyptian Earth's Climate for Sustainable Development Foundation recently announced. COP27 follows a historic year in the fight against plastic pollution. On March 2nd, 2022, Heads of State, Ministers of environment and other representatives from UN Member Nations endorsed a world's first resolution at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi toEnd Plastic Pollutionand forge an international legally binding agreement by 2024. About Greenbutts \u-497 Since 2010, Greenbutts has worked with R&D institutions, international tobacco companies, and industry experts to develop biodegradable filter technology \- trademarked as a "Greenbutt". The Company has developed and patented a "zero-plastic" filter, made without any synthetic materials or plasticizers, 100% biodegradable and water dispersing which meets certain industry criteria. The proprietary Greenbutts filter is designed to reduce the significant environmental impact caused by plastic cigarette filter pollution. Over 4 trillion are discarded every year making single-use filters the most littered plastic item in the world. With over a decade of R&D and strong intellectual property, Greenbutts offers the global tobacco industry a seamless transition to zero-plastic filters while meeting the new global single-use plastic (SUP) legislation initiatives.

The following information was released by Cornell University: By Blaine Friedlander, Cornell Chronicle October 31, 2022 At the United Nations' upcoming Conference of the Parties better known as COP27 , the annual convention to ensure countries meet global climate targets set by the Paris Agreement 11 Cornell students will help delegations from specialized agencies and small countries gain a stronger voice. The undergraduate and graduate students, all taking Cornell's Global Climate Change Science and Policy course in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), will travel to the United Nations Climate Change Conference at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Nov. 6-18. "I've been looking forward to taking this class since I was a freshman, with the hopes of attending the UN COP conference, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it," said Rebecca Foody '23, who will be assisting the delegation of the Earth Child Institute, a non-governmental organization that represents children and youth to rebuild a normal-climate future. "I am eager to see how international climate negotiations take place," Foody said, "and see what I can do on a global scale to fight climate change." The class is taught by Allison Chatrchyan, senior research associate in the departments of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Global Development (CALS), who has been taking students to interact with global leaders since COP22, in 2017. This year, for the first time, the U.N. has invited students from Chatrchyan's class to join the selective Climate Change and Universities Partnership Program. Through that partnership, a Cornell student team that includes doctoral student Charlie Tebbutt, in Natural Resources and the Environment (CALS), will be conducting research on land-use planning and climate change needs for Peru. Doctoral student Valentina Rubio, in the School of Integrative Plant Science, Soil and Crop Sciences (CALS), will attend COP27 as an official representative of her home country, Uruguay. She said Uruguay focuses on renewable energy and sustainable agriculture her expertise as an agronomist. "Soil has a huge potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere," Rubio said. "I'm interested in the discussions regarding soil practices by farmers. And at COP27 , I expect to be learning how to communicate my research to policymakers, which is a new forum for me." Another team including Foody, Rubio and Andy Shin '23 is conducting research on the needs for climate-smart agriculture tools in Zambia. Katherine Cornett '23, Arden Podpora '23, and graduate students Nick Hamp-Adams and Courtney Schneider, in the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy, were invited by the ambassador to the U.N. from the Kingdom of Tonga a tiny Pacific-island nation to help their COP27 delegation. Tonga is vulnerable to rising seas and the effects of climate change. Other students participating on the Cornell student delegation are undergraduates Eva Fenningdorf '23, Alana Becker '23, and Elena Martin Hernandez '22, who are helping the Cornell exhibit and side events. Nearly 15,000 delegates are expected to attend COP27 , including about 90 heads of state. Several countries are expected to announce new 2030 emission targets as part of their commitment to the Paris Agreement, with many fortifying their existing 2030 targets before the meeting, according to the White House. Since late August, the students in the class have been steeped in global climate issues, as they learn about the science behind policies through the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). After taking the class last year and now serving as a teaching assistant this semester, Podpora is eager to absorb COP27 . "We will be able to network with experts from around the world and listen to differing perspectives," she said. "I think that's the coolest part about traveling to Egypt: The world is my classroom." Funding for student travel was provided through Cornell student travel grants and support through the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences; the College of Arts and Sciences; the College of Engineering and the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy. In addition to the students, Cornell's presence at COP27 includes faculty and staff who will be engaging partners and leading discussions. Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability is providing an online resource for the delegation. \</doc>

The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization issued the following news on Oct. 26, 2022: The United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), CGIAR and The Rockefeller Foundation announced today that they will host the official Food and Agriculture Pavilion at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) to be held from 6 to 18 November in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. This marks the first time that such a pavilion has been set up COP. As world leaders gather for COP27 , communities around the world are grappling with the compounded impacts of a global pandemic, growing pressures from the climate crisis, high energy and fertilizer prices, and protracted conflicts, which have disrupted production and supply chains and dramatically increased global food insecurity, especially for the most vulnerable. Some 193 million people faced crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity across 53 countries or territories in 2021 undermining decades of progress, according to the 2022 Global Report on Food Crises. Set against this backdrop, the official Food and Agriculture Pavilion will put the transformation of agrifood systems at the heart of the COP agenda for the first time as an important part of the solution to the climate crisis. Endorsed by the UN System and located in the "Blue Zone", the Pavilion will bring together community leaders alongside government, philanthropic, youth and academic partners. The aim is to advance a shared understanding of the most pressing food and agriculture issues facing people and planet and share knowledge and innovative solutions. A rich programme of events will showcase innovative solutions to help countries take effective climate action to protect agri-food systems. QU Dongyu, FAO Director-General, said: "We are proud to have our first ever Food and Agriculture Pavilion at COP27 , which is timely with the launch of the two new thematic FAO Strategies on Climate Change, and on Science and Innovation, to be implemented in synergy. The Pavilion will convene local, national, and global actors including farmers and youth to seek solutions for transforming agrifood systems to make them more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable, and ensuring that no one is left behind in our efforts to eradicate hunger and malnutrition." Claudia Sadoff, Executive Managing Director, CGIAR said: "Supporting the transformation of food, land and water systems in a climate crisis is CGIAR's mission and the stakes have never been higher. Millions more people are on the brink of food insecurity and threats to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers are increasing. We are honored to collaborate with FAO and The Rockefeller Foundation to ensure that these important issues are firmly on the agenda of this year's COP." Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation, said, "Climate change is a singular threat to humanity, and we cannot fully address it without building equitable, resilient, and sustainable food systems that nourish both people and planet. Good ideas and actions for transforming our food systems can come from anyone, and we are proud to support a space where knowledge can be shared." The 250m2 Pavilion includes a conference room, a meeting room for delegations and an office for bilateral meetings, as well as a Fairtrade stand providing free low carbon and organic tea and coffee. Using state-of-the-art digital and interactive technology, Pavilion will allow delegates, participants and media to browse and download information on projects and programmes developed by FAO, CGIAR and The Rockefeller Foundation.

(TNSrpt) -- The World Trade Organization issued the following news release: The 2022 edition of the WTO's World Trade Report presents new analysis and recommendations on how international trade and greater cooperation can amplify global efforts to address climate change and put the planet on a sustainable trajectory. The WTO's flagship publication, released on 7 November at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, also examines the consequences of climate change on trading patterns and future prosperity. "This report is being launched at the same time as COP27 . What I hope to see emerge there and elsewhere is a trade and investment facilitation pathway in support of a just transition to a low-carbon economy," Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who is participating in the climate summit, said in her foreword to the report. "The report argues that trade is a force for good for climate and part of the solution for achieving a low-carbon, resilient and just transition," she said. The Director-General will present the report at a high-level event for world leaders at COP27 on 8 November titled "Time to Act: Implementing Trade-Related Contributions to the Global Response to Climate Change." The report conveys four main messages: first, climate change is a major threat to future growth and prosperity due to potential productivity losses, production shortages, damaged transport infrastructure and supply chain disruptions. Furthermore, without significant reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, many countries are likely to find their comparative advantages changing, with agriculture, tourism and some manufacturing sectors particularly vulnerable to climate impacts. Second, trade is a force multiplier for countries' adaptation efforts in the face of climate disruptions, reducing costs of technologies and critical goods and services. In the longer-run, open international markets would help countries achieve necessary economic adjustment and resource reallocation. This is particularly relevant for the most vulnerable economies - least-developed countries, small-island developing states and landlocked developing countries. Third, trade can reduce the cost of mitigating climate change - by supporting the reduction or prevention of GHG emissions - and speed up the transition to a low-carbon economy and the creation of green jobs. WTO simulations presented in the report suggest that eliminating tariffs and reducing non-tariff measures on a subset of energy-related environmental goods could boost exports by 5 per cent by 2030, while the resulting increases in energy efficiency and renewable uptake would reduce global emissions by 0.6 per cent. Finally, the report emphasizes that international cooperation on trade-related aspects of climate policy is vital for making climate actions more effective, and the low-carbon transition more just, minimizing trade frictions and investor uncertainty. The report shows that, without global cooperation on ambitious climate policies, the world will not achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

The following information was released by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): Egypt and FAO leading efforts essential to mitigate and adapt to the impact of climate change 12/11/2022 Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt/Rome For agrifood systems to adapt to climate change and become more sustainable, improving the quality and quantity of climate finance contributions to the sector is critical that was the main message at the launch of the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation Initiative (FAST) held at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-El Sheikh, Egypt. The United Nations Climate talks are being hosted by Egypt this year and FAST was developed and initiated by the Egyptian Presidency in close collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other stakeholders. FAST comes at a time when the risk of hunger and malnutrition among the most vulnerable groups is getting worse and the world's agrifood systems are increasingly impacted by climate variability and extreme weather events. Agrifood systems also contribute to the climate crisis, ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. But the funding to transform agrifood systems to make them more sustainable, resilient and productive is grossly inadequate, and that is what this initiative hopes to address. Access to climate finance at both farm and country levels remains insufficient and FAST aims to implement concrete actions to correct this to transform agriculture and food systems by 2030 while supporting food and economic security and the environment. Speaking at the event, FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo, pointed out that while overall climate finance flows have been increasing over the past decade, the share allocated to agriculture has been steadily decreasing. The agriculture and land use sector received $122 billion in financing between 2000 and 2018, representing 26 percent of the global climate finance flows to all sectors. "That is why bold transformative actions are now needed to boost investment in agrifood transformation, support countries in accessing climate finance, and ensure that appropriate financial resources reach small and medium-scale food producers," Semedo said. FAST aims to make this possible by enhancing country capacities to identify and access climate finance and investment, giving stakeholders greater access to knowledge and developing guidelines and providing support in crafting appropriate climate action policies. Promoting food security and diversity, empowering and engaging women, youth, Indigenous Peoples and people in vulnerable situations, using science and innovation to improve agricultural practices across the value chains - these are some of the principles that will guide FAST's work. "This partnership will rely on and harness the efforts started by previous initiatives such as the Glasgow breakthrough and will be nurtured by future (COP) Presidencies. Agriculture is higher than ever on the COP agenda, and FAO is committed to support all actors in their efforts to transform our agrifood systems to become more efficient, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable," Semedo said. The summit is being held at a time when estimates show that the world is falling behind on the goal of reducing emissions by 45 percent by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. FAST is one of the key initiatives that FAO is a part of at COP27 . The organization will use its expertise and experience to lead several discussions on how agrifood systems can be part of the solution to the climate crisis and how food security can be achieved. \</doc>

PR Newswire The\~company is introducing new solutions to support the low-carbon transition and build awareness about climate change Tencent showcased next-generation low-carbon technologies at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP27 , in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. These include a zero-energy radiative cooling technology to protect glaciers, Asia's first carbon mineralization storage project, and water-saving and drought-resistant rice (WDR). Tencent officials also shared details about their ongoing projects to drive innovative solutions, guide the public to lead greener lifestyles, and support the transition to a low-carbon economy. ExploringNew Solutions to Reduce Carbon Emissions During a panel discussion on Wednesday, Xu Hao, Vice President of Tencent Sustainable Social Value (SSV) and Head of Tencent Carbon Neutral Lab, showcased the first carbon mineralization storage project in Asia, a collaboration between Tencent and Icelandic carbon sequestration company Carbfix. The company said that it's also collaborating with university research teams to develop zero-energy radiative cooling products, which allow the cooling of objects by radiating heat to outer space, to achieve both climate adaptation and carbon reduction. This technology can be used to protect glaciers and is being tested on the Dagu Glacier in Sichuan Province. Climate change is a significant threat to global food security. To address this challenge, Tencent is working with partners to promote a new breed of water-saving and drought-resistant rice. The project will assess the WDR's greenhouse gas-reduction potential to develop carbon assets and increase its yield per acre. It will also promote the WDR's cultivation to individual farmers through interactive mobile applications. Tencent has been actively contributing to nature-based solutions that leverage the ecosystem's own abilities to heal itself and are important tools for mitigating climate change. The company works with partners to restore seagrass beds and salt marsh ecosystems in pilot areas to develop marine carbon sinks. In forest areas, customized algorithms were created to assess forestry carbon sequestration projects to reduce monitoring and verification costs. Integrating technology to promote low-carbon transformation Tencent also introduced two smart energy products dubbed "Tencent EnerLink (Energy Connector)" and "Tencent EnerTwin (Energy Digital Twin)," to help companies conserve energy. These tools enable companies to more efficiently monitor and manage their energy usage by digitalizing their operations through cloud computation, big data, and the Internet of Things. Tencent Cloud partnered with Towngas China Company Limited to develop a digital platform that promotes efficiency in carbon and energy management and can reduce hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon emissions.\~\~ In China, there are numerous industry players and individuals who have proposed innovative solutions to climate change. For example, Tencent's Tanlive (Tan means carbon in Chinese) facilitates connections between the innovators and adopters and offer technology tools and insights to accelerate the implementation of their climate solutions. Harnessing the Power of Games to Build Awareness on Climate Change Tencent has also leveraged its experience in developing blockbuster games titles to raise public awareness about climate change. The company's "Carbon Island" promotes a low-carbon lifestyle amongst consumers. TiMi Studio Group, a subsidiary of Tencent Games, was one of the members of the Playing for the Planet Alliance backed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNDP). The Group has been committed to creating educational experiences in-and out-of games to prepare more than 110 million players worldwide to address critical climate challenges. Commenting on Tencent's participation in COP27 and its announcement of new technologies, Xu said, "Climate change is a collective challenge for humanity that requires collective actions. COP27 reflects the solidarity and commitments by the global community to achieve a low-carbon future. At Tencent, we are proud to be part of these global efforts to tackle climate change. Tencent has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. Along the journey, we will continue to leverage our expertise in technology to empower consumers, businesses, and society to respond to the climate crisis." Notes to editors:As a global leading internet and technology company, Tencent is committed to its part in supporting the climate transition. In February 2022, the company outlined itspathway to achieving carbon neutralityin its own operations and across its supply chain by 2030. Tencent has also spearheaded multiple initiatives that use cutting-edge technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as supporting peers in different industries to drive transformative change across their value chain to progress towards a carbon-neutral future.

Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged African countries to develop a common agenda ahead of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt this November that underscores the need for equity and justice in climate financing. "Africa and its member states, under the umbrella of the Africa Union and African Ministerial Conference on the Environment (AMCEN), must synchronise its messages and speak with one voice in all inter-related global events. We must use our collective bargaining weight to its full advantage to influence the outcome of these multilateral processes," he said. Kenyatta was speaking during a meeting of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change (CAHOSCC) on the margins of the 2022 United Nations Ocean Conference in Lisbon, which Kenya co-chaired with host country Portugal. Despite Africa contributing far less to global emissions that other regions, he said, the continent suffers the most from climate change-induced crises, such as drought, floods and locust invasion. "We cannot achieve progress without means of implementation. Adaptation only receives 25% of global finance, and Africa only receives 3% of this," he said, calling on Africa to hold to account "big emitters" of greenhouse gases by resubmitting more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by the September 23 deadline. "The world is expecting us to build and maintain the momentum from Glasgow, and to deliver concrete results in Sharm-El-Sheikh. We must therefore work together to deliver ambitious decisions," he said. \</doc>

Nov 18, 2022( Al Jazeera English: https://www.aljazeera.com https://www.aljazeera.com / Delivered by Newstex) Global climate talks have entered the final scheduled day of negotiations as chances of a deal still look unclear. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 [1]) in Egypt was expected to go past its deadline on Friday and into the weekend, with rich and developing nations deadlocked over creating a fund for countries devastated by the effects of global warming. The Egyptian presidency on Friday morning released a new, slimmer draft for an overarching cover document after a 20-page version released a day earlier had been criticised for being too long, vague and confusing. The two-pronged approach from the 27-nation EU would create a pot of money for poor countries and push for steeper cuts of heat-trapping emissions by all countries, as well as the phasing out of all fossil fuels, including natural gas and oil. EU climate chief Frans Timmermans said the bloc's proposal on funding for loss and damage and mitigation was Â£ final offer' that sought to 'find a compromise' between countries. In climate negotiations, loss and damage[2] refers to the idea that rich nations, which have historically done the most to contribute to climate change, should compensate the developing countries most affected. Mitigation[3] refers to efforts to slow global warming, like drastically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Timmermans said he was 'encouraged' by the immediate reaction to the proposal and more engagement was expected on Friday. 'This is about not having a failure here,' he said. 'We we cannot afford to have a failure. Now, if our steps forward are not reciprocated, then obviously there will be a failure. But I hope we can avoid that.' Germany's foreign minister said the European Union is serious about delivering climate justice for poor countries suffering disastrous effects of global warming, urging other major polluters to put up or shut up when it comes to providing financial support for those in need. 'We're making clear that Europe is on the side of the most vulnerable states,' German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. 'Others can now show which side they are on. Spending money is not an end in itself, but it is about ensuring justice.' Baerbock acknowledged that industrialised countries who were 'mainly responsible for global warming up to now should also pay for the damage and losses as a matter of priority'. But she warned excluding key polluters and not also requiring them to cut their emissions would 'be a totally wrong incentive system'. Baerbock added unless emissions are reduced more steeply, 'no money in the world could pay for the damages and losses of the future'. 'Deafening silence' Other big players were staking out their positions after the EU's offer. Deals at COP27 must be made with support from all of the nearly 200 countries at the talks. China, which had been quiet during much of the talks, and Saudi Arabia both said the money for a loss and damage fund should not come from them. Developed countries should foot the bill, China said. Both also insisted the 2015 Paris Agreement that aims to limit global warming to an ambitious 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) increase should not be altered. As for the United States, there was Â£ deafening silence' after the EU revealed their proposal, said Preety Bhandari, a senior adviser on climate finance at the World Resources Institute. 'So I assume overnight and during the course of the day there will be a lot of diplomatic outreach across various parties to finally help us land the decision on funding for loss and damage here at COP27 .' Loss and damage has become a flashpoint at the climate talks that started two weeks ago. Poorer countries bearing the brunt of climate change, from rising sea levels to extreme flooding, have been stepping up the urgency, accusing richer polluters that have contributed the most to Earth-warming greenhouse gas emissions of stalling. Hours before the EU's intervention, COP27 President Sameh Shoukry - the foreign minister of host country Egypt - had told reporters that countries were 'shying away from taking the difficult political decisions'. The UN climate agency also published a draft proposal for a loss and damage deal late on Thursday, but the three options laid out for delegates to consider did not yet reflect the EU proposal. The first option suggests establishing a new fund for climate-vulnerable countries. The second posits delaying the decision on a fund until next year's COP28 summit. The third calls for deciding on funding arrangements at COP28, with no mention of a new fund. Climate-vulnerable countries insist that they cannot wait another year for the creation of a fund to pay compensation.

(TNSres) -- Bread for the World issued the following news release on Oct. 21, 2022: Following the conclusion of a two-day "Convocation on Climate and Hunger," Christian leaders from Africa, Europe, and the United States signed a statement committing themselves to stand together and "seek public policies that yield measurable results and meaningful change for those disproportionately affected by hunger and climate change." Through the Convocation and statement, the leaders hope to unify and amplify a global Christian voice on the need to address climate change to end hunger in advance of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ), which will be held next month in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Organizers of the Convocation believe the unique gathering is the first to bring together Christians from the three continents to address climate change and its impacts on hunger. "Today, Christian leaders from the U.S. and Europe stand in solidarity with Africa's Christian leaders in their calls for action on climate and hunger at COP 27 ," said Rev. Eugene Cho, president and CEO of Bread for the World. "We hope the Convocation and statement model how the western world can affirm the voices of Africans in tackling the issues of hunger and climate change as a group of equals." African Christian leaders welcomed Christian leaders from the United States and Europe to come alongside them in support of policies that will establish climate justice and end hunger. The convocation statement reads in part: "As Christians from Africa, Europe, and North America, we share a fierce resolve to stand and work together to end the hunger crisis made worse by climate instability, to renew God's creation, and to bring our planet into balance, forming a beloved community in which all of creation can thrive. Climate justice is our means for furthering this resolve... "Together, we seek public policies that yield measurable results and meaningful change for those disproportionately affected by hunger and climate change. We recognize that high-income countries have historically been the highest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions and have strategic roles to play in ending the dual hunger and climate crisis." The "Convocation on Climate and Hunger" was organized by the U.S.- based Bread for the World and hosted by the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC-CETA).

Nov 18, 2022( Climate Law Blog: HYPERLINK http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange / Delivered by Newstex) By Martin Lockman At the 27th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, delegations are hard at work determining the contours of how nations should prepare for climate change. A key focus has been on the Global Goal on Adaptation. Article 7.1 of the Paris Agreement[1] establishes a 'Global Goal on Adaptation' (GGA), committing Parties to the tasks of 'enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate response in the context of the temperature goal.' The Paris Agreement is, however, notably silent on what this 'global goal' actually is. Adaptation encompasses a staggering array of activities at the local, regional, national and international scale which cut across sectors and borders. A floodwall, a crop insurance scheme, and a pandemic prevention program can each be adaptation, and there may be material tensions and tradeoffs between different adaptation measures. In short, comparing and categorizing climate adaptation measures can be incredibly challenging[2]. HYPERLINK https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/files/2022/11/COP27.png https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/files/2022/11/ HYPERLINK COP27 .png In the second week of COP 27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, negotiators debate a proposed GGA framework. Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, officials, academics, and civil society members have put forward different visions of the GGA. At COP26 in Glasglow in 2021, the parties tasked subsidiary groups with carrying out a two-year 'Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh Work Programme on the Global Goal on Adaptation,' designed to clarify and quantify the GGA. Four GGA workshops were held between June and November of 2022, focused on (1) goal-setting methodologies[3], (2) barriers to adaptation and related data gaps[4], (3) adaptation measurement techniques and metrics[5], and (4) existing and proposed methods for reporting and communicating on adaptation[6]. With this groundwork laid, negotiations at COP 27 have focused on one central dynamic. In the first week of COP 27 , developing country groups pushed for the parties to establish a concrete framework for the GGA this year. The developing country proposal consists of a multidimensional framework[7], which proposes to track adaptation progress by applying a set of cross-cutting considerations across multiple thematic areas like 'terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems,' 'food and agriculture,' and 'settlements and infrastructure,' and examining multiple dimensions of adaptation, including planning, implementation, finance, and capacity-building. Zambia, on behalf of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), also pushed for the adoption of specific (if broad) metrics for the GGA. Proposed metrics included, among other measurements, a target of 100% of the global population having access to early warning systems by 2025 and 100% of countries developing adaptation plans by 2030. In contrast, several developed countries, including the European Union and the U.S., have questioned the need[8] to implement a comprehensive framework at this time. These countries have advocated for another year of work before any GGA framework is established, and proposed a broader approach based on the adaptation policy cycle, 'which encompasses risk and vulnerability assessments, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation, and learning[9].' This tension continued in meetings of the subsidiary bodies during the first week of COP27 ,[10] and culminated on Friday (November 11) with the adoption of draft conclusions[11] acknowledging the subsidiary bodies' inability to agree on an outcome and bringing the issue to the attention of the conference Presidency. By Wednesday (November 16) Zambia's proposed firm metrics had fallen out of negotiations[12], and parties remained divided[13] on whether to leave COP 27 with a GGA framework or delay for another year. One reason for the tension in these negotiations is that the GGA has become a strategic front in a broader struggle over climate change finance. At COP 15 in Copenhagen in 2009, developed countries pledged to direct at least $100 billion USD per year in climate finance to developing countries by 2020. That promise has been broken[14]; an OECD study published in September of 2022 found that, as of 2020, developed countries had mobilized only $83 billion per year. A recent study by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) concluded that even if the $100 billion pledge had been fulfilled, it would be woefully inadequate. According to UNEP, '[i]nternational adaptation finance flows to developing countries are 5-10 times below estimated needs[15],' which could be as much as $340 billion per year by 2030 and $650 billion per year by 2050. Many developing country delegations see the GGA as a crucial tool to pressure richer nations to deliver on their climate finance promises. In an interview prior to COP27 , the current Chair of the AGN, Ephraim Mwepya Shitima of Zambia, made it clear[16] that many delegations see concretizing the GGA as a key step to securing adaptation financing. While it has received less emphasis in negotiations, many also see a comprehensive and nuanced GGA as a way to monitor intra-country disparities in access to climate adaptation resources, which can be at least as stark as wealth disparities between countries[17]. This stance has only intensified throughout the COP, and in 'Head of Delegation' negotiations on Thursday (November 17) developed and developing countries once again clashed over the scope, scale, and speed of a potential GGA framework. With less than 48 hours left of COP 27 , however, it remains unclear if the conference will conclude with a GGA framework or if adaptation measurement will be kicked down the road to COP 28 and beyond.

PR Newswire The27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 )was held in Sharm EI Sheikh, a coastal city in Egypt, from November 6 to 18 amid significant global attention. Li Wenxue, Vice President of LONGi, virtually attended a sideline meeting themed"Green Finance and Chinese Industries Tackling Climate Change"on November 12 and released the 2nd White Paper on Climate Action to the world. "Climate change is a common challenge, and it is related to the sustainable development of all humankind,"Li Wenxue said in his speech, adding that the current state of global climate change has changed from a future challenge to an immediate crisis. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, in order to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, global greenhouse gas emissions need to reach a peak in 2025 and reduce by nearly half in 2030. Urgent actions are required to prevent the severe climate impacts caused by global warming by promoting a green, low-carbon transition through aggressive emission reduction measures. Li Wenxue stressed that in the face of the crisis brought about by climate change, replacing traditional energy with renewable energy is a key step in the green and low-carbon transformation. As per predictions, by 2030, the annual new photovoltaic installed capacity in the world will need to reach 1,500-2,000GW to form an effective support for the global energy transformation, thus laying the foundation for achieving global net zero emissions, which will be 10 times the new installed capacity of global photovoltaic in 2021. The green low carbon transformation will create a huge green market, which will serve as a fresh impetus for green development. As a globally leading energy technology company, LONGi firmly believes that technological innovation can help humankind achieve carbon neutrality at a rapidly declining cost. Since 2021, LONGi has broken the world record for the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells for 11 consecutive times, while firmly pursuing the innovative solution of "Green electricity +Green hydrogen". LONGi is always committed to becoming an advocate, practitioner and leader of sustainable development in the field of global clean energy, making positive contributions to global green low-carbon development and realizing a zero-carbon future. The report released by LONGi is the 2nd White Paper on Climate Action since the company's participation in the United Nations Climate Conference last year. In 2021, LONGi established a greenhouse gas emission accounting system covering the entire value chain of the company (Scope I, II and III). It has actively implemented RE100 and used 3,096 million kWh of green power throughout the year, accounting for more than 40.19% of total power consumption, which is equivalent to dodging 1.68 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, including more than 160,000 tons of emission reductions through energy conservation and consumption reduction. While LONGi continues to meet the rapidly increasing global demand for photovoltaic capacity, its carbon emission intensity has been further reduced. The greenhouse gas emissions per unit revenue in 2021 are 20.7% lower than those in 2020, laying the foundation for the gradual decoupling of capacity growth and carbon emissions. It is reported that the report received technical support fromThe Carbon Trust, an international independent consulting agency, and comprehensively demonstrated the firm commitment and practical action of LONGi as a leading enterprise in the photovoltaic industry in dealing with global climate change. In terms of implementing corporate climate action, both the management and grassroots employees of LONGi are ambitious and pragmatic. In 2018, LONGi took the lead in proposing the concept of "Solar for Solar" at the 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference . In 2020, LONGi became the only Chinese enterprise to join the four climate initiatives, namely, RE100, EP100, EV100 and SBTi at the same time. In 2021, LONGi kicked off the construction of the first "Zero Carbon Factory" in the photovoltaic industry and established its hydrogen energy equipment manufacturing division. In 2022, LONGi released the "Supply Chain Green Partner Empowerment Plan", actively responding to the requirements of the national "Double Carbon" goals, and working with partners to continue to promote the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction. During the past year, LONGi has steadily promoted climate action, established a greenhouse gas emission accounting system covering the company's entire value chain (Scope I, II and III) and accelerated the construction of a sustainable development and ESG management system, actively used a high proportion of green power, continuously improved energy efficiency, reduced carbon emission intensity in products, and laid a solid foundation for achieving gradual decoupling of capacity growth and carbon emissions. At present, the world is facing multiple challenges such as geopolitical conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic and instability in the supply chain. While some countries have wavered from their climate change policies, China has continued to attach great importance to tackling climate change and unswervingly followed the path of green development. "LONGi also firmly believes that tackling climate change and achieving net zero emissions is a global consensus, and is willing to work with partners from all sides to take joint action to accelerate the transformation of clean energy and low-carbon green development. We will actively contribute to the innovation of green energy technology enterprises, and help China and the world move towards a zero carbon future,"Li Wenxue said in his speech. The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the Energy Transformation Commission (ETC), the China New Energy Chamber of Commerce (CNECC), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and other international organizations, as well as some representatives of LONGi's partners and customers took part and supported the release of LONGi's 2022 White Paper on Climate Action. As a leading solar technology company in the world, LONGi, along with Vanke Foundation and China Corporate Climate Action (CCCA), launched an enterprise-themed exhibition hall in the Green Zone of the COP27 conference and displayed its most recent generation of Hi-MO 6 series modules. About LONGi Founded in 2000, LONGi is committed to being the world's leading solar technology company, focusing on customer-driven value creation for full scenario energy transformation. Under its mission of 'making the best of solar energy to build a green world', LONGi has dedicated itself to technology innovation and established five business sectors, covering mono silicon wafers cells and modules, commercial & industrial distributed solar solutions, green energy solutions and hydrogen equipment.

The following information was released by the Government of Canada: Canada is wrapping up its participation at the Twenty-Seventh United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), more committed than ever to keeping the goal alive of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, supported by Catherine Stewart, Canada's Ambassador for Climate Change, and Steven Kuhn, Canada's Chief Negotiator for Climate Change, and a strong team, met with colleagues from more than 190 countries in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, at a critical time as countries are being devastated by climate events such as historic flooding, as well as rising energy and food crises due to geopolitical instability. Canada came to the table as a fully-committed partner in advancing cooperation and implementation for climate action and is leading by example with the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, the country's comprehensive sector-by-sector roadmap to achieve its goal to reduce emissions by at least forty percent by 2030, on the road to net zero by 2050. Negotiations focus on moving the needle on many important climate issues under the Paris Agreement, including mitigation, climate finance, and adaptation. Canada notes many challenges on the topic of loss and damage and heard vulnerable countries on the difficulties they are facing in accessing the resources they need. Canada has engaged, and continues to engage, constructively on loss and damage and is working toward a concrete outcome. Minister Guilbeault will share a statement on the final text decision in the coming days. Amid the often tough and ongoing negotiations underway, Canada announced many new commitments and investments over the course of the conference, including around emissions reduction, climate financing for the most vulnerable developing nations, and clean energy transition, along with multilateral partnerships. Canada announced increased cooperation with the United States on reducing oil and gas sector emissionswith a special focus on methane. Cutting oil and gas methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to combat climate change. This is why Canada joined the Joint Declaration from Energy Importers and Exporters on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuels and reaffirmed its commitment to reduce methane emissions by at least seventy-five percent by 2030. To help achieve these goals, Canada published a regulatory framework to help to inform consultations and the development of forthcoming stricter oil and gas methane regulations. It also joined the International Methane Emissions Observatory to help monitor and share methane emissions data gathered by satellites. Canada is committed to helping the world's most vulnerable combat the impacts of climate change, and announced a number of practical initiatives totalling $84.25 million through its $5.3 billion international climate finance commitment and other sources of funding at COP27 . This includes $24 million for critical areas such as loss and damage, access to climate finance, and climate governance and $4 million to help Belize, Grenada, Guyana and Saint Lucia, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean, reduce methane emissions and help them achieve their climate target under the Paris Agreement. Canada remains steadfast in its commitment, including working in partnership to reach the collective goal of mobilizing US$100 billion as soon as possible and through 2025. Canada is proud to have released the Climate Finance Delivery Plan Progress Report with Germany ahead of COP27 to provide further transparency on developed countries' commitment toward the goal. Canada continues to advocate for clean energy and is ambitiously pushing for the adoption of carbon pricing globally by rolling out with Chile the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge, launched by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at COP26. New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are among countries that are considering, or have already made, carbon pricing key to their approach in fighting climate change. Canada announced an additional $16 million in support of the World Bank's Partnership for Market Implementation to advance the Challenge's goals, as well as two new initiatives under its $5.3 billion commitment to help developing countries transition to clean energy and drive global ambition. The relationship between protecting nature, halting biodiversity loss, finding nature-based solutions and climate change was emphasized at COP27 . Minister Guilbeault held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from other countries and organizations to discuss shared priorities on climate change, as well as nature and biodiversity loss, as Canada prepares to welcome the world to Montreal, Quebec, for the Fifteenth United Nations Conference on Biological Diversity (COP15). The international community cannot delay working together to jointly address these pressing challenges. Canada is ready to welcome the global community this December to come to an agreement on an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework. \</doc>

Lightsource bp, a subsidiary of BP plc, issued the following news on Nov. 22, 2022: After two weeks on the ground at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, our Lightsource bp delegation has returned home safely. We were proud to be part of the +45,000 attendees in Egypt this year. For the diplomats and politicians, the result of their work is the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan. There will be hope that those in attendance now take some of the ideas contained in the agreement home with them and start making tangible steps to accelerate action. The deal repeats the call for deeper action and repeatedly flags the role that renewables will play in that. The final deal calls for faster, deeper action to slash emissions. It goes as far as to highlight the essential role for renewables in that process. Figures from the IEA estimate that 9 percent of global electricity was generated by wind and solar in 2020. But that figure will need to reach 68 percent by 2050 to pair with its Net Zero scenario. In Europe, BloombergNEF estimates that 2.4TW of dedicated renewables will be required purely for making green hydrogen Europe has around 1.7TW of installed wind and solar capacity as of April 2022.

By E.A. Crunden Two environmental groups want a major beverage giant pushed out of the world's largest climate conference over plastics concerns, arguing the material has become "the new coal" and warrants a major response. Just Zero and Beyond Plastics, two U.S. based-groups, called on the United Nations Climate Change Conference to kick Coca-Cola Co, out as a sponsor of this year's COP 27 on Wednesday. They asserted that the beverage manufacturer's role in the event is undermining the global fight against climate change and is at odds with efforts to bring down emissions. " COP 27 is supposed to focus on solutions for fighting the catastrophic climate crisis," said Judith Enck, who heads Beyond Plastics and previously served as an Obama-era EPA regional administrator. "Instead, we're allowing it to be a stage for corporate greenwashing." She was joined in her remarks by Just Zero State Policy Director Peter Blair, who said the company's sponsorship of COP 27 "makes it hard to see this meeting as anything more than a performative act." Other corporate sponsors for COP 27 include Microsoft Corp., IBM Corp., Boston Consulting Group Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC. But Coca-Cola has drawn ire from anti-plastics groups who have long targeted the global beverage manufacturing force over plastics, a fossil fuel product. They have pushed back hard on Coca-Cola's role as a sponsor for this year's COP event, noting not only the realities of plastics production but also the mounting environmental crisis associated with pollution and dismal recycling numbers. Moreover, advocates have cited a 2021 report from Beyond Plastics and Bennington College in Vermont that found plastics are poised to overtake coal as a driver of climate emissions within a decade (Greenwire , Oct. 21, 2021). Coca-Cola has repeatedly emphasized its recycling commitments and investments, which include plans to achieve net-zero emissions by midcentury and heavily combat marine debris. But an annual audit of corporate brands by Break Free From Plastic , an international coalition, has notably named Coca-Cola "the world's top plastic polluter" for four years running. Critics charge that its pollution footprint speaks for itself. Coca-Cola has said that it is responsible for around 3 million metric tons of plastic packaging, an inevitable waste product. Such numbers, advocates argue, should disqualify the company from COP 27 sponsorship. "By pouring millions of dollars into sponsoring COP 27 , Coca-Cola is making a shameful play to give the appearance of environmental responsibility," said Blair. "But behind the scenes, Coca-Cola's lobbyists campaign to block improvements in real recycling and resist calls to transition away from single-use plastic bottles to reusable and refillable glass containers." Enck similarly took a hard line on the issue. "Plastics [are] the new coal. How can a major plastic polluter be in a leadership position at such an important climate conference?" she asked. "It's well past time that our country's policymakers and advocates commit to holding corporations accountable for the impact their products and policies have on our climate and environment." A spokesperson for Coca-Cola did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments from Just Zero and Beyond Plastics compound earlier complaints from groups including Greenpeace, who have argued the company's presence at COP 27 is "greenwashing" (Climatewire , Oct. 25). Progress report The push coincides with the release of a major new report on recycling from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which does significant work on plastics issues. In its 2022 progress report, the organization found that "strong progress" is being made in some areas but that a number of companies are not on track to completely implement reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging by 2025. Produced with the U.N. Environment Programme, the findings underscore just how challenging it is for companies to meet plastics recycling metrics. Flexible packaging, like sachets and films, are particularly burdensome, given that they are not accepted by most recycling facilities and easily find their way into the environment as contaminants. Coca-Cola is one of the companies participating in the annual report, which shows the company actually increased the amount of plastic it has produced since signing on in 2018. Graham Forbes, who leads plastics work for Greenpeace USA, argued that "the report clearly shows that voluntary commitments from companies to address plastic pollution have failed." Still, some industry members pointed to the report's upswings. Matt Seaholm, CEO and president of the Plastics Industry Association, noted that most of the companies participating in the effort have continued to reduce their virgin plastic use. Many are also bolstering their use of recycled plastics, something Seaholm asserted shows progress. "This report confirms that recycling is real, recycling works, and we need to increase investments in it to continue making progress," he said. Seaholm also underscored the need for continued investment in such endeavors. Industry members have long argued that plastics are too ingrained in global society to be abandoned, and that they have key uses in life-saving products like medical devices, along with renewable technology like solar panels. Striking a balance between advocating for those items while also addressing pollution concerns, Seaholm said, remains key to addressing the problems that have emerged as plastics have become a global contaminant. "The fact of the matter is plastic packaging offers significant environmental and economic benefits over the alternatives, but plastic waste continues to be a challenge," he continued. "Plastics packaging also keeps us healthy and safe, and finding more ways to reuse and recycle plastic is the key to responsibly assuring that protection." \</doc>

The following information was released by the World Economic Forum in Davos: A global coalition of ocean leaders announced today at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference a first-of-a-kind framework to guide the development and purchasing of high-quality blue carbon projects and credits. Blue carbon or the carbon captured and sequestered by ocean ecosystems is experiencing a particularly rapid increase in demand. The High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles and Guidance was developed to provide consistent and accepted standards for blue carbon projects and credits for credit purchasers, investors, suppliers, and project developers. "We are defining a way forward that ensures inclusive participation and leadership of communities and other local groups, as well as equitable access to benefits and capacity building for all those who have a stake in these coastal ecosystems," said Karen Demavivas, Lead, Ocean Action Agenda, at the World Economic Forum. "The guidance will act as a strong compass to help blue carbon stakeholders navigate this unique space and opt for blue carbon projects that offer a real and lasting positive impact." Nature-based carbon credits are proving to be an effective tool for incentivizing climate action, with the global voluntary carbon market estimated to grow to $50 billion by 2030. As organizations race to achieve their net-zero commitments, blue carbon stakeholders are advised to select quality blue carbon projects that prioritize sustainable and equitable outcomes for people, nature, and the climate. "This framework is one contribution to the growing dialogue around high-quality blue carbon," said Whitney Johnston, Director of Ocean Sustainability at Salesforce. "We hope these principles will serve as a foundation for actions that ensure equity, accountability, transparency, and sustainability in the blue carbon space." The High-Quality Blue Carbon Principles and Guidance was made possible through a collaborative effort between the World Economic Forum's Friends of Ocean Action, Salesforce, Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance, and Meridian Institute. The principles were derived through a consultative process, consolidating existing knowledge and best practices to provide a shared vision for achieving high-quality blue carbon credits. \</doc>

The following information was released by the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT): On 10 November 2022, Egyptian authorities denied human rights defender Giorgio Caracciolo, an Italian national and Deputy Director for International Programs at DIGNITY and a member of the executive committee of EuroMed Rights, entry to Egypt and required him to leave Cairo International Airport on a flight to Paris, France. Caracciolo, who had a valid entry visa to Egypt and a QR Code for COP27 Green Zone access according to an expert, was scheduled to participate in COP27 , including by meeting with Egyptian human rights defenders and officials from various governments attending COP27 . Egyptian authorities did not provide him with a reason for revoking his visa and denying him entry. Caracciolo's denial of entry confirms earlier about restrictions facing civil society at COP27 amidst a systematic crackdown on the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. From the outset, the Egyptian government has maneuvered to sideline and silence independent civil society at COP27 . COP27 , human rights organizations documented the arbitrary detention and interrogation of scores of people by the Supreme State Security Prosecution on the suspicion of supporting calls for peaceful protests during the conference. Egyptian environmental activists have voiced their concern that engagement with the COP27 may lead to acts of reprisals by the Egyptian authorities after the conclusion of the conference. Through Caracciolo's leadership, DIGNITY has fought for years against Egypt's systematic practices of torture and ill-treatment. Egypt's attacks on and marginalization of critical voices and human rights activists, including through Caracciolo's denial of entry, undermine the integrity of COP27 and impede the ability of civil society to meaningfully engage with the Conference of Parties. We call upon States participating at COP27 to express their deep dismay at Caracciolo's denial of entry and urge the Egyptian authorities to address urgent human rights concerns, including by: 1. Ensure the right to freedom of association by closing all politically-motivated investigations into the legitimate work of NGOs, removing all restrictions on independent civil society including travel bans and asset freezes, and allowing their unimpeded participation at COP 27 2. Remove all disproportionate restrictions on the right to freedom of expression and ensure freedom of the media. 3. Amend legislation on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly to comply with Egypt's international human rights obligations, allow the full exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression during and after COP27 , and instruct security forces to refrain from using unlawful force when policing protests during and after COP27 . The failure of States participating at COP to urge the Egyptian authorities to address those concerns effectively encourages them to use COP27 as a means to whitewash Egypt's abominable human rights record, which will ultimately exacerbate the ongoing human rights crisis in the country.

KIGALI, Rwanda, Nov. 07, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- From 6 \- 18 November 2022, heads of states, high level government representatives and business leaders will gather at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt for the latest round of international climate talks. During the conference, a high-profile event will be held to globally launch the Rwanda Sustainable Finance Roadmap which was launched in Rwanda at the end of October 2022. It will be an informative session that will introduce Rwanda\' s vision of becoming a sustainable finance hub, through Kigali International Financial Centre (KIFC). The launch event is set to showcase the steps Rwanda is taking towards becoming a leader in green finance; and how this Roadmap will drive the implementation of new sustainable financial structures and instruments to support ESG models and drive sustainability across Rwanda. The event will take place on Wednesday 9 November 2022 at the Rwanda Pavillion. The Roadmap was developed in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) that continues to play an important role in accelerating the Sustainable Agenda on the continent. KIFC is also a member of the international network of Financial Centres for Sustainability (FC4S), a flagship initiative of the UNDP which aims to accelerate the shift to sustainable finance and achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord. The network has a collective of 39 international financial centres, representing 82% of the global equity market. Nick Barigye, CEO of Rwanda Finance Limited, the investment promotion agency that is leading the development and promotion of KIFC, said:  Sustainable finance is one of our key priorities and Kigali International Financial Centre (KIFC) is taking important steps to steer Rwanda towards becoming a leader in sustainable finance. The Roadmap shows the full range of financial instruments that we are implementing with a target to accelerate the mobilisation of local, regional, and international capital towards green and sustainable projects. It also provides a pathway towards transitioning our local financial sector to ESG best practices. Rwanda understands the importance of climate finance and recognises the role that the financial sector needs to play in driving the country\' s sustainable growth through capital mobilisation and allocation of economic resources, as well as by recognising and managing risks related to climate change. COP27 presents a great opportunity for Rwanda to promote global collaboration to address climate change issues and to advance the country\' s vision to become a carbon-neutral and climate resilient economy by 2050. COP27 is also an important opportunity for Africa and African financial centres. The continent produces just 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions however has experienced some of the worst consequences due to increasingly extreme weather conditions. This year\' s negotiations need to reach concrete decisions that yield tangible results and advance the implementation of the National Determined Contributions (NDCs), including adaptation and mitigation efforts and delivery of finance to enhance implementation. About Kigali International Financial Centre (KIFC) About Rwanda Finance Limited (RFL)Rwanda Finance Limited is the agency leading the development and promotion of Rwanda as a preferred destination for international investment and cross-border transactions in Africa. RFL works closely with key stakeholders to develop and support the Kigali International Financial Centre through investment promotion, policy advocacy and sector upskilling. _____________________________________________________ Note to editors: For press enquiries and requests for interviews, contact HYPERLINK mailto:rwanda@aeqglobal.com rwanda@aeqglobal.com Derrick Amoako +44 7759 764 174/Shaduri Umutoniwase: +250 7885 80110 For more information KIFC / RFL Website LinkedIn Twitter \</doc>

Today, the window of opportunity for scaled-up global climate action to prevent disastrous global warming and build resilience in the most vulnerable nations is closing fast. And a major impediment to reducing emissions and accelerating climate adaptation is both lack of financial investment and major bureaucratic hurdles to accessing those funds that are available. For Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS), the failure of the international community to provide US$100 billion per year to address climate change impacts in the developing world, a pledge made thirteen years ago, has grave consequences. And it will be a major issue for Pacific leaders at the COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference due to start in Egypt on Sunday. \\x93The Pacific is at the frontline of the impacts of climate change. Climate finance is critical to allow mitigation and adaptation actions, yet the region is suffering from a lack of access to the climate finance already committed to global mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund. Due to global priority setting or global priorities, it is not flowing to where it is needed most,\\x94 Dr Stuart Minchin, Director-General of the regional development organization, Pacific Community, in Noumea, New Caledonia, told IPS. \\x93It seems the polluters are setting the rules, and consequently, the flow of climate finance is more like a drip feed than the torrent that is required to meet the challenges of the region.\\x94 Island nations scattered across the Pacific Ocean are among the world\\x92s most exposed to climate extremes, such as rising air temperatures, ocean acidification, more damaging cyclones, heatwaves and the critical loss of biodiversity, water and food security, the IPCC reported this year. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat estimates that the region needs US$1 billion per year to implement its climate adaptation goals and US$5.2 billion annually by 2030. \\x93Without global funding, Pacific Island countries and territories will not be able to identify and implement climate solutions,\\x94 Anne-Claire Goarant, Programme Manager for the Pacific Community\\x92s Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability Programme in Noumea told IPS, adding that the costs will be high. \\x93Already climate-induced disasters are causing economic costs of 0.5 percent to 6.6 percent of annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Pacific Island countries. This trend will continue in the future in the absence of urgent climate action. Without adaptation measures, a high island, such as Viti Levu in Fiji, could experience damages of US$23-52 million per year by 2050.\\x94 The unique characteristics of islands, such as small land areas, the very close proximity of many communities, infrastructure and economic activities to coastlines and precarious economies, means that severe weather events can have disastrous impacts. Fifty-five percent of the Pacific Islanders live less than 1 kilometre from the sea, and every year more villages face relocation as their existence is endangered by flooding and sea erosion. \\xA0Excessive heat, drought and rainfall are predicted to threaten crop and food production, and by the end of the century, important revenues from Pacific tourism could plummet by 27-34 percent. The costs of climate adaptation could reach more than 25 percent of GDP in Kiribati, 15 percent of GDP in Tuvalu and more than 10 percent of GDP in Vanuatu. Yet Pacific Island nations are \\x91among the least equipped to adapt, putting their economic development and macroeconomic stability at risk,\\x92 reports the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One of the two largest global sources of climate finance is the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has the mandate to focus on the needs of developing countries, and another, the Adaptation Fund, supports tangible adaptation projects. However, most of the global funding tracked by Oxfam in 2017-2018 did not reach the most fragile nations. Only 20.5 percent of reported finance was allocated to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and 3 percent to Small Island Developing States. \\x93On financing adaptation in developing countries, what\\x92s happened thus far is not good enough. We need to scale up quite dramatically the ambition within the multilateral development banks and bilateral donors. And we need to work on blended finance, where some public finance leverages private finance, and there is a proper sharing of risks between the private and public sectors,\\x94 Mark Carney, the United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Finance, has stated. The Pacific Community is working closely with nations across the region to develop and submit climate funding proposals and support them in implementing projects once finance is approved. In Fiji, Nauru, Tonga and the Solomon Islands, for example, it is supporting projects on the ground to build climate resilience expertise and capacity among smallholder farmers with a Euro 4.6 million grant from the multi-donor Kiwa Initiative. But many countries in the region are experiencing limited success with funding applications. In the Federated States of Micronesia, financial support is needed for increasing resilience in health, protecting coastal areas, lifeline access roads, and critical infrastructure from climate destruction and improving water security, Belinda Hadley, Team Leader in FSM\\x92s National Designated Authority for the Green Climate Fund explained. But funding remains elusive as the island states struggle with overly difficult and resource-intensive application processes. \\x93The processes to apply for multilateral climate finance are heavy and complex. This makes accessing climate finance a slow and onerous process. In-country capacities within governments and other institutions are insufficient in the face of such complex processes. Many countries don\\x92t have enough sufficient personnel to meet the burdensome requirements set by the donors,\\x94 Dirk Snyman, Co-ordinator of the Pacific Community\\x92s Climate Finance Unit told IPS. \\x93Even after project approval, disbursement of funds can still take one to two years. This does not allow countries to implement their adaptation and mitigation actions within the timeframes required.\\x94 Funders need \\x93to facilitate faster and easier access to climate finance in such a manner that the climate change priorities of Pacific communities, rather than the priorities and policies of the donors, are driving the regional portfolio of climate change projects,\\x94 Ma\\xEBva Tesan, Communications and Knowledge Management Officer for the Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability Programme emphasized. Snyman said that the situation could be improved if multilateral finance providers made application procedures more streamlined and flexible, changed the current compliance-based approach to a focus on positive project impacts and a dedicated climate fund was established for losses and damages in the region. These views are echoed by the IMF, which recommends that climate finance providers should recognize \\x91the shrinking window of opportunity to address the climate crisis\\x92 and \\x91consider further efforts to rebalance the risks to shareholders with the urgency of climate adaptation needs of small and fragile countries.\\x92 The COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference will be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on 6-18 November.

The global scientific, social and political consensus is that climate change presents a dangerous threat to humanity, involving physical, transitional and litigation risks at every level, in both the private and public sectors. As part of their Climate Crisis Initiative, the IBA released their Climate Crisis Statement in 2020, recognising the imminent threat that the climate crisis poses globally and emphasising the role the legal profession has in addressing the issue. The ABA and the Law Society of England and Wales also published climate change resolutions in 2019 and 2021 respectively. The Honorable Justice Luis Roberto Barroso of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil will provide a keynote address at the COP27 event. Lara Douvartzidis, Project Lawyer at the IBA Legal Policy and Research Unit, and Leticia Perrone Campos Mello, Partner at WALD Lawyers & President of the Special Committee for the Defense of Sustainable Development at the OAB, will moderate the session. Other expert speakers include:  Caio Borges, Coordinator of the Law and Climate Portfolio, Instituto Clima e Sociedade  Dr Markus Gehring, Fellow in the Centre for Environment, Energy and Natural Resources Governance (C-EENRG), Associate Professor in the Law Faculty of the University of Cambridge  Sophie Marjanac, ClientEarth leader, Climate Accountability Initiative; Expert in climate change law and litigation, human rights, and corporate management of climate risk  Professor John Dernbach, Commonwealth Professor of Environmental Law and Sustainability Director, Environmental Law and Sustainability Center, Widener University  Roger Martella, Chief Sustainability Officer, General Electric Company (GE)  Dr Alessandra Lehmen, Leading Environmental, ESG, and Climate Lawyer, LSE W50  Caroline May, Specialist Environment and Health and Safety Lawyer, Norton Rose Fulbright  Nina Pindham, Barrister Specialising in Planning and Environmental Law, No5 Chambers Across two sessions, panelists will discuss the following topics: Session 1: The Current Situation. This session shall consider how law associations around the world are responding to the global legal community's response to the climate crisis - including actions taken, climate litigation and challenges on the horizon. Session 2: Looking Ahead. What role should lawyers play in addressing climate change? What more can law associations do to help lawyers integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation into their practice? Participants will receive morning tea followed by lunch at 1300, providing networking opportunities for practitioners and law associations to collaborate at the international level to tackle the greatest issue of our age - the climate crisis.

The following information was released by the UK Government: One year on from hosting COP26 in Glasgow, the UK has handed over the Presidency of the United Nations Climate Change Conference to Egypt as world leaders, including the UK's PM, Rishi Sunak, meet at Sharm el Sheikh for COP27 . British High Commission Islamabad and British Deputy High Commission Karachi The UK's Presidency of COP26 made progress on each of its four goals of: mitigation (reducing emissions), adaptation (helping those already impacted by climate change), finance (enabling countries to deliver on their climate goals) and collaboration (working together to deliver even greater action). Most importantly, if countries which agreed the Glasgow Climate Pact deliver on their commitments to phase down coal power, halt or reverse deforestation and speed up the switch to electric vehicles, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is still possible. This will be critical for preventing devastating climate impacts and protecting vulnerable countries like Pakistan. At COP26 the UK pledged 55m in financial support to Pakistan to assist with building climate resilience and tackling climate change. This support is in addition to 26.5m provided by the UK Government and 30m donated by UK citizens to provide relief following this year's devastating floods. Having handed over the Presidency, the UK is maintaining its ambitious goals on climate change. This year the UK is launching the 'Accelerating to Zero Coalition' which will promote the use of more electric cars worldwide. The UK is also initiating the 'Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership' to halt and reverse forest loss and will be working with developed countries to increase the availability of climate finance to countries such as Pakistan. Development Director at the British High Commission, Islamabad Jo Moir, said the following: This year's floods are a stark reminder of impact climate change is having on our lives. Globally, we will face more climate catastrophes, and climate-vulnerable countries like Pakistan face enormous challenges. Business as usual is not enough. At COP27 we need to make further progress on ensuring countries which have been affected by climate related disasters have the necessary tools to build-back smarter. The UK will be a leading voice on this. Notes to editors: Important achievements of COP26 include: International partners mobilising over $20 billion for a just and inclusive transition from coal to clean energy. 137 countries committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 in the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use. The COP26 Declaration on Accelerating the Transition to 100% Zero Emission Cars and Vans brought together over 35 countries, 6 major carmakers, 43 cities, states and regions, 28 fleet owners and 15 financial institutions and investors, all committing to work together to achieve this goal. It currently has over 180 signatories. Building on the ZEV declaration, the UK will formally launch the Acceleration to Zero (A2Z) Coalition this will comprise of a group of governments, manufacturers and businesses that will take the lead in ensuring that all new vehicles are zero emission by 2035 in leading markets and globally by 2040. On 2 November, as part of its Climate Finance Accelerator programme the UK announced that seven low-carbon projects from across Pakistan would receive technical support to improve their ability to attract long-term investment from financers, worth up to 148m. These projects have the potential to benefit communities across Pakistan, through clean energy access, green transportation and pollution reduction while creating jobs. The ultimate objective however is to improve the flow of much needed climate finance which will allow Pakistan to build back smarter. At COP27 \</doc>

(TNSrpt) -- The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued the following news release:    New report details how extreme heat events foreshadow a less habitable world.    Record high temperatures this year-which are fueling catastrophes in Somalia, Pakistan and around the world-foreshadow a future with deadlier, more frequent and more intense heat-related humanitarian emergencies, a new report warns. Released a month ahead of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 "As the climate crisis goes unchecked, extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, are hitting the most vulnerable people the hardest," says Martin Griffiths, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. "Nowhere is the impact more brutally felt than in countries already reeling from hunger, conflict and poverty." The report-the first to be published jointly by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)-offers concrete steps that humanitarians and decision makers can take to mitigate extreme heat's worst effects. 2022 has already seen communities across North Africa, Australia, Europe, South Asia and the Middle East suffocate under record-high temperatures. Most recently the Western United States and China have buckled under severe heat. The report, notes that, in the coming decades, heatwaves are predicted to meet and exceed human physiological and social limits in regions such as the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and South and South-West Asia. Extreme heatwaves in these regions, where humanitarian needs are already high, would result in large-scale suffering and loss of life, population movements and further entrenched inequality, the report warns. "The climate crisis is intensifying humanitarian emergencies all around the world. To avert its most devastating impacts, we must invest equally on adaptation and mitigation, particularly in the countries most at risk," says Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General of the IFRC. "At COP27 Heatwaves prey on inequality, with the greatest impacts on isolated and marginalized people. The report stresses that the urgent priority must be large and sustained investments that mitigate climate change and support long-term adaptation for the most vulnerable people. The report also finds that, although the impacts of extreme heat are global, some people are hit harder than others. Vulnerable communities, such as agricultural workers, are being pushed to the front lines while the elderly, children, and pregnant and breastfeeding women are at higher risk of illness and death. The world's lowest-income countries are already experiencing disproportionate increases in extreme heat. These countries are the least to blame for climate change, but they will see a significant increase in the number of at-risk people in the coming decades. Building on a growing body of knowledge and good practice around early warning, anticipatory action and response systems to heatwaves, the report suggests the following five key steps to help the most vulnerable people:  Support preparedness and expand anticipatory action, especially by local actors, who are often the first responders in emergencies.  Find new and more sustainable ways of financing local action.  Adapt humanitarian response to accelerating extreme heat. Humanitarian organizations are already testing approaches such as more thermally appropriate emergency housing, 'green roofs', cooling centres and adjustments to school timetables, but this will require significant investments in research and learning.  Strengthen engagement across the humanitarian, development and climate spheres. Addressing the impact of extreme heat in the long-term and helping communities, towns, cities and countries adapt to extreme heat risk will require sustained development planning.

The following information was released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA): The Arab region is highly vulnerable to climate change. Temperature has increased by an average of 0.8 C over the last 20 years, and is projected to increase by 4.8 C by the end of the century. Droughts, heat waves, forest fires, sand and dust storms, sea level rise and flash floods are impacting health, homes, livelihoods and nature in urban, rural and coastal communities alike. Today, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ( ESCWA ) reiterated calls to accelerate climate action by pushing for better climate finance in the region at the Arab Regional Forum on Climate Finance, organized ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ). COP27 COP27 President Designate and Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry said. " This allows moving rapidly towards full, timely, inclusive and at scale action on the ground through translating agreements and pledges into concrete initiatives, scaling up and replicating success stories to deal with threats of climate change", he added. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohamed said in a video message that countries must make good on their commitments, and developed countries must demonstrate how they will abide by their pledge to deliver a $100 billion annually and double adaptation finance to $40 million, as agreed during the COP26 in Glasgow. "Innovative financial instruments can help, including initiatives such as the Climate/SDG Debt Swap-Donor Nexus put forward by ESCWA," she added. The Forum was an avenue for facilitating engagement among a broad set of partners and stakeholders to accelerate public and private investment mobilization, and blended finance opportunities around concrete projects and initiatives. It also connected institutional investors, private sector financiers and development partners with Governments to broker dialogue around co-creating investment opportunities to support priority actions in the region. For his part, UN Climate High-Level Champion and UN Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Mahmoud Mohieldin said that common regional work can overcome obstacles that hinder the financing and implementation of climate projects amid the current global challenges. "Climate financing is insufficient and takes too long to be negotiated; it is unjust because the most vulnerable countries are asked to pay for a crisis that they don't contribute to, and they get the smallest share of finance to achieve their climate goals," he added. Participants called upon public and private stakeholders, as well as leaders of the international development community who are committed to delivering on climate finance in the region, to identify entry points for climate finance to accelerate access to clean energy and energy-efficient technologies, and to identify means to ensure water and food security. In her remarks, ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti stated that over the past decade, Arab States received about $34 billion in public international climate finance, less than 7% of what would be required to implement the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of 11 Arab countries. "More climate finance commitment is required with a greater focus on adaptation, particularly in the water and agricultural sectors," she added. In fact, water and food security remain key catalysts for the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as mitigation and adaptation goals in the Arab region. The Arab Regional Forum on Climate Finance is one of five regional forums organized by the Egyptian Presidency of COP27 , the UN Climate Change High-level Champions, and the five United Nations regional commissions.  About ESCWA One of five United Nations regional commissions, ESCWA supports inclusive and sustainable economic and social development in Arab States, and works on enhancing regional integration. \</doc>

Climate change is an existential threat to humans and our ability to thrive on a healthy planet. But when it comes to rising temperatures, the inability of humankind to slow emissions and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius isn\\x92t because we lack knowledge or need new technologies. Consider: Humans have been warned for more than a century about the dangers of a warming climate and its adverse impact on human health and planetary systems, including but not limited to loss of biodiversity, decreased soil and ocean health, increased sea-ice melt and corresponding sea-level rise, and amplified disasters such as hurricanes, floods, heat waves and droughts. Fifty years ago, \\x93The Limits to Growth\\x94 warned humans of the serious need to live in balance with Earth\\x92s systems. The science is settled. Likewise, technologies that drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions are available and increasingly cost-competitive\\x96particularly in energy production and transportation, two of the most significant contributors to global emissions. What is missing? This is not a difficult physics equation. While we live in a complex world, the laggards in this area are observable: money and societal will. As countries enter the second week of the global negotiations at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, typically referred to as COP27 , success will depend on the ability of the negotiators to mobilize investments and advance policy at the conference to accelerate opportunities for progress in altering the trajectory of climate change. Even discussions on \\x93loss and damage\\x94\\x96a signature issue of this conference that is historically neglected\\x96are defined by these two needs. Underlying the issues of loss and damage are questions about processes for addressing loss (policy) and determinations of who is financially responsible (investment). The price tag to address climate change is not small, but viewed in the right frame, it is a bargain. Take climate-enhanced disasters. In 2021, the world experienced four mega weather events that each cost $20+ billion in economic loss: Hurricane Ida, flooding in Europe, flooding in China and unprecedented winter weather in Texas and parts of Mexico. These types of human-induced disasters are now increasingly frequent, occurring at more places and at higher amplitudes, and are more costly without considerable investment to curtail rising greenhouse gas emissions. The 5th High Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance takes place during the second week of COP27 , where ministers will discuss achieving the annual $100 billion support mark for lower-income countries, a total those countries already note as too little, too late. The real need is in trillions of dollars, not billions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that globally, $1.6-3.8 trillion (USD) must be invested every year through public and private climate-related finance to keep warming well below warming beyond 2 degrees Celsius. For comparison, the International Monetary Fund reports that fossil-fuel subsidies in 2020 were $5.9 trillion (USD) when summing up explicit and implicit subsidies. Combining policy with public investment can dramatically amplify results. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, the country\\x92s most dramatic attempt to reorient its infrastructure and electricity production to lower emissions, could spend as much as $800 billion (USD) in tax credits, spurring on private investment to the tune of $1.7 trillion (USD) over the next decade, according to a Credit Suisse review of the policy. The same report estimates that with the manufacturing and consumer tax credits, the cost of solar electricity could fall below one U.S. cent, possibly as soon as 2025. The investment bank declared that the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act \\x93definitively changes the narrative from risk mitigation to opportunity capture\\x94 for corporations to take advantage of the law\\x92s positive impact on the economy. We have fallen behind the timeline set by the Paris Climate Accords and the 1.5 degrees Celsius target no longer seems to be achievable. The international negotiations must push the agenda to define aggressive mitigation policies, with incentives and disincentives, to scale known solutions on the fastest timescales possible for manufacturing and distribution throughout the world. This needs real investments, private as well as public, for a chance to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. The time is now to show the most marginalized countries the money.

Nov 07, 2022( Newsbusters.org: HYPERLINK http://newsbusters.org http://newsbusters.org A climate expert exposed an extreme report for hyping the supposed dangers of climate change just two days before the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) began in Egypt. 'The climate crisis is killing us. # COP27 must deliver a down-payment on climate solutions that match the scale of the problem,' UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres[1] tweeted[2] Oct. 25, promoting a doom-peddling report[3] on climate change from The Lancet. But Hoover Institution visiting fellow and climate expert Dr. Bjorn Lomborg[4] tore apart The Lancet's 'deliberately deceptive' climate report in a Nov. 4 Wall Street Journal op-ed[5]. The climate crisis is killing us.# COP27 [6] must deliver a down-payment on climate solutions that match the scale of the problem. HYPERLINK https://t.co/LhoXfrBZhD https://t.co/LhoXfrBZhD  Ant\'f3nio Guterres (@antonioguterres) October 26, 2022[9] Lomborg excoriated The Lancet for its claim that 'health [was] at the mercy of fossil fuels' in an absurd Oct. 25 study[3]. 'It is hard not to see the Lancet study's failure to adjust this figure as a deliberate act of deception,' he wrote. Lomborg also explained that The Lancet cherry-picked data by focusing on heat deaths. It was an Â£mateur statistical fallacy,' Lomborg added. Worst of all, the report misses the bigger picture. As Lomborg summarized, 'the journal claims rising temperatures have killed people but ignores that they appear to have saved far more.' So even if temperatures are rising  as billionaire Bill Gates[11], State Department climate cheerleader John Kerry[12] and the rest of the eco-doom crew so often claim[13]  that's actually good news because 'cold deaths are decreasing with rising temperatures.' Lomborg followed The Lancet's numbers to their logical conclusion: 'Based on today's population size, the current temperatures cause about 17,000 more heat deaths in older people, but also result in more than half a million fewer cold deaths.' [Emphasis added]. But The Lancet and other climate propaganda peddlers disguised as scientific journals do not just discredit science as an institution. 'This dishonesty leads to worse policy outcomes,' Lomborg wrote, criticizing activists who 'push for extreme and expensive climate policies that threaten economic growth.' Economic growth, not government intervention[14], is the recipe for human flourishing, Lomborg argued. 'Temperatures rose throughout the 20th century, but the U.S . nonetheless saw a decrease in heat deaths[15], largely thanks to air-conditioning.' He continued: 'Policies that focus on lifting people out of poverty and providing affordable, reliable sources of energy would allow the rest of the world to reduce heat deaths and live more comfortable lives. They would also help stave off the much greater threat of cold deaths.' Conservatives are under attack.

Mohamed Abdel Hamid/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images President Joe Biden made a brief appearance at COP27 , the annual United Nations climate conference, on Friday to try and convince the world that the United States is more committed than ever to tackling climate change. In addition to touting the passage of https://grist.org/politics/biden-signs-the-inflation-reduction-act-into-law/ the biggest climate bill in U.S. history , the president announced several initiatives to cut emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, including new oil and gas regulations at home and a plan to drive down emissions internationally. Cutting methane emissions is an urgent climate project. The gas is 80 to 90 times stronger than carbon dioxide at heating up the planet in its first 20 years in the atmosphere, and it leaks out of fossil fuel infrastructure ranging from wells to pipelines all the way to power plants and homes. Methane breaks down in the atmosphere in a matter of decades, meaning that addressing these leaks today can reduce its impact quickly - which would slow down climate change and stave off some of its worst effects. A year ago, the Environmental Protection Agency HYPERLINK https://grist.org/regulation/in-a-first-the-epa-will-regulate-methane-from-existing-oil-and-gas-wells/ proposed regulations to address methane leaks from existing oil and gas sites. The U.S. already had some rules in place to prevent leaks from new wells, but existing wells have been allowed to go on polluting. Now, after an extensive public comment period, the agency is proposing even stronger regulations that could take effect as soon as next year. Environmental groups applauded the government on Friday for addressing key concerns raised by experts in their feedback on the original proposal. "The Biden administration is continuing to advance the ball on these crucial standards," said Jon Goldstein, the senior director of regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund. Under last year's proposal, if emissions at a particular oil or gas well were low enough, those wells would be exempt from routine monitoring for leaks. Now the EPA wants regular monitoring of all wells - including those that are no longer being pumped but have yet to be properly shut down. These previously exempt wells, often called "marginal wells" because they don't produce much oil or gas, are estimated to be responsible for HYPERLINK https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29709-3 more than 50 percent of all wellsite methane .  The oil and gas industry HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/drillers-ask-us-exempt-smallest-wells-looming-methane-rule-2022-11-02/ fought to exclude marginal wells from monitoring , claiming the rules would be too burdensome for smaller companies. But the Environmental Defense Fund found that https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/files/2021/11/MarginalWellFactsheet2021v2.pdf?_gl=11haopmt_gaMTcyMTA3MTQ0NS4xNTEyNzU3Nzg1_ga_2B3856Y9QWMTY2NDQ2MjUwNi4yNDIuMC4xNjY0NDYyNTA5LjU3LjAuMA.._ga_Q5CTTQBJD8MTY2NDQ2MjUwNy4yNDIuMC4xNjY0NDYyNTA5LjU4LjAuMA.. three-quarters of these wells are in fact owned by large companies that raked in an average gross revenue of $335 million in 2019. The EPA is also proposing to strengthen limits on "flaring," an industry practice of burning off methane that comes out of oil wells, converting it into carbon dioxide - which is still harmful to the climate, but less so in the short term. But flares regularly fail, and the less wasteful alternative is to capture that gas and sell it, so that if it's burned, it's at least creating usable energy. The new rules would require well operators to capture the gas unless they can prove it's not feasible or safe to do so. "While we are disappointed EPA did not propose an outright ban on oil and gas industry flaring," said Melissa Hornbein, a senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, "we are nonetheless encouraged by the draft rule's incisive measures to tackle leak detection and repair from all sources, including low-producing and abandoned wells." The third big change is a "super emitters program" that would authorize third parties that track methane leaks to notify companies when they detect big plumes and require companies to respond within a matter of days. Satellite companies like HYPERLINK https://res.cloudinary.com/diywkbi34/image/upload/v1656926003/Kayrros_Methane_Report_June_15_2022.pdf Kayrros regularly uncover high-volume methane leaks in the Permian Basin, an oil and gas field that spans West Texas and Southern New Mexico. To date that data has been used to shame companies - now it could be used for enforcement. The EPA says the rules would deliver an HYPERLINK https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/OIl%20and%20Gas%20Supplemental.%20Overview%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf estimated $3 billion worth of climate and health benefits per year , taking into account the costs of compliance. That includes preventing 36 million tons of methane from entering the atmosphere between now and 2030, the greenhouse gas equivalent of shutting down all the coal power plants in the U.S. for a year. The estimate also accounts for eliminating nearly 10 million tons of volatile organic compounds, chemical gases emitted by oil and gas infrastructure that can harm human health and contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone. Once put into effect, the rules would work in conjunction with a fee on methane emissions that was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, the climate bill Biden signed in August. Beginning in 2025, major offenders will be charged a fee of up to $1,500 for each excess ton of methane they release. In addition to strengthening regulations at home, Biden is also working to shore up international cooperation on methane. At last year's climate conference in Glasgow, the U.S. launched the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane emissions from all sources by 30 percent by 2030. At COP27 on Friday, the U.S., along with the European Union and a number of other partner countries, agreed to HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/joint-declaration-from-energy-importers-and-exporters-on-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-fossil-fuels/ develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions that would help create a market for "low methane-intensity natural gas." More than 130 countries signed on to the Global Methane Pledge, and dozens are expected to release more detailed plans to address methane at the conference. But the initiative has still failed to attract the three of the worst methane offenders in the world - Russia, India, and China. \</doc>

The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa issued the following news release on Dec. 9, 2022: "Supporting climate-smart development in Africa is extremely pertinent. Climate change is a looming threat to Africa. The continent is the most vulnerable region to climate disasters," Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Mauritius said at the conference opening. Prime Minister Jugnauth stressed how the rise in petroleum prices caused by the war in Ukraine should quicken Africa's motivation to shift away from fossil fuels and become self-sufficient in electricity production. "In order to face the challenges of climate change more effectively, Africa needs the support and assistance of development partners," he added. The largest pan-African economic meeting is being held under the theme "supporting climate-smart development in Africa." It is bringing together various stakeholders-- policymakers, climate experts, the private sector, researchers, and youth--to discuss and draft an action plan to support the low-carbon and climate-resilient development of Africa. In a speech read by Acting Chief Economist and Vice-President, Prof. Kevin Urama, the African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina underscored the urgency of Africa adapting to climate change. "Africa is suffering from the devastating effects of climate change, from droughts, floods, irregular rainfall, locusts, and armyworms, he said. "Supporting climate-smart, environmentally friendly development is one step in the right direction," he said. Estimates show that Africa suffers $7-15 billion per year in GDP losses to climate change, which are projected to rise to $45-50 billion per year by 2040. During COP27 , the African Development Bank and its partners launched the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa to speed up the development of green infrastructure in Africa. In her remarks, Assistant Administrator and Director of the Regional Bureau for Africa at the United Nations Development Programme, Ahunna Eziakonwa, emphasized that Africa's path to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be climate smart. "It is important to emphasize that Africa's path to attaining the SDGs must by climate-smart. Protecting the planet cannot be an option, it is an urgent priority, noted Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa. Speaking on the recently concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP 27 , she said: "While COP27 in Egypt did not achieve the drastic reduction in emissions that the world needs, it did see the establishment of funding arrangements for loss and damage." Ms Eziakonwa told participants about the new "Africa Minigrids" partnership between the Global Environment Facility, the United Nations Development Programme, the African Development Bank, and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Together they will support new solar battery mini-grid markets in 21 countries in Africa. Deputy Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Dr. Hanan Morsy observed that the theme of this year's conference provides the opportunities to digest and synthesize the discussions at COP 27 and propose recommendations for supporting climate-smart development in Africa. "Africa needs to close huge development gaps by investing substantially in key sectors such as energy, agriculture, transport, water, and cities, among others. These sectors are all very vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change," Morsy said. ECA is working with partners to support the development of just energy transition plans in many African countries, tapping the continent's abundant clean energy resources. It is also working with African Export-Import Bank, the Africa Finance Cooperation, the African Development Bank, and other partners to leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area to use Africa's abundant clean energy resources to transform the continent's minerals. The idea is to "support regional and global value chains related to the global drive for net zero emissions," Morsy said. The African Economic Conference is jointly hosted by the African Development Bank, the Economic Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Program.

Nov 08, 2022( DownWithTyranny: HYPERLINK https://www.downwithtyranny.com/downwithtyranny https://www.downwithtyranny.com/downwithtyranny Delivered by Newstex) By Thomas Neuburger There's so much to write about these days. I'd considered doing a comment on the upcoming Term of the U.S. Supreme Court, including this: The nightmarish Supreme Court case that could gut Medicaid[1] I still might; stay tuned. But the following takes the cake. As usual these days, this is two stories wrapped into one. Official COP27 It's big news in a small world that COP 27 is being held this week in the lovely Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. Sharm el-Sheikh, where UN climate luminaries will contemplate helping the victims of the wealthy world's climate violence For those not following the UN climate conference news  and let's face it, most people aren't  COP 27 is the 27th Conference of the Parties[2], i.e., those nations participating in the United Nations effort to stop global warming. These conferences happen every year, the rhetoric gets more and more desperate, and inaction piles on inaction like stones at a rockslide. Still, they try. There's something special about this year's event, though. The app. From the Guardian[3]: Fears mount that Cop27 app could be used by Egypt to surveil regime's criticsCybersecurity experts warn that official Cop27 climate app requires access to a user's location, photos and even emailsThere are mounting fears over the surveillance of delegates at the Cop27 [4] climate talks in Egypt, with cybersecurity experts warning that the official app for the talks requires access to a user's location, photos and even emails upon downloading it.The revelation, as more than 25,000 heads of state, diplomats, negotiators, journalists and activists from around the world gather at the climate summit that starts in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday, has raised concerns that Egypt's authoritarian regime will be able to use an official platform for a United Nations event to track and harass attendees and critical domestic voices.The official Cop27 [4] app, which has already been downloaded more than 5,000 times, requires sweeping permissions from users before it installs, including the ability for Egypt's ministry of communications and information technology to view emails, scour photos and determine users' locations, according to an expert who analysed it for the Guardian. That part's bad enough. That an official platform, UN-created (one supposes) and sanctioned, could be designed for surveillance is terrible. The big shock in the Guardian story  at least in the Guardian editor's mind  is that the evil Egyptian dictator is the beneficiary. This data could be used by Abdel Fatah al-Sisi's regime to further crack down on dissent in a country that already holds[5] about 65,000 political prisoners. Egypt has conducted a series of mass arrests[6] of people accused of being protesters in the lead-up to Cop27 and sought to vet and isolate any activists near the talks, which will see governments attempting to hammer out an agreement over dealing with the climate crisis. Focusing on the Wrong Perp? But does this focus on the wrong perp, the wrong evil surveiller? Note this: [Amr] Magdi [of Human Rights Watch] said ... that conferences like Cop27 are Â£n excellent chance from a security perspective for information gathering,' including for certain activists 'they want to know more about'. [emphasis added] Who's "they"? There's quite a lot in the piece about the super-surveillance of the Egyptian state; it's well worth your time to read it. But as you do, ask these questions: Who developed the app? (The article doesn't say.) Who at the U.N. approved the app? (More silence from the article.) If the U.N. developed the app, why put the surveillance capability in it? If the Egyptian government developed it, why did the U.N. accept it as official? At best, the U.N. let Egypt develop the app and rubber-stamped the result without considering its misuse. I consider that unlikely. At less-than-best, the U.N. let Egypt develop the app, knew how it would be abused, and said yes anyway as part of the deal that let them use the gorgeous resort town of Sharm el-Sheik as its 2022 venue. Egypt gets its spyware; the U.N. gets to host its climate-concerned luminaries in style (see above). But at the very worst, spying on delegates and attendees at climate conferences is becoming more and more normal, regardless of where they will be held, and the U.N. is on board with that. After all, the climate is getting worse by the year, noticeably enough that even the worst climate deniers have shifted tactics to climate delay instead[7]. Can you imagine, even in the Land of the Free, that the U.S. government wouldn't keep a close eye, a very close eye, on so-called 'eco-terrorists[8]' if a major event like this were held within its borders? Police regularly brutalize pipeline protesters[9] already. U.S. surveillance[10] of climate protesters is happening[10] today. All of this has already been normalized. If COP28 were hosted in Midtown Manhattan, don't you think every suspect cell phone in a 50-mile radius would be tracked[11] till the conference ended  and every cell phone, period, near the event? What easier way to do this than via an app? And if the U.N. sanctions the spying, all the better.

Nov 25, 2022( PA Pundits: HYPERLINK http://papundits.wordpress.com http://papundits.wordpress.com By Paul Driessen ~ As Americans give thanks this week for our many blessings, let us recall the Pilgrims' and Native Americans' primitive agricultural knowledge and technologies, the hunger and disease that were constants in their lives - and how so many around the world are not much better off today. Much of Africa still lives on the edge, with well over 600 million people not even having electricity. Many parts of India, Asia and Latin America also face serious energy and food deprivation. Incredibly, so does Europe. 'German industry stares into the Net Zero abyss,' 'Europe's energy crisis may get even worse next year,' 'Even Germany's wind industry is sliding into crisis,' 'Millions face poverty and destitution in Green Britain, as Brits pay highest electricity bills in world,' headlines warn. Banning Russian gas imports amid Putin's war on Ukraine plays a role and is frequently scapegoated. But the primary cause is Europe's love affair with intermittent wind and solar, and hate-fest for fossil fuels and nuclear, amid frigid winter realities that have caused Germany to obliterate ancient villages and recent-vintage wind farms to mine lignite coal beneath them. Closer to home, New England[1] and New York also face a cold, dark winter[2], because they too have voted against drilling, fracking, pipelines, coal and nuclear power - and now demand more oil and gas from the same companies that they and President Biden want to drive into oblivion. However, the greatest hypocrisy of all was on full-throated display at the COP-27 climate circus in Egypt November 6-18 - where attendees kept asking whether Africa should be allowed to exploit its oil, natural gas and coal reserves to improve living standards, feed families and save lives! Al Gore[3] preached that fossil fuel investments should be terminated worldwide, including in Africa. UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres absurdly asserted that 'New funding for fossil fuel exploration and production is delusional' and will only 'feed the scourge of war, pollution and climate catastrophe' (the manmade cataclysms found in computer models and COP-27 rants, though not in the Real World[4]). At the COP-27 Even worse, it's not just energy these arrogant eco-totalitarians want to obstruct in Africa and other developing regions. It's also modern fertilizers  indeed, all aspects of modern agriculture - everything that can actually help farmers feed hungry people and make enough money to build a home or barn, send their children to school, and buy tractors and other equipment. They don't even want Africa producing natural gas and using it to make nitrogen fertilizer, which dramatically boosts crop yields[6] and is absolutely essential if the world is to feed eight billion people - especially without turning millions more acres of wildlife habitat into marginal croplands. Poor countries are no long going to tolerate this outrageous, intolerable, racist neo-colonialism. Nor should they, especially when they realize now-rich countries are on the verge of de-industrialization and bankruptcy - and have neither the intention nor ability to shell out billions, much less trillions[7], of dollars in annual 'reparation, loss and damage' payments for alleged impacts from manmade climate change. So when the UN, now-rich countries and eco-pressure groups tell them there'll be no financing for fossil fuels and modern agriculture - only for wind and solar energy, organic farming and 'AgroEcology' - poor countries should just tell these purveyors of poverty, hunger, disease and death to buzz off. That would leave poor countries largely on their own. But they have numerous advantages that their predecessors lacked: access to the incredible energy, agricultural, industrial, economic, medical, communication and other advances of recent centuries[8], especially during the fossil-fueled industrial era. They simply need to chart their own destinies and utilize these advances. Every project they undertake will generate new wealth, innovation and self-confidence to undertake subsequent projects. I've written about these callous eco-imperialists - these financiers and merchants of death - many times (here[9], here[10], here[11] and here[12], for example). Unfortunately, they never repent, never revise their lethal attitudes and policies. The global following they enjoy underscores how the ill-informed but well-intended really are led around by the well-informed but ill-intended - on climate, energy, agriculture and human rights. Their AgroEcology schemes reject virtually the entire foundation of modern agriculture, which feeds feed billions of people with less acreage and water, using monoculture farming, carefully developed and tested chemical fertilizers and insecticides, biotechnology, hybrid seeds and mechanized equipment. Instead, they demand 'food sovereignty' - the 'right' to 'culturally appropriate' food produced through 'ecologically sound and sustainable methods, in accord with AgroEcology policies - the kind that brought hunger and chaos to Sri Lanka[13]. They even vilify Golden Rice[14], which could end Vitamin A Deficiency, blindness and death among malnourished children. Could the insanity and hypocrisy get any worse? Sadly - yes. European leaders have been pleading with African nations to launch oil, gas and coal projects - for shipment to Europe. In their next breath, the EU Commission says supporting nitrogen fertilizer production[15] in Africa would 'clash' with EU climate goals. The International Energy Agency worries that half of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has no access to electricity. In its next breath, the IEA says stopping planetary overheating doesn't allow for more African petroleum production[16]. Even more colonialist, Time magazine promotes the notion that 'humans eating insects could help save the planet.' The New York Times extolls a new Julia Child 'Joy of Cooking (Insects).' And a group of 'renowned' African and European 'ecology and nutrition experts' says climate change and other considerations make Africa 'the perfect laboratory' for testing new ways to feed humanity - like turning lake flies[17] from the Lake Victoria region into 'crackers, muffins, meat loaves and sausages.' COP-27 (or FLOP-27[18]) claims to have reached another 'historic milestone[19]' in saving Planet Earth[20]! But it's all driven by unfounded hysteria about manmade climate cataclysms. Let's all take a deep breath. We certainly face climate fluctuations[21] and extreme weather events - but no worse than in the past, and with no replicable, convincing evidence that manmade emissions have replaced natural forces. More importantly, we have far greater wealth, far more knowledge, far better technologies and resources than in the past - to help us adapt to climate changes, survive extreme weather events and rebuild afterward. That's infinitely preferable to blanketing the Earth with wind turbines, solar panels, battery modules, transmission lines, mines and factories to build the things - and processing plants to make bug burgers and other delicacies, in time for climate luminaries to enjoy them at COP-28. Can't we just be calm and rational (and thus colonialist?[22]) just this once? Just asking. Paul Driessen[23] is senior policy advisor for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)[24].

The following information was released by NYC Health + Hospitals: Biden Administration officials at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) highlight the health system's efforts Nov 11, 2022 NYC Health + Hospitals was celebrated by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) for its pledge to help decarbonize the health care sector and make health care facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. At a NYC Health + Hospital/Lincoln event on May 12, Mitchell Katz, MD, President and CEO, joined Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Rachel Levine, MD to pledge that the health system would formally commit to pursuing the Biden Administration's climate goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. "I was proud to join the Admiral in May to pledge our commitment to lowering our emissions," said Dr. Katz. "Since 2006 we have reduced our overall emissions in our facilities by over 30 percent, and as we approach 2030 we will go even further. We have a lot of work to do, but we are leading the way in NYC." "HHS returns this year to COP27 to report great progress," said ADM Levine. "Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector." One hundred two prominent health organizations in the US have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including health systems representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more. Federal systems like the Indian Health Service (IHS), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Military Health System (MHS) are working together to meet similar goals to those these private sector organizations have embraced. Combined, this means that over 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing over 15 percent of US hospitals. About NYC Health + Hospitals NYC Health + Hospitals is the largest municipal health care system in the nation. We are a network of 11 hospitals, trauma centers, neighborhood health centers, nursing homes, and post-acute care centers. We are a home care agency and a health plan, MetroPlus.

(TNSrpt) -- Environment and Climate Change Canada issued the following news release on Nov. 16, 2022: United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ) winds up, Canada is urging the international community to continue collaborating to address the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Today, during Biodiversity Day COP27 , the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, announced that Canada is investing up to $855,000 to ensure that not-for-profit environmental groups and Indigenous partners can fully participate in the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (COP15), taking place in Montreal from December 7-19, 2022. Over fifty groups will receive the funding, which is being coordinated by the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, to support their participation in the lead up to the Nature COP and facilitate many important events that will be accessible to the general public. The announcement comes as the Minister has been actively engaged in a number of high-profile events at COP27 dealing with nature and biodiversity, including a Canadian co-hosted ministerial meeting, Biodiversity Action (MoBA) at COP27 | A Final Push on the Road to COP15, attended by representatives from over twenty-five countries. Minister Guilbeault has also been conducting many bilateral meetings with partner countries with the message that conserving nature and halting the alarming biodiversity loss are fundamental in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Canada is taking a strong leadership role, along with international partners, in championing the development of an ambitious framework with clear targets and actions that also recognize the important role Indigenous peoples and communities play in conservation and biodiversity. Delegates from 196 countries are expected to gather in Montreal for COP15. Canada continues to make progress on the goal toward thirty percent by 2030, having launched the largest conservation campaign in the country's history, backed by multi-billion dollar investments in Budget 2018 and Budget 2021, available to the provinces and territories. Canada has also committed to ensuring that at least twenty percent of its $5.3 billion climate finance commitment supports projects that leverage nature-based climate solutions and contribute biodiversity co-benefits in developing countries over the next five years. Quotes "Climate and nature are two sides of the same coin. The call to protect nature must receive the same attention as does the climate. Coming out of COP27 , Canada is excited to welcome the world to Montreal for the Nature COP to come together and land commitments that will protect the natural environment that sustains us all. We are going to ensure the full participation of civil society groups, environmental groups, and Indigenous partners at COP15, because we know the importance of their work and their voices. I've been able to rally support from many countries at a number of events at COP27 , with the hopes of an ambitious global framework to protect biodiversity to come out of Montreal. For Canada's part, we're driving progress to reach our commitment of protecting thirty percent of our land and thirty percent of our oceans by 2030. To get there, we have launched the greatest conservation campaign in the country's history, fueled by multi-billion dollar investments available to the provinces and territories." - The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts  The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society is a well-known, nation-wide organization with a strong history of involvement in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and biodiversity-related program delivery in partnership with the Government of Canada.  The Government of Canada invested $1.3 billion into the Nature Legacy Program in Budget 2018, and $2.3 billion for the Enhanced Nature Legacy Program in Budget 2021.  The Fifteenth Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity will focus on a new Global Biodiversity Framework to guide the world's collective efforts to protect nature and halt biodiversity loss around the globe.  There is an urgent need for international partners to halt and reverse the alarming loss of biodiversity worldwide. Canada will continue to advocate for international collaboration on an ambitious post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, including targeting thirty percent of land and oceans conserved by 2030.  In 2021, Canada doubled its climate finance commitment to $5.3 billion over five years. One of the focus areas of its implementation is nature-based solutions and biodiversity. For example, Canada is providing $15 million to support the Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance to enhance resilience to climate change through nature-based solutions, and the Global Fund for Coral Reefs, to support international efforts to conserve and restore coral reefs.

Let them eat cake," famously attributed to Marie Antoinette by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, has become universal shorthand for a monarch's total disregard for her famished citizens stealing and wreaking havoc in the streets to survive. World leaders are making the same faux pas this week at their opulent stay in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for COP27 , the United Nations ' climate change conference . While they eat the best food in the world and enjoy luxurious tourism opportunities, they will leave the conference telling billions of people that the only way to combat the "climate crisis" is to stop eating meat, stop production of fossil fuel-based fertilizer, and, well, stop eating entirely. The Malthusian climate cult isn't about saving the world - it's all about depopulation. When the world gets tired of the lies and energy poverty, will those leaders want a "climate amnesty," like the pandemic amnesty now desperately sought by U.S. leaders who shut down schools? Probably. But they don't deserve it. Nearly eight billion people will be affected by the COP27 convention. Of those, 800 million people still live in dire poverty without access to any electricity. 3.3 billion people have access to less electricity than the average American refrigerator. While the 30,000 globalist elites bend the knee to the false god of the net-zero agenda, billions face hunger and lack of fuel needed to keep warm this winter. This scarcity is driven by the decarbonization agenda that has permeated the political elite class around the world. The media and world leaders have framed people as "the enemy" of the planet. This inhumane messaging has been so effective that there is a huge following of young people who truly believe they have no future and will do anything they are told. This includes sitting in the streets blocking ambulances to protest, throwing soup and pies at priceless paintings, gluing themselves to any surface, and repeating objectively false propaganda. They've drunk the Kool-Aid, not realizing the policies they promote will destroy lives without affecting the climate in the slightest. Despite this, countries - developed and undeveloped - have jumped on the climate bandwagon and are demanding trillions of dollars for climate finance and reparations. Africa's political elite may welcome the bribes, but the governed should be forewarned. Germany declared that it would get rid of fossil fuels and become 100% renewable, but after spending $500 billion over 20 years, fossil fuels went from supplying 86% to 79% of the country's energy - a tiny shift hardly worth the massive cost. With looming threats of rolling blackouts come winter all across Europe, and wintertime freezing deaths on the rise, it would seem German energy producers are waking up. Reports earlier this month that efforts to boost energy supply included demolishing a wind farm to get to the coal underneath. All over the news this past week has been the left's call for "pandemic amnesty" after all the mistakes they made during the COVID-19 pandemic. A final plea before the election, they were scrambling to rebrand their plot for power as honest mistakes. But they weren't just mistakes; they ruined the lives and livelihoods of millions by shutting down businesses, mandating experimental vaccines, and seeking power and control through every avenue they could. Now they just want us to forgive and forget, and though we may forgive, we will never forget. We can't forget because we can't let it happen again. And yet, the left is actively conducting the same power grab under the guise of the "climate crisis," prioritizing the planet over human lives. Liberal world leaders currently calling for net-zero carbon emissions may find themselves fleeing from their countries when their climate policies backfire. That's what happened to the former president of Sri Lanka, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was the first candidate in the world to run on a net-zero campaign and the first to show us from start to finish what net-zero policies do to a country. They took a country from prosperity to poverty, not over decades, but in just one year. After banning the use and importation of nitrogen-based fertilizers, food production dropped 50% and prices increased 80%, impoverishing millions. Globalist political leaders demonizing affordable, reliable energy from fossil fuels and nuclear may find themselves on the road begging for amnesty when their people weary of freezing and starving. Out of one side of their mouths, leaders say people need to stop flying and eating meat. Yet they plan their next extravagant trips to pontificate from their private jets. The Bill Gateses and Taylor Swifts of the world are wealthy enough that paying for expensive energy, and going vegan won't affect their lives. The rest of us - especially those still suffering from energy poverty in developing nations - won't be so lucky.

It\\x92s finally over. After the anticipation and build-up to COP27 , the biggest climate meeting of the year is now in our rear-view mirror. The crowds of delegates that thronged the Sharm el-Sheikh international convention center for two long weeks have all headed home to recover. Many will be fatigued from long hours and sleepless nights as negotiators tried to seal a deal that would move the world forwards. Did all this hard work pay off? In our opinion, COP 27 was both better and worse than we\\x92d hoped. Failing to Follow the Science First, the bad news. COP 27 failed to deliver what the science tells us was needed. With the window of opportunity closing fast on our goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C or less, COP 27 did far too little on the all-important issue of mitigation\\x97that is, cutting emissions. The case for urgent action keeps getting stronger. The latest reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make for grim reading about what to expect if we let temperatures rise too much. Nowadays, though, we just need to read the newspapers to catch a glimpse of the future. The head of the key negotiating Group of 77 \\x96 134 developing countries \\x96 was Pakistan which has been dealing with the worst floods in its history, leaving 1717 people dead and dealing an estimated $US40 billion in damage. In 2022 in the USA, there were 15 climate-related disasters which each exceeded $1 billion in costs. Meanwhile, in Africa, according to Carbon Brief\\x92s analysis of disaster records, \\x93extreme weather events have killed at least 4,000 people and affected a further 19 million since the start of 2022.\\x94 The pressure was therefore on at COP 27 to respond to such disasters. Attending COP27 were 112 world leaders and over 300 government ministers: not as many as at COP 26, but still a good number. Something like 27,000 people from governments, intergovernmental, stakeholders, and journalists also attended the COP. This was to the backdrop of the UN Secretary General warning us that we needed to "cooperate or perish,\\x94 to take urgent action to take us off "a highway to climate hell". Messing up on mitigation: And yet progress on mitigation was modest, at best. While some delegations pushed hard for stronger commitments on cutting emissions, the appetite in some quarters just didn\\x92t seem to be there. After being pressured to do more in Paris and Glasgow, China, India, and some of the oil-producing countries appeared reluctant to take much more in Sharm el-Sheikh. They feel developed countries, which are historically responsible for the bulk of emissions, should be doing more themselves, rather than coercing others. The result was a negotiated outcome with little more on the table than we had in Glasgow. For instance, delegates could not agree to ramp up their language on fossil fuels, much to many people\\x92s disappointment. Finance: Likewise, there was not too much to report on the issue of climate finance. The $US100 billion annual support for developing countries initially promoted by Hilary Clinton at the 2009 Copenhagen COP and enshrined in the Paris COP in 2015 will be reviewed in 2024 with a new figure being hopefully agreed then for 2025 implementation. The Global South has been talking of this new sum numbering in the trillions to help adapt and mitigate against climate change. And yet there were few signs of movement towards anything of that magnitude. Given that the North has still not met its pledge of US$100 billion by 2020, it\\x92s clear a lot of movement is needed in the next couple of years. Yet news from outside the conference, such as the US House of Representatives now having a Republican majority, does not bode well. For a meeting billed as the \\x93implementation COP\\x94 where climate action was taken to another level, the news on mitigation and finance was therefore disappointing. Just prior to the start of COP27 the lead negotiator for Egypt Mohamed Nasr underscored: \\x93science reports were telling us that yes, planning is not up to expectations, but it was implementation on the ground that was really lagging behind.\\x94 Exceeding Expectations\\x97the Loss and Damage Fund Perhaps most surprising was the agreement to create a \\x91Loss and Damage\\x92 fund to help the most vulnerable countries. This has been a key issue for almost 30 years, particularly for small island developing countries. In Glasgow this looked very unlikely to be resolved in the Sharm COP, but with a late change of heart by the Europeans and eventually by the USA and others in the OECD, this is perhaps the most significant and surprising outcome from COP 27 . Even as recently as October, the signs were that OECD countries were not on board with calls for a new fund. However, at COP 27 the \\x93trickle\\x94 of earlier action in this area turned into a flood. Interestingly, it was Scotland at COP 26 that started things off, with a modest, voluntary contribution. More recently, Denmark, Austria, New Zealand and Belgium had also financial commitments to loss and damage, now amounting to $US244.5 million. Mia Mottley Barbados\\x92 Prime Minister has called for a 10% windfall tax on oil companies to fund loss and damage caused by climate change, which could raise around $US31 billion if it had been introduced for 2022. Still, the signs a fund would be agreed at COP 27 had not been good. This makes the final outcome all the more welcome. The idea, the door is now open for the most vulnerable countries to receive more support. A goal has now been set to fully operationalize the fund at COP 28 in a year\\x92s time. For the most vulnerable nations, this cannot come quickly enough. Global Goal on Adaptation: Another positive development, albeit on a more modest scale, was in the area of the \\x91Global Goal on Adaptation\\x92. Here, delegates agreed to \\x93initiate the development of a framework\\x94 to be available for adoption next year. A lot of work will need to be done at the intersessional meeting of the UN Climate Convention\\x92s subsidiary bodies in Bonn in June next year to prepare for this, including how to measure progress towards this Goal. An approach similar to the development of the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 might be appropriate, perhaps? Article 6: Another of the Glasgow breakthroughs was that on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on carbon markets and international cooperation. COP 27 saw some solid work undertaken on how to operationalize this both in market and non-market approaches. There are still a lot of sceptics on this will have a genuine impact and how to ensure not double counting or even that any offsets are real. An approach that is more ecosystem-based than just trees is gaining momentum. Such a change, if it happens, also offers a real chance to link the two major UN conventions on climate and biodiversity. Agriculture: The work on the Koronivia Work Programme on Agriculture went down to the wire. The outcome was a four-year open-ended working group reporting at COP31 (2026). Some controversy on the term \\x91food systems\\x92 may see its first workshop address this issue. It will also look at how we can better integrate the programme\\x92s work into other constituted bodies such as the financial mechanisms of the convention. The Green Climate Fund has given only $US1.1 billion for adaptation on agriculture. It says one of the major reasons for this is the: \\x93Lack of integrated agricultural development planning and capacities that consider maladaptation risks and investment needs across the agricultural sector, climate information services and supply chains.\\x94 Coalitions of the Willing: One of the outcomes from the Glasgow COP was the launch of \\x91Coalitions of the Willing\\x92; groups of countries and stakeholders wanting to move quicker on an issue than they might under the official UN negotiations, which are consensus-driven and involve more than 190 countries. In Sharm el-Sheikh we saw a number of countries join the Methane Pledge, including Australia and Egypt. China joined the meeting on the Pledge and committed to its own national methane strategy. In Glasgow, 137 countries had taken a landmark step forward by committing to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. With the imminent return to leadership in Brazil of President-elect Lula da Silva, there is renewed hope that real action on the Amazon forests is possible again. Lula committed Brazil to reaching zero deforestation and was hailed as a hero by many when he turned up at COP 27 during the second week. Meanwhile, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)\\x97the global coalition of leading financial institutions\\x97committed to accelerating the decarbonization of the economy. GFANZ, which includes over 550 of the world\\x92s leading financial institutions, has committed to reduce their financed emissions in line with 1.5 degrees C. With $US150 trillion of combined balance sheets, the accountability mechanism announced of a new Net-Zero Data Public Utility is yet to prove if it is effective in holding the finance sector to their commitments. However, if it can deliver on its potential, this could be a game changer. There was plenty more activity at COP 27 where the results are harder to measure. Most people at these large UN climate summits are not negotiators and COP 27 was full of \\x93side events\\x94 and government and stakeholder pavilions each with its own set of events and agendas. Ideas were shared, connections made, and partnerships for further action shared. The upshot of all of this activity is hard to measure, but probably considerable. The thematic days organized by the Egyptian Presidency also gave space to these issues and helped bring together ideas that may ultimately find their way into future UN decisions. In this respect, too, the quality of the side events and pavilions at COP 27 exceeded our expectations. On to Dubai and COP28 Was COP27 a success or failure? When it comes to keeping up with the science, the answer can hardly be positive. The call to \\x93keep 1.5 alive\\x94 hangs in the balance and is still on \\x93life support\\x94. In that sense, COP 27 had very little impact on our current trajectory, which is a likely warming of 2.4-2.8 C by the end of the century. On the other hand, the promise of a loss and damage fund, as well as modest successes on adaptation, Article 6, agriculture, and actions outside the official negotiations, mean COP 27 delivered some bright spots of success. Looking ahead to next year, COP 28 will be important as it marks the first \\x93global stocktake\\x94 to judge where things now stand. We hope this will focus world leaders to increase their pledges (or \\x93nationally determined contributions\\x94) significantly. It will be interesting to see how the United Arab Emirates, as COP 28 host, performs. As a major oil producer, it faces some serious challenges in transitioning to a net zero world. At COP 27 \</doc>

Conspiracy, denialism, and misleading narratives are running amok on social media. World leaders trying to craft effective policies and solutions are not just fighting climate change, they're fighting a radical minority that gets amplified by Big Tech. The data points are everywhere: On HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/elon-musk?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships Elon Musk 's new HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships Twitter "hellscape" (his HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585619322239561728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1585619322239561728%7Ctwgr%5E1bc87b41418dbba5abdea62fac2918460e9f7171%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2022%2F10%2F27%2Felon-musk-tells-advertisers-that-twitter-cannot-become-a-free-for-all-hellscape%2F words , not ours), a basic search for "climate" returns "#climatescam" as one of the top results. Social media accounts that posted U.S. election-related conspiracies also shared climate conspiracies, with the highest engagement content found on Twitter, where Republican figures call climate change and green energy a failure, hoax, and scam. Furthermore, HYPERLINK https://caad.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/issue-5.w.pdf new \~ HYPERLINK network analysis shows that top-performing posts that discussed ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing are linked to an ongoing "anti-woke" campaign and have now fully merged with conservative networks that push everything from transphobia to "stop the steal" to anti-vaccine disinformation. Starting at HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cop26?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships COP26 in Glasgow last year, our team of analysts HYPERLINK https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/deny-deceive-delay-documenting-and-responding-to-climate-disinformation-at-cop26-and-beyond-full/ outlined the most prevalent climate disinformation narratives. Climate disinformation not only took the form of outright denial, but it also morphed into additional, more subtle tactics, such as attacking renewables and building climate into the GOP's culture wars. Even more effective than saying "climate change isn't real" was "climate change is real, but the solutions on the table are too expensive or disruptive." Despite these clearly mapped threats, not enough is being done by social media platforms. HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/google?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships Google , HYPERLINK Facebook , and Twitter profit from climate disinformation and drive its business model. Efforts to push for greater content moderation and transparency around the harms caused by their products consistently fall on deaf ears. Companies have taken some action in the past year. Twitter announced a new policy to demonetize climate disinformation, but with Musk now at the helm of Twitter and threatening disinformation HYPERLINK https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3723094-twitter-confusion-misinformation-policies/ moderation , it's one step forward and three steps back. Google pledged it would prohibit users from profiting off climate denial, but new research shows that HYPERLINK https://foe.org/news/dewey-ad-report/ half of all climate denial sites are supported by Google . Facebook announced expanded climate information programs at COP26, but HYPERLINK https://www.isdglobal.org/isd-publications/deny-deceive-delay-documenting-and-responding-to-climate-disinformation-at-cop26-and-beyond-full/ our analysis found that those were outgunned by the disinformers on their own platform by a factor of 12. If we want a shot at a livable future, social media companies should be vigilant about how vulnerable the COP27 negotiations are to disinformation. One example is the conference's "loss and damage" discussion being HYPERLINK https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2022/11/07/cop-27-britain-opens-door-climate-change-reparations-poorer/ falsely equated with Denialists are HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/darrengrimes_/status/1589320503088795651 p \~ HYPERLINK ointing fingers at other crises such as the U.K.'s cost-of-living crisis in order to downplay climate change, as though the issues were up for competition. False narratives continue to circulate the claim that the planet needs the fossil fuel industry because it provides "energy security," when its emissions and historic greenwashing are responsible for the crisis in the first place. Much of this content flows completely unchecked by platforms. World governments and social media companies must stop this madness. Musk and Big Tech leaders prioritize their profit over real-life harms done to the public and the planet. Critical voices of climate scientists, climate activists, and those impacted by climate injustice are being drowned out by falsehoods and conspiracies that flourish on their platforms. There are simple, fair, and concrete ideas to stop this artificial spread of climate disinformation. First, social media companies must strengthen their content moderation policies around climate disinformation and hate speech, at COP27 and beyond. Most companies have some form of community standards, but these need to be stronger, enforced, and made fully transparent. No more free passes from the Facebook " HYPERLINK https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/21/facebook-xcheck-system-oversight-board-review XCheck " system that lets elite climate disinformers off the hook. No more Musk antics saying he promotes "accurate" information and then threatening advertisers who want safety standards. Policies that demonetize false and misleading content are essential to curbing the impact of bad actors. This applies to issues from climate change to the protection of trans youth to the rise of white nationalists. Policymakers should step up worldwide. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change HYPERLINK https://techpolicy.press/latest-ipcc-reports-underscore-threat-of-climate-disinformation/ mentioned climate disinformation as a threat to climate action in one of its most recent reports, but the HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/united-nations?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must now include concrete measures to both recognize and fight climate disinformation in the final agreement at COP27 . HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/eu?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships EU policymakers should make sure the HYPERLINK https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act-ensuring-safe-and-accountable-online-environment_en Digital Services Act's , HYPERLINK https://techpolicy.press/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/dsosa_final.pdf DSOSA ) to increase transparency and accountability from Big Tech. Every year when nations meet at COP, they see how difficult it is to address the climate crisis. Let's not let the spread of climate disinformation make it harder. If we're not more vigilant, the disinformation will continue to harm and divide us all.

The following information was released by the Government of India: by PIB Delhi The Union Minister of Environment Forest and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav addressed the special United Nations Country Team (UNCT) on the key themes and takeaways from CoP 27 at UN House, today. The meeting was followed by the inauguration of the Climate Change Photo Exhibition with the Swiss Embassy at the UN House in New Delhi. Mr Shombi Sharp, United Nations Resident Coordinator in India, congratulated the Government of India on its vitally important contributions made at the recently concluded CoP 27 at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. He remarked that Indias bold leadership on the climate agenda, and the innovative solutions increasingly emerging from government and private sector partners in India, are a beacon to the world for a more sustainable, just and equitable global future. In his address to the special UNCT meeting, Shri Bhupender Yadav said: Ladies and Gentlemen, I am happy to be amongst you all in this special meeting with UN Country team which focuses on key takeaways and outcomes from recently concluded COP 27 . I have just returned from COP27 and I am sure you would have followed its proceedings and read its outcomes. It was an implementation COP with a headline outcome on funding arrangements including a dedicated loss and damage fund. Today, I would like to hear your views on your approach to operationalize the COP27 outcomes in India, in keeping with our National Development Priorities. At COP26 in Glasgow, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi shared his vision of LiFE Lifestyles for Environment as a key approach to promoting sustainability and combating climate change. Since then, much work has been done to translate this vision into a plan of action. Mission LiFE was conceptualized to take forward this message to the global community. The UNSG has reinforced the importance of Mission LiFE, by participating in its launch event on 20th October at Kevadia, with PM Shri Narendra Modi. I am glad to share that the cover decision of COP-27 , called Sharm el-Sheikh implementation plan, notes the importance of transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production for efforts to combat climate change. India seeks to involve a billion people in this global mass movement of Mission LiFE. We made a start, with several LiFE related events at the India Pavilion during COP27 . I appreciate the involvement of UNEP and UNDP in these events. One immediate task ahead is to create a LiFE compendium of global best practices on sustainable lifestyles. This will be a comprehensive repository containing best practices from around the world. I understand that UN INDIA is already working with NITI Aayog and MoEFCC in this regard. There could be many other ways to roll out the COP27 decision on transition to sustainable lifestyles. For example, UN India could consider organising a global conference on Mission LiFE during Indias G20 Presidency. Many UN agencies are implementing agencies under GEF and some are also accredited entities under GCF. We are now preparing a shelf of projects for the GEF 8 cycle. I expect that outcomes of COP27 on sustainable lifestyles, climate action in agriculture, mitigation work program and just transition would be factored in appropriately, in the upcoming projects. COP27 has established a 4-year work program on climate action in agriculture and food security. Agriculture, the mainstay of livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers, will be hard hit from climate change. We look at the agriculture sector primarily as a sector for adaptation and building climate resilience. We should not burden our smallholder farmers and pastoralists with mitigation responsibilities. FAO, in particular, may note that India has kept mitigation in agriculture out of its NDCs. COP27 has also established a work program on just transition. For most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonisation, but with low-carbon development. Developing countries retain the right to choose their energy mix and in achieving the SDGs. Just transition is not just an issue for individual countries, it is also about a global just transition. Developed countries taking the lead in climate action is therefore a very important aspect of the global just transition. At COP27 UN agencies anchor many environment conventions and treaties. I would insist that the UN system remains steadfast in the protection of foundational principles of each of these conventions and treaties in its work in different countries. For India, the principles of equity and CBDR-RC in the light of national circumstances remains, paramount. I urge you to ensure that these foundational principles are respected when you prepare projects for implementation in India. Red-tapism is the bane of all bureaucracies and I am afraid it does not spare the UN system either. Many reporting requirements under the multilateral environment conventions and treaties are funded through GEF projects. I am given to understand that three critical projects on fulfilling reporting requirements under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement have not yet taken off, even one year after its approval by GEF. Such delays are strictly avoidable. The concerned UN agency may kindly take note, and I request that these projects may definitely be launched in the coming month. With these thoughts, I thank you for organising this interaction and I look forward to hearing your views. \</doc>

Atlanta, Nov. 09, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASHRAE, along with 23 of the world\' s leading building industry organizations issued a statement to government representatives attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) pledging to assume a leadership role in decarbonization efforts in the built environment. The organizations are signatories of the Building Industry Steps Up to Address Climate Change \- a statement to government representatives that are parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changes (UNFCCC), expressing a collective commitment to meeting 1.5\'b0C Paris Agreement targets. In a video presentation, 2022-23 ASHRAE President Farooq Mehboob, Fellow Life Member ASHRAE, presented a roadmap for addressing climate change, reading directly from the statement.  The buildings that we live and work in are responsible for approximately 40% of total global direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, said Mehboob.  The built environment is therefore one of the leading drivers of climate change. Simultaneously, making changes to how and what we build is one of our most effective tools for mitigating and adapting to climate change and places a great responsibility on the built environment industry. This is a responsibility we earnestly accept. Signatories demonstrated their support of the statement.  Collaboration across the buildings industry is critical to enable and accelerate progress on climate goals. This shared statement communicates to engineers around the globe that their work matters; and our collective commitment to leadership in decarbonizing the built environment engages them in the global effort to address the devasting impacts of climate change. USGBC is pleased to work with ASHRAE and other partner organizations to support the many engineers and building professionals on the front lines, making the case to their clients to push their designs to go further to decarbonize. - Peter Templeton, President and CEO, U.S. Green Building Council Government leaders from around the world are convening for climate negotiations at COP27 ,\~November 6-18 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. ASHRAE leadership will participate in a COP 27 Official Side Event on November 16 titled  Planning, Design and Development in the Global South: The \' How To\' for People + Planet.

(TNSrpt) -- The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change issued the following news release on Nov. 6, 2022: The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 opened today with the key aim of ensuring full implementation of the Paris Agreement. Discussions at COP27 begin near the end of a year that has seen devastating floods and unprecedented heat waves, severe droughts and formidable storms, all unequivocal signs of the unfolding climate emergency. At the same time, millions of people throughout the world are confronting the impacts of simultaneous crises in energy, food, water and cost of living, aggravated by severe geopolitical conflicts and tensions. In this adverse context, some countries have begun to stall or reverse climate policies and doubled down on fossil fuel use. COP27 is also taking place against the backdrop of inadequate ambition to curb greenhouse gas emissions. According to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, CO2 emissions need to be cut 45% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels to meet the central Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. This is crucial to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall. A report published by UN Climate Change ahead of COP27 shows that whilst countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward, efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Since COP26 in Glasgow, only 29 out of 194 countries came forward with tightened national plans. "With the Paris Rulebook essentially concluded thanks to COP26 in Glasgow last year, the litmus test of this and every future COP is how far deliberations are accompanied by action. Everybody, every single day, everywhere in the world, needs to do everything they possibly can to avert the climate crisis," said UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell. " COP27 sets out a new direction for a new era of implementation: where outcomes from the formal and informal process truly begin to come together to drive greater climate progress - and accountability for that progress," Mr. Stiell said. In his opening address, the UN Climate Change Executive Secretary asked governments to focus on three critical areas at COP27 . The first is a transformational shift to implementation of the Paris Agreement and putting negotiations into concrete actions. The second is cementing progress on the critical workstreams of mitigation, adaptation, finance and loss and damage, while stepping up finance notably to tackle the impacts of climate change. The third is enhancing the delivery of the principles of transparency and accountability throughout the UN Climate Change process.    COP27 Presidency vision based on human needs The Egyptian COP27 Presidency has set out an ambitious vision for this COP that puts human needs at the heart of our global efforts to address climate change. The Presidency intends to focus the world's attention on key elements that address some of the most fundamental needs of people everywhere, including water security, food security, health and energy security. Sameh Shoukry, Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 President said: "We're gathering this year at a time when global climate action is at a watershed moment. Multilateralism is being challenged by geopolitics, spiraling prices, and growing financial crises, while several countries battered by the pandemic have barely recovered, and severe and depleting climate change-induced disasters are becoming more frequent. COP27 creates a unique opportunity in 2022 for the world to unite, to make multilateralism work by restoring trust and coming together at the highest levels to increase our ambition and action in fighting climate change. COP27 must be remembered as the 'Implementation COP' - the one where we restore the grand bargain that is at the centre of the Paris Agreement."    Highlights of COP27 Following a procedural opening on Sunday, 6 November, to enable work to begin quickly, Monday and Tuesday will be the World Leaders Summit with the presence of Royalty and more than 100 Heads of State or Government. The World Leaders Summit provides all Heads of State or Government with the opportunity to set the stage for COP27 . The two days will include the Sharm el-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit and will feature important High-Level Side Events. Other Key Events A number of key Ministerial and other events around current climate change efforts will take place during the COP. These include a first ministerial round table on pre-2030 ambition and continued discussions on the global stocktake - a process for countries and stakeholders to see where they're collectively making progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement - and where they're not. These discussions got underway at the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June 2022 and will pick up where they left off at COP27 . Together, all events provide Ministers and participants with a space to have frank and open discussions on progress made to date. A High-Level Segment mostly attended by Ministers will take place in the second week of the COP, from 15-18 November.    Global Climate Action COP27 . The COP27 Presidency will host a series of events in thematic days from 9-17 November which will highlight practical solutions to the challenge of climate change and explore approaches to immediately scale up the implementation of these solutions in key sectors with all stakeholders. Under the guidance of two high-level climate Champions, Nigel Topping (UK) and Mahmoud Mohieldin (Egypt) progress, plans and targets for a range of sectors and initiatives will be presented in dozens of events in the Climate Action Zone in COP. These events will focus on the overarching theme of turning climate pledges into climate action in pursuit of net-zero emissions, enhanced resilience for the most vulnerable, and aligning financial flows with these goals. In addition, UNFCCC supported sectoral initiatives in sectors such as sports, fashion, tourism, events and aviation and will announce higher ambition and increased collaboration to align these sectors with the 1.5 degree Celsius target of the Paris Agreement.    Digital participation To ensure a truly inclusive COP, digital participation has been enabled to complement the physical COP negotiations. A multitude of events are webcast.

Nov 22, 2022( The Heartlander: HYPERLINK https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news Delivered by Newstex) As Americans give thanks this week for our many blessings, let us recall the Pilgrims' and Native Americans' primitive agricultural knowledge and technologies, the hunger and disease that were constants in their lives - and how so many around the world are not much better off today. Much of Africa still lives on the edge, with well over 600 million people not even having electricity. Many parts of India, Asia and Latin America also face serious energy and food deprivation. Incredibly, so does Europe. 'German industry stares into the Net Zero abyss,' 'Europe's energy crisis may get even worse next year,' 'Even Germany's wind industry is sliding into crisis,' 'Millions face poverty and destitution in Green Britain, as Brits pay highest electricity bills in world,' headlines warn. Banning Russian gas imports amid Putin's war on Ukraine plays a role and is frequently scapegoated. But the primary cause is Europe's love affair with intermittent wind and solar, and hate-fest for fossil fuels and nuclear, amid frigid winter realities that have caused Germany to obliterate ancient villages and recent-vintage wind farms to mine lignite coal beneath them. Closer to home, New England[1] and New York also face a cold, dark winter[2], because they too have voted against drilling, fracking, pipelines, coal and nuclear power - and now demand more oil and gas from the same companies that they and President Biden want to drive into oblivion. However, the greatest hypocrisy of all was on full-throated display at the COP-27 climate circus in Egypt November 6-18 - where attendees kept asking whether Africa should be allowed to exploit its oil, natural gas and coal reserves to improve living standards, feed families and save lives! Al Gore[3] preached that fossil fuel investments should be terminated worldwide, including in Africa. UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres absurdly asserted that 'New funding for fossil fuel exploration and production is delusional' and will only 'feed the scourge of war, pollution and climate catastrophe' (the manmade cataclysms found in computer models and COP-27 rants, though not in the Real World[4]). At the COP-27 Even worse, it's not just energy these arrogant eco-totalitarians want to obstruct in Africa and other developing regions. It's also modern fertilizers -- indeed, all aspects of modern agriculture - everything that can actually help farmers feed hungry people and make enough money to build a home or barn, send their children to school, and buy tractors and other equipment. They don't even want Africa producing natural gas and using it to make nitrogen fertilizer, which dramatically boosts crop yields[6] and is absolutely essential if the world is to feed eight billion people - especially without turning millions more acres of wildlife habitat into marginal croplands. Poor countries are no long going to tolerate this outrageous, intolerable, racist neo-colonialism. Nor should they, especially when they realize now-rich countries are on the verge of de-industrialization and bankruptcy - and have neither the intention nor ability to shell out billions, much less trillions[7], of dollars in annual 'reparation, loss and damage' payments for alleged impacts from manmade climate change. So when the UN, now-rich countries and eco-pressure groups tell them there'll be no financing for fossil fuels and modern agriculture - only for wind and solar energy, organic farming and 'AgroEcology' - poor countries should just tell these purveyors of poverty, hunger, disease and death to buzz off. That would leave poor countries largely on their own. But they have numerous advantages that their predecessors lacked: access to the incredible energy, agricultural, industrial, economic, medical, communication and other advances of recent centuries[8], especially during the fossil-fueled industrial era. They simply need to chart their own destinies and utilize these advances. Every project they undertake will generate new wealth, innovation and self-confidence to undertake subsequent projects. I've written about these callous eco-imperialists - these financiers and merchants of death - many times (here[9], here[10], here[11] and here[12], for example). Unfortunately, they never repent, never revise their lethal attitudes and policies. The global following they enjoy underscores how the ill-informed but well-intended really are led around by the well-informed but ill-intended - on climate, energy, agriculture and human rights. Their AgroEcology schemes reject virtually the entire foundation of modern agriculture, which feeds feed billions of people with less acreage and water, using monoculture farming, carefully developed and tested chemical fertilizers and insecticides, biotechnology, hybrid seeds and mechanized equipment. Instead, they demand 'food sovereignty' - the 'right' to 'culturally appropriate' food produced through 'ecologically sound and sustainable methods, in accord with AgroEcology policies - the kind that brought hunger and chaos to Sri Lanka[13]. They even vilify Golden Rice[14], which could end Vitamin A Deficiency, blindness and death among malnourished children. Could the insanity and hypocrisy get any worse? Sadly - yes. European leaders have been pleading with African nations to launch oil, gas and coal projects - for shipment to Europe. In their next breath, the EU Commission says supporting nitrogen fertilizer production[15] in Africa would 'clash' with EU climate goals. The International Energy Agency worries that half of Sub-Saharan Africa's population has no access to electricity. In its next breath, the IEA says stopping planetary overheating doesn't allow for more African petroleum production[16]. Even more colonialist, Time magazine promotes the notion that 'humans eating insects could help save the planet.' The New York Times extolls a new Julia Child 'Joy of Cooking (Insects).' And a group of 'renowned' African and European 'ecology and nutrition experts' says climate change and other considerations make Africa 'the perfect laboratory' for testing new ways to feed humanity - like turning lake flies[17] from the Lake Victoria region into 'crackers, muffins, meat loaves and sausages.' COP-27 (or FLOP-27[18]) claims to have reached another 'historic milestone[19]' in saving Planet Earth[20]! But it's all driven by unfounded hysteria about manmade climate cataclysms. Let's all take a deep breath. We certainly face climate fluctuations[21] and extreme weather events - but no worse than in the past, and with no replicable, convincing evidence that manmade emissions have replaced natural forces. More importantly, we have far greater wealth, far more knowledge, far better technologies and resources than in the past - to help us adapt to climate changes, survive extreme weather events and rebuild afterward. That's infinitely preferable to blanketing the Earth with wind turbines, solar panels, battery modules, transmission lines, mines and factories to build the things - and processing plants to make bug burgers and other delicacies, in time for climate luminaries to enjoy them at COP-28. Can't we just be calm and rational (and thus colonialist?[22]) just this once? Just asking.

Topline Global carbon emissions continued to rise this year and have shown no signs of slowing down, the Global Carbon Project said Thursday, as world leaders push for new initiatives to halt climate change at this week s United Nations Climate Change Conference . <figure> <figcaption> Carbon emissions rose to an all-time high in 2022. </figcaption></figure> Key Facts Global carbon dioxide emissions are expected to total 40.6 billion tons this year, as emissions from fossil fuels rose 1% since 2021. A few large carbon-emitting countries are expected to decline this year, including China (down 0.9%) and the European Union (down 0.8%), but the United States is projected to increase its emissions 1.5% and India is projected to grow 6%. Corinne Le Qu\'e9r\'e9, a professor at the University of East Anglia s School of Environmental Sciences, suggested in a press release the rise in emissions is a result of global economies moving out of the pandemic, when demand for fuel particularly for aviation was far lower. Should emissions continue to grow at this pace, the Global Carbon Project estimates there is a 50% chance that total global temperature increases will top 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next nine years despite the 2015 Paris Agreement s goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. By next year, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are expected to be 50% higher than during pre-industrial levels. Big Number 1.4 billion. That s how many tons of carbon dioxide need to be cut each year from global emissions in order to reach zero emissions by 2050. Crucial Quote UN Secretary General Ant\'f3nio Guterres opened the climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, last week bywarningworld leaders that the Earth is on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator. He added that the world is in the fight of our lives, and we are losing. What To Watch For President Joe Biden is expected to arrive at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt on Thursday to discuss the Paris Agreement. Key Background The report by the Global Carbon Project s science team composed of scientists from the University of Exeter, the University of East Anglia and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich is released as the UN s two-week climate summit comes to a close. During the summit s 2015 meeting, nations signed the Paris Agreement and agreed to cut carbon emissions by enough in order to keep the catastrophic effects of climate change at bay. Scientists haverecentlycast doubt over whether several countries will be able to meet the agreement s landmark goal of holding temperatures to 1.5 degrees. New policies and increased efforts to develop renewable energy have improved projections, though they have not been sufficient, and the U.S briefly left the Paris Agreement in 2020 before returning in 2021. A recent U.N.reportindicates global temperatures will increase by as much as 2.9 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

The natural products industry spends considerable time and energy discussing climate change and, in particularly, the food system\' s role in the increasing global temperature.Officials and activists from around the world are again meeting to discuss climate change. Last week, the 27 th United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP27 started; this time, it\' s in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.The New York Times has compiled a HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/article/cop27-climate-change-summit.html style=color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;" 12-question list of things to know about COP27 , while New Hope Network offers this roundup of news focusing on justice and equity surrounding the climate change crisis.The urgency of climate change mitigationDuring a two-day Climate Implementation Summit that immediately preceded the COP27 conference, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called for a Climate Solidarity Pact, through which developed and developing countries would reach agreements to reduce emissions, end dependence on fossil fuels and provide sustainable energy for everyone, the HYPERLINK "https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1130247 style=color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;" United Nations news service This is our only hope of meeting our climate goals," he says. Specifically, Guterres asked countries to tax the profits of oil and gas companies, then use the funds to assist people who struggle with food and energy prices, as well as countries sustaining climate-related damages and losses. Solidarity that respects all human rights and guarantees a safe space for environmental defenders and all actors in society to contribute to our climate response. Let\' s not forget that the war on nature is in itself a massive violation of human rights," he says.Guterres\' demands reflect, in part, developing countries\' wanting a  loss and damage" fund to help them recover from disasters. John Kerry, U.S. Special Envoy for Climate under President Joe Biden, HYPERLINK "https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/some-countries-have-resisted-15c-goal-cop27-text-us-says-2022-11-12/ style=color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;" tells Reuters , though, that the United States would not support that move. We will find a way, I am confident, to be able to have financial arrangements that reflect the reality of how we are all going to deal with the climate crisis," Kerry says.The countries of Africa are among the most vocal demanding a  loss and damage" fund, as the continent is experiencing some of the most devastating climate-related weather events even though it creates less than 4% of the world\' s carbon emissions, according to HYPERLINK "https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/09/africa-cop27-un-climate-change-loss-damage/ style=color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;" Foreign Policy .

The urgency of climate change mitigationFood Tank and the Food Systems Pavilion organized a discussion regarding access to healthy food at COP27 . Food is a human right," says Monica Yator, founder and executive director of the Indigenous Women and Girls Initiative, a nonprofit founded in 2020, in Kenya.  It is also a basic need." The initiative introduces women to crop farming, which women are allowed to participate in, even though they cannot own land. Its mission is to support women and amplify their voices to ensure their rights are protected and that they are involved in decision-making processes.The Self Employed Women\' s Association, known as SEWA, encourages women to grow nutrient-rich, traditional foods as industrialized farming is stripping foods of nutrients. Women form an integral part of the entire food system, from product to household consumption and disposal of food," says Mansi Shah, documentation and design consultant for SEWA.Read more and watch a video at HYPERLINK http://foodtank.com/news/2022/11/increasing-nutrient-density-for-resilience/ Food Tank .The urgency of climate change mitigationSlashing through the alphabet soup that embroils sustainability actions and reports, a new term might be rising to the top: a just transition.The international trade union movement has long promoted this term to describe climate action plans that are  socially equitable, financially viable and environmentally regenerative." More than 30 countries including the United States, Canada and members of the European Union signed at COP26 the Glasgow Just Transition Declaration, which set goals of creating sustainable, green and inclusive economies and decarbonizing economies to limit the global average temperature increase. A lot of the guides on just transition are targeting governments to help them establish just transition frameworks. It\' s not clear what\' s expected of businesses yet, and it can be scary to stick your head above the parapet.," says Haley St. Denis, head of just transition at the Institute for Human Rights and Business.Read more at HYPERLINK http://www.triplepundit.com/story/2022/cop27-just-transition/759731 Triple Pundit .The urgency of climate change mitigationAs Russia\' s war in Ukraine continues to limit global oil supplies, rich countries in the West are pushing for more fossil fuel projects in Africa.Such projects, which are being called out as energy colonialism, won\' t benefit the surrounding communities, either with more energy or better economies. It\' s estimated that, because most fossil fuels extracted in Africa are exported, about 600 million people lack access to electricity. It\' s not just about the energy source, it\' s about the whole energy system who decides, who benefits and who profits," says Dipti Bhatnagar of Friends of the Earth International in Mozambique.

Nov 14, 2022( Mexico News Daily: HYPERLINK https://mexiconewsdaily.com https://mexiconewsdaily.com Mexico will collaborate with the United States to double its capacity to produce renewable energy, Foreign Affairs Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Saturday at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. He also announced that Mexico will aim to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030, a target five percentage points higher than expected[1]. Ebrard made the announcements at a COP27 press conference at which he appeared alongside the United States special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry. 'President L\'f3pez Obrador has decided to increase the national greenhouse gases emissions reduction target from 22% to 35% in order to accelerate the energy transition in North America,' he said. 'That means doubling efforts in the next eight years compared with the original plans for this decade,' the foreign minister said. Mexico intends to ramp up production of a range of clean energies including wind, solar, geothermal and hydroelectric. Ebrard said that an additional US $48 billion in investment in the renewable sector will be needed to double Mexico's capacity to generate clean energy by the end of the decade. He said that the public and private sectors in both Mexico and the United States will invest in renewables, but didn't specify how much money would come from each country. The United States Embassy in Mexico said in a statement[2] Monday that 'Secretary Kerry indicated his support for Mexico's new renewable goal, and the United States intends to work closely with Mexico to achieve these ambitious goals, including through U.S. efforts to mobilize financial support and joint efforts to catalyze and incentivize investments into new Mexican renewable energy deployment and transmission.' Foreign Minister Ebrard announces the clean energy agreement at a COP27 press conference on Sunday, alongside U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry. Twitter @m_ebrard L\'f3pez Obrador said earlier this year[3] that 17 U.S . energy companies had committed to invest in solar and wind projects in Mexico. Kerry said Saturday that Mexico and the United States have a shared 'vision' for a clean energy future in North America. Sonora is set to play a key role in the bilateral plan, with a massive solar farm[4] among the renewable projects slated to commence operations in the northern state in coming years. Ebrard said last week[5] that Mexico needs to increase renewable energy production Â£t a rate even faster than the United States' to ensure it can comply with any clean energy requirements the U.S. imposes on exports to that country. In a separate announcement on Saturday, Pemex said it would collaborate with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, especially methane. The state oil company said in a statement that the EPA would provide technical support for the development and implementation of a plan to help reduce its emissions. 'Through the agreement, the EPA will support [Pemex] with economic diagnoses and analyses to support decision-making in its onshore oil and natural gas operations,' it said. The emissions reduction plan is slated to be developed and implemented in the first half of next year. A team of European scientists published a study earlier this year that concluded that Pemex released some 40,000 tonnes of methane[6] into the atmosphere from a Gulf of Mexico oil and gas platform during a 17-day ultra-emission event last December. The state oil company rejected the study[7], but the scientists retorted that they definitely didn't mistake nitrogen for methane[8], as Pemex claimed. Methane, the main constituent of natural gas, is much more harmful to the environment than carbon dioxide and is considered a major contributor to global warming.

Last year's climate COP 26 in Glasgow, Scotland, was billed as the most important conference in the history of humanity. But it failed to deliver. If anything, that failure added urgency for global climate action at COP 27 in Egypt last month. Now that it this year's COP is over, it is useful to reflect on a few excerpts from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\\x92s opening day remarks: \\x95 \\x93These climate conferences remind us that the answer is in our hands and the clock is ticking." \\x95 "We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing." \\x95 \\x93Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing, global temperatures keep rising\\x85and our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible." \\x95 \\x93We are getting dangerously close to the point of no return. And to avoid that dire fate all countries must accelerate their transition now, in this decade." \\x95 \\x93Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish." \\x95 \\x93It is either a climate solidarity pact, or it is a collective suicide pact.\\x94 Sadly, COP27 COP 27 did not deliver. In fact, it has been labelled by many as the worst COP ever. What happened in Egypt puts a whole new spin on the term COP-out. But how could it have been otherwise? COP 27 was held in a country aligned with surrounding petrostates ruled by a ruthless dictatorship and was sponsored by one of the world\\x92s largest plastic polluters: Coca-Cola. It did not seem to register with organizers that the company\\x92s relentless bottled water production is widely held in the global water science and policy community as a triumph of marketing over common sense. COP 27 was an open invitation to blatant global greenwashing? The obvious should not be missed here: Capitalism is not out of control, capitalism is in control \\x96 and COP 27 offers clear proof of that truth. COP 27 . What, one might reasonably ask, could possibly go wrong? Lots, evidently. The oil and gas lobby completely corrupted the COP process. The proceedings and outcomes of COP 27 make it clear that the fossil fuel sector now owns the COP agenda. The sole aim of their presence there was to prevent, not promote, progress on dealing with the global climate threat. And they succeeded. None of the agreements negotiated in Egypt are binding. Like the national emissions reductions target put forward by UN Member States under the Paris Climate Accord, the commitments made at COP 27 are all merely aspirational. There is no penalty for failing to achieve them. There have been 27 COPs since 1995 and still no formal binding agreement on cutting fossil fuel burning. Except for a small blip during the pandemic, fossil fuel burning globally continues to rise, not fall. As one participant pointed out, the aspirational scheme agreed upon in Sharm el Sheikh is a down payment on disaster. No one expects anyone to actually compensate developing countries that contribute little to the climate threat for the catastrophic impacts climate breakdown is now having on them. With COP 28 scheduled to be held next year in the United Arab Emirates \\x96 one of the most notorious petrostates of them all \\x96 the only thing COP 27 accomplished was to expose what the COP summit process has become \\x96 a pointless travelling circus set up once a year out of which little but platitudes emerge. The entire COP process is no longer fit for purpose. It is a bloated, corrupted process too moribund to come up with any measures effective enough, and binding enough, to bring about the changes we need to make to avoid climate catastrophe. Voices calling for change get louder and louder. The COP process must be replaced with something more efficient that does its work largely hidden from the glare of the media. It can no longer be allowed to be contaminated by corporate sponsorship. The process can no longer be allowed to be owned and corrupted by the global fossil fuel cartel and oil and gas sector lobbyists. One suggested way of doing this is to establish an IPCC-like structure of smaller bodies, each addressing key issues, notably energy transition, restorative agriculture, transportation and issues related to damage and loss. Each such body would be made up of representatives of majority-world countries empowered to negotiate legally binding agreements that are workable and achievable, whether it be halting and reversing deforestation, cutting carbon dioxide and methane emissions, drawing down coal use and addressing other threats to our future such as ocean acidification and deoxygenation. These agreements can then be signed off by world leaders without the need for the hype, grandstanding and false hope now associated with COP process pronouncements. We are witnessing a great bonfire of our heritage. Things are being lost that have not yet been found. We need to find them before they, and we, are gone.

The following information was released by the University of Colorado - Boulder: At the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ), the Right Here, Right Now Global Climate Alliancea multiyear international climate justice initiative supported by United Nations Human Rights and the University of Colorado Boulder announced the launch of a groundbreaking initiative for rights-based climate action, the Human Rights Climate Commitments (HRCC). Inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other human rights instruments, the first draft of the commitments will be an outcome of the inaugural Right Here, Right Now Global Climate Summit (RHRN) to be held in person and virtually Dec. 14 at CU Boulder. The summit will include participation by climate and human rights advocates, including former Irish President Mary Robinson, who also served as UN high commissioner for human rights from 1997 to 2002. Registration is now open and is free. "UN Human Rights is proud to be the global partner of the Right Here, Right Now Global Climate Alliancea human rights initiative committed to promoting and advancing the rights of people around the world suffering from the devastating effects of climate change," said Benjamin Schachter, UN Human Rights team leader for environment and climate change. "Addressing the climate crisis will require a whole-of-society effort. That's why UN Human Rights is so excited to be a part of the alliance and see its new initiatives develop and grow in the coming years." David Clark, founder and CEO of the Right Here, Right Now Global Climate Alliance and CEO of David Clark Cause, explained the emphasis on the most vulnerable. "The United Nations continues to inform the world of the grave statistics showing how women, children, Indigenous peoples, the poor and the marginalized are suffering the most as the climate catastrophe escalates," Clark said. "The creation of the commitments will provide a unique human rights framework for government and business leaders, human rights advocates, climate experts, universities, and others to kickstart critical action to address climate change and help the people most affected by it.". The alliance is working with its global partner, United Nations Human Rights, and CU Boulder to elevate understanding about the human rights crisis that climate change represents and to urgently appeal for more ambitious efforts to address it. The HRCCs will play a key role as an aspirational and prescriptive living document, including specific commitments that governments at all levels, corporations and universities will be urged to make to prevent and minimize the harmful effects of climate change and address their impacts. The commitments will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect the highest human rights standards and latest scientific information. "The Human Rights Climate Commitments are based on the human rights framework that establishes specific obligations and responsibilities to respect and protect human rights, including in the context of climate change," said CU Distinguished Professor S. James Anaya, an expert in international law who is the RHRN summit steering committee chair and the former UN special rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous peoples. "What distinguishes the commitments is that multiple sectors are involved. The threat of climate change to our survival requires a concerted effort by all of us." At a news conference announcing the commitments, Ian Fry, special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, stressed the importance of other sectors of society taking action. "The COP process is broken," Fry said, calling out the United States and other Group of 20, or G-20 countries, for not financially helping poorer countries that are suffering from the impacts of climate change. "Recalcitrant countries like the US continue to undermine the basic human rights affected by climate change. So this is why we need important partnerships like the Right Here Right Now group. We need people to think outside the box who are not bound by autocratic governments like the US. We need collaboration between scientists, educators, cultural and industrial leaders to come together to address climate change. I commend the Right Here Right Now Alliance for its work in bringing us together and bringing together key influencers. Collectively, the alliance represents thousands of educational institutions and other organizations around the globe. We need these institutions to think beyond the bounds of the COP process." Anaya painted a picture of what the HRCCs could look like. "Imagine the impact if national governments across the developed world committed substantial funds for the damages and loss already suffered as a result of climate change, if cities broadly committed to targeted increases in green public transportation to reduce reliance on private vehicles, if business enterprises across sectors committed to science-based carbon emissions reduction targets, and if educational institutions at all levels committed to specific steps to build widespread knowledge about climate change and expertise to address it. These are the kind of proposed specific commitments that will be discussed and put forth at the Boulder summit." Anaya noted that multiple stakeholders will develop and revise the commitments, and a preliminary version of the commitments will be announced at the next COP in Dubai. Since its launch in fall 2021 at COP26, the Right Here, Right Now Global Climate Alliance has already emerged as the largest public-private partnership addressing climate change as a human rights issue, bringing together human rights experts, scientists, corporate leaders, nongovernmental organizations, academics, advocates and people around the globe in the fight for rights-based climate action to preserve a common future. In addition to the Right Here, Right Now Global Climate Summit and the HRCCs, next year the alliance will introduce global initiatives with partners in sports, music, education and technology. The alliance and upcoming summit has garnered support from celebrities that include Leonardo DiCaprio, Quincy Jones, Celine Dion, Cher, Jeff Bridges and Camila Cabello. The superstar coalition's Right Here, Right Now COP27 Campaign in support of UN Human Rights aims to collectively reach a milestone of over a half billion people via Twitter, Instagram and Facebook followers. \</doc>

Environment and Climate Change Canada issued the following news release: Canada is wrapping up its participation at the Twenty-Seventh United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), more committed than ever to keeping the goal alive of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, supported by Catherine Stewart, Canada's Ambassador for Climate Change, and Steven Kuhn, Canada's Chief Negotiator for Climate Change, and a strong team, met with colleagues from more than 190 countries in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, at a critical time as countries are being devastated by climate events such as historic flooding, as well as rising energy and food crises due to geopolitical instability. Canada came to the table as a fully-committed partner in advancing cooperation and implementation for climate action and is leading by example with the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan, the country's comprehensive sector-by-sector roadmap to achieve its goal to reduce emissions by at least forty percent by 2030, on the road to net zero by 2050. Negotiations focus on moving the needle on many important climate issues under the Paris Agreement, including mitigation, climate finance, and adaptation. Canada notes many challenges on the topic of loss and damage and heard vulnerable countries on the difficulties they are facing in accessing the resources they need. Canada has engaged, and continues to engage, constructively on loss and damage and is working toward a concrete outcome. Minister Guilbeault will share a statement on the final text decision in the coming days. Amid the often tough and ongoing negotiations underway, Canada announced many new commitments and investments over the course of the conference, including around emissions reduction, climate financing for the most vulnerable developing nations, and clean energy transition, along with multilateral partnerships. Canada announced increased cooperation with the United States on reducing oil and gas sector emissions--with a special focus on methane. Cutting oil and gas methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to combat climate change. This is why Canada joined the Joint Declaration from Energy Importers and Exporters on Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuels and reaffirmed its commitment to reduce methane emissions by at least seventy-five percent by 2030. To help achieve these goals, Canada published a regulatory framework to help to inform consultations and the development of forthcoming stricter oil and gas methane regulations. It also joined the International Methane Emissions Observatory to help monitor and share methane emissions data gathered by satellites. Canada is committed to helping the world's most vulnerable combat the impacts of climate change, and announced a number of practical initiatives totalling $84.25 million through its $5.3 billion international climate finance commitment and other sources of funding at COP27 . This includes $24 million for critical areas such as loss and damage, access to climate finance, and climate governance and $4 million to help Belize, Grenada, Guyana and Saint Lucia, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean, reduce methane emissions and help them achieve their climate target under the Paris Agreement. Canada remains steadfast in its commitment, including working in partnership to reach the collective goal of mobilizing US$100 billion as soon as possible and through 2025. Canada is proud to have released the Climate Finance Delivery Plan Progress Report with Germany ahead of COP27 to provide further transparency on developed countries' commitment toward the goal. Canada continues to advocate for clean energy and is ambitiously pushing for the adoption of carbon pricing globally by rolling out with Chile the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge, launched by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at COP26. New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are among countries that are considering, or have already made, carbon pricing key to their approach in fighting climate change. Canada announced an additional $16 million in support of the World Bank's Partnership for Market Implementation to advance the Challenge's goals, as well as two new initiatives under its $5.3 billion commitment to help developing countries transition to clean energy and drive global ambition. The relationship between protecting nature, halting biodiversity loss, finding nature-based solutions and climate change was emphasized at COP27 . Minister Guilbeault held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from other countries and organizations to discuss shared priorities on climate change, as well as nature and biodiversity loss, as Canada prepares to welcome the world to Montreal, Quebec, for the Fifteenth United Nations Conference on Biological Diversity (COP15). The international community cannot delay working together to jointly address these pressing challenges. Canada is ready to welcome the global community this December to come to an agreement on an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Quotes "Progress on commitments was at the forefront of this COP. It was very fitting, as it's time to move from ambition and pledges to concrete action, which is exactly what we are doing at home with our sector-by-sector Emissions Reduction Plan. Throughout the past two weeks, Canada actively looked for ways to make progress and bridge positions on cornerstone issues, including on the important matter of loss and damage. And in a time of significant global challenges, we remain more committed than ever to support the global transition to cleaner energy. We will keep up the momentum as we head to COP15 in Montreal next month and rally for ambitious commitments to protect our natural world." - The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Quick facts  COP27 marked the fifth anniversary of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, co-launched by Canada and now over 165 members strong. Phasing out coal electricity is one of the single most important climate steps the world can take.  The Prime Minister attended the concurrent G20 Leaders' Summit in Bali, Indonesia, where he made other notable climate announcements including: - A landmark Just Energy Transition Partnership with Indonesia and G7 partners to mobilize an initial US$20 billion in public and private financing toward significant new targets and policies in order to limit coal power, increase renewables, and reduce energy sector emissions. - $750 million for FinDev Canada, to bring Canada's development finance institution to the Indo-Pacific region to help support sustainable infrastructure needs. Canada's contribution will help reduce poverty, build climate resilience, advance gender equality, and promote the economic development of economies and communities to benefit everyone.

Nov 09, 2022( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com In the heat of Sharm El Sheikh, discussions started on 6 November that will determine how, over the next years, we address the defining challenge of our time: climate change. The latest United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 [1]) brings together political and business leaders, activists, civil society groups, international organizations and others, to set commitments that can quicken the action and adaptation needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The context for COP27 could not be more urgent, as the latest IPCC report[2] sets out in stark terms. Human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption, to the environment and countless people around the world. Increased heatwaves, droughts and floods are already a reality. These extremes are causing cascading affects that have exposed millions of people to health risks, and acute food and water insecurity, especially in developing and emerging economies. These crises are inter-connected and those affected most are often the least to blame. For example, World Resources Institute analysis[3] shows that, while many parts of Africa are at the forefront of climate change impacts, the continent accounts for only 3% of global CO2 emissions. Prioritizing adaptation that protects the most vulnerable How we address these challenges require holistic thinking, long-term strategies and clear accountability, to prevent and alleviate negative impacts. We cannot achieve that without widespread and comprehensive reporting by organizations on their climate impacts. As UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has set out[4], greater leadership is needed from governments and businesses, warning that efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is 'on life support'. And so, with good reason, the focus of reporting has been mostly on emissions, with widespread commitments by companies to reach 'net-zero' targets. Yet focus on emissions reductions alone is not enough. If we are to avoid further escalation and consolidation of crises, we urgently need transparency and accountability on how a low-carbon transition, which supports the needs of workers and communities, is being prioritized. Beyond this, organizations need to explain how their strategies and business practices alleviate the impacts of climate change on those around them. To this end, there are growing demands on companies to help the communities directly affected by their activities to become more resilient against the impacts of climate change. Clarity on the climate data that matters most At GRI, we urge all organizations to disclose their impacts on the planet, because transparency - through quality, comparable information - is an essential stage in identifying where responsibilities lie and contributing to global solutions to the climate crisis. Sustainability reporting can be a driver for better environmental performance. However, companies are not always reporting the data that matters most. That is why, as the most widely adopted standard-setter for sustainability impacts, we convene stakeholders across the board in our standards development, to determine best practice. This is the approach we will again follow as we get ready for a major update of GRI climate-related standards. A review will launch in 2023 and cover not only commitments and actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, but also how to ensure a holistic view on adaptation and resilience to climate change. This will account for the physical impacts of climate change as well as the low-carbon transition on workers and communities. A key consideration here will be to connect the climate standards review to our current revision program for labor-related reporting[5]. Demands for more clarity and consistency on the most relevant climate-related impacts of organizations, from the local to the global levels, has been a key learning from our Sector Program - particularly in the Sector Standards for oil and gas (GRI 11[6]) and coal (GRI 12[7]). Alongside steps to mitigate emissions, these standards have extensive focus on achieving a just transition. The new Agriculture, Aquaculture & Fishing Standard (GRI 13[8]), meanwhile, gives attention to how organizations enable adaptation and protect critical sources of food. Our revision of the Biodiversity Standard (GRI 304[9]) has shone a light on the inter-relations between the climate and biodiversity crises. This process is at an advanced stage - and the exposure draft for the revised Biodiversity Standard is expected to be released for public comment early December (during the UN Biodiversity COP 15). This updated standard will closely intersect with our work on climate standards. 'Double materiality' in climate disclosure As demonstrated by our multi-stakeholder engagement, we believe standard-setting should not happen in isolation. To that end, our review of climate standards will not only build on our wider program to develop the GRI Standards, it will also see collaboration and alignment with the climate standards under development by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the recommendations of the TCFD, as well as new EU standards under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. GRI reporting is focussed on impact materiality - in terms of how the organization impacts on people and planet. We will ensure our updated climate standard(s) complement the financial materiality disclosures in the proposed ISSB standards, reflecting our commitment to a global comprehensive reporting regime in which impact and financial disclosure are on an equal footing. When it comes to climate reporting, the interrelationship between impact on the organization and impact on the outside world is clear to see. Taken together, this 'double materiality' perspective[10] - with both the inside-out and outside-in viewpoints taken into account - will be crucial in driving accountability for climate impacts. GRI AT COP27 Together with partners, GRI is co-hosting two events at COP27 , under the theme Towards a Global Comprehensive Climate Reporting System. The first event [11](Green Zone[12], 9 November) explores a vision for regional businesses, while the second event (Blue Zone[13], 11 November) will see GRI and the IFRS Foundation discuss the challenge from the perspective of financial and business leaders. We are keen to hear from a multitude of stakeholders on their climate reporting needs and expectations. Margherita and Noora will both be in attendance in the second week of COP27 , to gain early input on what impact-focused climate standards should look like. If you are traveling to Egypt, reach out[14] and arrange a meeting.

Nov 07, 2022( The Dawn: http://www.dawn.com http://www.dawn.com Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif attended the Sharm El Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit (SCIS) on Monday where he robustly campaigned for global action to address Pakistan's climate change challenges. The heads of several governments  in their interaction with Shehbaz on the sidelines of the mega climate change summit  termed his continued presence in the flood-affected areas as an "extraordinary gesture", according to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO). He was received by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres at the Sharm El Sheikh International Convention Centre. In his meetings, the premier drew the attention of the international community to help Pakistan overcome the risks of climate change. PM Shehbaz highlighted the damage suffered by Pakistan in wake of the recent flash floods[1] and emphasised transforming key climate-related decisions into concrete actions and credible plans. While thanking the international community for helping the flood-struck people in Pakistan, the prime minister stressed that as a developing country most affected by the phenomenon, Pakistan needed urgency of climate solidarity and climate justice. Meetings with world leaders The prime minister met with the Arab League's Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit, UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon, Indonesia Vice President Maruf Amin, Iraq President Abdul Rasheed Rashid, Lebanon Prime Minister Najib Mikati, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.

He added that the whole world would have to bear the consequences of climate change's effects that developing countries are facing today. HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/PakPMO/status/1589630614063304704 He also appreciated European countries for cooperating in removing Pakistan from the Financial Action Task Force's grey list while advocating for the possibilities of bilateral trade between the EU and Pakistan. Talking to the IMF managing director, Shehbaz told her that changes have been brought in budget estimates for the immediate relief and rehabilitation of flood victims. He also expressed hope that the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) would prove to be a milestone in bringing climate justice. HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/PakPMO/status/1589626512701292547 https://twitter.com/PakPMO/status/1589626512701292547 The prime minister also met the Iraqi president, Lebanese prime minister and EU President Charles Michel.

COP27 is taking place at a time when millions of people in Pakistan, and millions more in other parts of the world, are facing severe adverse impacts of climate change. We're on a highway to climate hell: UNSG Meanwhile, UNSG Guterres told countries gathered at the summit that they face a stark choice: work together now to cut emissions or condemn future generations to climate catastrophe. The speech set an urgent tone as governments sit down for two weeks of talks on how to avert the worst of climate change, even as they are distracted by Russia's war in Ukraine, rampant consumer inflation and energy shortages. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and other world leaders pose for a family photo during the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, November 7.  Reuters "Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish,' Guterres told delegates gathered in the seaside resort town of Sharm el Sheikh. He called for a pact between the world's richest and poorest countries to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels and funding to ensure poorer countries can reduce emissions and cope with the climate impacts that have already occurred. "The two largest economies  the United States and China  have a particular responsibility to join efforts to make this pact a reality," he said. Despite decades of climate talks, progress has been insufficient to save the planet from excessive warming as countries are too slow or reluctant to act, he noted. "Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible," he said. "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator." Former US vice president Al Gore, also speaking at the event, said global leaders have a credibility problem when it comes to climate change. He criticised developed nations' ongoing pursuit of gas resources in Africa, which he described as "fossil fuel colonialism". "We have a credibility problem all of us: We're talking and we're starting to act, but we're not doing enough," Gore said. "We must see the so-called 'dash for gas' for what it really is: a dash down a bridge to nowhere, leaving the countries of the world facing climate chaos and billions in stranded assets, especially here in Africa," he said.

The following information was released by the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB): Panel Discussion Showcased Economic Potential of Promoting Sustainable Textile and Cotton Sector in Egypt and Sub-Saharan Africa 10 November 2022 Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt 10 November 2022 On the sidelines of the ongoing 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) in Sharm el Sheikh, the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC), a member of the Islamic Development Bank Group (IsDB), organized a joint session with United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Egypt titled 'Egyptian and Sub-Saharan Africa Cotton Traceability for Resilience and Sustainability. This session highlighted the strategies for boosting the ability of value stream participants to fully realize the potential of the climate-resilient textile and cotton sector in Egypt and Sub-Saharan Africa while increasing competitiveness and integration in regional and global value chains. Egyptian cotton is mostly renowned for its outstanding physical fiber qualities, exceptional aesthetic performance, and unmatched durability. However, in the Egyptian cotton-textile value chain, cotton is both a contributor and a victim of climate change. In response to these challenges, the UNIDO multistakeholder project, "The Egyptian Cotton Project," supported by ITFC, began supporting Egyptian farmers in June 2020 to execute a methodical strategy for sustainable cotton growing as advocated by The Better Cotton Initiative. On the regional level, evidence shows that the main issue of the African cotton and textile industry remains the low level of local processing of the fibre and the valuation of by-products. Despite some issues in the cotton and textile sector, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) which came into force on January 1st, 2021, offers a large market of more than 1.3 billion consumers, as well as several business opportunities. This large market should further stimulate industrialization and investment opportunities in the cotton value chain. Moderated by Ramamurthi Krishnan, Advisor, Abc Oqqo'gr Agro Cluster Limited Group of Companies, the Panel Discussion was joined by Aymen Kasem, Division Manager, Trade Development, ITFC; Dalia Tadros, Director of Operations, Industrial Development Group Representing Ministry of Public Sector (Ex- Assistant Minister of Public Business Sector of Egypt), Sara Berlese, Program Officer, UNIDO Regional Office in Egypt; and Babajide Sodipo, Senior Manager, AU/AfCFTA Relations at Afreximbank. With unique areas of expertise, the panelists discussed the policies, practices, and processes that can push pledges into action to enhance the traceability and transparency of the Sub-Saharan African and Egyptian cotton-textile value chain. These pledges will allow for a just transition towards a low-carbon, resource-efficient, and more circular economy. During his keynote speech, Eng. Hani Salem Sonbol reiterated, "The African cotton sector has been a key focus of ITFC, particularly in all major producing countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, and Mali with US$ 1.4 billion in financing the cotton sector. Since its inception, ITFC has provided approximately US$7 billion in financing to the food and agriculture sectors. Farmers are one concrete example of how our impact manifests. ITFC also collaborate with UNIDO through the Better Cotton Initiative because of our long-standing involvement in the African cotton sector. Together, we assist brands and retailers in achieving more consistent quality and sourcing their products from Egyptian cotton producers who adhere to national and regulatory agricultural practices." Krishnan Ramamurthi, the sessions moderator stated that "without sound traceability, measuring progress to ESG Goals and commitments are limited. Further, commodity supply and value chain traceability is a two step process, wherein both digital chains of custody and cutting edge "fingerprinting" of the origin for verification are required components. Aymen Kasem added that traceability provides the ways and means to overcome non tariff related barriers, thereby enhancing trade. ITFC supports agritech solutions that enables sustainable farming especially in the least developed countries. Sara Berlese, Program Officer, UNIDO Regional Office in Egypt said, "Traceability is a powerful enabler for more sustainable, transparent and inclusive cotton-textile value chains in Africa. UNIDO is keen to further support multistakeholder initiatives, focusing on skills development and innovative digital solutions to foster new opportunities for African cotton textile industry. Dalia Tadros, Director of Operations, Industrial Development Group, Representing Ministry of Public Sector commented, "The Egyptian Cotton Reform Project covering the entire supply chain from farming to complete processing; aims at availing traceable and sustainable inputs for private finished goods producers; thus creating sustainable value added for the crop that supports the livelihoods of many families and women across the African Continent." UNIDO and ITFC are committed to continuing to support practical and scalable solutions to improve the performance and competitiveness of the Egyptian cotton-textile value chainone of the country's most iconic industrial productionswhile preserving its environmental and social sustainability and inclusivity for future generations. \</doc>

Among the throngs of global leaders and power brokers currently attending the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) is a Stanford student preparing to deliver her address to the world. Henna Hundal M.D. '26, a second-year medical student and a health and climate activist, is in Egypt at her second Climate Change Conference, the annual climate summit where global leaders convene to discuss paths forward to combat climate change. Hundal is a delegate and negotiator to the COP27 . She is the key opinion leader for the summit's advocacy campaign. Hundal is also working with COP27 This year, the event is taking place in Egypt from Nov. 6 to Nov. 18. The Daily sat down with Hundal before her departure to learn more about her time at COP26, hopes for COP27 and the vital role the medical community plays in dealing with the consequences of climate change. The Stanford Daily [TSD]: You attended COP26 last year. Can you tell us more about your experience? Henna Hundal [HH]: Last year at COP26, some of the delegates actually held up pictures of their grandchildren on the main stage and showed them to the camera and said, "I need to have good outcomes at this conference because I need to be able to go home to my grandchildren and say that I did everything I could to protect their homes for them." You see this especially in places that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis - countries that are much more vulnerable at this point in time.\~ Seeing how truly complex the process is to get a heterogeneous group to come to common ground and find mutual solutions was really transformative for me. It sparked my interest in thinking about what role can the medical community play in this process too. TSD: How do you think COP27 would be like this year? HH: We're going to see discussions and negotiations around themes such as adaptation, mitigation, climate finance, loss and damage. The latter is when I'm particularly looking forward to seeing more progress on climate reparations, which has been touted as something that COP27 will hopefully address with more rigor than COP26. I think COP27 COP27 .\~ HH: There's so many examples of the ways that climate change can really worsen prospects for human health, and we need climate-conscious doctors to tackle this. A great example was actually at Stanford this past summer, when we had an extreme heatwave overlapping with power outages. The University actually opened respite centers for students to cool off and hydrate when those outages occurred, and people could refrigerate their medications. There was structural support when the power went off. We know that climate change is tied to the increasing frequency of these extreme heat events. We also know that extreme weather events are tied to physical injuries and create climate refugees who also face the psychological toll of watching their homes getting destroyed. There's also a study that came out recently looking at the impact of California's wildfire smoke exposure on skin health. We can also look at, for example, waste reduction by the healthcare sector. For the purpose of an advocacy campaign, I profiled a project that took place right here at Stanford about reducing tray waste from skin biopsies, and had great results. There's so many opportunities to extend waste reduction work and finding that line between keeping sterility and patient safety but also promoting sustainability. TSD: You mentioned that we need climate-conscious doctors - how are medical schools like Stanford beginning to train their future doctors to be ready for this? HH: What's been heartening for me is seeing Stanford's medical community increasingly embrace its capacity for advocacy. There's the Stanford Climate and Health group where students have been mobilizing around different legislation.\~ I'm also serving as a TA for EMED 234: "The Impact of Climate Change on Human Health." I think really, there's so much opportunity to include climate change education within medical education and really create this idea of climate-conscious doctors who are proactively having conversations with patients about how climate change might affect them. For example, for patients who are taking medications that might make them more sensitive to heat-related illnesses, they will need to be made aware of this and the extreme heat waves like the ones we have in the summer. TSD: Why do you think it's important to talk about climate change and health now? HH: In this world emerging from the throes of COVID-19, so much has changed. And I think we're realizing, more than ever, that having strong systems in place is going to be critical, not only for bettering future health crises like pandemics, but also thinking about how climate change might affect health systems. Are our health systems even ready to adapt? The interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

Sean Gallup/Getty Images Amid sky-high energy prices, Russia's war in Ukraine, and an ongoing global pandemic, the 27th United Nations climate change conference , or COP27 , drew to a close with mixed results on Sunday. The negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, ended with a HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cp2022_L19_adv.pdf historic agreement to set up a fund for "loss and damage," a shorthand for the unavoidable effects of climate change that the developing world is disproportionately grappling with. But on a suite of other measures - such as phasing down the use of oil and gas and increasing funding for adaptation - COP27 delivered little progress, keeping the world on a path that will lead to warming of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a critical threshold for avoiding catastrophic climate disruptions. While many climate justice advocates praised the hard-won victory on loss and damage, celebrations were muted on Sunday. "Without a phaseout of fossil fuels we are setting the world on a path for further losses and damages," said May Boeve, executive director of the climate advocacy nonprofit 350.org, HYPERLINK https://350.org/press-release/no-phase-out-of-fossil-fuels-threatens-gains-on-loss-and-damage/ in a statement . "This is where the COP has failed." Negotiators overcame great odds to secure the landmark loss and damage deal. The conference was supposed to close on Friday but ran into early Sunday morning with bleary-eyed diplomats working through the night and into the early morning. Logistical challenges also pushed diplomats to the edge, with many blaming the COP27 presidency, headed by Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, for poor management. Food and water were limited at the venue, the Wi-Fi was spotty, and restrooms were at times out of toilet paper. At one point, HYPERLINK https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/burst-sewage-pipe-adds-infrastructure-woes-cop27-93001344 a sewage line burst "But after the pain comes the progress," said Molwyn Joseph, Antigua and Barbuda's environment minister and the chair of an intergovernmental organization called the Alliance of Small Island States, reflecting on the late nights negotiators spent sparring to set up a loss and damage fund. "The agreements made at COP27 are a win for our entire world. We have shown those who have felt neglected that we hear you, we see you, and we are giving you the respect and care you deserve." Here's a rundown of where the key issues from COP27 stand after the conference. Phasing down fossil fuel use Many countries arrived in Egypt eager to build on the progress made at last year's conference in Glasgow, Scotland, which culminated in HYPERLINK https://grist.org/cop26/cop26-made-real-progress-it-also-isnt-enough/ a landmark agreement all coal power and fossil fuel subsidies, it was the first mention of fossil fuels in a COP text. HYPERLINK https://ukcop26.org/cop26-president-closing-remarks-at-cop27/ lamented that it was a battle to even get countries to recommit to a key tenet of the Glasgow Climate Pact - a call on all parties to "revisit and strengthen" their plans to cut emissions. "I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak," he said during the closing plenary session of COP27 . "Unfortunately, it remains on life support." Climate advocates also criticized the final agreement for pushing for "low-emission and renewable energy." While the reference to renewable energy was a welcome new development, the term "low-emission" could be used to justify the expansion of natural gas, which is technically lower emission than coal but is still a major contributor to climate change. "We can't afford any loopholes that leave room for the expansion of harmful fossil fuels and further destruction, like the dash for fossil gas on the [African] continent by European nations," said Landry Ninteretse, regional director of the environmental group 350Africa.org, in a statement. There were small marks of progress on climate mitigation over the last two weeks outside of the official negotiations. Fifty countries either HYPERLINK unveiled national plans or regulations to cut their emissions of methane , a powerful greenhouse gas, or are in the process of creating such plans. Developed countries, including the U.S., also committed new funds HYPERLINK to help Indonesia transition off of coal . And the keepers of the world's three largest rainforests, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Indonesia, https://grist.org/beacon/opec-for-rainforests/ pledged to work together on forest preservation . Loss and damage The deal to set up funding for loss and damage is a major breakthrough in climate negotiations. Just two months ago, developing nations' demand for a separate fund to address the toll of climate disasters https://grist.org/international/loss-and-damage-john-kerry-cop27-climate-reparations/ appeared to be a far-fetched goal HYPERLINK https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/ 20 percent of total historical emissions - opposed HYPERLINK https://grist.org/international/cop27-agenda-climate-reparations-loss-and-damage/ placing the issue on the official HYPERLINK COP27 agenda , fearing that any agreement to fund loss and damage would open them up to unlimited liability. But escalating pressure from nonprofits, growing media attention, developing countries' relentless and unified approach, and a last-minute reversal from the European Union brought the U.S. and other developed countries on board. The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan calls for a new, direct fund for loss and damage, but many of the nitty-gritty details about the fund's governance and structure will be decided by a transitional committee in the coming year. For now, the fund remains an empty bank account. Crucially, the committee will decide which countries will contribute to the fund and which ones will draw from it, major points of contention during negotiations. Developed countries want to expand the donor base to include wealthy developing countries and major polluters. China is a key target, and South Korea, Singapore, and some Gulf countries that have high standards of living are also on the list. The U.S. and other wealthy nations also want to restrict China from being able to receive money from the fund. For its part, China appears willing to contribute, but HYPERLINK https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/cop27-chinas-climate-envoy-says-expects-cooperation-with-us-continue-2022-11-19/ on a voluntary basis "Those details have to be worked out," said Harjeet Singh, an advocate with Climate Action Network, an international coalition of more than 1,800 environmental groups. "A new journey begins to make sure it's not an empty shell, and it helps the most vulnerable people access money. Now, it is all about making it happen." Adaptation funding While countries may be lightyears away from reaching it, the 2015 Paris Agreement at least sets a target of limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. This aim HYPERLINK guides other mitigation goals HYPERLINK https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition reach net-zero emissions by 2050 Adaptation projects in developing countries receive less than a third of all international climate funding committed by wealthy nations, and the HYPERLINK https://grist.org/cop27/wealthy-nations-pledged-to-fund-climate-adaptation-abroad-theyre-way-behind-schedule/ gap between the cost of adaptation and the funding available continues to widen. Last year's Glasgow pact "urged" rich countries to double their provision of international adaptation finance by 2025 and established a program to define and measure progress toward a global goal on adaptation. This year saw little movement toward that end. Countries pledged HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/news/cop27-reaches-breakthrough-agreement-on-new-loss-and-damage-fund-for-vulnerable-countries an additional $230 million The COP27 HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/624412 a request that the U.N. climate convention finance committee produce a report on doubling adaptation finance by COP28 next year, with little detail on what the report would contain. Countries agreed to come up with a framework to track adaptation progress but continue to disagree on what measuring, reporting, and review will look like. Because of COPs' history of producing pledges that are never met, developing countries, like HYPERLINK https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/cop27-african-bloc-unhappy-says-agreement-on-framework-for-adaptation-goal-being-delayed-86078 those in the Africa bloc Carbon markets Last year at COP26, countries established rules for a new HYPERLINK https://grist.org/cop26/countries-finally-agreed-to-create-an-international-carbon-market-heres-why-its-controversial/ global carbon market These markets have been heavily criticized for HYPERLINK https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-carbon-offsets-renewable-energy/?sref=wINQCNXe not actually preventing or removing greenhouse gas emissions and for allowing ongoing pollution by wealthy nations. This year, countries were supposed to work out the details to avoid these types of outcomes, but they didn't get very far. Countries and advocates wary of the potential for greenwashing through carbon credits hoped to establish a centralized way to oversee trades, review their validity, and create transparency. The HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/documents/624417 final text allows governments to keep information about trades confidential. "This transparency loophole risks being exploited by countries seeking to shroud their emission trades in secrecy," said Jonathan Crook, a global carbon market expert with Carbon Market Watch, in a press statement. COP27 agreement creates a new, second-tier market where companies can buy credits as "mitigation contributions," implying - HYPERLINK https://www.climatechangenews.com/2022/11/18/greenwash-alert-as-cop27-draft-allows-double-claiming-of-carbon-credits/ but not requiring - that if they're counted by the country where the project is located, they shouldn't also be claimed by the corporate funder. Another outstanding debate from COP26, the question of what can be considered carbon "removal" on the new market, has been HYPERLINK pushed to next year HYPERLINK failed to establish human rights protections , and were released after no consultation with nonprofits or advocates, were sent back for revision. \</doc>

(TNStalk) -- The Climate Center, a climate policy organization working to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, issued the following agency statement on Oct. 26, 2022:    As goes California, so goes the world. With our state poised to overtake Germany as the fourth-largest economy in the world, it's even more essential for Sacramento policymakers to attend the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt in two weeks. There, they can learn from other pioneers and first-adopters, share California's progress, and come home ready to push for action commensurate with the rapidly worsening climate crisis. The Climate Center is an official Observer NGO to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As an Observer, we're able to help a limited number of California policymakers and nonprofit leaders gain entrance to the annual gathering that draws more than 30,000 attendees from all over the world. This year, we are delighted to be co-hosting an official side event at COP27 with the California Energy Commission and the National Renewable Energy Lab. This panel will explore the Grid for the Future: how clean energy solutions like rooftop solar and batteries can serve as the foundation for a modern, reliable electric system. And throughout the event, we'll learn from global climate leaders who are helping to decarbonize their countries. Thanks to the activism of our supporters and the collaborative work of The Climate Center, California is stepping up as a climate leader once again. But with the latest analysis showing the world is doing "nowhere near enough," it's time for us to do even more. California can and must end the fossil fuel era and accelerate equitable climate action. Engaging with leaders at COP27 is one key step in that direction. Stay tuned for more updates from Egypt!

The following information was released by the Nuclear Energy Institute: Statement from Maria Korsnick, president and chief executive officer at the Nuclear Energy Institute: The commitments made today at COP27 to advance the objectives of the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) Compact are important steps to achieving our global climate goals. Industry and government have come together under a shared goal of building a just and affordable energy transition during this critical moment for our climate and economy. The 24/7 CFE Compacts global community provides the support, tools and partners that organizations need to meet their full electricity demand with carbon-free resourcesevery hour, every day, everywhere. Nuclear energy is the source that can make this all work. Its not enough to decarbonize some hours of the day. To meet our climate goals, we must create an energy system capable of providing carbon-free electricity every hour of the day. As the most reliable provider of carbon-free electricity, nuclear is uniquely positioned to be the backbone of the clean energy grid of the future. With the energy trilemma of security, affordability and sustainability at the forefront of COP27 this year, nuclear energys critical role in the worlds net-zero goals has never been clearer. These actions are essential in driving more technology-inclusive solutions needed for achieving our global climate targets. As an early signatory of the 24/7 CFE Compact, we are proud to have so many of our members join us, demonstrating our industrys commitment to delivering on decarbonization. We will continue to work together to ensure a just and affordable global energy transition. \</doc>

Nov 07, 2022( The Week UK: HYPERLINK http://www.theweek.co.uk http://www.theweek.co.uk The UK has suggested it is opento paying climate change reparations to developing countries by backing talks on the subject at the Cop27 summit that kicks off in SharmEl-Sheikh, Egypt today. SEE MORE Cop27 : who's attending and who's giving it a miss[1] SEE MORE Cop27 and Africa's climate financing problems[2] SEE MORE Rishi Sunak's plans to tackle climate change[3] The idea of 'loss and damage' compensation - otherwise known as climate reparations - has been under debate since UN-backed climate talks first began in the early 1990s. Axios[4] said the issue 'is rooted in the disparate impacts of climate change around the world, with a relatively small group of countries - roughly the G20 nations - responsible for most of the warming-related impacts we're experiencing today'. By contrast it is predominantly countries in the developing world, particularly in Africa[2], South Asia and small island nations in the Pacific, that are most vulnerable to climate disasters, despite having played little part in causing them. What have the papers said? The last-minute agreement to include talks on 'loss and damage' payments at Cop27 [1] 'might sound like the most dry processology you might ever have to read but actually history has been made today, before the event has even started', wrote Allegra Stratton for Bloomberg[5]. With the cost of loss and damage for developing countries estimated to reach a possible $1trn by 2040[6], 'who foots the bill is a question the rich economies responsible for the bulk of past emissions, and for current global warming, have been resolutely avoiding for years', said Al Jazeera[7]. But opinion in those rich economies'has softened in recent years as catastrophic events such as the floods in Pakistan have focused global attention, and tension over the issue threatens to derail coordinated climate action', said The Telegraph[8]. Unprecedented flooding last month left vast swathes ofPakistan submerged, causing more than 1,700 deathsand driving some 33 million people from their homes. 'The disaster puts Pakistan at the forefront of evolving thinking in the international community about how to pay for countries' adaptation to the ravages of global warming - and who should pick up the bill,' said the Financial Times[9]. Bangladesh, another of the countries leading calls for loss and damage payments, could see a third of its agriculture lost and its GDP fall 9% by 2050 due to climate change impacts, a new World Bank report has found. 'We are not asking for charity or debt from developed countries, but rather reparations for their historical legacy in the climate crisis,' he argued. What next? Progress on climate reparations is likely to dominate this year's summit and ultimately be the barometer by which it will be judged a success or a failure. Industrialised nations remain 'skittish about committing to a specific way of paying for it', said Axios, a stance that 'will come under pressure in Sharm el-Sheikh, as developing countries seek specific funding arrangements given how quickly climate disasters are ratcheting up in scope, severity and frequency'. For their part, developed countries, including the UK, 'have long pushed back on agreeing to the principle that they should pay for the impacts of climate change, fearing a cascade of reparation demands that will play out badly in domestic politics', said The Telegraph. The paper set out the dilemma facing many leaders amid a cost-of-living crisis by arguing thatRishi Sunak[3], who wasdue to address the summit latertoday, will 'come under pressure in Egypt to agree to a costly deal on reparations at the same time as he draws up plans for sweeping domestic tax rises and spending cuts'. Appearing on BBC's[11] Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the shadow climate and net zero secretary Ed Milibandinsisted it was 'morally right'to hand money to poorer nations that are 'on the frontline of the climate crisis' and that it would also be in Britain's 'self-interest' to boost aid to developing countries. Yet using taxpayers' money to compensate poorer countries affected by climate change at a time when domestic spending is being cut will be a hard sell. AsMailOnline[12]noted, Pakistan's receipt of foreign aid from Britain has 'often been criticised due to the Asian country's development of a space programme and nuclear weapons'.

The following information was released by the UAE Government: The Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) introduced the second edition of the UAE Green Business Toolkit in partnership with the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), as part of its participation in the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), held in the Egyptian city of Sharm El Sheikh. The move aligns with the UAE's pathway to net-zero and supports sustainable economic development. The launch took place during a session, headlined by Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Minister of Climate Change and the Environment, and moderated by Helena McLeod, Deputy Director-General of GGGI. Almheiri said, "Our ability to tackle the challenge of climate change and deliver tangible results in its mitigation and adaptation depends on the active participation of all sectors in our net-zero efforts. Therefore, the UAE prioritises private sector engagement in all its future plans. The Toolkit is part of MOCCAE's efforts to enhance the contribution of private sector companies to the fight against climate change by adopting green and sustainable practices in line with the objectives of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative." The UAE Green Business Toolkit 2.0 seeks to benefit from the business sector's increasing awareness about the importance of achieving net-zero and building a low-carbon economy. The document offers a comprehensive definition of the net-zero concept, explains its role in creating new business opportunities and reducing operating costs in the long term, and highlights the gains that come with the pursuit of a net-zero strategy. These include strengthening investor confidence and customer loyalty as well as boosting global competitiveness and the ability to attract talent. The second edition also draws a roadmap for developing an integrated company net-zero strategy. It outlines a four-step approach that involves measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, setting emission reduction targets, implementing measures to reach the targets, and linking the targets with the country's economy-wide decarbonisation efforts. In order to provide the private sector with a clear understanding of the benefits of the green business ecosystem, MOCCAE launched the National Dialogue for Climate Ambition (NDCA) in May 2022. The series of stakeholder assemblies, dedicated to a different industry every month, explores sectoral requirements, priorities, and future directions related to climate neutrality. The UAE Green Business Toolkit 2.0 outlines 92 measures businesses can take to become greener, such as switching to clean sources of energy, electrifying the company vehicle fleet, and replacing conventional raw materials with low-carbon alternatives. MOCCAE launched the first edition of the UAE Green Business Toolkit in 2018 with the intent to inspire all types of companies nationwide to take the first step to becoming more eco-friendly and socially responsible by creating awareness. It provided businesses, whether established or emerging, with all the information necessary to green their operations with a focus on three main areas green offices, green procurement, and green products and defined optimal implementation mechanisms. In the four years since, public awareness of the critical need for sustainability has seen tremendous growth. Notwithstanding mounting adverse climate-related impacts, the need to prioritise sustainable practices has only become more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the UAE economy pursues its green recovery plans, increased attention is required to manage environmental, social, and climate-related risks to prevent future disruptions. The second edition of the Toolkit supports the country's ambition to reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by 2050, as well as the Principles of the 50, the UAE Green Agenda 2015-2030, and the National Climate Change Plan of the UAE 2017-2050. Going green offers businesses multiple benefits and creates new growth opportunities. In addition to protecting the environment and conserving natural resources, it cuts down on operational costs, reduces waste, and boosts product competitiveness, with environmental friendliness becoming an important global quality standard. The application of green economy principles in the workplace also enhances employee health and happiness and improves customer satisfaction. The UAE Green Business Toolkit 2.0 aims to build on the capacity of companies to adapt to a global economy in transition, and mobilise the private sector to dedicate resources to contributing to the country's climate targets. \</doc>

The following information was released by Human Rights Watch: 1) What is COP27 ? 2) Why is the climate crisis also a human rights crisis? 3) What are some of the human rights implications of decisions being made at COP27 ? 4) What are the broad human rights concerns about COP27 being hosted by Egypt? 5) What type of restrictions of civic space could be imposed during COP27 ? 7) What is the impact of the human rights crisis in Egypt on environmental groups and broader civil society? COP27 ? 9) What is Egypt's climate record and what are its current main positions in climate negotiations? 10) Have there been previous climate summits when participation of civil society was restricted? 11) What should the Egyptian government do to enable full and meaningful participation in COP27 ? 12) What should United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change member states and the Secretariat do to press Egypt on ending human rights abuses? What is COP27 COP27 is the 27th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference . It brings together state parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as well as thousands of experts, journalists, and representatives from businesses and nongovernmental groups. COP27 , to be held in November 2022, is a forum for states to discuss the rights-based climate actions necessary to enable countries to collectively meet the target of keeping the global rise of temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, in line with the Paris Agreement. Why is the climate crisis also a human rights crisis? From burning forests to sweltering cities, parched farmlands to storm-battered coasts, the climate crisis is taking a mounting toll on lives and livelihoods around the globe. And unless governments act boldly and quickly to massively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the situation will become unimaginably worse. In coming years, rising sea levels and massive food shortages threaten to drive hundreds of millions of people from their homes. Climate change aggravates existing inequalities and the impact of the failure to limit greenhouse gas emissions is particularly felt by communities that are already facing serious human rights violations, including Indigenous peoples, older people, people with disabilities, LGBT people, women, children, and those living in poverty. The capacity of states to protect the rights of the most at-risk populations could be severely strained and, in many places, broken. The ability to avert this dystopian future, affecting today's children and future generations, will most likely depend, in large measure, on what governments do today to protect human rights. To ensure that elected officials and industry leaders hear public demands for more ambitious climate action, states need to guarantee the rights of people everywhere, especially at-risk groups, and listen to the growing ranks of youth climate activists around the world speaking out about the urgent need for robust and rights-respecting action on climate. What are some of the human rights implications of decisions being made at COP27 ? Governments have a human rights obligation to address climate change, including by rapidly cutting greenhouse gas emissions and helping people adapt to the impact of the climate crisis. At this year's COP, governments should adopt a specific recommendation to rapidly phase out all fossil fuel use and production. There is growing consensus, including from the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that for governments to meet global climate targets there cannot be new oil, gas, or coal development. Governments at COP27 should commit to ending authorization for all new fossil fuel projects. In addition, they should end all forms of support, including subsidies and international finance, for oil, gas, and coal developments to rapidly reduce emissions and to limit the human rights impacts of climate change. Governments should also commit to protecting the rights of communities directly affected by fossil fuel operations, including the people living in and around sites of fossil fuel exploration, production, storage, transport, use, and disposal. Governments should commit to protecting those most at risk and ensure their participation, and representation, in decision-making on climate change. At this year's COP, governments should also define the rules for global carbon trading to ensure that they uphold, and advance, the human rights of communities affected by carbon offsetting projects, and establish a grievance mechanism for when these safeguards fail. Further, the decisions on climate finance and adaptation should benefit those who are most affected by the climate crisis and least able to adapt. These decisions should be made in close consultation with these groups, including Indigenous people, older people, and people with disabilities. Despite the necessary efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, the climate crisis will cause irreparable physical, economic, and displacement-related consequences, or loss and damage. Countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change, including small island developing states, are pushing for governments at COP27 to establish a finance mechanism to deal with urgent loss and damage. What are the broad human rights concerns about COP27 being hosted by Egypt? International and Egyptian civil society groups fear that the severe restrictions imposed by the Egyptian authorities in recent years will hinder the full and meaningful participation of journalists, activists, human rights defenders, civil society, youth groups, and Indigenous peoples' representatives at COP27 . In addition, the Egyptian government could try to use its role as the COP27 presidency to promote an image of openness and tolerance, although political oppression under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government has caused one of the country's worst human rights crises in decades. Several informed sources told Human Rights Watch that the Egyptian authorities, through the Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs, have, in closed meetings, asked several Egyptian groups to participate in the COP27 events, mostly around "welcome" topics. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat told Human Rights Watch they granted a one-off admission to attend COP27 , outside the usual process to be accredited, for over 30 Egyptian groups, all "endorsed" through the Egyptian government. What type of restrictions of civic space could be imposed during COP27 ? Protest Space: In an interview with The Associated Press on May 24, Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said that his government is planning to designate "a facility adjacent to the conference center" in Sharm el-Sheikh, in the Sinai Peninsula, where the meeting will be held, where activists can hold protests and voice their opinions. He also said that the government will provide participants "access, as is traditionally done on one day of the negotiations, to the negotiating h[all] itself." Given existing restrictions on protest and assembly in Egypt, which amount to effective criminalization, the foreign minister's comments imply that the Egyptian authorities will not tolerate protest outside this "government-designated" space. Reprisals: Even if Egyptian authorities do not impede access or protests during COP27 , past experiences suggest that fears of reprisals against Egyptian activists after the COP27 concludes are well-founded. The authorities have prosecuted or otherwise punished, including by travel bans and asset freezes, many human rights defenders and independent journalists for engaging with UN mechanisms and foreign officials, or criticizing the government. Surveillance and Other Security Restrictions: Given that security forces in Egypt are largely unaccountable and act above the law, the prospect of physical and digital surveillance against participants at COP27 is real. Egypt's security forces entrap LGBT people on same-sex dating applications and social media. LGBT people are arrested and prosecuted based on digital evidence police find when searching their personal devices, and many face torture in detention. The risk of entrapment and digital targeting against LGBT participants during and after COP27 may be heightened. When Egypt hosted the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights in April and May 2019, African activists reported a range of abuses, also in Sharm el-Sheikh, where COP27 is being held. Scores of participants reported that the authorities delayed or prevented them from obtaining visas or delayed delivering the badges needed to attend the official summit. Many said they were followed and spied on, and some reported being physically abused by Egyptian security agents. They also said that hotels did not allow them to rent meeting rooms, citing "security instructions". Access to Information: Egyptian authorities have, since 2017, blocked access to roughly 700 websites, including the few remaining independent platforms for news media and human rights websites left in the country. The authorities also blocked thousands of websites and texting and calling apps temporarily during events that drew large protests, such as the 2019 street protests. Such massive censorship, coupled with systematic arrests and prosecutions of journalists, has severely restricted access to information and reporting around topics deemed prohibited by the government, including environmental issues. Why has Human Rights Watch described the situation in Egypt as a "human rights crisis"? Since the military forcibly removed President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013, the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who was then the defense minister, has relentlessly persecuted critics, dissidents, journalists, and human rights and political activists. The wholesale crackdown on dissent included mass killings of hundreds of largely peaceful protesters in 2013, which most likely amounted to crimes against humanity, as well as the arrest and prosecution of tens of thousands of people on political grounds. Under the guise of combating terrorism, security agencies, particularly the Interior Ministry's National Security Agency, have carried out rampant abuses, including systematic, widespread torture and enforced disappearances, all with near-absolute impunity, apparently as part of a state policy to stifle peaceful dissent, most likely amounting to crimes against humanity. The Interior Ministry forces have also killed dozens of alleged terrorists in extrajudicial executions disguised as shootouts. The authorities also have labeled virtually all peaceful dissidents as terrorists and prosecuted hundreds of them before extraordinary emergency, military, or terrorism courts. Since 2014, under President al-Sisi's government, Egypt ranked almost every year among the top three worst countries in the world in the numbers of imprisoned journalists according to records of the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international organization that promotes press freedom and defends the rights of journalists. Egypt also ranked as the third worst country in the numbers of executions carried out in 2021. President al-Sisi has issued laws that severely undermined judicial independence. Thousands of people, including children, have been prosecuted in mass trials, in unfair proceedings lacking the simplest resemblance to due process, resulting in lengthy prison sentences and unprecedented numbers of death sentences. In North Sinai, adjacent to Sharm el-Sheikh, where COP27 is hosted, the Egyptian military and police have committed flagrant abuses and war crimes, including several incidents of extrajudicial executions, as it has battled a relatively small Islamic State-affiliate. What is the impact of the human rights crisis in Egypt on environmental groups and broader civil society? Since 2014, Egyptian authorities have intensified restrictions on human rights and environmental groups in one of the harshest government clampdowns in decades, resulting in diminished space for independent organization and assembly. Increasingly repressive policies have severely curtailed the ability of environmental groups to carry out independent work essential to protecting the country's natural environment and informing policy making. The groups have faced security harassment and intimidation tactics including arrests and travel bans, creating a general atmosphere of fear. Restrictions on receiving funding have severely affected human rights and environmental groups. Several laws since 2014, including a 2014 amendment to the penal code, as well as the old and new laws on nongovernmental groups, arbitrarily restrict grants and donations from foreign and national sources. Increasingly since 2014, the government has prosecuted dozens of independent human rights and civil society organizations, some of them doing environmental work, for receiving foreign funds, and imposed travel bans and asset freezes on leading activists. Such prosecutions have had a chilling impact on these groups. The government repression has forced dozens of Egypt's leading civil society activists and groups, including those working on environmental and human rights issues, to leave the country, or to scale down or quit their activism. A number of foreign human rights and environmental organizations have closed their Egypt offices since 2014. Why is participation of civil society and Indigenous peoples essential to a successful COP27 ? Effective climate action requires more people voicing their opinions and peacefully taking to the streets, not fewer. Robust and rights-respecting climate action requires the full and meaningful participation of civil society, including child and youth activists. This includes those on the front lines of the climate crisis and populations most at risk for the harm of climate change, including Indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, older people, children and young people, women, LGBT people, minorities, and people living in poverty. What is Egypt's climate record and what are its current main positions in climate negotiations? Egypt is actively scaling up domestic oil and gas production, use, and export capacity, with plans to become a significant Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exporter. Egypt is responsible for over a third of total methane gas consumption in Africa and is the continent's second largest gas producer, and is making efforts to increase gas consumption in nearly all sectors. While Egypt has updated its Nationally Determined Contribution in July 2022, the Climate Action Tracker still rates Egypt's overall climate targets and policies as "highly insufficient". This rating indicates that these targets are not consistent with the Paris Agreement's objectives, including because Egypt could easily achieve its weak emission targets today without introducing any new policies. There is a general lack of data and information about many aspects of climate change in Egypt. Egyptian authorities effectively prohibit journalists and advocates inside the country from researching sensitive environmental issues. They are barred from studying the impact on local communities and the environmental toll of fossil fuel operations, including production, refining, and export operations. They are also barred from determining the impact of Egypt's vast and opaque military business activity, such as destructive forms of quarrying, water bottling plants, and some cement factories, as well as of "national" infrastructure projects such as a new administrative capital, many of which are associated with the president's office or the military. At the same time, the government is critical of the Global North and its contribution to climate change and encourages engagement by Egyptian groups around related issues because it intersects with the government narrative and interests while its own policies on climate and environment remain unchecked. Have there been previous climate summits when participation of civil society was restricted? Representatives of civil society and Indigenous peoples have long fought for their right to participate in climate negotiations. For example, at COP25 in Katowice, the Polish government prevented some climate activists from entering the country and searched some of them in their hotel rooms. At COP26 in Glasgow, observers struggled to access negotiating rooms, online and in person. What should the Egyptian government do to enable full and meaningful participation in COP27 ? Egyptian authorities should ease their grip on civic space and uphold the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly to enable a successful climate summit. The Egyptian authorities should immediately and unconditionally release people arbitrarily detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights or for their religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation. The authorities should also amend domestic laws to bring them in line with Egypt's obligations under international law. They should repeal or substantially amend laws that unduly restrict and criminalize the exercise of human rights, including Law No.107 on protests, Law No.10 on assemblies, and the 2019 Law on Regulating the Work of Civil Associations, known as the NGO law. The authorities should pledge to uphold the right to freedom of peaceful assembly at all times, including during international events, and refrain from unduly limiting protests to a specific designated area. What should United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change member states and the Secretariat do to press Egypt on ending human rights abuses? The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat should work with the Egyptian government to provide space for diverse civil society participation at the climate talks. This includes ensuring that premises are inclusive and accessible to all, and that observers, including groups critical of the government, have access to registration and negotiations, and are able to protest and express their positions freely. UN member states attending COP27 should urge Egyptian authorities to end limitations on freedom of assembly, association, and expression and take other meaningful steps to ensure the safe and meaningful participation by civil society. States should recommend concrete, structural reforms to ensure that positive changes endure beyond COP27 . \</doc>

Nov 21, 2022( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, known as COP27 [1], has been marked by discord over topics such as the struggle to maintain a commitment to global warming limits. There has also been good news, including an agreement between the United States and China to cooperate again on climate change issues. Amid those potential distractions, Edison International's delegation at COP27 [2] kept its eye on the ball, with a packed agenda of meetings with global leaders and its own continued leadership in the drive for a clean energy future. COP27 panel discussions featuring the Edison leader. Pizarro expressed satisfaction that the U.S. has followed the example set by the state of California by committing to specific actions to reduce carbon emissions. He also expressed hope other nations will follow. 'What is really needed now is a greater sense of urgency,' Pizarro said, pointing to Pathway 2045[3] and Mind the Gap[4], two groundbreaking analyses of the steps necessary to decarbonize California's economy and help avoid catastrophic damage from climate change. Also representing Edison at COP27 were Drew Murphy, Edison International senior vice president of Strategy, Corporate Development and Sustainability, and Caroline Choi, Edison International and SCE senior vice president of Corporate Affairs. With predictions of an impending global recession looming over COP27 , questions about the costs of transitioning to a clean energy economy persist. As Pizarro has often said, 'The cost is high, but the cost of inaction is greater.' One challenge is to make sure those costs don't fall disproportionately on the poorest consumers of energy. Edison's COP27 delegation stressed that the transition can not only be affordable in the long run, but equitable as well. 'Yes, there are investments up front that need to be made,' Pizarro said. 'But our analysis sees the average consumer energy bill  natural gas, gasoline, electricity  decrease by one-third in real terms by 2045.'

Nov 21, 2022( Granite Grok: HYPERLINK http://granitegrok.com http://granitegrok.com Nations gathered for the COP 27 Climate Conference are on the brink of agreeing to a world Welfare package that redistributes wealth from Western countries to third-world countries. John Kerry has been talking about how to do this for decades. But there's a catch. Kerry tested positive for COVID at the Conference. Related: The Goal of the 'Climate Change' Movement (Ironically) is a Political Climate in Which Nothing Changes[1] Everyone is worried (OMG!) that vaccinated and boosted special envoy John Kerry has been infecting all the other vaccinated and boosted attendees. Or are they more concerned that it might make it impossible to reach an agreement on world welfare in the name of climate reparations? 'He is fully vaccinated and boosted and experiencing mild symptoms. He is working with his negotiations team and foreign counterparts by phone to ensure a successful outcome of COP27 ,' Kerry's spokeswoman Whitney Smith wrote in a statement late on Friday. Loss and damage remains the main sticking point between rich and poor nations, particularly the issue of how to compensate countries that have already been ravaged by climate-driven floods, droughts, mega-storms and wildfires. I could remind everyone that there is no evidence of man-made 'climate-driven floods, droughts, mega-storms and wildfires.' And this 'use the climate as a global wealth redistribution plan' has been on John Kerry's lips for longer than I've been blogging. Obama was also a big supporter, and it came up numerous times, but they never had the gas to get it done right. COP27 appears to be the time and place, but Kerry got himself the COVID. Thank god for modern communications infrastructure made possible by climate fuels. They are still all in on it but will the divided US Senate pass any such treaty, and, better yet, would a Republican majority House fund it? Given the current inflation and fiat money, I'm hoping the answer is no. Still, we're always just one stolen election away from another Democrat majority, so stay frosty, my friends (except my friends in Buffalo. You need to keep warm). Good thing shoveling is exercise, which will keep you toasty as long as you're bundled up for all the six feet of climate change you just got[2].

PR Newswire \~Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. ("Ping An" or the "Group", HKEx:2318; SSE:601318) is using financial innovation to support China's energy transition and combat climate change risk, said Richard Sheng, Secretary of the Board of Directors. Mr. Sheng, speaking via videoconference, joined a seminar on green and sustainable finance at the China Pavilion of the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ). Managing the risks related to climate change is an important part of the Group's long-term development strategy. In its second Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report in 2021, Ping An disclosed the bank's credit and investment portfolio and the corresponding risk exposure in eight high-carbon emission sectors: coal power, steel, cement, non-ferrous metal, paper making, aviation, petrochemical, and chemical. Ping An has made a visionary move to invest in green and low carbon assets and reduce the proportion of high-carbon emitting assets to mitigate the financial risks related to climate change. It is supporting China's goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. For China, as the second largest economy in the world and the largest importer and consumer of energy, energy security is critical, said Mr. Sheng. "A secure transition of energy is a trend with rather high certainty," he said. "Ping An is fully harnessing its advantage in long-term capital from insurance," said Mr. Sheng. "In coherence with the long cycle of green projects, it gives fresh impetus to low-carbon development while obtaining steady income." "Ping An has leveraged its strength of integrated finance and has also scaled up the investment in green industries in terms of investment mix," said Mr. Sheng. As of September 30, 2022, Ping An's green investment and financing totaled approximately RMB319.8 billion. As of the end of June 2022, Ping An Capital's carbon neutrality equity investment totaled RMB25.6 billion, including RMB13.2 billion related to clean energy. In November 2021, Ping An Capital served as investment consultant for Ping An Life's RMB2 billion investment in CGN Wind Power, which is developing clean energy projects such as wind and photovoltaic power. After investing, Ping An Life holds a stake of 2.16% in the company. Insurance is one of the major sectors of the financial industry confronting climate change risks, said Mr. Sheng. Ping An's pursuit of innovation in insurance products aims to make insurance an economic "shock absorber" and a social "stabilizer". For example, Ping An has combined Catastrophe Parametric Insurance and index insurance, which makes use of heavy rainfall and typhoon data as parameters for insurance payouts. Once the compensation conditions are met, the compensation amount can be determined without on-site inspection, which helps accelerate post-disaster reconstruction and resumption of business operations. In 2022, Ping An also piloted forest carbon sinks remote sensing index insurance in six provinces: Hebei, Guangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Guangdong and Guizhou. It provided carbon sink risks protection with RMB34.28 million for 340,000 mu (22,667 hectares) of forest land. According to Ping An's 2021 TCFD report, less than 2% of the estimated RMB7.92 trillion in Ping An's assets in investment and banking services were related to the eight major high-carbon emission, or "brown", sectors. While supporting the transition of traditional coal-powered and high-carbon emitting clients, Ping An has also helped to raise their awareness of emission control and consumption reduction, and offered technology to monitor emission data and better navigate the path of transition. Ping An will continue to enhance the accuracy and precision of climate risk assessment, while fulfilling its corporate social responsibility as a financial institution. The Company will also dynamically adjust the control of high-carbon industries and support for green industries according to relevant national policies and market conditions. It will promote quality industrial and social transformation through its professional financial products and services to empower sustainable development. About Ping An Group Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. ("Ping An") strives to become a world-leading retail financial services group. With nearly 228 million retail customers, Ping An is one of the largest financial services companies in the world. Ping An advances intelligent digital transformation, and employs technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of its financial businesses and enhance risk management. The Company believes "Expertise Creates Value" and "Expertise makes life simple".

The COP27 talks, which start Nov. 6 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, face multiple headwinds that could distract governments from climate issues, including Russia's war in Ukraine and a freeze of U.S.-China climate negotiations. China has signaled its intense focus on energy security, energy shortages, the economic slowdown and keeping tight pandemic controls in place. Yet experts said the country still has options to add to its nationally determined contributions or at least get started on new commitments at COP27 . "It's a year that is very difficult for anybody to concentrate on the climate agenda [or] even the economic agenda," said Li Shuo, a Beijing-based policy analyst for Greenpeace East Asia. Li does not expect China to accelerate its current targets for peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. "I don't think the political and economic conditions are there," Li said. "But people should pay attention to smaller issues, and hopefully, we can still make progress on most issues." Climate change mitigation and international climate financing are areas where China can show leadership, said Lucie Qian Xia, China policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute of the London School of Economics and Political Science. "China [has been] intensifying its climate action abroad, and it will continue to do so because it is a way of showing its aspiration to be a responsible great power," Xia said. Beyond China's borders COP27 ] as an opportunity to demonstrate leadership in trying to push for support for emerging economies," said Cory Combs, associate director at policy research consultancy Trivium China. "If China came forward and really pushed hard in making these finances appear more quickly, it makes sense from a geopolitical lens, as well as soft power lens from China's perspective." China could also use the talks to highlight its support of renewable and low-carbon energy projects in developing countries, especially in Asia-Pacific and Africa, where China has massive investments in energy transition supply chains. In 2021, Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged to stop financing overseas coal projects. Green Belt and Road Initiative Center data showed that the country has not funded any such new coal projects since then, although most of the outbound investment flowed into oil and natural gas projects rather than renewables, said Alice Lei Bian, a policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute. Chinese investment in overseas renewables projects is much slower than overseas coal financing in the 2010s, Greenpeace's Li said. The key challenge for China over the next few years is to address the mismatch between renewable energy projects and the country's state-backed overseas infrastructure development model, Li said. China could leverage its battery supply chain in countries with Belt and Road projects to facilitate renewable investment, analysts said. Chinese companies have been doubling down on Indonesian nickel mining investments after Jakarta banned nickel ore exports in 2020. Mining for nickel, a battery metal, is still largely powered by coal and comes with a host of environmental concerns. China could export environment-friendly technologies and practices tested in its China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park to use in Indonesia's industrial parks, Bian said. China could also require its Indonesian projects to have stricter emissions limits, in line with those back home, Bian added. Curbing methane, heavy industry emissions U.S.-China coordination on advancing an action plan to cut methane emissions will be key at COP27 , said Greenpeace's Li, especially after Beijing cut off climate dialogue with Washington in August. The two nations announced a joint agreement in November 2021 to cooperate in slowing global warming, in which China pledged to develop a "comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane" and aimed to achieve a significant effect in the 2020s. "The U.S.-China agreements' work on methane was never really dependent on them working with each other," Combs said. There could be some lost opportunity for technical cooperation on methane emissions, but the two countries will likely keep working on the issue at a high level, Combs said. China could add decarbonization targets for steel and cement sectors to its nationally determined contributions, said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. In February, the central government set a target for the steel industry to peak emissions by 2030, five years later than the original plan. The China Building Materials Federation said in September that the cement sector will peak emissions by 2023. Pressure to act comes in part from the European Commission's July 2021 proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism, which would impose tariffs on carbon-intensive products imports, including power, iron, steel, aluminum, cement and fertilizer. China's steel and aluminum exports to the EU are at risk, which could be a lever to induce international carbon tax cooperation, Bian said. China could also strengthen coordination with the World Trade Organization and the Group of Twenty and move forward with international cooperation on carbon pricing. A carbon price floor could help China address the risks posed by carbon border adjustment mechanisms and accelerate developed countries' delivery of international climate finance, Bian said.

As the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 opens on November 6, 2022, in Egypt, the Federal Government of Nigeria, represented by the Federal Ministers of Environment, Power and Trade has recommended a white paper titled: 'Trade, Energy and Climate Change: Harmonising Nigerian and Global Concerns on Climate'. Led by PUTTRU, the white paper is a collaborative effort with the Federal Ministry of Environment, Federal Ministry of Power, Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Energy Commission of Nigeria and the Office of the Deputy President of the Senate. PUTTRU is a business facilitation online platform that connects African energy companies to financiers from all over the world. The objective of the white paper is to inform the international community and Nigeria's trade partners on how the country's national concerns on trade, energy and climate change can be harmonised with global concerns in a manner that ensures that Nigeria's interests are seen as global interests. The white paper posits that given Nigeria's large and growing population, achieving this balance between trade, energy and climate change is a matter of national, continental and global concern. Ultimately, the goal is to strengthen Nigeria's position as a global trade partner in the global supply chain as the world moves towards a net-zero future. The 58-page document is divided into four chapters namely: 'Climate Change', 'Energy', 'Trade' and 'Trade, Energy and Climate Balance' with three Forewords written by Mohammed H. Abdullahi (Minister of Environment), Engr Abubakar Aliyu (Minister of Power) and Otunba Niyi Adebayo (Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment). Enriched with insights, the document has an impressive list of contributors and reviewers drawn from members of Technical Working Group (TWG) with experts from the Federal Ministries of Environment, Power, Industry, Trade and Investment, Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) and other ministries, department and agencies (MDAs) of the Federal Government, the academia and civil society organisations. In separate forewords, the Minister of Environment wrote: "This white paper explores the different nexus between trade and climate change while focusing on how future trade opportunities will be affected by climate change and policy response. This will guide stakeholders in discussions on how trade provides the goods and services that can drive mitigation and adaptation, and the new opportunities for promoting trade diversification in the transition to a low-carbon world", while the Minister of Trade and Investments wrote: "I commend the production of this white paper, which combines three of the most pressing concerns for not just our country or continent but for the entire world. The Technical Working Group, made up of public and private sector representatives and the academia, have provided sound recommendations that harmonise both Nigerian and global perspectives on these topical issues. " While urging the global community to adopt the position of the white paper, the Minster of Power wrote: "the Ministry strongly calls on all stakeholders, private and public partners, investors and global climate change and energy expers to study the white paper for better understanding of the conditions necessary to achieve transformational economic development for our country and meet her climate obligations". Proffering strategies for Nigeria's harmonisation with the global net-zero future, the paper suggested a three-prong approach: sustainably increasing material consumption in a manner that creates the necessary local economic conditions to attract investment to achieve carbon neutrality; substituting waste removal mechanisms from material consumption to those that meet sustainability conditions; and shifting consumption from geographies/economies with very high CO2 per capita/GDP per capita into geographies with levels too low to attain carbon neutrality, like Nigeria. Lead author of the white paper and founder of PUTTRU, Monica Maduekwe remarks that the white paper calls for Nigeria's international trade partners to act now, stressing the need for planned and targeted investments to go into strategic projects in the next 5 to 7 years. According to her, this is to avoid investing in infrastructures that are energy-intensive in the near term, since doing so will result in path dependencies that will delay the emergence of a carbon-neutral Nigeria. The white paper contributes to PUTTRU's vision to be the bridge to an Africa energy market with the ability to meet its current and future energy demands in a manner that ensures sustainable development. \</doc>

Dec 02, 2022( The Dawn: http://www.dawn.com http://www.dawn.com Pakistan was devastated by floods[1] again this year. At one point, almost a third of the country was under water. Lives, homes, and livelihoods were destroyed on a massive scale, with the total economic loss estimated at a staggering $15.2 billion.[2] It was against this backdrop that Pakistan led the Group of 77[3] at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference  COP27  held in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, last month. HYPERLINK https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1722792 https://www.dawn.com/news/card/1722792 [4] At an otherwise lacklustre and fruitless conference, the closing hours of COP27 saw the signing by nearly 200 nations of an agreement to create the 'loss and damage' fund.[5] Its designated purpose is to help vulnerable countries adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. In Pakistan, this is being hailed as a 'landmark' achievement. However, before claiming victory over climate reparations, it is important to gain some perspective. #a-history-of-empty-promisesA history of empty promises The 'loss and damage' fund in its current form is only a fancy showpiece  shiny on the outside, but hollow on the inside. The intention of the developed world was shaky from the very start when advocates of the loss and damage fund struggled to even get it on the agenda. While the agreement has been signed, no concrete decisions have been taken. In fact, key issues  who will pay, who will benefit, and the amount of the fund  have been postponed for next year's COP28 conference. In the meanwhile, a transitional committee is being set up to make these decisions, which is not scheduled to meet[6] until March 2023. The history of climate reparations from the developed world casts a long shadow over this year's fund. At best, it should leave us sceptical about its material impact. In 2009, a pledge by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to raise $100b in climate finance annually[7] never truly materialised. A small portion of funds raised[8] actually reached the 48 poorest countries of the world. After the 'loss and damage' fund was announced, the NGO, Global Witness, said[9] that all other actions on climate action lack any ounce of credibility if the $100 billion is not delivered by next year. And it is right. HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/Global_Witness/status/1595432492172947456 https://twitter.com/Global_Witness/status/1595432492172947456 If wealthy countries fail to follow through on promises made in the past, such pledges will continue to remain only numbers on paper. The US also previously pledged $3b to the UN Green Climate Fund[10] but delivered only a small portion of it. For this reason, jubilation over the 'loss and damage' fund must be contained until the agreement takes on a more tangible form. #so-whats-landmark-about-itSo what's landmark about it? Wealthy countries have shied away from signing agreements in the past. The Paris Climate Accords, the OECD pledge, or the Glasgow Pact did not create legally binding obligations on climate reparations. That is also why funds under the previous pledges never properly materialised. Apart from the announcement of the fund, the COP27 conference was a disappointing event. The wealthy countries failed to make any progress on crucial steps required to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Research Institute, said that while progress on loss and damage was encouraging, it was disappointing that the decision mostly 'copy and pasted language' from last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow about curbing emissions, rather than taking any significant new steps. HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/anidasguptawri/status/1594330933683163136 https://twitter.com/anidasguptawri/status/1594330933683163136 In fact, post-Covid recovery and energy shortages created due to the Russia-Ukraine War has meant that the developed world has moved backwards, instead of forwards in fulfilling its climate goals. According to the Glasgow Pact,[11] each country was required to send plans to the United Nations each year, outlining how they would honour their commitment to limit global warming to 1.5-degrees. Australia submitted plans that did nothing to limit their emissions. The US was unable to pass legislation to meet its 2030 goal of halving emissions below 2010 levels. Canada is unlikely to even send a plan this year. And with oil and gas prices rising, the European Union is trying to balance its climate goals with energy security. #the-hypocrisy-of-it-allThe hypocrisy of it all Lack of action on these fronts directly impacts countries like Pakistan that contribute very little to global greenhouse gas emissions but remain highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Ironically, US climate envoy John Kerry said at the COP27 conference that the US will increase its contributions towards international climate finance, which would make it the single largest contributor of climate finance. This statement appeared hypocritical and self-aggrandising. Since the 1850s, the US has produced the most total carbon dioxide emissions in the world, more than twice as much as the second country on the list. It is also the largest oil and gas consumer, and the third largest coal consumer in the world. Climate reparations is a right that the US owes to climate vulnerable countries. It is not a gift, and it certainly must not be played up for soft politics. HYPERLINK https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co-emissions?country=USA~PAK~BRA~CHN~FRA~DEU~IND~SAU~ESP~GBR https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co-emissions?country=USA~PAK~BRA~CHN~FRA~DEU~IND~SAU~ESP~GBR [12] The developed world needs to change its attitude, but so does the developing world. G77 countries, and Pakistan in particular, should have advocated for debt forgiveness. It is doubtful that debt forgiveness would have made it on the agenda, considering the 'loss and damage' fund barely made it. But to compel an action, collective pressure must be placed. Despite its shortcomings, we are where we are on climate reparations because of it. Debt forgiveness makes humanitarian sense. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the founding declaration of principles for the international human rights framework, recognises the inherent dignity of all people on a foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world. #the-pros-of-debt-forgivenessThe pros of debt-forgiveness Pakistan is facing a grave debt crisis currently, with a chance of default within the next year. Its total outstanding debt[13] is $130b, of which $23b has to be repaid[14] within the next five years. Without money freed up from servicing external debt obligations, Pakistan will be unable to invest in social reforms. It will also undercut Pakistan's ability to rehabilitate from this year's floods and to create climate resilience for the future. There is also a strong economic argument in favour of creditor countries willing to forgive sovereign debt. Debtor countries who no longer have to service debt, will use the added wealth towards increasing imports from creditor countries. Many domestic industries in debtor countries are reliant on such imports but are suffering due to import restrictions imposed to save precious foreign exchange reserves. In creditor countries, increased exports to debtor countries will directly benefit workers, farmers, manufacturers, and local businesses. As a result, debt forgiveness will allow wealth to be transferred from savers to consumers in creditor countries, thereby incentivising economic growth through a consequential increase in demand and productive capacity. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace calls it an 'efficient fiscal boost'. The resultant loss to the respective treasuries of creditor countries will be made up by the payment of higher income and sales taxes, thus allowing wealth to trickle up instead of down. It is a win-win situation for creditor and debtor countries alike. Furthermore, when the transitional committee meets next year in March, there will no doubt be disputes amongst contributors over the amount that they actually have to transfer into the fund. As a reparatory measure, debt forgiveness will not create such issues. Decisions will be taken by each country keeping in view their fiscal flexibility, and the amount of debt forgiven can be counted towards the respective country's required contribution to the fund. By creating the 'loss and damage' fund, wealthy countries have recognised their obligation towards vulnerable countries. But progress on climate reparations has been taking place at a snail's pace. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to suffer. It is time to present radical options as viable solutions. Wealthy countries have a lot of catching up to do in contributing their fair share towards climate reparations.

Nov 15, 2022( NEI: https://www.nei.org/news https://www.nei.org/news Washington, D.C. Statement from Maria Korsnick, president and chief executive officer at the Nuclear Energy Institute[1]: 'The commitments made today at COP27 to advance the objectives of the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) Compact are important steps to achieving our global climate goals. Industry and government have come together under a shared goal of building a just and affordable energy transition during this critical moment for our climate and economy. The 24/7 CFE Compact's global community provides the support, tools and partners that organizations need to meet their full electricity demand with carbon-free resources every hour, every day, everywhere. 'Nuclear energy is the source that can make this all work. It's not enough to decarbonize some hours of the day. To meet our climate goals, we must create an energy system capable of providing carbon-free electricity every hour of the day. As the most reliable provider of carbon-free electricity, nuclear is uniquely positioned to be the backbone of the clean energy grid of the future. With the energy trilemma of security, affordability and sustainability at the forefront of COP27 this year, nuclear energy's critical role in the world's net-zero goals has never been clearer. 'These actions are essential in driving more technology-inclusive solutions needed for achieving our global climate targets. As an early signatory of the 24/7 CFE Compact, we are proud to have so many of our members join us, demonstrating our industry's commitment to delivering on decarbonization. We will continue to work together to ensure a just and affordable global energy transition.'

Nov 01, 2022( The Moderate Voice: HYPERLINK http://www.themoderatevoice.com http://www.themoderatevoice.com The next great international effort to prevent climate catastrophe looks headed for let-down at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP27 UN chief Antonio Guterres is warning that the world is headed towards a dismal future marked by more intense flooding, wildfires, drought, heat waves and extinction of species. The recent drastic and devastating floods in Pakistan are a preview of this catastrophe. He has been beating the drum loudly for several years to push governments towards much stronger actions to mitigate climate change but progress looks bleak at least is coming years. 'We must end our suicidal war against nature. The climate crisis is the defining issue of our time. And yet climate action is being put on the back burner,' Guterres said recently. 'Global greenhouse gas emissions need to be slashed by 45 percent by 2030 to have any hope of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. And yet emissions are going up at record levels - on course to a 14 percent increase this decade.' His words are backed by the best available scientific data. A new UN report on climate change warns that only 26 of 193 countries have followed through on promises made at last year's COP26. Currently, the earth is on track to warm by an average of 2.1 to 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2021 compared with pre-industrial levels. That is far more than the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius agreed in Paris and confirmed at later negotiations. Tens of millions people are likely to suffer life-threatening heat waves, food and water scarcity, and coastal flooding with each fraction of a degree of warming. Millions of mammals, insects, birds and plants will disappear. Hurricanes, typhoons, vast forest fires and similarly lethal climate events will increase around the world, particularly affecting the Caribbean islands and American coastal areas including heavily populated urban centers. Climate disasters are natural events accelerated by human follies that generate gases choking the earth's atmosphere. The only solutions are whole-of-world cooperation to share the burdens of inventing, designing and implementing effective measures to slow down changes. Regrettably and frighteningly, the geopolitical environment is no longer one of the peaceful collaboration that characterised multilateral affairs in 2015 when the Paris accords and later improvements were agreed among the US, China, Europe and other nations. Currently, the entire US-led West is engaged in an intensifying trade war with China and Russia that is dividing the world's financial and technology systems into rival blocs. There is an emerging 'you are with us or against us' attitude in the US-led western bloc as its hostility grows towards China and especially Russia because of the invasion of Ukraine. The European Union (EU), which was a deeply committed proponent of the Paris goals, is being forced by the Ukraine war to walk back its enthusiasm because of increasingly severe difficulties in supplying the electricity and energy needs of its industries and people. A chief reason is determination to punish Russia by stopping or drastically reducing imports of gas and oil to deny it funds to finance the Ukraine invasion. The EU is doing so at the cost of high inflation, cutbacks in energy consumption at the risk of social unrest, and a looming economic recession. Over the next five years, it wants to sharply reduce dependence for its energy needs on Russia, which supplied almost 40% in recent years. The EU is collectively as wealthy and productive as the US but is in the throes of a profound structural transformation away from fossil fuels to green energies like wind, solar and hydrogen. This very difficult transformation has been thrown into high gear suddenly by Russia's reckless invasion so European governments are turning again to oil, gas and coal, but from anywhere other than Russia. This return to hydrocarbons in both the US and EU has put the idealistic thinking underlying the Paris accords and COP27 on the back burner despite clear recognition that only green energy can save all of us from climate catastrophe. But they are not low cost and well-developed enough to make the switch in less than 10 to 20 years. According to McKinsey's 2022 Global Energy Perspective, fossil fuels still have critical roles to play in the years to come. Demand for natural gas is expected to increase 10 to 20 percent by 2035 and could remain an important part of total primary energy demand by 2050, even as the world transitions to alternative energy sources. If the Democrats lose either the Congress or Senate or both on November 8, which falls before the closure of COP27 on November 18, American negotiators will lose clout because foreign governments will no longer believe in President Joe Biden's ability to deliver global leadership. An each-country-for-itself attitude could emerge during coming years. Transformation towards green energy sources is a massive issue estimated to cost trillions of dollars. The International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook published on 27 October estimates that annual clean energy investments of at least $2 trillion will be needed by 2030 and $4 trillion by 2050. An 2019 estimate by Stanford University places at $73 trillion the cost of a global effort to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050. To dampen the disparities between rich and poor countries, the US led a commitment by rich nations in 2009 to provide $100 billion annually to poorer nations by 2020. But pledges have fallen far short and the finance made available is mostly loans rather than grants. That puts additional debt burdens on poor countries, especially at a time of rising inflation and higher dollar interest rates fixed by the US Federal Reserve.

Nov 11, 2022( Axios: http://axios.com http://axios.com Delivered by Newstex) A new UN Live program is trying to mediate inclusivity issues at COP27 through "digital portals," or repurposed shipping containers placed around the world and outfitted for long-distance conversations. The big picture: Past UN climate summits have been criticized[1] for a lack of diverse representation, and this year's event is no different, as activists from African nations have faced[2] barriers to entry. "Many activists have been denied access to accreditations," Ugandan youth climate justice activist Nyombi Morris told Axios from COP27 . How it works: The 'digital portals' are repurposed shipping containers with floor-to-ceiling screens placed in public and private institutions around the world. This week, they connected people not physically at COP27 with attendees at the event  like a life-sized FaceTime. Designed for UN Live's Global We for Climate Action program[3]  which is funded by the IKEA Foundation  12 portals in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Mali, India,South Africa, Barbados, Iraq, Mexico, Denmark and the U.S., were linked to a corresponding portal at COP27 . The backstory: From Indigenous peoples left out of[4] last year's summit to men taking up 74%[5] of speaking time during plenary sessions, issues with inclusion and representation were in abundance at COP26. This year, activists from African nations have been reporting[6] problems with accreditation, visa requirements and funding needed to attend COP27 . "Many voices are being silenced," Morris told Axios. Molly Voss Fannon, CEO of UN Live  the main organization operating the portals  told Axios they have been working with African activists who were unable to make this year's summit because of those obstacles."We are bringing in climate activists who were not able to attend, to come into portals where we already have them standing up in Africa," Fannon said, speaking to Axios from COP27 . What they found: Kumi Naidoo, a South African human rights and climate activist, told Axios in an email that he spoke with officials from the International Trade Union Confederation and activists in Ethiopia and Sudan through the portal in Johannesburg. "The Global We programme is ensuring that those that live on the front lines are not mere spectators but are the central players in trying to shape their destiny, which should be a critical part of our climate response," Naidoo wrote. Of note: Organizers say portal conversations are recorded with machine learning tools, which then transcribe them and convert them into records that will be shared online in a digital archive to be available as a resource for world leaders, historians and the broader public. Fannon hopes to see the portals used at COP28, and beyond. "We're building what we aspire to become the world's largest and most inclusive conversation on climate," Fannon told Axios. Yes, but: Around 37%[7] of the world's population has never accessed the Internet, and nearly all of the roughly 2.9 billion people that have no digital access live in developing countries  which are most heavily impacted by climate change  according to a 2021[8] UN report. Between the lines: Although most of the portals that launched during COP27 are in developing nations, few are in places without digital connectivity, where representation in the global climate conversation is largely lacking[9]. Only two sites were set up in places without stable Internet access. At the Nakivale refugee settlement in Uganda, Africa and the Harsham refugee camp in Erbil, Iraq, portals used mobile data and local nonprofits to connect to COP27 . And just four of the 25 portal sites that organizers say will be up and running by the end of 2022, to be used for future social impact conversations, will be hosted in areas without digital access. What they're saying: Fannon told Axios they "decidedly designed" the program to be able to operate in spots without stable internet connectivity. "We are determined to allow everyone to be part of the conversation."

Nov 10, 2022( Foreign Policy: HYPERLINK http://www.foreignpolicy.com http://www.foreignpolicy.com Welcome toForeign Policy's South Asia Brief. COP27 , Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar meets his Russian counterpart in Moscow, and China and India have their eyes on Nepal's parliamentary elections. If you would like to receive South Asia Brief in your inbox every Thursday, please sign up here[1]. South Asia Calls for Loss and Damage at COP27 Pakistan is weathering a furious political storm[2] at home, along with an economic crisis. But at this year's United Nations climate change conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt known as COP27  Islamabad is leading the charge in the global fight for climate aid to the developing world. Pakistan currently chairs the G-77 group, comprised of 134 developing countries at the U.N., and Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, is a vice chair of COP27 . Before the conference began, Islamabad succeeded[3] in putting the issue of 'loss and damage' onto the summit agenda. As currently envisioned, loss and damage financing would involve developed countries providing support to developing countries on the front lines of the climate crisis. Developed countries have long resisted such a policy, fearing it will make them vulnerable to continuous demands for compensation, given their outsized production of greenhouse gas emissions. But Pakistan has a golden opportunity to make the case for wealthy countries to embrace loss and damage aid and for international donors to make new commitments for aid focused on adaptation and mitigation. Pakistan's catastrophic floods this year triggered[4] by early and intense monsoon rains offer a vivid example of why loss and damage is so compelling. The disaster, which submerged one-third of the country and affected 33 million people, provides a perfect data point. The flooding and its aftermath have so far cost the cash-strapped country around $40 billion[5], as well as a projected 2.2 percent[6] decline in GDP. At COP27 Shortly before COP27 , Indian Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav released a statement[9] calling for action on climate finance, adaptation, and loss and damage. Bangladesh's environment minister, Md. Shahab Uddin, has promised[10] to push for loss and damage funding, too. In his COP27 speech, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said[11] that developing countries 'need to be compensated for loss and damage.' Even Afghanistan's Taliban have echoed[12] the language of loss and damage. With its global clout, India could play a key role in advocating for loss and damage financing. India made ambitious carbon-emissions-reduction pledges[13] at last year's climate summit. It has backed them up with mitigation strategies, including major investments[14] in renewable energy that have made it one of the world's fastest-growing solar markets[15]. India's efforts can drive home a powerful message: Developing countries may seek loss and damage help, but they are also willing and capable when it comes to fighting climate change. This isn't to suggest these efforts will result in immediate policy success. It's a major victory for South Asia and its G-77 partners just to get loss and damage on the U.N. climate summit's agenda. But the negotiations over loss and damage will be long and acrimonious, and there's unlikely to be an agreement or even a breakthrough by the end of COP27 . What We're Following Jaishankar visits Moscow. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow on Tuesday. The visit marked the first time[17] that Jaishankar has visited Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in February. The meeting did not appear to yield any notable new agreements, although both sides described it as an opportunity to discuss bilateral issues. Jaishankar said[18] that the 'Ukraine war was a dominant feature' in his talks with Lavrov. The trip is notable for its timing: It comes as India, a close partner of Russia, shows signs of frustration with the war in Ukraine, though it has not condemned the invasion outright. At a regional summit in September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told[19] Russian President Vladimir Putin that 'today's era is not an era of war.' This week, a New York Times report[20] highlighted the possibility that India might pitch itself as a mediator to help end the war. Jaishankar did not travel to Ukraine this week, but Modi told[21] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in October that India is prepared to be involved in peace efforts. Even if it is well positioned[22] to mediate, in reality New Delhi isn't going to volunteer for the task unless asked by both sides. Jaishankar's visit to Moscow likely pushed the stance that India has taken for weeks: Diplomacy, dialogue, and de-escalation are urgently needed.

After last week's assassination attempt[23] on Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan, the political temperature remains high. On Thursday, Khan's anti-government 'long march' resumed[24] from the spot where he was shot and wounded in Wazirabad, Pakistan. Later this month, the protest is expected to arrive in Rawalpindi[25], home to Pakistan's military headquarters and where Khan, who was released from hospital this week, promises[25] to return to the march. He has said[26] the protest will eventually reach Islamabad, but he hasn't specified a date. Khan, who was ousted as prime minister earlier this year, has not toned down his confrontational rhetoric. He has repeatedly accused[27] three officials of involvement in the attack: Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and a senior intelligence official, Faisal Naseer. (The government has denied[28] the accusations.) On Monday, Khan sent a letter[29] to Pakistani President Arif Alvi appealing to him to take note of 'serious wrongdoings' by certain parts of the military leadership and to conduct an investigation. Khan's letter accuses military and intelligence officials of various abuses of power; such specific allegations against top security leaders from a senior member of the political class are rare in Pakistan. There is little that Alvi, a member of Khan's party, can do; Pakistan's presidency is a ceremonial role. But it's significant that Khan went over the military leadership's head, marking the latest escalation in a growing confrontation between Khan, the government, and the military which until earlier this year was allied with Khan. Nepal prepares for elections. Nepal holds parliamentary elections on Nov. 20, pitting Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba against an opposition alliance led by former Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli. Deuba and Oli are two of the most dominant figures in Nepali politics. The election is sure to be watched closely in both Beijing and New Delhi. One of the campaign's big storylines is geopolitics[30]: Nepal has become a major battleground for India-China competition. China's influence in Kathmandu grew during Oli's most recent term, from 2018 to 2021, as the two countries inked infrastructure deals linked to its Belt and Road Initiative. Deuba is seen as more aligned with India. Last week, the Indian government sent 200 vehicles to Nepal to facilitate election logistics; the Indian Embassy said[31] Kathmandu requested the cars. In Foreign Policy, Marcus Andreopoulos wrote[32] that the Chinese Communist Party has sought to shape Nepali politics through both official diplomacy and soft power. Under the Radar Afghanistan's Taliban regime has reported significant achievements in bilateral trade. This week, the deputy prime minister's office announced[33] that Afghanistan exported $1.8 billion in goods over the last seven months, including carpets, fruits and vegetables, coal, and semiprecious stones. Products went to China, India, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan. Islamabad alone imported $744 million worth of goods. The trade data represents a twofold increase over the same period last year. It shows that despite tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan since the Taliban takeover last year, commercial cooperation with Islamabad and other neighbors remains robust. The Taliban's ability to generate government revenue[34] from cross-border activities, including trade as well as customs tariffs, remains one of its few economic successes. Regional Voices The Print editor D.K. Singh notes[35] the 'growing indiscipline and factionalism' within India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the inability of party leaders to rein it in, leaving the task to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 'He is expected to play arbiter and keep the flock together but he may have reasons to be disappointed with his senior party colleagues,' he writes. A Himalayan Times editorial warns[36] that sluggish export performance is contributing to Nepal's balance-of-payment crisis, which remains serious despite some recent relief from increased remittances. 'If countries like Laos, Cambodia and Mongolia can export goods worth $6-9 billion annually, there is no reason why we should lag behind,' it argues. Author Sibtain Naqvi argues[37] in the Business Recorder that former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has defied expectations that he would become weaker after being ousted from power. 'Even his most ardent supporters would not imagine that a few months after losing the prime minister's seat, Imran's popularity would grow,' he writes.

BRUSSELS, Belgium, Oct. 12 -- The European Union's Committee of the Regions issued the following news release: Less than one month ahead of COP27 - the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC), the European Committee of the Regions (CoR) has renewed its calls for sub-national governments to have a stronger role in global climate negotiations and further recognition in the implementation of the Paris agreement. The CoR proposes a global system to collect and monitor cities' and regions' carbon emission reductions, and calls on Member States and the Council of the EU to unequivocally support the inclusion, within the COP27 conclusions, of the urgent need for multilevel cooperation action and for the full involvement of local and regional authorities in the implementation of the Paris agreement. Following a summer of massive droughts, floods and fires across the EU and with soaring energy prices, inflation and millions of Europeans threaten to fall into energy poverty this winter, the energy and climate crisis is on top of the discussions at the CoR's October plenary session and the 2022 European Week of Regions and Cities. Ahead of the UN climate conference that is to kick off in Sharm El Sheikh on 6 November, CoR members held a plenary debate on the role of subnational authorities at COP27 with the Vice-Chair of the ENVI committee at the European Parliament Bas Eickhout, the Mayor of Utrecht at ICLEI envoy at COP27 Sharon Dijksma and the Mayor of Chefchaouenand ICLEI regional chair for Africa and Mohamed Sefiani. Opening the debate, Vasco Alves Cordeiro, President of the European Committee of the Regions, said: "The climate crisis is becoming more and more evident to everybody's eyes: we need to act urgently and move from commitments to achievements. What will be decided at COP27 will shape climate and energy policies and have an impact on all local and regional authorities. This year's COP27 takes place in the midst of the energy crisis, a crisis exacerbated by Putin's war against Ukraine, but that is something we should have tackled already decades ago by shifting towards a climate-neutral economy. The European Committee of the Regions will be very vocal at COP27 and continue to work to reinforce its alliances at EU and global level to achieve this goal." Rafa&#322; Trzaskowski (PL/EPP), Mayor of Warsaw and new chair of the CoR's ENVE commission and of the Green Deal Going Local working group, said: "Thanks to a massive investment in LED lightning on the streets of Warsaw, we have reduced energy consumption and public spending substantially. Many other European cities and regions are committed to implement sustainable solutions that make local communities a healthier and better place to live in. We therefore call for direct funds to facilitate the work of local and regional authorities in accelerating the energy transition. Furthermore, we call for COP27 to take into account the voice of cities and regions and we welcome the support of the European Parliament for further multilevel cooperation. We now call on the European Commission's Executive Vice-PresidentFransTimmermansto fight for a stronger role for cities and regions at the COP27 negotiation table." The European Parliament's ENVI COP27 resolution, voted on Monday 3 October, supports the CoR proposals for multilevel cooperation and a stronger role of cities and regions in the implementation of the Paris agreement. Through opinions by Alison Gilliland (IE/PES) and Olgierd Geblewicz (PL/EPP), the EU's assembly of cities and regions aims at strengthening the role local and regional governments in global climate negotiations and the implementation of the Paris agreement. Sub-national authorities and city diplomacy can overcome current bottlenecks in global climate negotiations and demonstrate that higher ambition is possible to accelerate energy efficiency and the deployment of renewable energies as the only solution to tackle the current energy and climate crisis. Dublin city councillor, Alison Gilliland (IE/PES), rapporteur of the opinion 'Towards a structural inclusion of Cities and Regions in UNFCCC COP 27 ', said: "Ourecosystemsare damaged andfragile and manyimpacts of the climate crisis are already irreversible. Wecannot allow the war and the energy crisis to stop the just transition towards a cleaner and more sustainable planet.Cities and regions needmore direct finance and greater support to reach our climate goals. As defined by theGlasgow Climate Pact, we need inclusive governance and we call on all CoR members to be proactive in pushing their national delegations for an explicit reference in the Council Conclusions on the key role that subnational authorities play in this transition." Olgierd Geblewicz (PL/EPP), President of West Pomerania Region and rapporteur of the opinion 'The CoR's role in boosting subnational climate diplomacy ahead of COP27 and COP28', said: "Sub-national and city diplomacy are not sufficiently recognised nor exploited. Cities and regions are at the forefront in dealing with the consequences of climate change but also of climate solutions. Local and regional authorities are instruments for citizen engagement and community empowerment, without which we cannot deliver on the promises of the Paris agreement. We call on the European Commission to engage local and regional authorities as ambassadors of citizens in climate negotiations. As the EU's assembly of cities and regions, the CoR stands ready to become the institution that coordinates sub-national climate diplomacy with EU partner countries." Jakub Piotr Che&#322;stowski (PL/ECR), president of the &#346;l&#261;skie Voivodeship and CoR rapporteur on the 'Energy package on gas, hydrogen and methane emissions', also took part in the debate, stressing that: "The New Gas Package and the Methane Regulation are key to the strategic objectives of the European Green Deal, as well as the 'Fit for 55' package and REPowerEU. Developing markets for hydrogen and biomethane and reducing methane emissions is also crucial for our regional economies and for keeping up with our climate ambition."

The following information was released by the Government of Canada: Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ), the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and John Kerry, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, together welcomed continued close collaboration between Canada and the United States to further reduce methane emissions from their respective oil and gas operations. Both countries agree that significant opportunities exist to eliminate routine venting and flaring, enhance leak detection and repair, and address problems such as blow-downs and other potentially large releases. During their meeting on the sidelines of COP27 , Minister Guilbeault and Special Envoy Kerry took note of the pivotal moment in time with respect to climate. Both underscored the need to avoid backsliding on commitments made at COP26 in Glasgow, the importance of countries implementing concrete actions to reach their climate goals, and limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Cutting oil and gas methane emissions is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to combat climate change. Methane is a potent, but relatively short-lived, greenhouse gas, and is eighty-six times more harmful than carbon dioxide over a twenty-year period. Now that profit margins are robust and energy prices are high, the time is right to invest to reduce emissions in the oil and gas sector. Making investments now will position the North American oil and gas industry among the cleanest in the world and enable it to compete in an increasingly decarbonizing industry. \</doc>

Stakeholders in Kenya's electricity sector have announced plans to achieve 100% renewable energy usage by 2030, the Standard reported. Under the name the Electricity Sector Association of Kenya (Esak), the group aims to join forces to counter the effects of global climate change resulting from the use of fossil fuels. Kenya's renewable energy sources currently account for 70% of the country's installed electrical capacity. They include hydropower, geothermal, bioenergy, wind and solar energy. Kenya's energy mix comprises bioenergy (64.6% of total primary energy supply), oil products (16.9 %), renewable energy sources (15.2%) and coal and hydropower (1.9 %), according to the country' energy regulator. United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 "In line with the current administration's agenda on introducing reliability and affordability of power, we commit to encouraging the sustainable development of the Kenyan electricity sector through collaboration, advocacy and data-driven solutions, as a result maintaining investor confidence through a predictable and stable business environment,'' said Esak Chairperson, George Aluru. ``This is even as we build the value chain and grow demand by attracting global industrial investors looking to accelerate their sustainability agenda by leveraging Kenya's existing 90 per cent renewable electricity grid. This will position Kenya as a leader in the green industrial revolution," he said. \</doc>

As defined by the Glasgow Climate Pact, we need inclusive governance and we call on all CoR members to be proactive in pushing their national delegations for an explicit reference in the Council Conclusions on the key role that subnational authorities play in this transition." Olgierd Geblewicz (PL/EPP), President of West Pomerania Region and rapporteur of the opinion 'The CoR's role in boosting subnational climate diplomacy ahead of COP27 and COP28', said: "Sub-national and city diplomacy are not sufficiently recognised nor exploited. Cities and regions are at the forefront in dealing with the consequences of climate change but also of climate solutions. Local and regional authorities are instruments for citizen engagement and community empowerment, without which we cannot deliver on the promises of the Paris agreement. We call on the European Commission to engage local and regional authorities as ambassadors of citizens in climate negotiations. As the EU's assembly of cities and regions, the CoR stands ready to become the institution that coordinates sub-national climate diplomacy with EU partner countries." Jakub Piotr Chelstowski (PL/ECR), president of the Slaskie Voivodeship and CoR rapporteur on the 'Energy package on gas, hydrogen and methane emissions', also took part in the debate, stressing that: "The New Gas Package and the Methane Regulation are key to the strategic objectives of the European Green Deal, as well as the 'Fit for 55' package and REPowerEU. Developing markets for hydrogen and biomethane and reducing methane emissions is also crucial for our regional economies and for keeping up with our climate ambition."

The COP 27 climate summit is taking place amid a rash of political, economic and environmental upheavals, including missed funding and emission targets, increased pollution and climate devastation, rising global inflation, cuts in Western development assistance and the negative after-effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The summit\\x97the 27th Conference of State Parties ( COP27 ), scheduled for November 6 through 18-- is billed as one of the largest annual gatherings on climate action, this time in the Egyptian coastal town of Sharm el-Sheikh. The Brussels-based Centre for UN Constitutional Research (CUNCR) predicts COP27 \\x93will likely face the same empty promises and no actions by most big countries responsible for climate change.\\x94 In a message during the launch of the UN Environment Programme\\x92s (UNEP) Adaptation Gap report released on the eve of COP27 , Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warns \\x93the world is failing to protect people from the here-and-now impacts of the climate crisis\\x94. \\x93Those on the front lines of the climate crisis are at the back of the line for support. The world is falling far short, both in stopping the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and starting desperately needed efforts, to plan, finance and implement adaptation in light of growing risks\\x94. He also pointed out that adaptation needs in the developing world are set to skyrocket to as much as $340 billion a year by 2030. \\x93Yet adaptation support today stands at less than one-tenth of that amount. The most vulnerable people and communities are paying the price. This is unacceptable,\\x94 Guterres said. Gadir Lavadenz, Global Coordinator, Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice (DCJ), told IPS COP 27 \\x93It is outrageous to still see big corporations manipulating and dominating this process. Big polluters have a role to play, stop polluting and not use the climate COPs to greenwash their actions. COP 27 must deliver a strong message to the world that the multilateral system can still play a role in the climate crisis\\x94. Lavadenz also pointed out that the annual $100 billion target was not only evaded systematically by developed nations, but it has demonstrated to be insufficient to deal with the magnitude of our climate crisis and there is growing evidence of this. \\x93COP 27, unlike its predecessor, should move away from false solutions like geo-engineering, carbon offsets, nature-based solutions and others and instead focus on the matters that have the potential to impact the most vulnerable countries and groups\\x94. Finance is not about cold numbers, but about the lives at risk in this very moment and that have no means to deal with a problem caused by the consumerist culture of a small privileged portion of this world. \\x93COP 27 cannot be remembered as just another meeting, but as a moment to show progress and hope through real solutions\\x94, declared Lavadenz, who is the Coordinator of a global network of over 200 grassroot, regional, and global networks and organizations advocating climate justice. Flagging a new report from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters October 26 that countries are bending the curve of global greenhouse gas emissions downward, but the report underscores that these efforts remain insufficient to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. The report shows that current commitments will increase emissions by 10.6 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. This is considered an improvement over last year\\x92s assessment, which found that countries were on a path to increase emissions by 13.7 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels, \\x93but it is still not good news\\x94. Just 26 of 193 countries that agreed last year to intensify their climate actions have followed through, pointing Earth toward a future marked by climate catastrophes, according to the U.N. report Meena Raman, a Senior Researcher at the Third World Network, a member organization of Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice (DCJ), told IPS the $100 billion target is supposed to be $100 billion per year. \\x93This target is not expected to be realised and is complicated by how climate finance is counted.\\x94 She pointed out that the definition of what climate finance is in itself an issue being addressed at the COP. \\x93Given that many developing countries are in debt distress, the provision of more loans which need to be paid back presents a very major problem for those countries who need the finance\\x94. What is needed, she argued, is more grants for especially tackling adaptation needs and funds to address loss and damage. Meeting the climate finance needs of developing countries through non-debt creating instruments is critical, including through the reform and re-channeling of Special Drawing Rights as outright grants for climate finance. COP 27 must not be a lost cause. It is the time for implementing in real terms the commitments made by developed countries, Raman declared. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters last week: \\x93When we were together at COP26, (in Scotland in October-November 2021), we brought forward a declaration, a statement, for the elimination or the reduction of methane gas by 30 percent by 2030.\\x94 \\x93We are now looking at most countries committing to this. If everyone did this, this would be the equivalent of removing all vehicles and all the ships and all the planes that are currently out in the world in terms of emissions. So, we can have a real impact. We can do what is needed to maintain the 1.5 degree Celsius rise of temperature\\x94, he declared. IPS UN Bureau Report \</doc>

(TNSres) -- The University of Bristol issued the following news release:    A team of leading University of Bristol researchers on hot topics, ranging from climate change policy to adapting to a warming world and ensuring the transition to a net zero economy is fair, are poised to join the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference .    The climate researchers from the university's world-renowned Cabot Institute for the Environment will travel to Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt next week where the summit, better known as COP27 , is being held on Sunday 6 November until 18 November. Policy and adaptation expert Dr Rachel James, climate justice specialist Dr Alix Dietzel, and energy and climate policy expert Dr Colin Nolden will be sharing their expertise at various events. As the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change marks its 30th anniversary, the impacts of climate change are becoming more apparent over the past year with worsening weather extremes across the world, including in the UK which saw record-breaking heatwaves during the summer. The conference seeks to accelerate global climate action through reducing emissions, increasing adaptation efforts, and improving sufficient funding, while also making sure the transition is just and fair. Dr Rachel James is a climate scientist, focusing on African climate systems and developing climate science to inform and advance climate change policy. Her previous research has been designed to progress international climate policy discussions, including the COP process, and analysed the impacts of global mitigation goals comparing different warming scenarios. Dr James has also looked at how science can support the negative impact, known as 'loss and damage', from climate change. Her wide-ranging expertise will help further relevant meetings and discussions at the gathering. Dr James said: "With the war in Ukraine and a cost of living crisis, it would be easy to lose sight of the importance of climate action. But we can't afford to wait, the urgency of addressing climate change has never been greater. And that's particularly true for African countries, which are projected to experience some of the most damaging impacts of climate change. "There have already been many devastating extreme weather events in African countries this year - tropical cyclones in Mozambique and Madagascar, flooding across West Africa, and drought in Ethiopia and Uganda. These barely get a mention in the UK news. That's why an Africa-led COP is so important: to highlight the loss and damage associated with climate change, and the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions, to adapt to the changes that are already underway, and for action and support to address inevitable loss and damage." Dr Alix Dietzel is a Senior Lecturer in Climate Justice and Associate Director for Impact and Innovation at the Cabot Institute. Focusing both on global and local climate policy, she is interested in how fair and equitable the response to climate change is and how to ensure a just transition is achieved. Her role at COP27 Dr Dietzel's previous work includes a study into how decisions on just transition are made in Bristol, as well as extensive research on how well the global governance of climate change, including COPs and outcomes like the Paris Agreement, protect human rights and ensure those responsible for climate change do their part to address it. Dr Dietzel said: "This COP is extremely important for moving forward on a just transition that is socially inclusive and ensuring loss and damage is properly financed. It is increasingly clear the effects of climate change are highly unequal and we have to look to those who have caused the most damage to ensure people are compensated, while also ensuring we move forward on climate change in a fair and inclusive manner at the global and local level." Dr Colin Nolden works on energy and climate policy across a range of different academic disciplines, including law, geography, engineering and business. His research, which intersects energy demand, markets, and communities, spans governance frameworks to support energy poverty alleviation efforts at a community level to international climate clubs to raise ambition among countries implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change objectives. Dr Nolden said: "Recent reports by various United Nations bodies indicate the revised Nationally Determined Contributions put forward by the 195 signatories of the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon emissions are still insufficient to limit global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial level. "As it stands, we are likely to witness warming exceeding 1.5 degrees in this decade, a level beyond which we start significantly increasing the risk of passing irreversible tipping points in the climate system. There are also more than 300 other climate scientists and researchers at the University of Bristol who will be following the COP27 proceedings, sharing their expertise and insights with local, national, and international media. Professor Guy Howard, Director of the Cabot Institute and Global Research Chair for Environmental and Infrastructure Resilience, said: "The world needs to take urgent actions on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow global heating, and to support countries and communities to adapt. Building resilience will be critical given the changes the world is already experiencing. Ensuring that the breadth excellence of the research at Bristol in tackling these issues is visible at COP27 is important in our mission to help solve global crises. As we have observer status with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Alix, Rachel and Colin will have the chance to engage with policy makers and negotiators to help provide them with the best evidence to help inform future actions."

The University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine posted the following news on Dec. 1, 2022: United Nations climate change conference , COP27 "Penn has real expertise on climate solutions, so it's really important for us to participate in these international venues where finding solutions is the number one priority," says Cornelia Colijn, executive director of the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy and one of two heads of Penn's delegation, with Michael Weisberg, the Bess W. Heyman President's Distinguished Professor in the Department of Philosophy. More than 30 representatives from across the University--including the Kleinman Center, Perry World House (PWH), School of Arts & Sciences, Penn Carey Law School, School of Veterinary Medicine, Stuart Weitzman School of Design, Penn Institute for Urban Research (Penn IUR), and more--participated in COP27 . Shortly after the conclusion of COP27 , Magill and Penn Board of Trustees Chair Scott L. Bok published a statement--which will also run in the Dec. 6 issue of the Almanac--articulating how Penn is responding to the challenge of climate change in its management of the endowment (see the sidebar). The University has also launched a new website designed to centrally curate its work on sustainability in the hope of making it easier for the University community to follow Penn's efforts to combine its research, educational, operational, and investment initiatives aimed at addressing climate change. Overall, the 27th Conference of Parties brought together nearly 200 nations that had signed on to the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Climate Agreement was adopted at COP21 in 2015, when nearly every country in the world agreed to curb emissions to prevent global warming from surpassing 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, the temperature at which dangerous climate "tipping points" become increasingly likely. Since then, the annual conferences have focused on enacting policies and measuring progress to keep warming under that level, as well as taking actions that protect humans and ecosystems as the planet warms. This year, the three major objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement guided the talks: adaptation, mitigation, and financing. Adaptation addresses how countries will adjust to the unavoidable effects of climate change. Mitigation concerns how countries will moderate their emissions to prevent further warming. Financing addresses who will pay for these efforts. The agreement surrounding loss and damage is a significant win, says Scott Moore, director of China programs and strategic initiatives at Penn Global. "This is the biggest thing to happen in international climate diplomacy since Paris--by a mile," he says. "I don't think many saw it coming." While global events like this often spotlight political leaders, nongovernmental organizations and research institutions like Penn also play a key role in sharing knowledge and lending legitimacy to the negotiations, says Weisberg, who is also director of postgraduate programs at PWH. "One thing of great importance that university researchers can do," he adds, "is to be there at the right moment to offer their expertise to the governments and civil society organizations trying to solve the climate crisis."    Adapting to a changing world Despite efforts to limit emissions, increased incidence of droughts, wildfires, floods, and extreme weather events around the world show that the effects of climate change are here and unavoidable. This reality made adaptation one of the most pressing issues at this year's COP and stoked an urgent need for solutions, says Melissa Brown Goodall, senior director of the Environmental Innovations Initiative in Penn's Office of the Provost. Adaptation strategies won't look the same around the world, and they'll require specific expertise to tailor them to each environment and circumstances. "The adaptation narrative is particularly important to Penn," Goodall says, because multiple centers at the University focus on adaptation research. For instance, climate change threatens global food supply chains, requiring a holistic solution that considers the welfare of animals, people, and the environment to prevent future food shortages. That was the subject of an address by Andrew Hoffman, the Gilbert S. Kahn Dean of Veterinary Medicine at Penn Vet, at the Nairobi Work Programme Focal Point Forum, which focused on agricultural adaptation and food security. Specifically, it provided an opportunity for researchers and delegates to interface and discuss how countries will ensure their food systems remain resilient in the face of a changing climate. Under Hoffman's leadership, Penn Vet opened its Center for Stewardship Agriculture and Food Security earlier this month, a research hub for issues of agricultural adaptation that aims to promote responsible use of natural resources in agriculture. Eugenie Birch, the Lawrence C. Nussdorf Professor of Urban Research in the Weitzman School and co-director of Penn IUR, joined the launch of several campaigns on urban adaptation. One, called "Roofs Over Our Heads," is an effort to publicize and address the needs of informal settlements, led by PWH visiting fellow Sheela Patel. Another looks at ways to finance projects to beat urban heat; visiting scholar and former mayor of Quito, Ecuador, Mauricio Rodas, who is now affiliated with the Kleinman Center, PWH, and Penn IUR, is a key leader on this work. Other engagements of Birch's included those focused on integrated urban development in 20 cities, resilient food initiatives, technology transfer, and urban resilience. Beyond that, she attended the first COP urban ministerial meeting as a partner and stakeholder for a project called "Sustainable Urban Resilience for the Next Generation" and participated in a process that summarizes for lawmakers the highly technical Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings. "They translated those findings into this simple, hopeful message: 'Cities are hotspots of global climate emissions and risk, but they are also hubs for innovation, action, and resilience,'" Birch explains. "It's up to us to plan and implement climate-resilient cities around the world."    Mitigating emissions Dealing with climate change isn't just about adapting to a new world; there are still ways to mitigate the problems that emerge in a warmer planet and to thwart further warming. The latest IPCC report states that to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels, countries need to cut their emissions in half by the end of 2030 and implement sustainable alternatives. At COP27 , Colijn shared the Kleinman Center's research on climate mitigation with global decision-makers. Every year, the Kleinman Center releases policy digests on climate issues from renewable energy sources for water-stressed regions to the influence of the Inflation Reduction Act on mining rare earth elements, the minerals used to produce wind turbines and electric vehicles. Through the conference, the center has had the chance to "connect those policy digests to people who can use them," Colijn says. Sharing tools like these, which include policy suggestions and outcomes, at a place like COP is essential to accomplishing the Kleinman Center's mission of a just energy transition, she adds. "COP really acts as a platform for deepening our policy engagement in this multilateral space."    Financing climate solutions Without financial backing, conversations around mitigation and adaptation are sure to stall, Weisberg says. "To have any hope of keeping global warming below 1.5 C, the entire global economy will have to realign with the goals of the Paris Agreement," he says. Developed countries set a target of $100 billion in climate financing every year from 2020 to 2025; at COP27 , one big aim was to close the existing gap in funding arrangements, as the world has not yet mobilized that funding. For the first time in the history of Penn's COP involvement, Penn students got to join the delegation on the ground. This semester, William Burke-White, a professor at Penn Carey Law and the inaugural director of PWH, co-taught a course on subnational climate adaptation finance with Rodas. The professors brought 10 students to Egypt to observe the finance negotiations in real time. "There is nowhere better to be these two weeks if you want to learn about climate change than in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt," says Burke-White. "It's at the heart of the action." The law students spent their semester studying how subnational actors--cities and states--receive climate financing after the U.N. negotiations distribute funds to countries. During the second week of the conference, they observed negotiations and developed a white paper to inform future finance negotiations. They are also each writing blog posts that will appear on the Kleinman Center site. Hannah Sachs, a graduate student earning a joint JD and Master in Social Policy from Penn's School of Social Policy & Practice, co-wrote one about private finance for the world's most vulnerable cities. Sachs says traveling to COP27 offered an unparalleled learning experience: "Attending COP in person allows a much more in-depth understanding of both the substance and dynamics of the negotiations."    Loss and damage Even with the efforts to adjust to climate change impacts, some of its effects are unavoidable. Colijn says one of the biggest issues at COP this year was the topic of loss and damage, which refers to the financial burdens caused by extreme and irreversible climate change circumstances. This issue of financial arrangements for addressing loss and damage isn't a new one, but this was the first time it appeared on the agenda as a formal negotiating topic. In an episode of its podcast "Energy Policy Now," the Kleinman Center covered loss and damage at COP27 The Republic of Maldives is one island nation vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Weisberg and Zeid RaÂ£d Al Hussein, a PWH Professor of Practice of Law and Human Rights, joined the delegation for the Maldives, assisting during its negotiations and providing high-level policy advice and strategy. "Michael and Zeid have provided invaluable support to the Maldives climate team since COP26," says Aminath Shauna, Maldives' Minister of Environment, Climate Change, and Technology. "Their technical guidance and knowledge, drawn from their vast experience in the fields of politics and international multilateral systems, helped us enormously." Two days after the conference was originally supposed to end, the parties at COP 27 reached an agreement--what's been described as a "landmark deal"--on loss and damage. It establishes funding for particularly vulnerable developing countries to aid in their response to global warming's biggest challenges. Many of the agreement's details will get firmed up in the months to come, including which countries will finance this and which will benefit from it.    A year-round commitment Though the U.N. climate change conference has concluded, the conversations that took place during those two weeks will influence Penn for the entire year to come. COP27 will continue to guide research directions at Penn, he adds, and the relationships built in Egypt will form the foundation for future climate negotiations. "The transfer of knowledge goes both ways," Colijn adds. "We're taking our research and bringing it to bear on what's happening within the venue. But we're also learning while we're there and bringing those new ideas and relationships back onto campus." Representatives from Penn at COP27 included the following: From the School of Arts & Sciences: Michael Weisberg, the Bess W. Heyman President's Distinguished Professor in the Department of Philosophy, and Santiago Cunial, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science.

The 27th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as the Conference of the Parties is taking place in Egypt this year. COP27 officially began on Nov. 6 and is scheduled to end on Nov. 18. Delegates have gathered in one of Egypt's most popular resort towns, Sharm El-Sheikh, alongside the coast of the Red Sea. Many important American figures and politicians will be in attendance at the 27th Climate Conference, including President Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Former Vice President and environmentalist Al Gore.\~ One of the major topics world leaders are tackling this year is settling agreements on who is financially responsible for the losses and damages of climate change in vulnerable nations. There is a large consensus that wealthy countries, such as the United States and parts of Europe should be financially responsible for the world's climate projects and costs of damage, such as extreme flooding that we've seen in places such as Pakistan, earlier this year.\~ The United States is responsible for more than 20 percent of the world's carbon emissions, even though it only inhabits five percent of the world's population. Such statistics regarding extremely high carbon emissions coming from countries like the U.S., China, Russia, India and Japan, among others, have long-time prompted the Global South to urge the world's wealthiest nations to take financial responsibility for environmental projects and damage across the globe.\~ The global south has called upon financial contributions from the west for many decades; however, there hasn't been much action until the last few years, when climate change has become increasingly hard to ignore. With deadly floods, harsh heat waves and extremely hard-hitting natural disasters, there has been less room for opposition.\~ Many countries including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland have promised to contribute amounts ranging from $2 million to $200 million in efforts to assist developing nations in coping with the effects and funding projects to provide more "green" alternatives to living.\~ French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his frustration at the lack of non-European monetary contribution, "'Europeans are paying... We are the only ones paying.'" A few days following President Macron's statement, President Biden committed $150 million to climate adaptation projects in Africa.\~ President Biden arrived in Egypt on Nov. 11, one week after most other leaders. In his speech, he discussed America's climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act and America's commitment to reduce its carbon emission by 50 percent before 2030.\~The policy is mostly focused on discouraging car transportation when possible and transforming the U.S. into a predominantly electric-running country, turning to electric cars, buses and more energy-efficient buildings and homes.\~ "There has been a significant increase in vehicle use since the pandemic started. There are so many reasons why people are using cars as their transportation now, especially in NYC where subways are not as safe as they once were," says University student Fatima Basit, majoring in Psychology with a minor in Biology. "Biden needs to create a plan for people who drive and how they can decrease vehicle energy consumption," she continued.\~ The White House announced its initiative to minimize methane and carbon dioxide emissions alongside the EU, the UK, Japan, Norway and neighboring Canada. And despite promises from the United States and others, carbon emissions are rising furiously, threatening to reach the 1.5 degree Celsius threshold within less than a decade.\~ In spite of global carbon emissions decreasing almost five percent during the height of the pandemic, when the demand for transportation significantly declined and the majority of international flights were canceled due to lockdowns across the globe, the return to normalcy has quickly erased the drop in emissions. Perhaps spending a longer time in strict lockdown could have benefitted the climate in the longer term; however, the economy's state discouraged lawmakers from extending it.\~ This year's COP is not the first time the world has initiated policies, commitments and agreements to prevent global warming. Leaders have been warned long before evident signals of disaster began to appear through droughts, floods and deadly heat waves. People are beginning to wonder how long it will be before conferences like this turn into action.\~ It's critical that small communities work towards environmentalism. Basit graduates this Spring and emphasizes the need for the University to contribute to a greener initiative, " I would love to see Pace become greener... We need to create classrooms with zero waste. Pace should plant a rain garden in the courtyard with the ecologist professors at Pace. It is essential to help students on campus to understand why recycling is important."\~ Climate change is becoming more of an emergency by the day. Annual UN conferences are certainly a start, but with countries around the world falling short of climate goals, there is room for much more.\~ \</doc>

The following information was released by the University of Connecticut: Students who attended the United Nations conference reflect on what they'll take away from it Elaina Hancock - UConn Communications This month, UConn sent 14 students to the 27th United Nations Conference of Parties Climate Conference (COP) taking place in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The COP is an opportunity for world climate experts, activists, and leaders to meet and discuss measures to act in the face of the climate crisis. UConn COP27 fellows were asked to write about their initial impressions of this world event. To read excerpts from a selection of those blogs, see below. The full list can be found on the UConn Institute of the Environment Office of Sustainability website. COP27 has been one of the most overwhelming yet formative experiences of my life thus far. Meeting some of the most influential activists, community organizers, and politicians has been humbling and enlightening. However, I have noted a distinct lack of queer representation at COP27 . Many (not all) panels show a diversity of gender, race, and background yet noticeably, there is no discussion about queer people existing in these spaces. I come from a Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies background so I feel keenly aware of how LGBTQ+ people occupy spaces and feel comfortable expressing themselves in these spaces. To say I am disappointed is somewhat of an understatement. There is so much wisdom here at COP at the variety of panels and events which tells us that diversity strengthens humanity and climate resilience as a whole. So to see a whole group of people ignored and made invisible feels disenfranchising. This is when I feel thankful to be a UConn student. This cohort of young undergraduates and graduates makes me feel hope when we begin each day with stimulating and engaging 'Breakfast Talks' where we discuss our thoughts and feelings about the conference. All the fellows come from a variety of backgrounds and throughout the day we all venture into different panels and learn a plethora of knowledge. During our morning 'Breakfast Club' I find the points of view expand my knowledge of COP27 and give me greater agency to squeeze every ounce out of the conference. I am excited about solutions day tomorrow. Climate activism can be heavy and discouraging so it is important to embrace these solutions and recognize that any change is a positive change. We Can't Hold Our Breath on Finance My experience at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh has been a whirlwind so far, often overwhelming at times in its scale and scope. The multitudes of people who traveled from every corner of the earth to share their stories of how their livelihoods are being impacted by climate change adds more gravity, reality, and clarity to the situation than ever before. On the bus ride back from the conference tonight, I sat next to a woman from the party delegation representing the pacific island nation of Vanuatu who told me of the stark impacts of climate change and associated sea level rise which have caused salt-water intrusion on their country's water supplies, forced a school near the coastline to be abandoned, reduced agricultural productivity, and degraded coral reefs and fisheries. She told me that many other small pacific island nations are facing similar challenges that are expected to worsen. These kinds of stories are ones I have heard repeatedly from voices around the world being shared here at COP27 in the three days we have been here so far. At the same time, seeing so many countries and citizens coming together in a united endeavor to address a common threat, even amidst global conflict and economic uncertainty, provides me with an upwelling of hope for the future. These examples, of many I have encountered here, provide points of indication that the world financial system is continuing to shift in a monumental way to direct the flow of investment towards the development of decarbonized economies. However, it appears many are still holding their breath here, as a major point of discussion in the COP27 negotiations is to create global finance facility for loss and damage from climate impacts on underdeveloped countries which continues to remain on the table. Challenging My Perspectives on Climate Action and What Climate Solutions Look Like Jocelyn Phung '23 (ENG) Intellectually I am attempting to absorb as much information as I can on everything that I am interested in or know nothing about. It has been an emotional rollercoaster going from being overwhelmed by the breadth and depth of climate change, to realizing that heartbreak for the destruction of life on our planet is the reason we are drawn here (Professor Phoebe Godfrey said it best), to contemplating my role in climate action, and to gaining hope for our future from all the technology, knowledge, innovations, art, poetry, and passions showcased at the conference. The first two days I was fascinated by all the new technologies, innovations and financial partnerships presented to mitigate and adapt to climate change. On the third day, however, I looked at all the information and narratives presented from a more critical lens. I reminded myself to be more critical of the solutions and data presented to me, of who is in the room and who is excluded, of who is represented, and of the interests behind narratives that are being pushed forward. From attending the Indigenous people's panels and speaking to grassroot climate justice activists, I learned about false solutions and thought more critically about how many initiatives discussed at COP27 perpetuate green capitalism and reinforce the racist, sexist, imperialist and elitist structures that destroyed our beautiful planet in the first place. It was argued that if we continue with our existing systems, the root of the problem remains unsolved. I also learned about the significance of ancestral knowledge and Indigenous perspectives as climate solutions, and how they are largely ignored in mainstream discussions. \</doc>

BEND, Ore., Nov. 10, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MindClick was celebrated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on November 10, 2022 for pledging ongoing action to decarbonize the health care sector and make health care facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. MindClick has formally committed to pursuing the Biden administration\' s climate goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. MindClick is at the forefront of this effort, as the company\' s innovative solution to green the global supply chain is driving decarbonization throughout every aspect of the product lifecycle \- from materials and manufacturing to packaging, distribution, and circularity, while reducing risk and optimizing business performance.\~ A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the number one threat to global public health. It exposes millions of people in the United States to harm every year with disproportionate impacts on communities that are often already the victims of longstanding discrimination through increases in extreme heat waves, wildfires, flooding, vector-borne diseases and other factors that worsen chronic health conditions. The healthcare sector also contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8.5 percent of U.S. domestic emissions. The HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge to help focus industry response to climate challenges. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities for both chronic and acute catastrophic climate impacts. One hundred two prominent health companies in the U.S. have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including organizations representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more. Federal systems like the Indian Health Service (IHS), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Military Health System (MHS) are working together to meet similar goals to those these private sector organizations have embraced. Combined, this means that over 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing over 15 percent of U.S. hospitals.\~  HHS returns this year to COP27 to report great progress, said ADM Rachel Levine, the Assistant Secretary for Health.  Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector.  MindClick's powerful environmental and social impact data for products used to build, furnish and supply health care facilities, is providing the decision tools\~health systems need\~to accelerate achievement of net zero carbon emissions\~goals, said JoAnna Abrams, founder and CEO of MindClick.  The product transparency we're facilitating is advancing innovation and critical collaboration between suppliers and their customers to support resiliency\~and reduction of scope 3 emissions. \~ For more information about how MindClick is responding to our nation\' s climate challenges, visit MindClick.

The following information was released by Human Rights Watch: Human Rights Watch joined representatives of 11 other independent Egyptian, regional, and international human rights organizations to meet in person in Cairo on November 12, 2022, for a roundtable hosted by the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF). The following is a joint statement from Human Rights Watch and participating groups: On 12 November, for the first time in years, representatives of 12 independent Egyptian, regional, and international human rights organizations met in person in Cairo for a roundtable hosted by the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), to discuss opportunities to promote and protect human rights in Egypt in the months and years ahead. Participants in the meeting welcomed the opportunity, made possible by the government's partial easing of restrictions on travel into Egypt for international civil society organizations during the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), to resume in person consultations between partners that should be a routine part of our work. COP27 , where the slogan "No Climate Justice without Human Rights" has gained currency. We encourage all national, regional, and international actors to support the basic rights and freedoms of people in Egypt. The participants look forward to future constructive engagement with the Egyptian government. We hope that Egypt will soon emerge from the human rights crisis that has undermined essential human interaction and creative collaboration to the detriment of the Egyptian human rights NGOs and the international community. Since the continuing crackdown on human rights organizations intensified after 2013, the Egyptian government has sometimes blocked travel to Egypt for international human rights organizations. During COP27 , a representative of the Danish Institute against Torture was barred from entering Egypt at Cairo International Airport, preventing the organization from participating at the roundtable. Moreover, several leading Egyptian NGO directors and staff remain arbitrarily banned from travel abroad, some stemming from the notorious Case 173 of 2011 (foreign funding case), which continues to impair the free functioning of independent civil society. Organizational Signatories: Amnesty International Al-Nadeem Center Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) Egyptian Front for Human Rights (EFHR) Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) EuroMed Rights Freedom Initiative Human Rights Watch (HRW) International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) \</doc>

Article 19 issued the following news release on Nov. 14, 2022: As the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) continues in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, ARTICLE 19 calls on states to intensify efforts to implement stronger transparency obligations agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement, which came into force in 2020. In the Paris Agreement, countries committed to take action to limit global average temperature increases to 1.5C above the pre-industrial level. However, over the last year, there has been very limited progress in reducing the immense emissions gap for 2030. A recent UN Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report 2022 found there was 'no credible pathway to 1.5C in place' and that 'woefully inadequate' progress on cutting carbon emissions means the only way to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a 'rapid transformation of societies'. It is clear that the gap between the pledges and the emissions reductions needed to achieve the temperature goal is falling too short. ARTICLE 19 believes that efforts to address climate change must be rooted in transparency and governments' actions being accountable. Transparency is not a single policy tool. We call on states to ensure that transparency is a key component to climate change action. Transparency as part of a global stocktake process Together, these reports have helped enable a global assessment of collective progress. Peer assessment of the publicly available information builds up fair competition for states' reporting and enhances their accountability, both nationally and globally. Through this process, countries gain the opportunity to learn from each other by sharing achievements, best practices and experiences. From 2024, the enhanced transparency framework (ETF) will be enforced and all countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement will follow a single, universal transparency process. The ETF will cover all aspects of the Paris Agreement that countries will be asked to report on, with a degree of flexibility, and this will continue to be made available to developing countries. The 2021 summit in Glasgow saw the development of common reporting tables and formats for reporting information and outlines of the reports. ARTICLE 19 calls on states to take the global stocktake process seriously by including meaningful and relevant information as a minimum standard for their reporting and ensuring this is strengthened at every review cycle in order to ensure that the global assessment reflects the reality of measures and allow concrete actions to be taken in a timely manner. Transparency as a tool for civic participation The participation of stakeholders and communities with vested interests has proved to improve the legitimacy of decisions, help build stakeholder capacity and strengthen implementation. However, public participation is often inconsistent, and it should apply systematically to all levels of government. Full implementation of public participation means that every individual, including people in marginalised communities, should know about their right to participate and should be provided with ample guidance on how, when and where to exercise their right to participation. Access to environmental information motivates and empowers people to participate in an informed manner. We know that poor communities are the most severely impacted by disasters linked to the global climate emergency. ARTICLE 19 calls on states to consider public participation and access to information as essential to ensure the public is educated about the effects of climate change. They should ensure laws on access to environmental information are effectively implemented and populations at risk, including indigenous communities, can engage in decision-making processes affecting them. Corporate environmental transparency Since the Conference of the Parties in Paris in 2015, the corporate sector has been considered to be one of the most important actors in the fight against global warming. Governments have imposed transparency on corporations through bringing in laws and regulations, and corporations are required to comply with government regulations and share environmental information. They must also inform and update stakeholders about what they are doing to reduce gas emissions, resulting in greater accountability. In turn, corporations have seen a positive impact on their businesses through their voluntary and proactive commitments to greater transparency. Transparency has enhanced businesses' reputations, boosted competitive advantage and helped to uncover risks and opportunities, track benchmark progress and allow access to lower costs of capital. Crucially, it has also provided opportunities to engage with stakeholders about environmental and social impact. In addition, firms' internal governance structures and external control systems enhance the transparency of environmental disclosure. Many private companies have taken steps to show they are taking climate impact very seriously by institutionalising oversight of their climate-related performance. An impressive 88% say they have appointed someone with responsibility for climate strategy, and 70% have established board-level oversight. ARTICLE 19 calls on corporations to proactively disclose information related to the impact of their actions on climate change in an accurate and timely manner. They should also facilitate public watchdogs such as civil society, journalists, media, activists, researchers and other stakeholders to access environmental information as a way to build trust, and as a form of accountability to customers and to the public in general.

Nov 09, 2022( Latin Times: http://www.latintimes.com http://www.latintimes.com Delivered by Newstex) As countries gather together for the United Nations COP27 climate change talks, Mexico is being urged by allies on Wednesday to make major commitments and policy changes to address the country's role in the current worldwide climate crisis. U.S. climate diplomat John Kerry has pushed Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to make a major announcement regarding the country's climate change policy, urging it and other countries to up their pledges to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, according to Reuters[1]. 'I was just in Mexico a few days ago and we will have a major announcement, which President Lopez Obrador has agreed to with respect to what Mexico is now going to undertake,' Kerry said, as he visits Egypt for the COP27 climate talks. 'That will be significant because that is not where we were in the time of Glasgow.' Mexico is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gasses in the world, ranking second overall in the entire Latin America region. Lopez Obrador's administration has been criticized for rolling back the country's Paris pledges, and many are skeptical of whatever announcement or pledges may come from his administration, The Guardian[2] reported. 'It's highly likely that the Mexican government will try to deceive the entire world at Cop27 with false actions and projects that will never be built,' renewable energy expert Carlos Flores said. 'We are not going to meet our current pledges, never mind anything more ambitious.' Lopez Obrador's previous plans have included prioritizing the use of fossil fuels as well as the dismantling of the country's national institute for climate change and the federal climate change fund, while pushing plans for renewable energy to the wayside. 'There is no way to look positively at the climate action of an administration that has been focused on undermining renewable energy. In order for Mexico to meet its Paris objectives, we will need a new president in 2024 who can regain the trust of investors and has a real commitment to the environment,' Flores said. Beyond that, many say that the climate change initiative has been stalled by the Russia-Ukraine war, which has been financed by Russian oil and which has encouraged more oil and gas drilling as some countries are pressured to move away from renewables, the New York Times[3] reported. 'We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,' Antonio Guterres, the U.N. Secretary-General, said. As the U.N. COP27 climate talks begin in Egypt, the President of Mexico is urged on Wednesday to push for stronger pledges that can help address the climate change problem in the world.

8 November 2022 (Voice of America) U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with the leaders of Egypt, Cambodia and Indonesia during a wide-ranging trip that includes an international climate summit and meetings of ASEAN and the Group of 20 industrialized nations, senior administration officials said on Tuesday. The officials were not able to say whether Biden would have a separate meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who is expected to attend the summit, and what their agenda might include. The two governments have been working toward arranging what would be the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since Biden took office in January 2021. Biden will begin his trip by traveling to Egypt to participate in the COP27 United Nations Climate Change Conference on Friday, where he will talk about America's efforts to reduce emissions and also hold a bilateral meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the officials said. He will then travel to Cambodia from Saturday to Sunday to participate in the annual summit between the U.S. and Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. He will also participate in the East Asia Summit, where he will focus on the Indo-Pacific region and talk about U.S. commitment to a rules-based international order in the South China Sea, they said. From Sunday to November 16, Biden will visit Indonesia to participate in a summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies. He will be "unapologetic" in defending Ukraine and calling out Russia during the meeting, one of the officials said. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Heartland Institute: By David Wojick Who would have guessed that a UN COP would turn into a promotion point for fossil fuel development? COP27 is looking that way, thanks to the energy crisis and Africa's determination to develop itself. How, or even if, this rapidly emerging issue will get on the COP 27 table remains to be seen, but it is certainly a lively topic of discussion on the side. Europe needs gas and Africa has it; green agenda be damned. Here are just a few of the high points on this fascinating new issue. In June the EU Parliament made gas green. I am not making this up. Their action made this fossil fuel eligible for a bunch of subsides and related green goodies. It also opened the door to investment. About the same time a bunch of African nations issued the Kigali Communique, saying this: We "Support Africa in the deployment of gas as a transition fuel...." The signers are Ministers and high-level representatives from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. More recently Germany and Poland's top dogs actually went to Senegal to talk up development of its considerable natural gas resources. Other EU leaders and ministers have visited other African countries. America is doing a bunch of gas investment too. Numerous deals are in the works, including tapping many new gas fields, building pipelines and building or enlarging LNG terminals and ports. For example, Mozambique is seeking to double its LNG poetry capacity. Of course everyone gives lip service to a far distant net zero goal, calling gas a "transition" step. In the meantime GET THE GAS. This so-called transition might last right thru 2030 or even 2050. The green agenda can be turned around without a word to that effect. In politics and diplomacy you never have to admit error. You just stop doing the wrong thing. Africa already sees a lot of gas production so this is just more of the same, a lot more. Here is a quick list of the major existing gas produces, with their rank in global production. Of course none is close to the giants America and Russia but they clearly know how to get the gas. Algeria 5th globally Nigeria 12th Egypt 20th Libya 40th Note that COP27 host Egypt is high on the list of gas producers. They may well want to get gas onto the table. Egypt's foreign minister and Cop27 president Sameh Shoukry Is quoted saying "We might see in gas a transitional source of energy with certainly less emissions". Better than coal, right? Not that gas is replacing coal as we are talking about growth and development. The president of COP26 tabled a whole set of radical proposals so we shall see what happens in COP27 But as I said, the gas work may just happen along side the COP27 climate negotiations. Many countries send dozens of delegates, while some send over a hundred. Few of these folks actually sit in on the negotiations and there is no room for them to do so. Cutting deals is likely. \</doc>

The following information was released by the Presidency, Republic of South Africa: The Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) will hold a Special Sitting today, Friday 4 November 2022, at which President Cyril Ramaphosa will set out Government's priority investment and financing interventions under the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan. Cabinet and the Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Just Energy Transition Partnership recently agreed that there may now be broader consultation on the investment plan. South Africa has entered into a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union to support South Africa's phasing-out of coal and reduce potentially negative consequences on workers, communities and the economy. The President will update the Commission in his capacity as Chair of this independent, statutory, multi-stakeholder body established to oversee and facilitate a just and equitable transition towards a low-emissions and climate-resilient economy. Today's engagement forms part of South Africa's preparation for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, or COP27 , which will take place in Sharm El Sheikh from 6 November. President Ramaphosa will travel to the Summit next week as leader of the South African Government delegation. Under the Just Energy Transition Partnership South Africa ahead of COP27 requires a financing package that is aligned to the country's fiscal realities and demands; upholds the development and climate finance principles and obligations that are due to developing countries, and is inclusive and just. The Presidential Climate Commission is focused on creating a social partnership around a just transition; defining a vision for a just transition, and means of achieving that vision, covering the necessary sectoral shifts, technological innovation, employment opportunities, and climate finance, as well as conducting independent analysis into climate change impacts on jobs, the economy, and policy. To these ends, the Commission engages with a wide range of stakeholders, including all spheres of government, business, labour, academia, communities, and civil society. Today's session will take place on a virtual platform from 16h00 to 17h30 online to receive and consider an update on the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JETIP). \</doc>

This November's United Nations climate change conference in Egypt is likely to be starkly different than COP26 held one year ago in Glasgow, as the focus shifts from lofty goals to the trickier challenge of achieving them. "At Glasgow, the investors were coming with bold big statements. Now a year in, it's hard work," said Kirsten Snow Spalding, senior program director of the Ceres Investor Network, whose 220-plus institutional investment members manage a collective $60 trillion in assets. Network members include some of the largest public pension funds in the U.S. and range geographically from the Washington State Investment Board, Olympia, overseeing $182.3 billion in assets, to the C$390 billion ($280.9 billion) Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, Montreal, to the Church of England Pensions Board, London, overseeing three pension funds. "I characterize this as the implementation COP," said Ms. Spalding, who expects that investors and policymakers will discuss how they are implementing their plans to reach net-zero emissions, the best sources of data for making those plans and more. Pledges made since the 2021 climate conference in Glasgow are "woefully inadequate," reducing greenhouse gas emissions less than 1% when at least 45% is needed, according to an Oct. 27 United Nations emissions gap report. A further complication this year is the geopolitical shift in Europe and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on energy sources, including fossil fuels, that could make reducing carbon emissions harder, logistically and politically. The war has also diminished hopes raised at COP 26 that more incremental progress would be made on reducing carbon emissions. "I think the Russian invasion has put pain to that," said Nazmeera Moola, chief sustainability officer for Ninety One in Cape Town, South Africa, with $144.6 billion under management as of Sept. 30. "Expectations are likely to be lower. It has very much shifted the conversation from how quickly you can shut down your power stations to how quickly countries can develop renewables," she said. Location, location, location As COP27 begins Nov. 6 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the location underscores one of its biggest challenges: convincing countries with widely disparate priorities and budgets to agree on next steps, and who pays for what. This year's gathering is expected to emphasize how more affluent countries, along with multilateral development banks, can and should help developing countries tackle climate change, and convince more investors to follow. Investors will be expecting a lot more from governments from both developed and emerging markets in terms of commitments, resources and policies, Ms. Spalding said. "They want to see the policymakers implement change. The rubber hits the road when (asset owners) sit with their asset managers, but they can't do that without the right signals" from governments, she said. When investors go to implement their net-zero plans, "that signal really matters, and where we invest matters, so investing in emerging markets is the No. 1 thing. These are the ones that need solutions first," Ms. Spalding said. Investors will also be looking for reassurance from countries and multilateral development banks like the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, that the energy transition needed to address climate risk will not be on concessionary terms, said Ms. Moola with Ninety One. Conversations between governments on how to pay for it is now "much more about private capital. It starts with banks and then heads to private finance," she said. "Ideally what you want to see is development banks guaranteeing it in order to induce private capital into the next tranche. And the private sector needs to be much more clear about what risks you want to be mitigated," Ms. Moola said. At the center of recent U.N.-convened climate conferences is the Paris Agreement, the international treaty adopted by 196 parties in Paris in December 2015. In effect since November 2016, it calls on countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions to achieve a climate-neutral world by 2050, with the goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. The agreement works on a five-year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate actions by countries, many of whom will be defending their records and commitments at COP27 . While the Paris accord is now universally recognized, getting there was "painful and difficult," said Michael McNicholas, London-based managing director of asset management for OMERS Infrastructure within the C$119.5 billion ($86.1 billion) Ontario Municipal Employees' Retirement System, Toronto. Country commitments This year, with institutional investors like OMERS Infrastructure looking at climate-related investments on a country-by-country basis, they will be looking closely for country commitments coming out of COP27 to help plan their next investments. Wael Aboulmagd, Egypt's COP27 ambassador, will be looking for country commitments, too. Egypt, as host of COP27 , plans to focus on how the many promises made since the 2015 Paris accord are being implemented when it comes to emissions reduction efforts, how countries are adapting to climate change, and the level of money and other resources being offered to help the most vulnerable countries do both. While countries agreed at COP26 to revisit and strengthen their emissions reduction plans this year, few have done that yet in the days ahead of COP27 , although a last-minute flurry is expected. Last year's conference saw increasing numbers of pension funds and asset managers committing to net-zero emissions targets by 2050 or even sooner. Before COP26 started, half of the members of the U.N.-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which includes the $426 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System, Sacramento, upped their timelines, pledging to cut emissions in their portfolios by 25% or more by 2025. One year later, members of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance are looking for investments in emerging markets to help meet their emissions target commitment, "across every asset class," said Ms. Spalding with the Ceres Investor Network. To date, CalPERS has reduced the carbon intensity of its fixed-income portfolio by 51% and its equity portfolio by 30% over the past seven years, CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost said at the Climate Finance Week Ireland 2022 conference on Oct. 19. Another CalPERS climate-focused strategy is using its voice at events like these climate change conferences. "We seek to educate and influence government and industry leaders across the world to take decisive and far-reaching actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Ms. Frost said. Whether or not asset owners and managers get the desired support from policymakers and regulators, "my sense is that investors aren't slowing down. They need the policymakers to move with them," said Ms. Spalding, and investor groups like the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance are expected to make themselves heard during COP27 about what they want governments around the world to do. Last year's conference saw the debut of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a private sector-led initiative to reach net-zero emissions. With roughly 500 member firms from across the financial sector in 45 countries, GFANZ represent roughly 40% of global private financial assets. In Glasgow, GFANZ officials pledged to find projects to mobilize private finance. Responsibility shift Pierre Abadie, the Paris-based group climate director at Tikehau Capital and co-head of its private equity energy transition and decarbonization practice, considers COP26 "the most interesting COP following the Paris Agreement," because it presented a future trajectory of climate commitments for companies to apply. "Most importantly, COP26 was the conference that shifted the responsibility away from the governments and towards the economy to finance the energy transition," said Mr. Abadie, whose firm has (EURO)37.5 billion ($36.5 billion) under management. "Compared to COP26, it seems like the mobilization for COP27 is not as strong and there is less of a market expectation," Mr. Abadie said. "I expect that COP27 COP26 also saw the debut of the International Sustainability Standards Board to develop global standards for climate disclosure in financial markets through audited corporate financial statements. A topic sure to come up at COP27 is ISSB's decision in October to require reporting companies to disclose their Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. Also known as supply chain emissions, they can represent as much as 70% of a company's carbon footprint but also the potential for the greatest carbon reduction. Before the rules are finalized in early 2023, there is sure to be heated debate about whether the more aggressive stance will encourage or discourage countries to embrace them. \</doc>

16 November 2022 (Republic of Philippines Department Of Foreign Affairs) SHARM EL-SHEIK, 14 November 2022 - The Philippines called for the adoption of a transformational and operational definition of 'climate finance' to include the principles or characteristics of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) at the fifth High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Finance of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt on 14 November 2022. The NCQG is the new set of climate financial support that takes into account the needs and priorities of developing countries from a floor of USD$100 billion per year. The Philippines asked for a delivery plan for achieving the USD$100 billion that focuses on adaptation financing, scaling up climate finance grants, and streamlining access to financing. The country likewise stated that financial mechanisms should be based on the best available science and technologies. Philippine Ambassador to Egypt H.E. Ezzedin Tago relayed that the collective ambition of scaling up climate action should be anchored on a transparent, accessible, predictable, and efficient mobilization of climate finance. Ambassador Tago highlighted the need for swift and effective initiatives. 'Let us all work to break down the barriers to ambitious climate finance. Let us all endeavor for a climate finance that offers more sustainable results,' he stated. The Dialogue was moderated by the Ministers of Maldives and Finland. States Parties shared the challenges and key areas of progress in climate finance, how the delivery and transparency of climate financing can be further enhanced, and lessons learned that can be applied to the deliberations on the new collective quantified goal. \</doc>

Oct 28, 2022( Politics.co.uk: HYPERLINK https://www.politics.co.uk https://www.politics.co.uk Following an interview last night, in which the United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, told BBC Radio 4 that he hoped King Charles would attend November's COP 27 summit, the government has said that the decision is a matter for the King. Last month it was announced that King Charles would not attend COP27 after discussions with then prime minister Liz Truss. It was reported at the time that, 'with mutual friendship and respect there was agreement that the King would not attend'. However speaking on the BBC Radio 4 'Today' programme, this morning, the new environment secretary, Therese Coffey appeared to put an alternative spin on events. Ms Coffey said, 'The government doesn't have a view on whether the King should go or not, it is a matter for the King'. King Charles, then in his role as the Prince of Wales, delivered the opening speech at last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow.

Through this financial statement the government is facing a number of difficult decisions on tax and spending as it seeks to close a gap of up to 50 billion hole in the public finances. That figure is equivalent to 2% of GDP. The move by Mr Sunak on COP27 has added significance because the UK is currently the COP president and will remain so until it formerly hands over the reins to Egypt in Sharm-el-Sheikh. Responding to Mr Sunak's decision, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer reacted on Twitter to say, 'My Labour government will show climate leadership. Britain showing up to work with world leaders is an opportunity to grasp. Not an event to shun'. His comments were mirrored by the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey who said, 'Rishi Sunak wants to keep the ban on new onshore wind, is failing to help families insulate their homes and is now refusing to attend the COP summit. His actions fly in the face of the UK's proud record of leading the global fight against climate change'. Campaign groups have also reacted angrily to the news. Christian Aid's Head of Advocacy and Policy, Fiona Smyth, said, 'It's extremely disappointing to see Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has chosen not to attend this year's COP27 climate summit in Egypt. So much for Global Britain'. Defending the government's approach on Climate Change, the new Environment Secretary, Therese Coffey told the BBC Radio 4 'Today' programme this morning, that 'The UK has set challenging climate change targets in terms of what we are able to do in reducing climate change emissions, we hosted a very significant COP last year in Glasgow, where a lot of progress were made'. With the UK's financial statement previously planned for 31 October, Ms Truss had herself planned to attend COP27 . The government will now be represented at the conference, by Alok Sharma, who presided over the COP26 summit, alongside environment secretary, Therese Coffey..

Human Rights Watch issued the following news release: Human Rights Watch joined representatives of 11 other independent Egyptian, regional, and international human rights organizations to meet in person in Cairo on November 12, 2022, for a roundtable hosted by the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF). The following is a joint statement from Human Rights Watch and participating groups: On 12 November, for the first time in years, representatives of 12 independent Egyptian, regional, and international human rights organizations met in person in Cairo for a roundtable hosted by the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), to discuss opportunities to promote and protect human rights in Egypt in the months and years ahead. Participants in the meeting welcomed the opportunity, made possible by the government's partial easing of restrictions on travel into Egypt for international civil society organizations during the United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ), to resume in person consultations between partners that should be a routine part of our work. COP27 , where the slogan "No Climate Justice without Human Rights" has gained currency. We encourage all national, regional, and international actors to support the basic rights and freedoms of people in Egypt. The participants look forward to future constructive engagement with the Egyptian government. We hope that Egypt will soon emerge from the human rights crisis that has undermined essential human interaction and creative collaboration to the detriment of the Egyptian human rights NGOs and the international community. Since the continuing crackdown on human rights organizations intensified after 2013, the Egyptian government has sometimes blocked travel to Egypt for international human rights organizations. During COP27 , a representative of the Danish Institute against Torture was barred from entering Egypt at Cairo International Airport, preventing the organization from participating at the roundtable. Moreover, several leading Egyptian NGO directors and staff remain arbitrarily banned from travel abroad, some stemming from the notorious Case 173 of 2011 (foreign funding case), which continues to impair the free functioning of independent civil society.

Developing countries were strongly aligned and very clear that the establishment of a Loss and Damage Finance facility, or fund (LDF), was their number one asks from COP-27 . The expectation was that the fund or facility would be set up so that it will deliver new and additional finance, not just reallocate money out of other pots that are already too small. And that it should be established as part of the Financial Mechanism of the UNFCCC, which also serves the Paris Agreement, to ensure that it operated within the equity principles of the Convention. This progress was made as a result of the consistency and persistence of developing countries, which did not allow themselves to be divided in the face of several developed countries' proposals to promise funding for only the most vulnerable countries (seeking to peel off SIDS and LDCs from the developing country block), and also in the face of pushback from developed countries, in particular the US. COP-27 will be remembered for the victory of the small and developing countries, which resulted in the establishment of the Loss and Damage Fund (LDF). Developing economies such as India, Brazil, and South Africa have driven this demand. Vulnerable-20, a group of 58 countries (V-20 group) most affected by the climate crisis, mobilized effectively in this regard. With a total population of 1.5 billion, this group contributes only 5 percent of total carbon emissions. This is why the group was adamant about reaching a final decision on the issue of loss and damage by developed countries. Creating a specific fund for loss and damage marked an important point of progress, with the issue added to the official agenda and adopted for the first time at COP-27 . Governments took the ground-breaking decision to establish new funding arrangements, as well as a dedicated fund, to assist developing countries in responding to loss and damage. Governments also agreed to establish a 'transitional committee' to make recommendations on how to operationalize both the new funding arrangements and the fund at COP28 next year. A 24-member Transitional Committee with 14 members from developing and 10 members from developed countries was created to work out the details of the modalities to operationalised the LDF, and identify where funds will come from - they need to be at scale and on a polluter pays basis, so from rich, historically high polluting countries. Developing countries will have the majority of seats (14), with two each for SIDS and LDCs. The decision guides The Committee to look at "potential sources of funding  including innovative sources" - which should include a tax on the fossil fuel industry, a frequent flyer levy or similar. These sources of funding have had great support in the lead up to COP-27 - from the head of the UN, Antonio Guterres, through Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, and civil society have been calling for these Polluter Pays sources for years. That said, there must also be a floor of public finance which links to the discussion on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance (NCQG). The Transitional Committee will also need to think about how funds will flow for both slow onset climatic processes like sea level rise and extreme weather events like storms and droughts. The Transitional Committee will report to next year's COP and CMA, and countries would establish the operational modalities for the new LDF. The decision also includes two workshops and a synthesis report on existing funding arrangements relevant to addressing loss and damage in 2023 and a call for submissions by 15 February 2023 with views on the second Glasgow Dialogue to take place during the UNFCCC intersessional in Bonn in June 2023. In the decision UN agencies, intergovernmental organizations and financial institutions are invited to provide input on how they might enhance access and/or the speed, scope and scale of availability of finance for addressing loss and damage. The activities and considerations of the decision will be taken into account at the second and third Glasgow Dialogues to take place in June of 2023 and June of 2024. The Chair of the SBI was also requested to provide a summary report of each Glasgow Dialogue within four weeks. This is significant as the decision that established the Glasgow Dialogue did not mandate a report of its discussions and outcome. The decision gives momentum to the Bridgetown Initiative kicked off by Barbados Prime Minister Mottley and her climate finance envoy Avinash Persaud in asking international financial institutions to consider at the 2023 Spring Meetings of the World Bank and IMF the potential for such institutions to contribute to funding arrangements to respond to loss and damage; and inviting the UN Secretary General to convene a meeting of international financial institutions and other relevant entities to identify the most effective ways to provide funding to respond to needs related to addressing loss and damage. Separately Emmanuel Macron had already announced he would convene a finance summit in Paris in June 2023 to follow through on the Bridgetown proposals on how to fund mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP-27 closed .with a breakthrough agreement to provide "loss and damage" funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters. "This outcome moves us forward," said Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary. "We have determined a way forward on a decades-long conversation on funding for loss and damage - deliberating over how we address the impacts on communities whose lives and livelihoods have been ruined by the very worst impacts of climate change." The cover decision, known as the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, highlights that a global transformation to a low-carbon economy is expected to require investments of at least USD 4-6 trillion a year. Delivering such funding will require a swift and comprehensive transformation of the financial system and its structures and processes, engaging governments, central banks, commercial banks, institutional investors and other financial actors. It is in addition to existing climate finance meant to help countries adapt to climate change and transition to clean energy. Parties also agreed on the institutional arrangements to operationalize the Santiago Network for Loss and Damage, to catalyze technical assistance to developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. LOSS AND DAMAGE MEANS: Loss and damage is not a new ask. But it's been a contentious issue for years, as rich countries like the United States fear that agreeing to a loss and damage fund could open them up to legal liability, and potential future lawsuits. It is the idea that rich countries, which emitted the most planet-warming gases, should pay poorer countries who are now suffering from climate disasters they did not create. Developing countries and small island states have been pressing for these kinds of funds since 1991, when the Pacific island Vanuatu first proposed a plan for high-emitting countries to funnel money toward those impacted by sea level rise. It took more than a decade for the proposal to gain momentum, even as much of Vanuatu and other small island Pacific nations are slowly disappearing. Climate activists in developing nations, pointing to Pakistan's cascading disasters as the clearest evidence, stressed: "why a dedicated loss and damage fund is needed. It's the responsibility of the developed world to support that effort. Commitments have been made but they're not being delivered." In Fiji, climate activist Lavetanalagi Seru's home Island, it has cost an average of $1 million to relocate communities because of sea level rise. Moving away from ancestral lands is not an easy decision, but climate change is having irreversible impacts on the islands, said Seru, the regional policy coordinator with the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network. "Climate change is threatening the very social fabrics of our Pacific communities," Seru said. "This is why these funds are required. This is a matter of justice for many of the small island developing states and countries such as those in the Pacific." NEED FOR CLIMATE FINANCE COP-27 had a focus on Loss and Damage like never before. Given the drumbeat of climate impacts coming into COP - one third of Pakistan flooded, devastating drought and famine in Kenya, heat waves and drought across Europe and southern China, Hurricanes in Cuba and the US, glaciers disappearing and sea level rise and coastal erosion forcing Pacific Islanders to relocate. At what has been billed as an "Implementation COP" in Africa, a continent grappling with loss and damage, went into overtime with so many issues unresolved, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres pleaded with delegates: We need action. No one can deny the scale of loss and damage we see around the globe. The world is burning and drowning before our eyes. I urge all parties to show that they see it - and get it. The world is watching and has a simple message: stand and deliver. Deliver the kind of meaningful climate action that people and the planet so desperately need. A major reason this type of fund is contentious is that wealthy nations are concerned that paying for such a fund could be seen as admission of liability, which may trigger legal battles. Developed nations like the US have pushed back on it in the past and are still tiptoeing around the issue. Understandably, the rich developed nations are "dragging their feet." But it's "very important for them to empathize and take responsibility." Developing countries were more aligned than ever before - in pre-meetings and throughout COP all 134 countries in the G77 and China spoke with one voice to demand climate justice. And civil society provided the flank with protests around the world and in the COP venue itself. And, finally, grudgingly, developed countries, with leadership from the European Union, agreed to establish a Loss and Damage fund. There has also been confusion about its definition - whether loss and damage is a form of liability, compensation or even reparations. 'Reparations' is not a word or a term that has been used in this context," US Climate Envoy John Kerry added: "We have always said that it is imperative for the developed world to help the developing world to deal with the impacts of climate." And US officials still have questions - whether it would come through an existing financial source like the Green Climate Fund, or an entirely new source. Speaking at a New York Times event on Sept. 20, Kerry suggested the U.S. would not be prepared to compensate countries for the loss and damage they've suffered as a result of the climate emergency. You tell me the government in the world that has trillions of dollars - because that's what it costs," Kerry said. He added that he refused to feel "guilty" for the climate crisis. "There's plenty of time to be arguing, pointing fingers, doing whatever," Kerry said. "But the money we need right now needs to go to adaptation, it needs to go to building resilience, it needs to go to the technology that is going to save the planet." But others say the money is there. It's more a matter of priorities. "Look at the annual defense budget of the developed countries. We can mobilize the money. "It's not a question of money being there. It's a question of political will." Whilst this was a massive breakthrough for climate justice, other elements of the Sharm-el-Sheikh outcome were more mixed. Disappointingly there was pushback against a definitive call to phase out all fossil fuels - blocked by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran. While countries keep referring to 1.5 0C, they fail to take the necessary action to stay below this limit to prevent future harms from happening. As long as countries keep fueling the loss and damage crisis by expanding oil, gas and coal, real justice will not prevail. Importantly, the new Loss and Damage Fund needs to be filled, and the US and other developed countries did not agree to include loss and damage as a target within the new collective quantified goal for climate finance (NCQG), which will need to be corrected at future meetings. Scotland is the first country to set aside $7.9 million for climate compensation. Germany has promised 170 million, Ireland 10 million, Australia 50 million, Belgium 2.5 million, and Denmark 12 million dollars. China's response in Sharm el-Sheikh was also surprising. China, which ranks third in the world for per-capita carbon emissions, is looking for funding for climate change. The response of China was resented by European nations. A similar situation was seen in case countries like Venezuela and Arab nations that profit greatly from oil and are the biggest oil producing countries but were considering climate compensation as bailout money. Thus, creating a compensation fund for climate loss and damage can provide small and developing countries with temporary relief. But, in order to find a lasting solution to the climate crisis, the world fraternity would have to focus on mitigating the effects of natural disasters rather than resolving their causes. LOSS AND DAMAGE CONTROVERSY The loss and damage theory measures "loss" as the harm that climate change has done to infrastructure, including buildings, ports, and roads. On the other hand, the term "damage" has been used to describe the decrease in productivity brought out by climate change such as unexpected temperature increases, shortened workdays, declining agricultural productivity, and a decline in tourism. Additionally, it is thought that climate finance is distinct from the loss and damage budget (Loss and Damage Fund) established to compensate for disasters (Climate Fund). It's not unusual to ask for loss and damage. Vanuatu in the Pacific Ocean first suggested a plan for high-emitting nations to direct money toward those affected by sea level rise in 1991. Developing nations and small island states have been pressing for these kinds of funds. This type of fund is controversial for rich nations because they worry that contributing to it might be interpreted as an admission of liability, which could lead to legal disputes. There has also been a misunderstanding regarding its definition, specifically whether loss and damage constitute a form of responsibility, payment or damages. In a way, this concept represents the compensation that small, developing and emerging economies are asking for in order to recover from the adverse effects of climate change. During the 2019 Madrid Climate Summit, a technical assessment programme for climate compensation was also developed. Currently, the United Nations and some development banks assist countries affected by climate change. According to a report, $ 580 billion will be needed by 2030 to adopt the loss and damage formula. UNITY NEED OF THE HOUR At COP-27 , international heads of many states spoke. It may not be surprising if John Kerry wins the next Nobel Prize for the environment given the way US President Biden appeared to be praising the climate ambassador John Kerry, who used climate change as a diplomatic tool. On the other hand, the unusual manner in which British Prime Minister Sunak left the conference confused dozens of audience members during the COP-27 event. Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Motley will likely be remembered as COP-27 's most influential leader. She criticized rich nations for the greenhouse gas emissions produced by them and also raised questions about why it is up to poor nations to collect the garbage now that has been created by them. She spoke extensively during her speech about the need to update the outdated global financial system to better reflect current conditions, such as making it simpler for nations affected by the climate to access capital. The Prime Minister urged nations to accept responsibility because, without it, nothing would change in the world. Santiago Network for Loss and Damage Applause filled the room as negotiators agreed the mechanisms to operationalize the Santiago Network. The vision of the Santiago Network is to catalyze the technical assistance of relevant organizations, bodies, networks and experts, for the implementation of relevant approaches for averting, minimize and addressing L&D at the local, national and regional level, in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change (Decision 2/CMA.2, para 43). The establishment of an Advisory Board to govern the Santiago Network was a key demand of the G77 and China. Women and Gender, Youth, and Indigenous Peoples constituencies will be represented on the Advisory Board, which will be open to observers. Participation of representatives of groups most affected by loss and damage will increase chances of delivering real and rights-based solutions. However, the omission of Environmental NGOs (ENGOs) is worrying, especially as they would bring additional and important expertise on a wide range of topics ranging from environmental integrity to human rights integration in climate action, contributing to the collective effort to catalyze technical assistance for the poorest and most vulnerable and address the gaps in the existing system. Importantly, the decision states that technical assistance should be in line with human rights, by referring to the relevant preambular paragraph of the Paris Agreement. An additional concern and critical issue is that with little finance committed so far for operation or delivery of technical assistance, the Santiago Network risks being cash strapped and unable to operate effectively unless more contributor countries step up. It is also essential that the Santiago Network is connected to the LDF. Only then will the technical assistance delivered by the network lead to long term and reliable grant based finance flowing to communities to address loss and damage in response to the latest climate disaster. INDIA'S STRATEGY IN COP27 While the rich countries were busy twisting the final agreement to their advantage at COP-27 in Egypt, India took a bold step by presenting its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In the midst of its ambitious development goals, India has demonstrated to the world its achievements and future commitments in the field of climate justice. India presented its significant newly launched initiatives in renewable energy, e-mobility, ethanol blended fuels, and green hydrogen as an alternative energy source. India's approach is founded on four key considerations that serve as the foundation of its long-term low-carbon development strategy: Despite having 17 percent of the world's population, India has contributed little to global warming, with its historical contribution to cumulative global GHG emissions being negligible. India's development requires a significant amount of energy. India is committed to and is actively pursuing low-carbon development strategies in accordance with national circumstances. Furthermore, India stated at COP-27 that it will promote future sustainable, climate and resilient development through its Smart Cities initiative. The country will meet its NDC commitment (Nationally Determined Contribution) of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of additional carbon sequestration by forest tree cover by 2030. India had updated its NDC even before the Egypt Climate Conference held. Due to the voluntary nature of NDCs, this will serve as a mirror to those countries that have forgotten their promise made in the Paris Agreement. The LiFE (Life for Environment) mission has been started by India some time ago in this series. India called LDF deal as "historic" to address loss and damage due to climate change-induced disasters, saying "the world has waited far too long for this. At the same time, making an intervention in the closing plenary session of COP-27 , Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said the world should not burden farmers with mitigation (reducing emissions of greenhouse gases) responsibilities. On the establishment of a four-year work programme on climate action in agriculture and food security, Yadav said agriculture, the mainstay of livelihood of millions of small farmers, would be hard hit from climate change. "We should not burden them with mitigation responsibilities. Indeed, India has kept mitigation in agriculture out of its NDCs (national plans to achieve Paris Agreement goals of limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius)," he said. But the outcome on other crucial issues such as India's call for phasing down all fossil fuels reflected little India has also demonstrated by fulfilling its commitments that any effort to save the earth will only be realized through an eco-friendly lifestyle. Rich countries that promised to solve the climate crisis were exposed during the Russia-Ukraine war when they turned energy into a weapon. The main failure of the Egypt Climate Conference was the lack of specific progress in increasing economic cooperation for climate change solutions. The COP-27 agreement also states that in order to achieve the goal of zero carbon emissions by 2030, a $ 4 trillion investment in renewable energy projects will be required. The question is, if developed countries refuse to provide $100 billion per year to developing countries to help them transition to a climate-friendly economy, how serious will they be about providing technology and expertise for green initiatives? However, by presenting a long-term low-emission development strategy, India has made the economic superpowers aware of their responsibilities, while also sending a message to developing countries that blaming rich countries will not help save the environment, and that everyone must take appropriate action. \</doc>

Nov 11, 2022( iOTWreport: HYPERLINK http://iotwreport.com http://iotwreport.com You know, I wasn't taking climate change serious enough. I think after this guy has changed his name I've been scared straight. This kind of thing will save the planet. This is like when the Tibetan monk lit himself on fire. Rainn Wilson probably wanted to do that, because he is brave and committed, but he figured it would be dumb to combat carbon emissions by emitting carbon. So he did the next dumbest thing. The actor's new name is Rainnfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson. NBC[1] Rainn Wilson, the actor, made the announcement via a Twitter video on Wednesday, timed to the United Nations climate change conference COP27 in Egypt this week. Wilson, a board member of Arctic Basecamp, changed his name via a website called Arctic Risk Name Generator which encourages visitors to become an 'Arctic name changer.' Although Wilson said of his name change 'This is not a joke,' it is unclear whether the actor and activist plans to officially change his name on government documents. Currently his Twitter and Instagram handles remain @RainnWilson. His full given name is Rainn Percival Dietrich Wilson. 'With the help of my scientist friends at Arctic Basecamp, I've changed my name to Rainnfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson,' Wilson said in a statement.

The International Council of HYPERLINK https://www.artnews.com/t/museums/ Museums ( HYPERLINK ICOM ), a prominent industry group, has released a statement signed by more than 90 museum leaders decrying actions by climate activists that involve targeting artworks. Among the high-profile figures to sign the letter include the Louvre's director Laurence des Cars, the Prado's Miguel Falomir, the British Museum's Hartwig Fischer, the Guggenheim's Richard Armstrong, director of the Guggenheim, the Mauritshuis's Martine Gosselink, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Max Hollein. In a statement, the museum group said the protestors "severely underestimate the fragility" of the works, calling the art "irreplaceable." Activists associated with the U.K.-based group Just Stop Oil movement have become known for protests in which they glue their hands to the frames of masterpieces, in an effort to spur action to remedy climate change. Similar activist groups have taken up these efforts in Germany, Australia, Spain, and Italy. Recent protests have involved throwing liquids at works by Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh. The ICOM letter's co-signers said that the community of museum leaders has been "deeply shaken" by what directors view as "risky endangerment" of the works. In the letter, the directors defend their stance against the activists' attempts to damage works, calling museums sites for "social discourse." ICOM's response to the protests comes as more than 90 state officials hailing from just under 200 countries met in Egypt for COP27 , the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , to address issues related to global climate change. The ICOM statement does not address issues related to recent governmental policies around climate change. \</doc>

HYPERLINK https://media.salon.com/2022/11/un_world_climate_conference_cop27_1244916412.jpg Link to Image Participants talk to each other during a break in the closing ceremony at the UN Climate Summit COP27 . Christophe Gateau/picture alliance via Getty Images For more than three decades, the developing world has demanded that wealthy countries pay up for the "loss and damage" that vulnerable nations are already experiencing due to climate change. Those calls were finally met early Sunday morning when the 27th United Nations climate change conference , or COP27 , came to a close in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. A new global pact establishes a fund "for responding to loss and damage" and creates a transitional committee to work out who will contribute to the fund, which developing countries will be eligible to draw from it, and how it will be governed. Negotiators for developing countries and nonprofits cheered the decision, noting that it was long overdue. "It's a historic moment," Nabeel Munir, a Pakistani diplomat and chief negotiator for the G77 developing countries, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2022/nov/19/cop27-fears-15c-target-danger-negotiations-overrun-live?page=with:block-637995478f088c5c88612255#block-637995478f088c5c88612255 told the Guardian . "[It's the] culmination of 30 years of work and beginning of a new chapter in pursuit of climate justice." The loss and damage fund is just the sixth special fund to be created in the United Nations' 30-year history of tackling climate change. Nations last agreed to set up the $100 billion Green Climate Fund in 2010. Just two months ago, establishing a separate fund for loss and damage restitution was an ambitious - perhaps even elusive - goal. The United States, European Union, and other wealthy countries were adamantly opposed for fear that admitting to their historical role in the climate crisis would open them up to unlimited liability, putting them on the hook for billions, if not trillions, of dollars. Some estimates put the price tag on loss and damage between $290 billion and $580 billion per year by 2030. But that opposition melted away in Egypt. Developing countries put up a united front at COP27 , pressure escalated from nongovernmental organizations, media attention grew, and a last-minute reversal from the European Union left the U.S. isolated in its opposition. "We can't celebrate, because it's already so late to have such a fund established," said Harjeet Singh, a longtime follower of climate negotiations and the head of global political strategy at the Climate Action Network, an international coalition of more than 1,800 environmental groups. "People needed it years ago. However, it does speak to people's power and all the pressure that came from the outside on both developing and developed countries. That made it happen, and that is something to be celebrated." The first glimmers of progress in the loss and damage debate happened last year, at climate talks in Glasgow. Scotland became the first government in the developed world to recognize loss and damage and pledged about $2.3 million toward funding it. Activists were buoyed by HYPERLINK https://grist.org/international/cop27-loss-and-damage-climate-reparations/ what they called the "de-tabooing" of the issue , but ultimately, COP26 ended with disappointment for the Global South, with only a meager agreement for a "dialogue" on the issue. The U.S. and other rich nations' opposition remained so strong that they initially tried to prevent the topic from making it onto the official COP27 agenda. But escalating pressure from activists and developing countries, as well as devastating floods that left a third of Pakistan, a country that has contributed less than 1 percent of carbon emissions historically, under water this summer, brought renewed attention to the issue. After receiving assurances that the U.S., European Union, and other developed nations wouldn't be held liable, the issue eventually made it onto HYPERLINK the formal agenda for the first time ever . It was a historic move and one that resulted in "cautious optimism," Michai Robertson, a negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States, told Grist. To understand what followed over the next two weeks, it's crucial to understand the various political factions and their positions in climate negotiations. Countries at COP27 largely fall into one of two groups: developed and developing, as defined in 1992, three years before the first COP conference. On one side are developed countries in the G7, which include the wealthiest nations and largest historical polluters. And on the other side are developing nations, which are HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/party-groupings further grouped into the G77, Small Island Developing States, Least Developed Countries, the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Alliance of Small Island States, among others. But these divisions based on the economic stature of countries in the 1990s has become a growing source of tension in climate negotiations. Countries in the G7 are largely responsible for historical emissions, making up HYPERLINK nearly 80 percent of the total carbon emissions between 1850 and 2015. In the last few decades though, growing economies in the developing world such as China and India have seen their emissions increase dramatically. China is now HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/12/climate/cop26-emissions-compensation.html#:~:text=Rich%20countries%2C%20including%20the%20United,over%20the%20past%20170%20years. the largest annual emitter During the first week of COP27 , the U.S. and other G7 nations seemed firmly entrenched in their opposition to a direct funding scheme for loss and damage. Instead, they emphasized the need for a broad array of "funding arrangements," from considering the use of existing climate funds to early-warning systems for disaster risk reduction. They proposed setting a deadline for 2024 for discussing those arrangements, but didn't promise any specific outcomes at the end. Meanwhile, the G77, China, and other developing countries, as well as nonprofits, called for a specific "mechanism" or "facility" or "fund" that would begin disbursing money in two years. By the middle of the second week, with each camp digging in its heels, tensions were running high. The outgoing chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, Molwyn Joseph, HYPERLINK told the press that establishing a loss and damage fund at COP27 was a "red line" for the group and that they were discussing walking away from negotiations if their demands weren't met. Meanwhile, advocacy groups began observing attempts to break up the unity between the various negotiating blocs representing the developing world. Led by Germany, the G7 in partnership with a group of climate-vulnerable countries had HYPERLINK https://grist.org/international/loss-and-damage-insurance-global-shield/ proposed an insurance initiative "They are looking for any possible way to break up the bloc," Brandon Wu, head of policy and campaigns at the social justice advocacy group ActionAid USA, told Grist. "One of those tactics is trying to say countries like China and India are different from some of the most vulnerable countries and they need to be contributors to this fund." But the developing nations stayed unified. China, which already contributes to climate financing through https://www.southcentre.int/question/chinas-boost-to-south-south-cooperation/ a separate $3.1 billion South-South Climate Cooperation Fund and other channels, HYPERLINK https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/9/china-willing-to-contribute-to-climate-damage-compensation said it would be willing to contribute toward compensation for loss and damage on a voluntary basis. Then on Thursday, in what appeared to be HYPERLINK https://unfccc-events.azureedge.net/COP27_91287/agenda an attempt to show a unified front COP27 , leaders from the G77, Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean, Alliance of Small Island States, and Least Developed Countries HYPERLINK held an "emergency press conference" https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-16/pakistan-climate-minister-sherry-rehman-talks-about-loss-and-damage-at-cop27?sref=wINQCNXe Pakistan's climate minister The turning point came just a few hours later. With little warning, at a late night meeting of negotiators, the Vice President of the European Union, https://unfccc-events.azureedge.net/COP27_91224/agenda Frans Timmermans, floated an "offer" COP27 . The proposal mostly capitulated on the demand for a fund set up immediately, but expanded the contributor pool to include emerging economies and wealthier developing countries. Having held firm against any sort of fund, the U.S. HYPERLINK https://twitter.com/DaveKeating/status/1593662175863783427 was reportedly blindsided "It actually just goes to show how blatant the U.S.' obstruction is," said Rachel Rose Jackson, director at the nonprofit Corporate Accountability. "[The EU and U.S.] work hand-in-hand to advance a shared strategy. When they get to the point when they're ready to publicly distance themselves from the U.S., you know they're doing dirty." The EU proposal broke the logjam. With the U.S. isolated in its opposition to the fund, it quickly reversed its position. In about 24 hours, the COP27 presidency, headed by Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, released text that explicitly called for a new, separate fund to support loss and damage costs in vulnerable countries. The fund is a massive step forward, but the agreement in Egypt punted on many thorny issues. For one, the pact is neutral on whether countries like China, which are classified as "developing" but are now major carbon emitters, will pay into the fund. The text also opens up questions about which countries will be eligible for appropriations from the fund. There are no concrete dollar amounts for funding. As a result, the fund is essentially an empty bank account at the moment. The battle over fund donors and recipients will play out over the coming year once a transitional committee is appointed. "There's hard work ahead to get this fund operational and ensure it serves the needs of communities hit hardest by climate extremes and slow-onset disasters," Rachel Cleetus, a policy director and lead economist at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. "But today, fittingly, at this 'Africa COP,' the most important and long-awaited first step on that path has been secured." \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 3 -- The United Nations World Health Organization issued the following news release: As world leaders open pivotal climate talks at COP-27 in Sharm El Sheikh next week, the stakes will be too high for our planet to end this year's conference without resolving crucial, pending issues on finance, support on adaptation and resilience, and implementation of recent climate commitments. COP27 will be a further opportunity for the world to come together and demonstrate the requisite political will to take on the climate challenge through concerted, collaborative and impactful action. But discussion around climate change and its impact on the world's population cannot take place without acknowledging the importance of global public health and how this is inextricably linked with climate change and the environment. The World Health Organization will have a key role at the conference to highlight the health-environment nexus and critically, to ensure the inclusion of health content in the negotiations. A dedicated Health Pavilion will showcase over 40 side events related to climate change and health, covering topics ranging from energizing health: accelerating electricity access in health-care facilities to the development of early warning systems and climate resilient food systems. WHO will be promoting the health argument for climate actions, the resilience of health systems, strengthening and reinforcing international cooperation and supporting the most vulnerable countries.

November 18, 2022 10:51 AM Johannesburg, South Africa - At COP27 , the United Nations climate change conference held in Egypt this month, China has figured prominently in a debate between Africa and Western nations over financial help to developing countries suffering the effects of climate change. This year alone the African continent has seen deadly flooding in South Africa and the worst drought in years in the Horn of Africa. African nations at COP27 are pushing hard for rich nations to pay climate compensation and contribute to a "loss and damage" fund. In a joint statement, China, Brazil, India and South Africa accused rich nations of double standards for using fossil fuels while pushing developing countries to go green. "The cold reality is that none of the high-income countries achieved 'developed' status under any carbon constraint, yet all the developing countries now need to find a new path to achieve high income [status] under the 1.5 degree target," Wei Shen, a climate expert at Britain's Institute of Development Studies, told VOA. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni posted on social media accusing the EU of "Western double standards," pointing out that some European countries are going back to coal mining. [See removed content in original press release.] Since the war in Ukraine and without Russian gas, Germany has had to depend more on its own coal for energy to get through the winter. Many African governments chafe at the fact that while the continent is responsible for about 3% of global emissions, they are being asked to phase out fossil fuels that some say are badly needed for development in a region where fewer than half the people have access to electricity ( HYPERLINK https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZG https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZG ). Divisions over compensation The U.S. has pushed for China - currently the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitter and consumer of coal - to be included in the group of nations responsible for such reparations. As the world's second-largest economy, China should be made to pay its share, Washington says. But while China says it supports developing countries in their quest for funds, it will not be contributing cash because - according to World Bank criteria - it's a developing country too. "At COP27 , China's Climate Envoy Xie [Zhenhua] mentioned that China doesn't have any obligation to provide LandD funding, but the country is willing to support lower-income countries for LandD caused by climate change," Lei Alice Bian, a fellow at the London School of Economics, told VOA. "The U.S. attempt to position China as a developed country is really not going to fly in Africa because the African side accepts that China should be treated as a developing country," said Paul Nantulya, an analyst at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington. That's because the West is responsible for the "historical and cumulative" emissions from the industrial revolution that have caused the global warming that the world is experiencing today, he said. While many developing nations blame the West for climate change, even saying China is also a victim, Ovigwe Eguegu, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy Development Reimagined, told VOA: "It is widely accepted - even by Beijing - that China's meteoric rise to world's second-largest economy came at a cost to the environment." "China finds itself in a paradox," Nantulya said. Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed at the U.N. last year that his country would no longer be financing new coal power abroad, with a focus instead on clean energy, although the road to green energy has some hurdles. "Initial plans to build a coal-fired power station have been put on hold. A 1000 MW solar plant is planned to supplement the energy mix requirements with a Chinese investor," Shavana Mushwana, a spokesperson for the zone, told VOA by email. However, Patrick Bond, a political economist at the University of Johannesburg, said even without the new coal power plant, the development will be a polluter, noting "there's a huge asterisk there ... since the additional power required to run such vast smelters and industrial facilities can't come from some small-scale solar installations," so the Special Economic Zone will still need to tap into South Africa's excessively stretched grid. Still, the change is indicative of what some analysts say is China's diversifying Belt and Road Initiative in Africa - away from a focus on large infrastructure projects such as ports and railways and toward investment in green energy like solar, wind and hydropower. Evidence of China's "Green Silk Road" can be seen throughout the continent. In energy-strapped South Africa, a Chinese company has set up the De Aar wind farm in the Northern Cape. In Kenya, China funded a 15-megawatt solar power plant in Garissa, and in the Central African Republic, a Chinese-built solar plant completed this year provides about 30% of the capital city's power. "In September 2021, the Chinese president announced at the U.N. General Assembly that China was going to stop the investment into coal, into projects abroad, and they're going to be investing a lot more into clean energy," Tony Tiyou, CEO of the consultancy Renewables in Africa, told VOA. "They've actually followed up on that." Fifteen Chinese-backed coal projects have since been canceled, though others that were already in the construction stage are ongoing, Nantulya said. He added that China's banks "were very quick to respond to the change in policy. Exim Bank, for instance, issued $425 million in green bonds that were earmarked for clean energy investment." China invested $380 billion in clean energy in 2021, more than any other country, and accounts for nearly half of the world's renewable energy investments. "China is serious in engaging Africa's renewable energy market," Wei said. Accusations of hypocrisy Analysts noted Beijing's focus on green energy comes after numerous previous cases of projects in Africa in which environmentalists have accused Chinese companies of polluting the environment and damaging wildlife habitats with their mining operations and infrastructure projects. Even currently, China is involved in a contentious crude oil pipeline project along with Uganda, Tanzania and a French company. That's despite opposition from the European Union, which worries the pipeline will harm the climate and environment. Uganda's Museveni slammed the EU for trying to intervene. Museveni is among a number of African politicians who regularly rail against what they see as Western lecturing and hypocrisy on climate change, arguing use of fossil fuels is what made the West rich and caused the climate crisis. Rich countries, however, are divided on climate compensation. \</doc>

EuroMed Rights posted the following news release: On 12 November, for the first time in years, representatives of 12 independent Egyptian, regional, and international human rights organizations met in person in Cairo for a roundtable hosted by the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), to discuss opportunities to promote and protect human rights in Egypt in the months and years ahead. Participants in the meeting welcomed the opportunity, made possible by the government's partial easing of restrictions on travel into Egypt for international civil society organizations during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ), to resume in person consultations between partners that should be a routine part of our work. The participants believe that opening civic space and enabling engagement between human rights experts are prerequisites for Egypt to be able to meet the many challenges currently facing the country in the civil, political, economic, social and environmental rights spheres. This is being demonstrated now at COP27 , where the slogan "No Climate Justice without Human Rights" has gained currency. We encourage all national, regional and international actors to support the basic rights and freedoms of people in Egypt. The participants look forward to future constructive engagement with the Egyptian government. We hope that Egypt will soon emerge from the human rights crisis that has undermined essential human interaction and creative collaboration to the detriment of the Egyptian human rights NGOs and the international community. Since the continuing crackdown on human rights organizations intensified after 2013, the Egyptian government has sometimes blocked travel to Egypt for international human rights organizations. During the COP27 conference, a representative of the Danish Institute against Torture was barred from entering Egypt at Cairo International Airport, preventing the organization from participating at the roundtable. Moreover, several leading Egyptian NGO directors and staff remain arbitrarily banned from travel abroad, some stemming from the notorious Case 173 of 2011 (foreign funding case), which continues to impair the free functioning of independent civil society.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 -- NASA issued the following press release/media advisory: NASA will participate in the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, which begins Sunday, Nov. 6, and runs through Friday, Nov. 18. The COP27 summit brings together countries from around the world to increase ambition by implementing existing goals and strengthening commitments to solutions that address climate change. The agency's vantage point from space provides critical information to advance understanding of our changing planet, including impacts from greenhouse gas emissions, the effects of warming including the decline of Arctic Sea ice, rising sea levels, more severe wildfires and shifting animal migration patterns. "NASA has a unique role in the global effort to continue understanding impacts of climate change and in addressing and mitigating those impacts," said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. "Beyond our Earth-observing satellites in space, instruments and research which provide an unparalleled understanding of our home planet, we are committed to working with our international partners to provide free and open data to the public. NASA is excited to be part of the discussions at COP27 to help answer the most pressing questions in addressing climate change." Throughout the conference, NASA staff and scientists will speak at several events and give presentations at the NASA Hyperwall, an interactive visual display of NASA imagery and data. Staff in attendance will include:  Tahani Amer, program executive, NASA Earth Science Division Mike Falkowski, program scientist, terrestrial ecology, NASA Earth Science Division To inquire about interview availability with one or more of these staff members, media should contact Tylar Greene at: HYPERLINK mailto:tylar.j.greene@nasa.gov tylar.j.greene@nasa.gov The NASA Hyperwall will be a main attraction at the U.S. Center. NASA scientists will provide two presentations per day, showing how NASA's global leadership in climate science and research helps model and predict ocean health, heat waves, wildfires, hurricanes, floods, and droughts. The full list of NASA presentations during the conference is available online ( HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/u-s-center-at-cop27/schedule-and-events/ https://www.state.gov/u-s-center-at- HYPERLINK cop27 /schedule-and-events/ Climate adaptation and mitigation efforts cannot succeed without robust climate observations and research. NASA's fleet of satellites and instruments observe how the planet is changing and measure key climate indicators, such as rising sea level, intensity of precipitation, and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. NASA is currently working to launch the next generation of Earth observing satellites- the Earth System Observatory ( https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-system-observatory https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-system-observatory ), which will provide a 3D, holistic view of Earth to help us better understand what our planet's changes mean for humanity. NASA is also designing an Earth Information Center ( HYPERLINK https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-information-center https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-information-center ), which will allow people to see how our planet is changing and provide easy-to-use information and resources that support decision makers to mitigate, adapt and respond to climate change.

(TNStalk) -- The Progressive Policy Institute issued a commentary to The Hill on Nov. 22, 2022, by strategic advisor Paul Bledsoe: Here is a summary:    Cop Out - Ignoring The Dictatorships Now Causing The Climate Crisis At COP27 The big news out of COP 27 , the UN climate negotiations, according to most media was a global agreement to create a fund to provide developing nations more aid to explicitly address rising climate change impacts. Yet, this action, while justified, is at best a thin, temporary band aid. Because without deep cuts in greenhouse gases from huge polluters like China, the cost of climate impacts will soon skyrocket into the trillions, overwhelming the ability of rich and poor countries alike to address it. So, what was done in Egypt to actually limit emissions and control global temperature increases, which after all is the central goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement? Precious little. Instead, a perverse sort of political correctness on the global left overtook the needed focus on solving the climate crisis, much of which is now inarguably caused by autocratic nations like China, Russia, Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia, who were barely mentioned during these talks. China's annual emissions alone are nearly one-third of the global total, more than all the developed countries combined, and still rising. Global greenhouse emissions cannot decline -- and climate protection cannot be achieved -- until and unless China begins to cut its emissions. Yet, China was never under any intense pressure from developing nations to act at these negotiations. China's President Xi Jinping, fresh from gaining a third consecutive five-year term as the leader of the Communist Party Conference, didn't even bother to show up. Never mind, that China consumes nearly 60 percent of the world's coal each year!

The following information was released by the Federal Foreign Office of Germany: The Climate Change Conference COP27 , which begins today in Sharm el-Sheikh, comes at a key moment in the shared international fight against the climate crisis. As an Arab and African country, Egypt is taking on a particular responsibility and leadership role by hosting this conference, something that I expressly welcome. Climate action is sustained by close liaison between political institutions and civil society, and so progress in this area is heavily dependent on participation for all. International events such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference must open their doors to everyone who works on these issues or is interested in them, so that the official representatives of the negotiating states can explain and advocate their approaches to solving the climate crisis to civil society representatives. We can only succeed in tackling the climate crisis if we are able to freely discuss ideas and approaches. Where the fear of repression prevails, on the other hand, civic engagement cannot endure. A significant event such as COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh inevitably puts the host country and all of its different facets in the spotlight. Taking on global responsibility means, not least, taking on responsibility for protecting human rights. But the human rights situation in Egypt falls short of this. The case of the journalist and activist Alaa Abdel Fattah and his lawyer Mohamed El-Baqer, who are both detained in conditions that are in some ways dire, is a prime example. It is unacceptable for people who want to freely express their opinion, and stand up for the right to do so, to be punished with long prison sentences sometimes in inhumane conditions. This is all the more true when a country such as Egypt stands by its international responsibility in other areas, and has indeed declared this year to be a Year of Civil Society. The release of Mr Fattah, who is at acute risk as a result of his hunger strike, and other political prisoners would be an important sign that Egypt takes this responsibility seriously. Civic engagement and sociopolitical criticism are neither crimes nor terror. The justified state aim of tackling terror and its causes must not be used as a cover for long-lasting infringements of human rights and civil liberties. Egypt's Human Rights Strategy must now be translated into concrete action that improves the situation for dissidents. An active civil society is not a disruption; it is an essential element in thriving societies. \</doc>

The following information was released by ActionAid: This Youth and Future Generations Day, young people urge world leaders to support countries suffering significant loss and damage from climate disasters. On Youth and Future Generations Day at COP27 young people urge world leaders attending COP27 to scale up financial support for communities, including women, children, and young people who are particularly vulnerable to the harsh reality of extreme climate disasters. As the impact of climate change intensifies, centering young people in the national and global discourse on climate change is critical to ensuring that young people are no longer excluded from decision-making and are not shut out from the debate. With a global estimate of 1.8 billion young people aged 10 -24, this generation of youth is the largest in history. ActionAid calls on governments to champion and support young climate activists as valuable agents of climate change. Young people, particularly those in the Global South, are disproportionately affected by climate change. As a result of extreme weather conditions, including droughts, tropical cyclones, and floods, they are facing high levels of unemployment, school closures, and extreme poverty. Happy, a climate activist from Tanzania, said: "Young people are affected today, but we are also affected tomorrow. We are today's generation and tomorrow's generation. One of the challenges is that young people are still not at the front of fighting climate. There is still no space, but we are demanding it, and if there is no room for us at the table, we young people will make for ourselves so that our voices will be heard." Ally, a climate activist from Tanzania. Speaking on the devasting effects of climate disaster on women and girls in Liberia, Princess, a young female climate activist from Liberia said: "Young women are at a risk of sexual and gender-based violence when they are unable to attend school due to extreme flooding. We need more young female climate activists. The best outcome at COP27 is for developed nations to keep their promise and finance communities dealing with loss and damage" Collins Odhiambo, Youth Engagement Advisor at Global Platforms, ActionAid's Youth Network, said: "The need for loss and damage finance can no longer be denied. COP27 must not become another talk show. The pledges must lead to concrete actions. Implementation of key COP 27 actions would be meaningless without all stakeholders on board." Young representatives will be able to present their statements and key policies for driving climate ambition to high-level policymakers during the Youth and Future Generations Day today.

(TNStalk) -- The Center for Strategic and International Studies issued the following commentary on Nov. 22, 2022:    Expectations were low for the 27th UN Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh, even though the Egyptian presidency branded it as an "implementation COP." Last November's COP26 in Glasgow was the first opportunity to review the more ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) countries were required to submit five years after the Paris agreement. COP26 also marked the return of the United States to climate leadership, after former president Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. As such, COP26 felt like a critical test of the world's commitment to keeping the target of 1.5 degrees Celsius warming alive, even if on life support. By contrast, COP27 always felt like a lower-stakes affair-even before an energy security crisis broke out in Europe and energy costs soared around the world. Tensions ahead of COP27 were palpable. Developing countries criticized wealthy nations for lack of promised support for a "loss and damage" fund and delivery of $100 billion per year committed climate finance to help poorer countries cope with the effects of climate change. As of late October, only 24 countries had submitted updated NDCs ahead of COP27 , suggesting incremental progress toward cutting emissions. And there was a growing sense that an energy security crisis Europe had diluted the focus on climate. There was little triumphalism after COP27 , suggesting that these low expectations were warranted. Developing country negotiators managed to secure agreement on a loss and damage fund, agreeing to create a "transitional committee" to operationalize and capitalize the fund. But details are missing. It is not clear which countries will provide funding and about the supporting role to be played by multilateral development banks. Overall, COP27 did little to raise ambitions on cutting emissions or phasing down fossil fuels.    Positive Steps on Methane Mitigation Ben Cahill, Senior Fellow, Energy Security and Climate Change Program The last COP elevated methane to the top of the international climate agenda, and COP27 showed that methane mitigation is gathering speed. At COP26, more than 100 countries joined the Global Methane Pledge-a collective effort to cut methane emissions by 30 percent from 2020 levels by the year 2030. Last November, the United States proposed new regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas, and soon after COP26, the European Union proposed its own ambitious methane legislation. This year's climate conference featured some concrete steps to cut emissions by adopting new technology and implementing new rules. The International Methane Emissions Observatory launched a Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) that will use satellite technology to track methane plumes and hotspots and enable rapid action by regulators and companies. The United States, European Union, Japan and other countries announced an important producer-consumer effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions from traded gas. Several countries announced new commitments to cut methane emissions from the energy sector. Collectively, these are important steps forward. The most consequential move on methane announced during COP27 came from the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its long-awaited supplemental proposal to reduce methane emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and gas sector. The proposed rules will cover lower production wells, create more stringent flaring rules, and allow a wider range of methane detection technologies. EPA aims to finalize the rule by 2023.    Politics of Fossil Fuel Phase Down COP27 Sandeep Pai, Senior Associate (Non-resident), Energy Security and Climate Change Program In 2021, the wording of the final deal at the COP26 was watered down from "coal phaseout" to "coal phasedown" after pressure exerted by India, China, and the United States. After the Indian environment minister explained the last-minute change at COP26, media and world leaders gave India in particular considerable flak for its stance. Most major economies' current energy systems are dependent on either oil and gas or coal for their energy security. While they may be undertaking an energy transition, they are still reluctant to phaseout the fuel they most depend on. For many wealthy countries, coal is no longer an energy security resource. They are oil and gas dependent. However, for most developing countries like India, coal remains a key source of energy security. India does not have vast oil and gas reserves and is highly import dependent. Although India has ambitious renewable energy plans, research shows that India will need to rely on coal for decades to meet the growing energy needs of its 1.4 billion people. This illustrates why a "coal phaseout" may be more problematic for developing countries like India. At COP27 COP27 text. However, India's call to phase down all fossil fuels has helped ward off negative attention from the global community surrounding its continued use of coal.    COP 27 Carves a New Future for the United States and China Taiya Smith, Senior Associate (Non-resident), Energy Security and Climate Change Program COP27 was no kumbaya moment, but that should not come as a surprise. Just like any other issue that requires government action, concrete steps on climate are constrained by domestic dynamics. Take China, for example. Previously a COP leader, China's focus this year was on managing internal pressures around its 20th Party Congress. Minister Xie Zhenhua set the tone, breaking tradition by lacing his opening remarks with controversial political discourse regarding Taiwan. Then, China-the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter-refused to curb methane emissions, in opposition to most of the rest of the world. And then China turned its back on its allies in the developing world by refusing to provide financial support to countries suffering the worst from climate change impacts. In contrast, the United States assumed at least a bit of its old leadership role. Riding high on the passage of significant climate legislation and recent successful elections, U.S. climate change envoy John Kerry committed to work to scale up U.S. international climate finance to over $11 billion. If successful, this would make the United States the world's single largest contributor to global action against climate change. The COP outcomes emerged after President Biden and President Xi held their first in-person meeting, a few days earlier at the G20. While the meeting did not result in a U.S.-China denouement as happened at the Paris COP, it did suggest that the two countries have some common ground and were willing to begin to sort out new guidelines for a relationship-albeit a competitive one. Clearly, national interests and global ambitions will continue to lead the bilateral U.S.-China relationship away from the closeness of a decade ago. What remains to be explored is if developing countries will be able to leverage the U.S.- China competition to get real traction on climate finance and support for rebuilding after climate loss and damages.

The following information was released by the Government of India: India committed to domestic action and multilateral cooperation on climate change India looks forward to substantial progress on discussions related to climate finance and clarity on its definition Strengthening of the financial mechanisms of UNFCCC imperative to meet the climate finance delivery goals Progress on Adaptation and loss and damage to complement each other Progress on actions, indicators and metrics needed on the Global Goal on Adaptation India to invite all countries to join LiFE movement Lifestyle for Environment, a pro-people and pro-planet effort COP 27 rightfully named as the COP of "Implementation" Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupender Yadav will be leading Indian delegation to attend the 27th Session of Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) scheduled to be held at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt from 6-18 November, 2022. India is fully engaged with the process and is supportive of the efforts by Government of Egypt for substantive outcomes at COP 27 . In the 56th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies held in June 2022 in Bonn, developing countries made it clear that UNFCCC is the centre of the collective and multilateral response to the issue of climate change. There must be a faithful, balanced and comprehensive implementation of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, in accordance with its goals and principles. India looks forward to substantial progress on the discussions related to climate finance and clarity on its definition. As it is a saying that what gets measured gets done, more clarity is needed on the definition of climate finance for the developing countries to be able to accurately assess the extent of finance flows for climate action. While the Standing Committee on finance will submit a report on the various definitions, we hope to have good deliberations on this to arrive at a common understanding. The interpretation of the term must be in line with the commitments made by the countries on climate finance in the Convention and its Paris Agreement. The goal of USD100 billion per year of climate finance by 2020 and every year thereafter through till 2025 is yet to be achieved. Due to lack of common understanding, several estimates of what has flown as climate finance are available. While the promised amount must be reached as quickly as possible, there is a need now to substantially enhance the ambition to ensure adequate resource flow under the new quantified goal post-2024. The discussion on the new collective quantified goal in the ad-hoc working group must focus on the quantity of the resource flow and also on the quality and scope. Issues relating to access to and suggestions for improvement in the function of the financial mechanisms are also important. Besides this, improvement in transparency to ensure appropriate oversight of the quantum and direction of flows is imperative. The Ad hoc working group must provide advice/ suggestions covering all the above aspects. Strengthening of the financial mechanisms of UNFCCC and its operating entities is imperative to meet the climate finance delivery goals. There needs to be a greater discussion on this as resources available to them should be utilized well. The SCF could also play an important role in assessing the shortcomings and may suggest appropriate measures to address them. The Egyptian Presidency of COP27 , which is also a member of the Like Minded Developing Countries, has rightfully named COP 27 as the COP of Implementation. India welcomes this step as over the last twelve months the world has seen the widening gap between the statements by developed countries at COP 26 in Glasgow and the reality of their actions. India will support the Egyptian Presidency, for a plan of action that answers the needs of developing countries. Adaptation and loss and damage are two issues at the centre of attention, and a progress on these two issues will complement each other. Loss and damage must also be on the agenda of COP27 and there must be specific progress on the issue of loss and damage finance. The existing financial mechanisms, like GEF, GCF and Adaptation Fund, under the Convention have not been able to mobilise or deliver funds for loss and damage due to climate change. These mechanisms are under-funded; accessing funding is cumbersome and time-consuming; and most of the funding is for mitigation. Adaptation funding is highly inadequate and loss and damage funding is perhaps none at all. These are the circumstances based on which G77 and China has proposed adoption of an agenda item on loss and damage finance. It is the time that this issue is accorded prominence on the climate agenda that it rightfully deserves. On the Global Goal on Adaptation, there needs to be significant progress on actions, indicators and metrics. There must not be any hidden agenda of mitigation, especially in the form of nature-based solutions, in the name of co-benefits. The Work Programme on Enhanced Ambition in Mitigation and Implementation cannot be allowed to change the goal posts set by the Paris Agreement. The GST process and the other mechanisms of the Paris Agreement, including enhanced NDCs and submission of the long-term low emissions development strategies, are sufficient. In the Mitigation Work Programme best practices, new technologies and new modes of collaboration for technology transfer and capacity building may be discussed fruitfully. On the issue of finance, a discussion on Article 2.1 (c), a sub-clause of article 2, cannot be opened as a standalone COP27 agenda item at this stage. Article 2(1) (c) has to be read in conjunction with entire article 2 as well as article 9 on climate finance. Reaching the USD 100 billion per year goal must come first, and the developed countries must be asked to show the roadmap for the same. India will emphasize again on its invitation to all countries to join the LiFE movement Lifestyle for Environment, a pro-people and pro-planet effort that seeks to shift the world from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilization of natural resources. India is committed to both domestic action and multilateral cooperation on climate change, and will continue to fight all global environmental concerns in the call to protect humanitys planetary home. But global warming also warns that equity and international cooperation, leaving no one behind, hold the key to success, where the most fortunate must lead the way. \</doc>

The University of California-San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography issued the following news: Denise Alcantara one of 20 UCSD students at international climate negotiation    Pakistan's glaciers melted. Water and ice rushed down the mountains to the communities. Bridges and homes washed away in an instant. A storm hit the country shortly afterwards, worsening the floods. "Permanent lakes have formed over highways, schools, hospitals, and croplands," said Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's Federal Minister of Climate Change after showing a harrowing video of the unprecedented series of catastrophic events that happened in Pakistan ultimately caused by due to extremely high temperatures. Minister Rehman stood before us with piercing eyes in a side event room at the just-concluded COP27 Today, Pakistan is facing a public health crisis with water-borne diseases affecting the population because floodwaters are in places where there shouldn't be water. Climate change is everybody's problem and the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference is a unique avenue at which almost every county across the globe is invited to present its solutions and work together to find solutions. As a Filipino international student at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, I watched what might have been the most talked-about issue at this year's event: the concept of loss and damage in which those most responsible for the climate change that has taken place so far help those with less to do with it recover from present-day damage and buttress themselves from future damage. COP27 was a great opportunity for me to learn about how climate-vulnerable developing countries are represented at the world's largest climate conference. The Philippines, an archipelagic country of over 7,000 islands in Southeast Asia, is currently ranked number 1 in the World Risk Index--an annual report assessing each country's disaster risk from hurricanes/typhoons, floods, sea-level rise, tsunamis, earthquakes, and the vulnerability of societies from these hazards. In November 2013, one of the deadliest and costliest typhoons in history, Super Typhoon Haiyan, killed more than 6,000 Filipinos and cost the Philippine economy $2.2 billion in damages. How can a country recover from that loss, especially when several super typhoons have made landfall in the Philippine islands since Haiyan? In the high-level side event "Climate Finance Needs of Developing Countries," Maldives' Minister of Environment, Climate Change and Technology Aminath Shauna revealed that one of the biggest issues that climate-vulnerable countries face is access to funds. "It takes four to five years to access funds," she said. In the same side event, Shawn Edward, Minister of Education, Sustainable Development, Innovation, Science, Technology and Vocational Training in the Carribean country of Saint Lucia, added that they are left with no choice but to borrow because of the degree of frequency of disasters affecting countries like his. Bureaucracy was the main concern among the ministers present at the event. They demanded simpler and more efficient schemes to access funds. How can developing countries implement adaptation plans when there is little money available and that available money is hard to access? How can a country meet its development goals when the forecast is that the disasters already felt will intensify as the temperature rises? This year's COP is dubbed as Implementation COP and implementation cannot be done without effective climate finance mechanisms. "We have failed on mitigation. We have failed on financing adaptation. So now, we have to address loss and damage!" Shauna said. Talks on loss and damage began in COP13 in 2007 and were officially adopted in the Paris agreement at COP21 in 2015. In the Paris Agreement, the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage was recognized. It is a fact that the countries suffering the worst impacts of climate change are the countries that contributed the least to the problem. Loss and damage could be one of the ways for the countries who profited the most from burning fossil fuels to pay climate reparations. Where are we on this? Short answer is it's still in the works. Aside from the negotiations and the side events organized by the UN, governments or Parties and civil society groups are given the opportunity to host events and exhibit their research and/or advocacy through Pavilions. For the first time in COPs, an Ocean Pavilion was organized to showcase the importance of ocean-based solutions in addressing climate change. This was made possible through Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and 18 partners, which are also science- and research-focused institutions. The oceans control the climate. There is an urgent need to integrate the best available ocean science to inform policy. What is happening to our oceans? How is it affecting the world's climate? How is the changing ocean affecting both marine and terrestrial life? What are the current marine technologies that can detect these changes? How can we develop better models to better predict disasters such as typhoons? Oceans absorb 90 percent of heat from global warming. While they serve as buffers keeping the planet from warming to levels posing existential threats to society, warmer oceans pose critical hazards to both land and marine organisms. The Ocean Pavilion is the hub for any ocean-related dialogue. It is the space where observers and policymakers can learn more and collaborate to help address the climate crisis. While the Ocean Pavilion is a leap in terms of highlighting ocean solutions and issues into the climate agenda, I hope to see more local solutions and issues showcased from the Global South. Growing up in Manila for me meant dealing with floods and storms on a regular basis and watching the sinking of communities due to sea-level rise. My being a reef researcher in the Philippines also means witnessing hundreds of corals turn white and die due to warmer seas. Climate change has been real to me for decades. I still dream for the day when climate justice is served. Will it ever come? That is still unclear to me. The negotiations are painfully slow. If you're the type of person who hates group work with three or four other people working for the same goal, imagine working with almost 200 other group mates who have their own agenda. This is the excruciating process that COP negotiators have to go through during the two-week meeting of the parties. On the other hand, there are roundtable discussions that observers or members of civil society groups could participate in. I was part of a discussion on adaptation in which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was seeking concrete ideas on how to move from adaptation plans to implementation, how to overcome barriers, and identify possible opportunities. It was amazing to witness how people from different countries voice out their truths to ensure that their truth is accounted for. I am pleasantly surprised that COP had a space for this. I started the week enraged and frustrated at the lack of representation from the Global South relative to the Global North. How can we find solutions when those with the biggest voices are the ones who caused the problem in the first place? But I still left the conference last Sunday with hope in my heart. One thing was clear to me, I am not alone. The existential problem we are all facing threatens every facet of our being and there are thousands of people who care enough to work night and day to move the needle towards progress.

(TNSconf) -- The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy issued the following news release: As governments and civil society prepare to gather in Sharm el-Sheikh for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) is joining partners around the world to advocate for agroecology and real zero and just solutions for agriculture. We are also exposing false net-zero agribusiness climate claims. IATP has engaged with the United Nations climate talks for more than two decades, advocating for bolder action to reduce emissions and deeper investments in a just transition, particularly for food and agriculture. At COP27 , IATP staff will prioritize the following:  Net-Zero pledges: Net-zero promises allow major polluters, such as agribusiness and fossil fuel companies, to continue status quo operations while using land-based carbon credits to "offset" emissions. IATP is demanding that countries and agribusiness companies make real emissions cuts to strive for real zero.  Methane action: Agriculture is the world's largest methane source. Urgent action is required to cut emissions of the potent gas. At COP26, more than 100 countries launched the Global Methane Pledge, yet none have committed to systemically cut methane from agriculture. Through research on the methane emissions of some of the world's largest livestock companies, IATP is highlighting the need to regulate emissions and transition from the high-emitting industrial model of animal agriculture.  Investment in food systems resilience: The threat from climate change and the vulnerabilities in the supply chain necessitate a commitment to investment of international resources into climate adaptation strategies to make food and farm systems more resilient.  International support for agroecology: A COP27 outcome should provide meaningful guidance on agriculture and resources to countries for transitioning their food and farming system towards agroecology. Over the next three weeks, IATP will release publications focused on these four themes. Publications include analysis of the following: the AIM for Climate initiative; the United States' commitment to the Global Methane Pledge; and agribusiness' positions on carbon removals. In addition, IATP with Changing Markets will release a first-of-its-kind report of the methane emissions of 15 of the biggest global meat and dairy companies. IATP also launched its COP27 podcast series ( HYPERLINK https://www.iatp.org/cop-27-sharm-el-sheikh-egypt-2022 https://www.iatp.org/ HYPERLINK cop-27 -sharm-el-sheikh-egypt-2022 During COP27 IATP experts will be available on-the-ground in Sharm el-Sheikh and virtually to provide comment on COP27 developments.

The UN's COP 27 climate conference in Egypt has started on a relatively harmonious note, after an agreement was reached on Sunday to include compensation for "loss and damage" in the official agenda for the two weeks of talks. However, the goodwill could soon evaporate if rich countries prove unwilling to help poor countries cope with climate change at a time when all nations are grappling with high energy prices, soaring inflation and other serious challenges. Compensation for loss and damage could indeed become the defining issue of this year's conference, exacerbating tensions between rich and poor after recent severe floods in Pakistan and Nigeria highlighted the consequences of climate change. At the heart of the debate is the idea that past and present carbon emissions of wealthier nations have contributed to climate-related damage in less developed countries and that they therefore have a moral responsibility to help them. Long a demand of the small island nations most at risk from rising seas and floods, this issue has been discussed during financial sessions at previous UN climate conferences, but never before as a stand-alone agenda item. Litmus Test "Loss and damage can no longer be swept under the rug. It is a moral imperative," UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the opening session of the conference in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. "Getting concrete results on loss and damage is a litmus test of the commitment of the governments to the success of COP27 ," he added. Guterres called for a clearly defined loss and damage roadmap "reflective of the scale and urgency of the challenge" to deliver "effective institutional arrangements for financing." He also repeated his call for governments to tax windfall fossil fuel profits. "Let's redirect that money to people struggling with rising food and energy prices and to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis," the UN Secretary General urged world leaders attending the session. Campaigners welcomed the elevation of loss and damage at this year's conference as "historic," but demanded substantial progress, including an agreement to create a dedicated fund with sufficient financial resources to provide compensation. Paltry Funding Losses in areas such as housing, infrastructure and communities could rise to $580 billion per year in 2030, according to the French Institute of International Relations, but funding for loss and damage remains paltry so far. The largest pledge to date, a fairly modest $13 million, was made by Denmark in September. Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of Scotland, which offered $2 million at the COP26 gathering in Glasgow last year, said in Sharm-el-Sheikh on Monday that she would announce a further financial commitment soon. With Western governments reluctant to commit to massive increases in public funding for climate aid, efforts are instead focusing on trying to boost private sector funding for initiatives in developing economies. The US and EU are both working on proposals to help achieve this, including an increase in "blended" finance packages where funding is provided by multilateral development banks and private sector institutions. Carbon offsets are seen as another way to to boost the flow of private funds to developing countries, with some press reports indicating that the US could unveil a new carbon credit initiative at COP27 on Wednesday. Oil Industry Voices Oil- and gas-producing nations are a more prominent presence at COP27 , especially compared with the last few conferences held in European cities. While producers are often criticized at these gatherings for prolonging dependence on oil and gas, this year's host Egypt has given them a greater opportunity to make the case that they are facilitating the energy transition rather than impeding it. Speaking on Monday at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund will now be targeting net-zero emissions by 2050 within its investment portfolio.

Nov 08, 2022( International Business Times India: HYPERLINK http://ibtimes.co.in Delivered by Newstex) COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has kicked off in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, introducing for the first time the loss and damage funding into the agenda. The term "loss and damage" in UN climate negotiations refers to expenses already incurred as a result of climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels or extreme heat waves. While current climate funding focuses on cutting carbon emissions to prevent climate change in the future, establishing a "loss and damage" fund means compensating countries that can't avoid or "adapt" to the changes that have already happened. Attending the conference is also the noted Indian climate and environmental activist - Licypriya Kangujam, who arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh for the UN COP27 Climate Change Summit. The 11-year-old girl, with her vocal views on climate change, has demanded strict laws to fight climate change. " COP27 COP27 Who is Licypriya Kangujam (Licy)? Licy is a familiar name in the circles of climate change activists. She is one of the youngest climate activists globally, who has been championing her cause to protect, preserve and nurture our environment by fighting climate change at an even tender age of just six. Not just in India, she has traveled the world for her cause, bringing to notice the alarming effects of climate change in front of world leaders. Transforming the Taj Mahal into a plastic pollution-free monument in June 2022 is to her credit. She has even attended the United Nations Climate Conference 2019 (COP25) in Madrid and the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly 2022. She has spoken in over 400 institutions and other platforms in over 32 countries advocating to adults about the threat of climate change as a part of her movement. So how did this inspiring journey of India's youngest climate activist begin? Licy was born in Manipur, a state in Northeast India known for being carbon negative. She grew up in Bhubaneswar before moving to Delhi in 2019. But the life-changing moment was when the devastating Cyclone Titli hit in 2018 Cyclone Fani in 2019. Licypriya Kangujam, 10-year-old Indian climate activistvia Twitter "During the cyclones, many people lost their lives and many children lost their parents and thousands of people become homeless. I was very sad. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't drink. I even couldn't take my food," Licy recalls. And when she moved to Delhi, she was shocked by the high air pollution and extreme heat wave crisis. Licy decided to take things into her hands and hoped to bring about a change, which would be for the future of this world. She was just six at the time. She is also the founder of The Child Movement foundation and Special Envoy to the President of Timor Leste. What is Licy fighting for? Speaking to International Business Times, Licy revealed she has three main demands from the leaders of the world to fight climate change. To pass a climate change law as soon as possible in the parliament: If they pass a climate change law then it will help to control the carbon emissions and greenhouse gases. It will also give climate. justice to millions of poor vulnerable people who are already the victim of climate change. To make climate education mandatory in the school education curriculum: If they include climate change as compulsory in our school education curriculum then we can fight the climate change from the grassroots. There will be no climate solution without climate education. To plant minimum 10 trees every year by each student: In India, there are 350 million students. If 350 million students plant minimum 10 trees every year, we will plant 3.5 billion trees every year. Trust me, India will be green in 5-10 years. For a young girl her age, she has a dream of a visionary. She hopes to see more bicycle on roads instead of more fossil fuel vehicles; coal power plants and thermal power plants replaced by clean energy; clean air to breathe; clean water to drink and a clean planet to live in. "Asking clean air to breathe, clean water to drink and clean planet to live is our basic rights." Licy is making all the efforts possible to make her demands heard loud and clear. For instance, just to get to COP27 [1]in Egypt, she sold tea on the streets and raised the funds. She calls upon world leaders to drive change and deliver climate justice. "Your action today will decide our future tomorrow," she says. " COP27 Licy is also taking her cause to her school, where she says her friends join her in the efforts to fight climate change. Inspired by her, many students stopped using single-use plastic and join Licy in her cleanliness drives, climate protests, and massive tree plantations. Licy's commitment to climate change isn't taking her focus away from her studies. She makes sure her studies and activism is balanced out without affecting one or the other. She reserves program invitations for weekends and other holidays and interviews and other activities until after school hours in the afternoon. Like many kids her age, she also plays with her friends every day in the evening. India at COP27 Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav on Sunday inaugurated India Pavilion at the conference, scheduled from November 6 till 18. While inaugurating the pavilion, Yadav said: "India believes climate action starts from the grassroots, individual level and hence designed the India Pavilion with the theme of LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment." India also pushed forward the idea of climate finance, introduction of new technologies, and new collaborations to facilitate technology transfers, he added. Licy acknowledges India's efforts in its fight against climate change. But raises the bigger question of what the developed nations are doing on this front. "Rich countries must pay for the loss and damage, I mean urgent climate finance, not as a loan to the developing countries to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement. Otherwise, it will be impossible to keep 1.5 degree Celsius alive," she said.

Nov 20, 2022( The Connecticut Mirror: HYPERLINK https://ctmirror.org Women are historically underrepresented at the United Nations' global conference on climate change, and this year's gathering, in Egypt, is no exception. But gender rights groups have worked to ensure that women  who are disproportionately impacted by climate change  aren't left out of key decision-making spaces. For the last week, delegations of government officials, civil society organizations and activists from around the world have convened in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt for the United Nations' annual Conference of Parties, known better as COP 27 . That matters particularly to women because they are disproportionately impacted by climate change. They are overwhelmingly displaced by climate disasters and are over 14 times more likely to be killed by climate-linked disasters, according to[1] the UN Human Rights Commission. Despite that fact, they are often left out of these key decision-making spaces on the climate crisis. Here are some of the key demands these gender justice groups are making as countries enter a second week of climate negotiations. Women's representation in climate leadership A photo of the heads of state and government representatives attending COP27  which was overwhelmingly men  went viral on social media at the start of the conference. According to the United Nations, of the 110 heads of state and government at the conference this year, only seven were women. The lack of women was illustrative of a larger issue of representation at COP 27 and previous climate conferences. While the numbers aren't in yet for this year's conference, last year the percentage of women in party delegations, convoys comprised of government representatives sent from countries participating in COP, was around 37 percent, but over 70 percent of total speaking time by delegates was taken up by men, according to a report[2] produced by the United Nations Foundation. Civil organizations and official stakeholder groups like the Women and Gender Constituency work to ensure their voices are heard at COP by organizing side events and protests. As in other years, women, and especially women of color and from countries in the Global South are demanding that their voices be heard and amplified in climate negotiations. 'When we talk about representation it is about more than numbers; it is meaningful representation and inclusion,' said Nada Elbohi, an Egyptian feminist and youth advocate, in a press release. 'It is bringing the priorities of African women and girls to the table.' An emphasis on listening to African and Indigenous women was one of 27 demands made by the African Feminist Taskforce, ahead of the start of COP27 . Including women in climate negotiations, with an emphasis on Indigenous women in particular, is crucial to managing the climate crisis, say advocates. In many countries, Indigenous women are on the frontlines of the climate crisis already, and while Indigenous people make up just 6 percent of the global population, they protect 80 percent of the world's biodiversity. Gender justice organizations are also calling on countries to individually dedicate financing and resources to enhance the participation of women and LGBTQ+ people in climate action from a local to national level, through what's known as the Gender Action Plan. This plan which was adopted at COP23[3], has several goals, including increasing representation of women in national delegations, increasing women's role in energy development, and addressing women's vulnerability to climate-linked disasters. Protections for environmental and human rights defenders The Women and Gender Constituency  which represents dozens of gender rights groups  held a protest at COP27 Friday, calling out the names of environmental and human rights defenders who have been killed defending their land and communities. Mara Dolan, program manager with international women's advocacy group the Women's Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), said the action was organized to emphasize the real human cost of the climate crisis to COP27 delegations and negotiators. In 2021, over 200 environmental and land defenders were murdered, according to Global Witness, a nonprofit that works to expose the role that extractive industries like mining and logging play in perpetrating human rights abuses. With a transition to electrification fueling an uptick in demand for minerals needed to produce things like electric cars, communities that live on the frontlines of extraction are still at risk. 'We have women leaders who we've lost because of their stances around protecting the land, protecting the community, protecting their communities and villages,' said Ozawa Bineshi Albert, a Yuchi and Anishinaabe woman who serves as the co-director of the Climate Justice Alliance  a coalition of U.S.-based grassroots environmental justice organizations.'So we have to lift that up as a violation against the human rights of women, women in climate change work and environmental justice work not to mention the threats that they experience because of the extractive industries that are contributing to the climate crisis.' Loss and damages This year, for the first time, a 'loss and damage' fund was put on the COP27 agenda. The fund is a call for countries that have been the greatest contributors to the climate crisis to pay those countries that are suffering disproportionately from it. 'We want to see negotiations deliver a stand-alone financing facility for 'loss and damage'  the negative effects of climate change that people cannot cope with or adapt to,' said Sylvia Dorbor, a negotiator on behalf of Liberia in a press release. 'In the last year alone, the African continent has seen major climate disasters, drought, floods and food insecurity. There is a historic and ongoing lack of support and compensation for the victims of climate change, who are disproportionately women.' But for many activists, it's about more than the climate crisis  it's about addressing the ravages of colonialism and exploitation of the human and natural world, too. 'We have arrived at this moment of crisis because of so much inequitable harm,' Dolan said. 'For us loss and damages is really about reparations,' Albert, from the Climate Justice Alliance said. 'How are communities lifted up and being invested in after all the harms that they've been experiencing?'

The following information was released by the Government of Canada: Statement from the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, on the United States multi-country Declaration to cut emissions from the oil and gas sector announced today at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ): "Past climate actions by the Government of Canada, the oil and gas producing provinces, and the industry, provide a solid foundation to reduce emissions in the years ahead. With oil and gas profits reaching record heights, now is the time for those companies to invest in positioning themselves for future success in a decarbonized world economy. "In fact, Canada's largest oil and gas companies have committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and many are making significant investments to further reduce their methane emissions. We welcome and encourage this commitment. The Government of Canada is reinforcing these efforts with new regulations to cap and cut emissions in the oil and gas sector, including regulations to cut methane from oil and gas by at least seventy-five percent from 2012 levels by 2030, clean fuel regulations, and funding to clean up orphan wells, as well as tax incentives for carbon-capture technologies and the development of clean fuels and technologies, such as hydrogen, biomethanization, and more. "Climate change won't wait for us. We have a short decade of opportunity for a smooth transition toward an economy powered by clean energy that supports good, sustainable jobs, and a liveable planet. Working together, we can make it happen." \</doc>

WellSpan Health\' s pledge to reduce emissions 50% by 2030 earned it recognition by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on Nov. 10. The health system has formally pledged to make health care facilities more sustainable by achieving net zero emissions by 2050, WellSpan Health said.  The WellSpan Health team is excited to embark on this effort as part of our commitment to reimagine healthcare. Our sustainability strategy is just another way we are taking action to improve the health of our patients and team members, as well as all our friends and neighbors across southcentral Pennsylvania, said Roxanna Gapstur, president and CEO of WellSpan Health.  Together, with other leading health systems across the country, our collective impact will be tremendous.  The health system announced significant clinical and operational changes last month, including partnerships with local suppliers, greening of clinical operations and increased water and energy conservation through efficiencies in business operations. A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the number one threat to global public health. The healthcare sector also contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8.5% of U.S. domestic emissions, WellSpan Health said. The HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge to help focus industry response to climate challenges. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities for both chronic and acute catastrophic climate impacts. More than 100 prominent health companies in the U.S. have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including organizations representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more. Federal systems like the Indian Health Service (IHS), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Military Health System (MHS) are working together to meet similar goals to those these private sector organizations have embraced. Combined, this means that over 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing over 15% of U.S. hospitals.  HHS returns this year to COP27 to report great progress, said ADM Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel Levine.  Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector.

The following information was released by Transparency International: The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will begin this Sunday, 6 November. For years, Transparency International has been calling attention to potential conflicts of interest and undue influence impacting climate policy and calling on leaders to address gaps. This year the UNFCCC Secretariat began an "observer review process" to ensure meaningful, inclusive, fair and transparent engagement from all observers, including civil society, academia and businesses and stop undue influence. But the process has been delayed, making no progress since the last COP. Brice Bohmer, climate and environment lead at Transparency International, said: "Fighting climate change and fighting corruption go hand in hand. The world's most powerful industries, from fossil fuels to automobile manufacturers, continue to lobby to dilute and delay climate policies and they must be stopped if we are to make real progress to save our planet. "We are thrilled that the UNFCCC Secretariat has begun to recognise this issue by beginning the observer review process and putting conflict of interest on this year's agenda, but we need tangible action now. Transparency International calls on the Secretariat to urgently implement a conflict of interest policy and put a stop to major corporations and polluting interests rendering climate action ineffective." Transparency International is co-hosting an official COP27 side event "Climate Justice, Civic Space and Public Participation" on 16 November from 15:00-16:30. \</doc>

Since HYPERLINK last year\' s summit HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/26/climate/un-climate-pledges-warming.html 26 of the 193 countries To understand the stakes, I spoke with my colleague Lisa Friedman. COP27 will be the 11th climate conference she has covered. What are the major themes? Countries that failed last year to put forward strengthened targets were expected to do so before COP27 . And the protection of vulnerable countries is going to be really high on the agenda. This year, Pakistan is leading the G77, which is a group of developing nations, so Pakistani leaders are going to be out front on the issue of aid for countries in need of support. We\' ll also hear a lot on the subject from the HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/27/magazine/barbados-climate-debt-mia-mottley.html small island nations So we\' re most likely going to see developing countries make a dramatic stand and call for wealthy nations to provide compensation for a problem that they didn\' t cause but with which they have to deal. How does the war in Ukraine affect the talks? A lot of countries are finding it very hard to move forward this year with their climate commitments.

It was cooperation between the U.S. and China that made HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/13/world/europe/climate-change-accord-paris.html the Paris Agreement This year, it\' s hard to imagine the U.S. and China making any kind of joint anything. And in the long term, it\' s impossible to see how the world can stay at safe temperatures without the world\' s biggest emitters working together. Even though this is the 27th meeting, climate change is still barreling forward. Is anything going to change this time around? I have medium expectations. There are big COPs and little COPs, and every five years or so there is a big decision-making protocol: Kyoto, Paris, Glasgow. I do expect there to be agreements and deals that move things farther along in the right direction. But the thing we\' ll be looking for is whether governments will keep the promises they make at these summits.

November 4, 2022 | CULTURE | By Rhetta Power | Illustration by Rowan Kempen On Nov. 3, Colorado College sent a delegation of AN380 students to the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference . This year is the 27th Conference of Parties . COP27 will take place between Nov. 6-18 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt and is expected to have around 40,000 attendants. A core mission of CC's delegation is to bring back tangible climate action and knowledge from the conference to share with the campus community. As a student in this Egypt-bound class, I would like to introduce you to fellow members of CC's delegation. Our group is comprised of ten CC students, one student from CSU, one high school student, and two professors. We come from a variety of backgrounds but share a common interest in acting against the terrifying reality of climate change. Sarah Hautzinger From Denver, CO Sarah, a professor of anthropology, is teaching this class because of a long and winding story that runs through her ethnographic research in Madrid, to Baca, and concludes with a realization that the rest of her life will be focused on climate action and justice work. Sarah is most looking forward to watching how all 14 of us in the delegation find our individual pathways in what we learn. She is also looking forward to pursuing her research on the moral, ethical, and spiritual dimensions of climate activism and her project on love and joy in climate work. Myra Jackson From California Myra, CC's mindfulness resident, is teaching this class because of her longstanding involvement with the COP and climate activism. As an Earth Elder, she believes that she can have the greatest impact by supporting inter-generational work. She described her involvement in the course as an "easy yes," and views the experience as a good use of her time on the planet and her five-plus years of work at CC. Myra is most looking forward to seeing the effects on each of us students and seeing any ripple effects we enact on CC's campus. Owen Brown '24 From Minneapolis, MN Owen, a mathematical economics major, is taking this course because of his interest in international politics; he believes going to a U.N. conference will be a great way to understand how people negotiate and come to like terms. He is looking forward to speaking with people from a wide variety of backgrounds at the event. Owen is most looking forward to comparing the work of activists, student groups, and NGOs with political organizations in the COP. Layla Haji '25 Neuroscience and Biochemistry From Denver, CO Layla, a neuroscience and biochemistry major, is taking this class to gain perspective on the magnitude of climate change. She thinks that being able to attend COP and see all the players in action will help her to become a better climate activist. She is very excited to hear all the new proposals for sustainable energy and decarbonization. Layla noted that these interests arise because oceans have only recently been introduced into COPs and countries are really pushing adaptation mitigation this year. Mary Andrews '23 Environmental Studies and French From Northampton, MA Mary, an environmental studies and French double major, is taking this class in order to gain perspective on which climate issues are most relevant, and use this information to inform her career beyond CC. She is most looking forward to listening. Although she thinks it might be overwhelming, she is going to try to attend as many informational sessions as she can. She is excited to see who is at the conference and view COP with a critical lens. Mary notes that COP seems a bit stagnant; she wants to figure out why things seem as though they are going around in circles. Olivia Jacobson '22 From Denver, CO Olivia, who is studyingenvironmental science and archeology at CC, is taking this course because she wants to take advantage of the opportunity to be able to experience and be involved with climate work happening globally. She is most looking forward to meeting other young people involved in climate action and experiencing all the different forms of exchanging knowledge. Mika Alexander '23 From Chicago, IL Mika, who is studying anthropology, political science, and race, ethnicity and migrations studies, is taking this class because of anthropological research she conducted with Sarah this past summer on climate action in communities. Attending the COP is an opportunity to scale her summer research up to the international level. She is most looking forward to being in a space where she can talk to people involved in all levels of climate actions and negotiations. Gracie Roe '25 From Newton, MA Gracie, a psychology major, is taking this course because it is a chance to share her voice on an international level and immerse herself in climate policies and climate change mitigation. She is most looking forward to presenting at the COP and our affiliated presentations with the Youth Environmental Alliance in Higher Education network. Reeve Schroeder '24 From Massachusetts Reeve is taking this class because she is an Anthropology major who is generally interested in environmental justice. She is excited to find opportunities to learn more about environmental justice issues at the COP and most excited to have the opportunity to interact with people from so many different backgrounds and places. Naomi Henry '24 From Brooklyn, NY Naomi, who is studying environmental studies, southwest studies, and music, is taking this class because it feels like stepping out of her comfort zone to be in a space with so much power. At the same time, she feels it will be an incredible, scary, and special opportunity to be in a space where so much change is happening. She is really looking forward to meeting many different people from all over and learning about the amazing work they are doing. Cecilia Timberg '23 From Washington, D.C. Cecilia, an environmental studies and anthropology double major, applied to this class not even knowing what COP stood for but was drawn in instead by the fact that we would be practicing ethnography. As an anthropology major, she has been grappling with the question of whether there is an ethical way to practice ethnography. She took this course to watch how ethnographic practices would play out "in the field." She is most excited for all the things she doesn't yet know that she doesn't know. Amara Nwuneli is a 15-year-old Nigerian-American activist, social innovator, actor, and author. She is the founder of Fight Global Warming Nigeria, a movement that works to raise awareness about climate change among Nigerians through interactive workshops, informational videos, and local initiatives. At COP27 , she is excited for the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and work together to make a wide-scale sustainable solution. She also wishes to represent the younger generation of African climate activists. During this event, she plans to not only deepen her understanding and perspective of the fight against climate change but to share what she has already been doing and call for action on a national scale. Susan Allison is an Ecosystem Science and Sustainability Master's student from Greenville, South Carolina at Colorado State University. She is attending COP27 as a part of a course at CSU called International Climate Negotiations. She is most looking forward to the opportunity to learn more about how other cultures around the world view sustainability and what taking action looks like from a perspective that is not just the United States policy lens. Rhetta Power '23 From Saint Paul, MN I am studying psychology and feminist and gender studies here at CC and am taking this course because of my experience in the Anthropocene class last year; it opened my eyes to the urgency of collaborative climate action. I am excited to visit Egypt for the opportunity to engage in an international meeting of this scale, and to witness and participate in action being made for our future. Through CC Communications and platforms such as Instagram and WordPress, our delegation hopes to share as much back home as possible. If issues of environmental justice and international relations interest you, keep an eye out for us! \</doc>

(TNSsel) -- The National Wildlife Federation issued the following news release: The final agreement of the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change made important progress in building alignment and agreement among world powers. The agreement includes essential, landmark provisions that pave the way for climate reparations and a more unified, global agreement on the protective value of nature. Crucially, the participants also resolved to seek to avoid warming the globe beyond 1.5 C, though additional action is needed with the United Nations projecting the planet is on track for 2.5 C warming in the coming decades. The agreement did not include a clear commitment to phase out the use of fossil fuels in line with the evidence on climate mitigation. " COP27 "Over the course of two weeks, leaders from around the world -- including Brazil, Ghana, and the United States -- reiterated that forests can and will play a central role in mitigating climate change, as did the final decision text," said Edie Juno, forestry specialist at the National Wildlife Federation. "As our window of opportunity closes, protection and responsible stewardship of forests, grasslands, oceans, and other ecosystems -- and their irreplaceable biodiversity -- is more important than ever." The National Wildlife Federation, which sent a delegation to Egypt for the two-week gathering, urged countries to prioritize the use of natural infrastructure, such as coastal floodplains and healthy forests, to save lives, naturally sequester carbon, provide essential wildlife habitat, and support clean air and water for people. The National Wildlife Federation and the Climate Equity Collaborative, which engages communities, youth and nonprofits in designing and implementing equitable and inclusive climate solutions, participated in and supported environmental programs and partners at the first-ever climate justice pavilion.

November 09, (THEWILL) The United Kingdom (UK) has pledged Pound 200 million to the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group's Climate Action Window. The AfDB in a statement said the window is a new mechanism set up to channel climate finance to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. The statement quoted the British Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, as saying the UK would provide Pound 200 million to the AfDB Group's Climate Action Window. Cleverly spoke alongside African leaders at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. "Climate change is having a devastating impact on some of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, but historically they have received a tiny proportion of climate finance. "This new mechanism from the African Development Bank will see vital funds delivered to those most affected by the impacts of climate change, much more quickly", he said. The UK foreign secretary also said that access to climate finance for emerging economies was a central focus at COP26 in Glasgow. "I am pleased to see tangible progress being made, supported today by Pound 200 million of UK funding. " According to the statement, Glasgow Climate Pact included a commitment from donors to double adaptation finance between 2019 and 2025. Similarly, British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said the UK would surpass that target and triple adaptation funding from Pound 500 million in 2019 to Pound 1.5 billion by 2025. "This funding package provided to the African Development Bank will be 100 percent earmarked for adaptation", Sunak said even as he also confirmed that the UK was delivering on the target of spending Pound 11.6 billion on International Climate Finance (ICF) between 2021/22 and 2025/26. Meanwhile, the President of the AfDB Group, Akinwumi Adesina, has welcomed the additional funding from the United Kingdom. "I applaud the UK government for this major contribution toward the capitalisation of the Climate Action Window of the African Development Fund. "As it seeks to raise more financing to support vulnerable low-income African countries that are most affected by climate change. "This bold move and support of the UK will strengthen our collective efforts to build climate resilience for African countries. "With increasing frequencies of droughts, floods and cyclones that are devastating economies, the UK support for climate adaptation is timely, needed, and inspiring in closing the climate adaptation financing gap for Africa. "I came to COP27 in Egypt with the challenge of climate adaptation for Africa topmost on my mind. I encourage others to follow this leadership on climate adaptation shown by the UK." \</doc>

Business Roundtable issued the following news release: On Wednesday, November 9, Business Roundtable CEOs and other company leaders participated in a panel discussion, "CEOs Accelerating the Global Low-Carbon Transition," at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The discussion focused on the unique initiatives their companies have undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and help advance a low-carbon future through data-driven innovation and strategic partnerships, with appropriate policy that supports both. The panel was moderated by Kara Hurst, Chief Sustainability Officer at Amazon, who facilitated a discussion between business leaders from four additional Roundtable member companies. Panelists included George Oliver, Chair of the Business Roundtable Energy and Environment Committee and Chairman and CEO of Johnson Controls; Michael Kasbar, Chairman, President and CEO of World Fuel Services Corporation; Pedro Pizarro, CEO of Edison International; and Solomon Assefa, Vice President at IBM Research.    What They Are Saying On What Companies Are Doing:  Hurst: "At Amazon, we have committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions across our operations by 2040 - 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. We are on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and by the end of 2021 the company had reached 85%. As the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally, Amazon now has a total of more than 375 renewable energy projects, representing 18.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity."  Oliver: "From a digital standpoint, our OpenBlue Platform allows us to bridge all of the systems into one data platform, be able to apply AI and achieve different outcomes ... that can [lead to] more efficiency in the building. More important, with that efficiency we can reduce the energy consumed 30, 40, 50%. So, our focus has been combining that technology with all of our systems that ultimately creates a net zero building as a service."  Pizarro: "How do you get there? Renewable power and storage on the supply side, electrifying three-quarters of transportation and 90% of buildings, using clean fuels like hydrogen and carbon capture--really using all the tools in the toolbox."  Kasbar: "In terms of SAF [Sustainable Aviation Fuel], these are pioneers, these are folks that have dedicated decades, without really a lot of support, without a lot of people believing them...it's admirable and the thing that we do is support those individuals wherever we can, we will invest in them and certainly support them [by] ... underwriting a lot of energy distribution ...we just try to be in the good column."  Assefa: "Leveraging technologies such as AI and the cloud to drive well-informed reduction of their own carbon footprint. ... The most exciting thing for me is the innovation side. ... We have about 3,000 research scientists around the world and if you ask them now what are they working on, they will tell you 'we're working on climate and sustainability.'"    On the Business Community's Leadership:  Oliver: "The business community over the last few years has really elevated the commitment to ultimately protect the environment and execute in our individual industries ... now, there's an urgency to work together and drive progress to protect the planet's health."  Pizarro: "We're seeing a greater sense of urgency in the business community. ... We also see an important role for increasing U.S. competitiveness in global markets by having more of these technologies [produced] here [in the U.S.]." On the Need for Supportive Policy & Partnerships to Accelerate a Transition to a Clean Energy Future:  Hurst: "[decarbonizing our transportation network] is intended to drive innovation across the industry and encourage more public charging infrastructure, which will help enable the broader transportation industry to more quickly reduce emissions. But it will take time to remove carbon emissions from heavy transportation systems, including ocean shipping, aviation, and trucking. Governments and the private sector need to come together on this important work."  Oliver: "As we're doing that [working to reduce energy consumption/GHG emissions], there's been a big focus on how do we now drive the partnerships, the policies and then the standards to really drive a significant step forward to decarbonize. ... There's an urgency now in the private sector but working with the public sector globally to be able to drive standards to what we believe is possible today. ... That can make a real big difference."  Pizarro: "It's been helpful to see the support through the bipartisan infrastructure bill ... the CHIPS Plus Act. I think all of [that legislation] will help to strengthen the manufacturing base and the research and development base in the U.S. to contribute that globally."  Kasbar: "We're really dealing with triangulating the trilemma of resiliency, security, affordability and access and sustainability and we've got the triumvirate of public, private, and societal factors that you need to navigate."  Assefa: "Everyone needs to be able to partner together so that we can really drive and accelerate innovation."    On Sustainability with an Eye Toward the Future:  Pizarro: "As we look forward ... so much of the investment is linked directly to sustainability and clean energy."  Kasbar: "We have this incredible transformation, and it does take everybody. Every bit counts, so just get started."  Assefa: "Sustainability isn't something you do on the side. It's a business imperative." Business Roundtable members have been helping to lead the charge when it comes to reducing GHG emissions in the United States and globally by executing on initiatives to reduce energy consumption, accelerate technology adoption and shape smart energy and sustainability policy. The Roundtable also recognizes the U.S. will not meet its climate goals without reforming the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects. For the U.S. to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, an unprecedented amount of new infrastructure must be planned, permitted and built within the next decade. The current permitting system is a roadblock to the new infrastructure projects. Business Roundtable is calling on Congress to pass bipartisan legislation reforming the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects this year. The reforms the Roundtable supports would reduce emissions, uphold environmental protections and pave the way for the U.S. to become a clean energy powerhouse.

On Sunday, November 6, the annual two-week UN climate negotiations kicked off in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, with over 35,000 delegates, NGO workers, journalists, and activists from around the world in attendance. One hundred and twenty heads of state will join, including President Biden, who attended briefly on Friday and will attend again after the G20 for the final days. The climate talks focus, as usual, on nations' commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and on transferring funding and technology from developed to developing countries. But this year's climate conference, also known as the Conference of the Parties or COP 27 , addresses two additional issues: compensation from developed to developing countries for loss and damages incurred due to climate change; and human rights violations in Egypt under the current authoritarian regime. According to the Paris Agreement[2], which was adopted in 2015, nations from around the world will work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (ghgs) to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), a commitment that was renewed at last year's COP 26 in Glasgow. The ghg reductions to achieve that goal are known as 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs), which are then tallied by the UN to ascertain the collective reduction. The climate accord stipulated that nations must provide details about how much they will reduce their ghgs and by when. Initially, nations were to put forward these NDCs by 2020 and then submit new NDCs every five years. But at last year's COP 26, it was proposed that the NDCs be submitted annually, both to keep nations on track with their commitments and to increase the pressure to ratchet up commitments more frequently, given that action must be taken by 2030 to avoid the irreversible impacts of climate change. As COP 27 kicked off, only 24 of almost 200 nations have submitted new or updated climate plans. Last month, the UN Environment Programme's 'Emissions Gap Report 2022[3]' showed that the current commitments to ghg reductions were insufficient, currently putting the world on a path of 2.8 C by the century's end. Related Article At the UN climate conferences, nations of the Global North and of the Global South often clash, since the former have historically benefited and continue to benefit from, among other things, the burning of fossil fuels, while nations from the Global South have already been disproportionately experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis, ranging from floods to heat waves to drought, though they have contributed the least to CO2 emissions. In 2009, Global North nations agreed to pay $200 billion per year by 2020 for mitigation technologies (to help reduce emissions) and adaptation programs (to address the impacts of climate change; for example, protecting existing and restoring mangroves and coral and oyster reefs, or managed retreat), but the Global North has failed on this commitment. A 100-page UN report, Finance for Climate Action[4], released on November 8, 2022, stated that $1 trillion per year is now needed by 2030 to help nations in the Global South address climate change. These moneys would come from a variety of sources, so this report is not demanding that sum from the UN alone. But it does point out that the issue of climate justice must address historical and present-day inequities. Meanwhile, the impacts of climate change have continued unabated, so nations in the Global South have been increasingly focused on demanding compensation to address those impacts, pointing out that they have already been suffering. At least year's COP 26, they pushed for a mechanism for compensation to be created. In what was a first, a draft of the agreement included language acknowledging 'loss and damages,' but this, to the outrage of nations from the Global South, was struck from the final agreement. And the opening of this year's UN climate conference was delayed in large part because of the insistence that loss and damages remains a topic. It is now on the agenda. Current Issue HYPERLINK https://www.thenation.com/issue/november-14-21-2022-issue/ https://www.thenation.com/issue/november-14-21-2022-issue/ Nations from the Global North are concerned about establishing a fund for loss and damages, since they would become legally liable for climate crisis damages, which the majority of the globe is already experiencing and which will only increase. The demand for compensation for loss and damages pushes the legacy of colonialism and resulting global economic inequalities to the forefront. Although no major agreement is expected t0 come out of this year's COP, the issue is sure to dominate the negotiations. At this year's COP 27 , attention is also focused on human rights violations of the authoritarian regime of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. In 2013, then-Gen. El-Sisi toppled Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, who came into office after the Arab Spring forced Hosni Mubarak to resign in 2011. El Sisi, who has been president since 2014, has banned protests and free speech. In 2019, a law came into effect restricting both. Organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have for years been calling out the crackdowns. To date, over 60,000 dissidents have been arrested and imprisoned. This explosion of arrests of dissidents has prompted a spree in the construction of prisons; one-third of Egypt's prisons have been built during El-Sisi's regime. Alaa Abd El Fattah, a pro-democracy British-Egyptian activist who has been in prison for nine years for speaking up about human rights violations and who has been on a hunger strike for over 200 days, which he escalated to drinking no water as COP 27 began. He is protesting his prison conditions and demanding his release as well as the release of other political prisoners. Fifteen Nobel Laureates have called for El Fattah to be freed. According to the Egyptian-based media organization Mada Masr[5], as of October, hundreds have been arrested in Egypt in their homes and workplaces and on the street. They are being held in pretrial detention, accused of 'spreading false news and joining a banned group.' Many global climate and human rights activists who have spoken up in support of El Fattah are from countries under authoritarian regimes. This shines the spotlight on the twinned repercussions of authoritarian regimes: They are often as detrimental to human rights as they are to the planet. As Putin invaded Ukraine and Biden imposed sanctions on Russia, leaders of authoritarian regimes such as Xi Jinping of China and Narendra Modri of India swooped in to buy gas and oil from Russia. (Neither Putin nor Xi Jinping plan to attend COP 27 .) COP 27 , both human rights and environmental justice will remain at the forefront.

The following information was released by the Library of Congress: The following is a guest post by Peter Roudik, the assistant law librarian for legal research at the Law Library of Congress and the director of the Law Library's Global Legal Research Directorate. Currently meeting in Egypt, the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 Our research identified 57 jurisdictions around the world with climate neutrality goals stated by national laws. These include the European Union (EU) and its 27 member states, where a June 2021 regulation sets 2050 as the target date for climate neutrality. Eleven EU member states have passed their own legislation in addition to the directly applicable regulation. Four jurisdictions have set an earlier target date of 2045. Germany and Scotland plan to achieve full climate neutrality by that date, while the laws of Gibraltar and Sweden provide for a significant reduction (85 to 100 percent) of carbon emissions from the 1990 baseline. Even a more ambitious goal is stated in the Climate Emergency Act of Maldives. This law of 2021 requires the country to have net zero emissions by 2030. The United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Russia enacted laws at the national and state levels introducing regional goals for reaching carbon neutrality. The report is part of the Legal Reports (Publications of the Law Library of Congress) collection which contains to date more than 3,000 reports, current and historical, authored by the Law Library of Congress specialists and analysts on a variety of legal topics. \</doc>

PR Newswire HonorHealth joins Biden Administration pledge to decarbonize health care sector, make facilities resilient to climate change. HonorHealth's leadership recognized by Administration officials at COP27 SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- HonorHealth, a leading Valley healthcare system serving 1.6 million people in the greater Phoenix and Scottsdale area, was celebrated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on November 10, 2022 for pledging ongoing action to decarbonize the health care sector and make health care facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. HonorHealth has formally committed to pursuing the Biden administration's climate goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To date, HonorHealth has invested in several sustainability initiatives, including engagement as an active member of Practice Greenhealth and serving as co-chair for the Southwest Healthcare Sustainability Collaborative comprised of other healthcare systems, universities and local governments. Supply Chain Operations implemented a medical equipment no waste project, centralized management of their 80-vehicle fleet and began a Styrofoam recycling project. Lastly, Food Services now offers meatless Monday entrees, sourcing produce locally and utilizing compostable food container products across all campuses. A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the number one threat to global public health. It exposes millions of people in the United States to harm every year with disproportionate impacts on communities that are often already the victims of longstanding discrimination through increases in extreme heat waves, wildfires, flooding, vector-borne diseases and other factors that worsen chronic health conditions. The healthcare sector also contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8.5 percent of U.S. domestic emissions. The HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge to help focus industry response to climate challenges. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities for both chronic and acute catastrophic climate impacts. One hundred two prominent health companies in the U.S. have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including organizations representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more. Federal systems like the Indian Health Service (IHS), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Military Health System (MHS) are working together to meet similar goals to those these private sector organizations have embraced. Combined, this means that over 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing over 15 percent of U.S. hospitals. "Our commitment to those we serve includes becoming more resilient and proactive to mitigate the health threats associated with climate change, especially in service of communities at disproportionate risk of climate-related harm," said Todd LaPorte, CEO at HonorHealth. "HHS returns this year to COP27 to report great progress," said ADM Rachel Levine, the Assistant Secretary for Health. "Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector."

Zero emissions for new cars and trucks could be realized in the near future under the terms of a provisional political agreement, members of the European Parliament said. The European Parliament late Thursday reached a preliminary agreement on CO2 emissions for new cars and vans, hoping to eventually eliminate fuel-powered vehicles completely by 2035. The provision is part of the EU's so-called Fit for 55 package that spells out how member states can cut their overall greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. An interim target for alternative vehicles was set for 2030, when new vehicles need to cut emissions in half relative to 2021 levels. Anna Hubackova, a European member of Parliament and the Czech minister of the environment, said the proposal sends a strong signal that the bloc is serious about transitioning to a cleaner future. "Zero-emission mobility will be a building block for slowing down climate change that can create severe disruptions in many sectors of our society, including environment, migration, food security and the economy," she said. The proposal follows a similar offer from Parliament that would mandate zero emissions from all new buildings owned by public entities by 2028 and all buildings in general by 2030. Meanwhile, a new report from the World Meteorological Organization finds that emissions of the three main greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- all set records last year. Atmospheric carbon dioxide reached 149% of the pre-industrial level in 2021, primarily due to emissions from fossil fuels and cement production. Methane emissions, meanwhile, were the highest since measurements began in the 1980s, while nitrous oxide levels were higher than the average annual growth rate over the past 10 years. Concerns like these, as well as the efforts to address them, will be on display next month when Egypt hosts the 27th United Nations Climate Change conference , dubbed COP27 \</doc>

4 November 2022 (Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia) The UN climate conference known as COP 27 will convene in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt on 6 November 2022. It is taking place at a junction of unprecedented global challenges. The world economy is in turmoil, facing multiple, mutually reinforcing crises. Even as the world is mounting a fragile recovery from the COVID\Â£c19 pandemic, high inflation, rising interest rates, falling currencies, and post-pandemic budget woes, together with a likely global economic slowdown, are increasing pressure on major economies. The Russian Federation-Ukraine conflict is fuelling a devastating energy, food, and cost-of-living crisis. All these are scaling back global efforts to mitigate climate change. COP27 has come against the backdrop of record-breaking floods, droughts, heat waves, and other extreme forms of weather that have forced several developing countries to face increasingly devastating fatalities and economic losses. Nine of the warmest years on record have come in the past decade alone. Climate change is a disruption multiplier that could have grave repercussions for densely populated Asia and ultimately lead to erasing the benefits of continued economic growth that happened during the past 3 decades. Bangladesh, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, are amongst the world's ten most climate-vulnerable countries, having suffered some of the most fatalities and highest economic losses For the first time since its assessment began more than 30 years ago, the UN Human Development Report has warned that human development measures have declined across most developing countries in Asia and Africa in the past 2 years. COP27 must take real action to stave off the worst effects of climate change. This means going beyond COP21's Paris Agreement (2015) on national commitments to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and COP26's Glasgow agreement (2021) to achieve a net zero economy by the middle of the century. The core issues behind the ongoing climate negotiations are making bold commitments and agreeing on higher targets to reduce GHG emissions by developing countries in times of economic uncertainty and extending massive financing that advanced economies have already committed in support of global climate actions. COP27 will be a success if substantial progress is made on both these issues. But current climate negotiations and agreed action plans are woefully inadequate for reaching a carbon-neutral planet by 2050, which would keep global warming below 2\'b0C as envisaged in the Paris agreement. Problematic actions are the heavy burning of fossil fuels by the top-five carbon emitters: China, the United States, India, the Russian Federation, and Japan, as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the European Union, taken together as economic blocs. One way would be for COP27 to name the countries or regional blocs that are most out of line with the Paris climate agreement and ask them to do more either individually or in cooperation with others. Rich countries have already shown that they can mobilise vast resources to tackle global emergencies. They did this in the midst of the 2008 global financial crisis, with an estimated $5 trillion dollar spent by the Group of Twenty (G20) countries on stimulus packages, and spectacularly so by Europe and the US in mobilising about $15 trillion as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response. However, when it comes to climate actions, advanced economies are failing dismally in raising the global goal of at least $100 billion annually in climate finance. COP27 should move forward in the vital area of international technology and financial cooperation to cut GHG emissions by major outliers. Singapore has announced that it will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, a powerful signal coming from a small country that accounts for only 0.1% of global carbon emissions. China, India, and Indonesia are taking the lead in upscaling their renewable energy share, although their portion of coal and gas in energy supply remains more than 70%. Energy, transport, and land use contribute about 80% of GHGs emissions in ASEAN. With massive investments flowing into emission intensive infrastructure, these countries could easily be locked in with high carbon growth for decades. Their action plan for decarbonisation-gradual but progressive at present-needs to see a massive shift and speed, with the necessary technology and financial innovations. Reaching a net zero economy by 2050 is the absolute minimum for all major emitters. A recent study by the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia tells us that the goal is feasible for ASEAN and East Asia. They can decouple economic growth from carbon dioxide emissions and generate new green jobs, but these require bold policy innovations such as carbon tax and market-based instruments such as emission trading systems (ETSs). China's ETS is the world's largest in terms of covered emissions, and prices are rising steadily. Despite several differences in pricing approaches, a call for a universal carbon tax should remain a key focus area for negotiated actions in Sharm el-Sheikh. At the top of the COP27 agenda is the need to act on climate change adaptation, which is an ever-increasing priority for developing countries. The negotiating parties should focus on scaling up adaptation solutions, mobilising appropriate technologies, and strengthening access to private financing for disaster resilience. Application of digital technologies and well-designed insurance schemes are getting recognised for enhancing climate and disaster resilience along global supply chains and most vulnerable communities. Whilst governments and industry carry the major responsibility for climate actions, consumers could play a large role in driving such activities. Mindful consumer actions such as saving energy at home, using public transport instead of driving, eating more plant-based foods and wasting less food; and customers and employees leveraging their position to demand public procurement choices. Many lifestyle goals can be achieved by deploying 'nudges', gentle persuasion techniques to encourage positive behaviour. Rather than framing climate change as a larger-than-life challenge, COP27 should recognise that small individual actions by consumers matter. It is the right time for COP27 to strive to build a global guiding framework, share information mechanisms, and create momentum to scale up community movements. Based on the mixed track records of past climate summits, and the fractured recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, consensus on the above actions may not be high at COP27 . A compromise might be reached by choosing specific commitments to be backed by major developing countries and emerging economies that want to see the co-benefits of climate actions: improved living standards for their citizens, cleaner air and water and cleaner cities, local job creation, and so on. If negotiations focus on this, which resonates with the climate justice agenda, COP27 will generate enormous momentum to get hesitant actors moving. \</doc>

The following information was released by the UK Government: To mark the forthcoming COP27 meeting, students took part in a debate ' COP27 : the Voice of Youth from Glasgow to Sharm El-Sheikh' in Astana. From: British Embassy Astana Published 28 October 2022 Student debates at KAZGUU University. In preparation of the forthcoming COP27 meeting that will take place from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, UN Resident Coordinator Office, British Embassy in Kazakhstan, Embassy of Italy in Kazakhstan and Embassy of Egypt in Kazakhstan in partnership with KazGUU University organised a student debate ' COP27 : the Voice of Youth from Glasgow to Sharm El-Sheikh'. The event was aimed to raise awareness about climate change, to put the topic on the public agenda, inspire and encourage youth to find climate solutions. The pre- COP27 debates united about 30 students of International Relations, Economics, and Law faculties from KazGUU University, forming 4 teams to discuss countries' collaboration, climate change mitigation, adaptation and sustainable finance. Addressing the students, UN Resident Coordinator in Kazakhstan Ms. Michaela Friberg-Storey noted: Today's event is a continuation of a good tradition. It's time to regain trust and work together constructively to build on Glasgow and deliver a package of concrete outcomes at COP-27 . UN Country Team collaborates with the Government of Kazakhstan in terms of updating NDC for further submission to the Conference of the Parties this year. It won't be easy, but scientists say that it is possible-and that each degree matters, each year matters, and each decision matters. In this regard youth is a strong force, which helps us to accelerate the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and make us more accountable. Ms. Kathy Leach, British Ambassador to Kazakhstan said: The Glasgow COP brought together close to 200 countries (including over 120 world leaders) and gave the world the tools needed to keep 1.5C alive. The Glasgow Climate Pact remains the blueprint for accelerating climate action in this critical decade. Yet the Pact is simply words on a page without action. This is a pivotal moment to redouble our efforts. Every country must revisit and strengthen their climate change targets. We must also support climate vulnerable countries by making sure commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured, driving real, practical action on the ground. None of this will be possible without mobilising climate finance. We continue to work with countries, international financial institutions and private financial institutions to meet the commitments they have made and help secure greater access to critical finance. Mr. Marco Alberti, Ambassador of Italy to Kazakhstan, said: COP26 messages were pretty clear: ensuring promises on emissions reductions; delivering for climate vulnerable countries by ensuring commitments on adaptation and loss and damage are honoured; getting finance flowing; working together and continuing to be an inclusive Presidency. This is the very core of the message we would like to deliver to our Egyptian friends. The strapline of COP27 , "Together for implementation" is made up of 2 key words: implementation, which is the common goal we must share to save the planet; and together, which indicates the path we must pace if we want to reach out to that goal. Next month, Egypt will be hosting COP27 with a view to building on previous successes and paving the way for future ambition. Ms. Manal Elsayed Yehia Elshinnawi, Ambassador of Egypt to Kazakhstan, said: Egypt's COP27 Presidency believes in the necessity to have inclusive, rules based, ambitious and substantive outcomes, up to the scale of the challenge and reflective to the political will, based on science and guided by principles, building on decisions and commitments from Rio 1992 to Glasgow 2021. Effective implementation requires meaningful and inclusive engagement with all stakeholders. This acquires particular significance in relation to youth, as we live in a world where 52% of its inhabitants are under 30 years old. Youth as well are leading at the frontline of creative and effective solutions that support their local communities and the broader global response to the climate crises. Thus, the incoming Egyptian Presidency is keen to make COP27 a hallmark for youth inclusive and meaningful engagement. Ainur Karbozova, Deputy Chairman of the Board of M. Narikbayev KAZGUU University, commented: Since Kazakhstan joined the UN back in 1992, our country is one of the most active members of the United Nations with all the important political initiatives being put forward from the UN headquarters. The United Nations is a solid supporter of all the reforms in Kazakhstan, but at the same time facilitates successful implementation of SDG Agenda by engaging students to tackle climate change issues as well. We are therefore very thankful of our students having such a unique chance of wearing hats of the global politicians and facing current challenges of humanity. The conference will provide an opportunity for multilateral collaboration between countries to phase out fossil fuels, accelerate the shift to renewables and implement energy efficiency measures to support demand reduction. \</doc>

(TNSsel) -- World Vision International issued the following news release on Nov. 20, 2022: At the close of the COP27 climate conference, World Vision has welcomed an agreement to set up a loss and damage fund, but urges leaders that vulnerable children cannot wait twelve months for progress on the critical climate issues driving hunger, conflict and poverty today. "We understand the challenge of getting nearly 200 governments to agree on anything," said Ekkehard Forberg, a climate and peace expert at World Vision speaking from Sharm El Sheik, "but the children of the world--who have made the least contribution to climate change but suffer the greatest impact--need action today. Children who have been forced from their homes by floods and children who have no food to eat because of drought do not have time to wait for procrastination and pontification." "We are pleased that an agreement was reached today to set up a loss and damage fund to help countries worst affected by the climate crisis. But children and young people cannot wait years for countries to start contributing and investing those funds. In humanitarian work around the world, World Vision is seeing the damage climate disasters are having every day and with increasing frequency and ferocity," said Mr. Forberg. While World Vision was pleased that, for the first time, there were official spaces and meetings dedicated for children and youth at a COP, the organisation believes that children are still not the focus of national and global climate plans. "Children are disproportionately affected by climate change and thus should be at the very centre of the national and global response," said Mr. Forberg. "Their voices need to be heard and their rights defended. COP27 was held in a desert resort, and next year it will be in one of the world's richest oil states. We would invite COP negotiators to come sit under the community tree with children and young people in rural Niger or in Kenya and see first-hand the impact of their decisions." These youth representatives would, among other topics, certainly recommend nature-based solutions to the climate crisis such as World Vision's Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration programme - a powerful way to regreen communities and capture carbon. Young people in those countries have seen the transformative power of this approach themselves. World Vision argues that if the international community adopted such solutions the world would be more likely to achieve the 1.5 degree goal. Tanzanian 15-year-old Shania - a participant in World Vision's Citizen Voice and Action programme - attended COP27 to speak out on the issue of climate change. Her attendance was facilitated by World Vision, the European Union and the African Union. Addressing the representatives of the COP 27 presidency she movingly said, "We are the least responsible for climate change, but we are the most affected by its impacts. This is not fair. Governments of all countries need to take bolder decisions and act quickly and decisively, and they need to do it NOW." Mr. Forberg said, "The world must listen to young people like Shania. We are running out of time, but we can, and we must, make changes now in order to protect the planet and ensure that all children can look forward to, rather than dread, their future on this planet."

Nov 02, 2022( Climate Home News: HYPERLINK http://www.climatechangenews.com http://www.climatechangenews.com The world's biggest emitters won't attend a leaders' summit kicking off the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt next week. More than 100 heads of states and governments are expected to attend the two-day summit, on the theme of 'implementation', in the Red Sea beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh 7-8 November. Amid soaring inflation and deepening geopolitical tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the high-level event is a moment for leaders to recommit to international climate cooperation. But a provisional list[1] of speakers, dated 31 October, shows that neither China's Xi Jinping nor India's Narendra Modi are expected to attend. US president Joe Biden won't make the leader segment because of an agenda clash with the US mid-term elections on 8 November. A handful of tight races[2] will determine whether the Democrats keep hold of the Senate. Cop27 'The absence of China and India doesn't help inject much-needed political momentum into the talks,' Tom Evans, of think tank E3G, told Climate Home News. Australia's Anthony Albanese is skipping the meeting. Defending his decision, he told reporters[5] he 'can't be in all places at once'. 'This Cop is one of implementation. It's not one of a new policy and program,' he said. Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau, who has the worst emissions record[6] in the G7, isn't on the list. Cat Abreu, a Canadian climate campaigner and founder of Destination Zero, told Climate Home there were no plans for Trudeau to attend the summit. Climate Home has contacted Trudeau's office for comment. According to the document published by the Egyptian host on Tuesday, Argentina, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey are not sending leaders. Indonesia will be represented at vice president level. Comment: Climate finance isn't reaching African communities - Cop27 must fix this injustice[7] Vladimir Putin, who has become the pariah of the international community, won't be going. Climate envoy Ruslan Edelgeriyev reportedly said[8] this was because no breakthrough decisions were expected from the climate talks this year. Jair Bolsonaro, who remains Brazil's president until Lula da Silva takes over on 1 January, is staying at home. Lula plans to show face although his travel dates have yet to be confirmed. Sources in his campaign team told Reuters[9] it would likely be during the second week of the talks. Instead, 'the geopolitical showdown' on climate action will take place during the G20 leaders' summit in Bali, on 15-16 November, in parallel with the second week of Cop27 , Evans said. Developing countries will be setting out their asks clearly during the first week of the talks. 'Leaders skipping Sharm can't duck the pressure for more action, and will need to come up with an ambitious response,' said Evans. There is no long-term prosperity without action on climate change. There is no energy security without investing in renewables. That is why I will attend @COP27P[10] next week: to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure and sustainable future.  Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) November 2, 2022[11] On Wednesday, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak announced[12] he would be in Egypt to 'deliver on Glasgow's legacy', after initially saying he wouldn't go. Boris Johnson, who was in power when the UK hosted last year's Cop26 summit, had already accepted an invite[13] from the organisers. There will be a strong showing from developing countries with at least 33 African leaders expected to take to the podium. Besides the usual series of national statements, Egypt is organising six high-level roundtables to move the dial on critical themes. On Monday afternoon, leaders have been invited to one of three parallel discussions on the 'just transition', food security and innovative finance for climate and development. Tuesday's topics are green hydrogen, water security and 'climate change and the sustainability of vulnerable communities'. Heads of UN agencies, multilateral development banks and civil society representatives will join national leaders for the roundtable events. Ina letter[14]to all participants, incoming Cop27 president Sameh Shoukry, said the roundtables have the aim 'of developing practical, impactful and ambitious solutions' on key issues. Shoukry said Egypt intends to restore what he called the 'grand bargain' that underpins the Paris Agreement: that developing countries get financial support from historic polluters to cut their emissions and cope with climate impacts.

Will the US ever do anything useful in fighting climate change? Biden appeared at COP27 the other day to commit the nation to better policies. I believe Biden takes this seriously and I respect him for that. But is it enough, especially given the instability of the United States and Republicans' bizarre pro-mass death policies around climate? [1] President Biden appeared before an overflowing United Nations convention on Friday to reclaim America's role as a leader on climate change and to stress a renewed U.S. commitment to stop the planet from catastrophic warming. At the summit, known as COP27 , he spoke of how he immediately returned the United States to the 2015 Paris climate agreement upon taking office after his predecessor, President Donald J. Trump, had withdrawn the country. 'I apologize that we ever pulled out of the agreement,' he told the gathering, which comprised diplomats, ministers and representatives of nearly 200 nations. Mr. Biden's speech came in the midpoint of the two-week summit that has focused not so much on cutting the pollution that is driving climate change, but on the question of what, if anything, industrialized countries owe to poor nations that are suffering climate disasters for which they are ill-prepared and did little to cause. That question has dominated the proceedings. And it's very hard to imagine a serious American commitment to payments to Pakistan and Bangladesh and Maldives to help them manage these problems. Even liberal Americans don't pay much attention to countries like this, while conservatives are outright opposed to foreign aid except as payoffs to right-wing governments. Biden of course made no suggestion of supporting such a thing either. During his remarks at COP27 , Mr. Biden made no mention of climate reparations. That disappointed some activists and diplomats, particularly those from developing nations, who view it as a matter of justice. 'It's fundamentally about who is most responsible,' said Fatima Denton, a Gambian scholar, longtime U.N. official and member of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group. 'There's a solidarity issue here that's only going to become bigger as the crisis grows. Support for that idea is needed now.' That is where the future is. And even a good solid liberal president like Joe Biden is nowhere close to even beginning to approach this. All that said, Biden is doing a good job committing the U.S. to promoting renewable energy and limiting methane. Too little, too late, but that's far from his fault. And if a Republican ever takes the presidency again in this country, their first move will be to release more methane to own the libs. Hard to be a global leader on climate with our internal issues.

(GlobeNewswire) - WellSpan Health was recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on Nov. 10, for pledging ongoing action to make health care facilities more sustainable and resilient to the effects of climate change. WellSpan Health has formally committed to reducing emissions by 50% by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and has already begun to take steps across the health system. The WellSpan Health team is excited to embark on this effort as part of our commitment to reimagine healthcare. Our sustainability strategy is just another way we are taking action to improve the health of our patients and team members, as well as all our friends and neighbors across South Central Pennsylvania, said Roxanna Gapstur, Ph.D., RN, president and CEO of WellSpan Health. Together, with other leading health systems across the country, our collective impact will be tremendous. The health system announced significant clinical and operational changes last month, including partnerships with local suppliers, greening of clinical operations, and increased water and energy conservation through efficiencies in business operations. A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the number-one threat to global public health. It exposes millions of people in the United States to harm every year with disproportionate impacts on communities that are often already more vulnerable through increases in extreme heat waves, wildfires, flooding, vector-borne diseases, and other factors that worsen chronic health conditions. The healthcare sector also contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8.5% of U.S. domestic emissions. The HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge to help focus industry response to climate challenges. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities for both chronic and acute catastrophic climate impacts. In the U.S., 102 prominent health companies have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including organizations representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more. Federal systems such as the Indian Health Service (IHS), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Military Health System (MHS) are working together to meet similar goals to those these private sector organizations have embraced. Combined, this means that over 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing over 15% of U.S. hospitals. HHS returns this year to COP27 to report great progress, said Rachel Levine, the Assistant Secretary for Health. Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector.

(TNSres) -- Swansea University issued the following news:    As world leaders gather in Egypt for the next COP27 summit, organised by the United Nations, four Swansea experts who conduct research on various aspects of the climate crisis are to feature in a showcase of Welsh collaborations with African universities.    The COP 27 The Low Carbon Energy and Environment Research Network, based at Bangor University in Wales, is gathering and promoting examples of collaboration between researchers based in Wales and Africa, to mark COP27 and also Wales Climate Week, which runs from 21 November.    Recyclable solar panels: Professor Matthew Davies and his team at Swansea University's SPECIFIC Innovation and Knowledge Centre have been working with researchers at the University of Kwazulu-Natal in South Africa to develop a solar energy testing centre. Their aim is develop solar panels which are not only highly efficient but also derived from materials that can be reused and fully recycled, reducing the need to mine and use new materials.    Professor Davies explains: Our research is geared towards creating a product with closed-loop recycling so that we can decouple primary materials from the economy. Using these secondary materials we can grow the economy without also growing Co2    Tree rings, climate evidence and drought: Tree rings can tell us about the climate of the past, providing crucial evidence about long-term trends. Dr Iain Robertson of Swansea University's geography department with colleagues from Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia led an international team which identified a sample of juniper trees in Ethiopia that provided high quality climate records in their rings. Taking cores from these trees allowed the team to see patterns of climate activity stretching back 300 years, providing firm evidence that less water was coming into the country from the Congo Basin, with increasing risk of drought.    Dr Robertson said: "Until now, the best longer term climate records we had for Ethiopia were archives on the flow of the River Nile which originates here. By comparing these records, we now have a better understanding of what to expect as the Indian Ocean continues to heat up."    African wild dogs under threat: Animals around the world are being affected by changes linked to the climate crisis, including African wild dogs, one of the top predators in central and southern Africa. Professor Luca Borger and members of the Swansea Laboratory for Animal Movement of the Biosciences Department at Swansea University have been studying their behaviour, with colleagues from the University of Pretoria in South Africa and the Zoological Society of London. They have fitted tags on wild dogs to track their movements, behaviours, temperatures and energy expenditure. The data will help understand if and how wild dogs are adapting to rising temperatures through behavioural changes, for example by hunting different prey or using more shaded habitats.    Professor Borger said: African wild dogs are already one of the world's most endangered mammals and their population dynamics are further affected by higher temperatures. By understanding their detailed behavioural and physiological responses we aim to help devise improved conservation initiatives.    Connecting Communities in Liberia: Dr Krijn Peters of the School of Social Sciences at Swansea University along with colleagues in Liberia, including LIDA-Research, has looked into a novel solution to improve access to rural communities. With greater rainfall during the wet season predicted due to climate change in Liberia, there is an increased risk that access routes will be cut off, limiting access to local markets, educational and health facilities.    Dr Peters said: As climate changes, Liberia is expecting a wetter rainy season. Promoting reinforced routes and bridges will help keep access open throughout the year, whilst also attempting to prevent deforestation of primary forests.

Nov 09, 2022( Accountancy Age: HYPERLINK http://www.accountancyage.com http://www.accountancyage.com This November, the 27th UN conference on climate change ( COP27 As part of our own mitigation measures, the UK Government is already legally committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. In terms of what this might mean in practice, in October 2021, the government published a policy paper Net Zero Strategy: Build Back Green[1]. This contains a number of objectives to transition all aspects of our economy to lower carbon alternatives. It is impossible to reduce emissions to zero - the target is net zero not absolute zero. This means that we also need ways of removing or 'cancelling out' unavoidable emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (often referred to just as 'carbon'). Called carbon capture or sequestration, there are both engineered and natural solutions to remove carbon from the atmosphere. In this article, we will look at the latter. Natural solutions for carbon capture include growing trees, which store carbon in their wood, and restoring peatbogs. A degraded and drying peatbog will emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, a happy, squidgy one will capture carbon in layers of dead plant material. Landowners willing to plant trees or restore peatland are able to gain an income from selling their ability to store carbon in the form of carbon credits. The Woodland Carbon Code and Peatland Carbon Code provide a mechanism for carbon emitters to purchase units to offset their unavoidable emissions. A Woodland Carbon Unit (WCU) represents one tonne of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere, while a Peatland Carbon Unit (PCU) represents the prevention of one tonne of emissions from a peat bog. As it takes time for trees to grow, or for the effects of restoration to reverse peatland emissions, landowners can instead opt to sell Pending Issuance Units (PIUs) to get cash flow earlier in the project. As long as the project is successful, these will mature into WCU/PCUs which the new owner can use to offset their emissions. All PIUs and WCU/PCUs are listed on a central UK registry, and once a WCU/PCU has been offset it must be retired to prevent double counting. Crucially, PIUs/WCUs/PCUs are not automatically attributed to any tree planting or peatland restoration project. Each project must be verified in order for any PIUs that the project is expected to deliver to be listed on the registry. A key requirement is that the landowner must be able to demonstrate that the project would not have been financially viable without the income from a carbon credits scheme. The tax perspective From the tax perspective, there are various elements to consider - from the potential for tax on sales of WCU/PCUs or PIUs, to the longer term implications for CGT and IHT depending on how the land value is affected. Understanding what these units are, and the nature of the agreements between landowner and end user, is key to establishing the tax position. These are potentially long term obligations, as the total amount of carbon (and thus PIUs) that might be attributed to a woodland could represent up to 100 years' growth. In some ways, the units are an intangible asset, but the landowner could also be argued to be providing some kind of service in removing carbon from the atmosphere. Many of those growing trees are keen for any income from PIU/WCU sales to fall within the commercial woodlands exemption (which says that the commercial occupation of woodlands is outside of the scope of income and corporation tax), while we have also seen commentary taking the view that a sale of all the PIUs from a project upfront should be considered a capital disposal. The position remains unclear and such uncertainty is mutually unhelpful for landowners, unit purchasers and the development of the schemes. At the present time there is little to no HMRC guidance on the taxation of credits and the ATT has helped to set up and facilitate a group of interested parties to look at these issues including foresters, land agents, tax specialists, lawyers and accountants. It is likely that the number of carbon credit schemes will only increase as we seek to find more ways to capture carbon to meet challenging net zero targets. Carbon sequestration is not limited to woodland or peatland. Soils, hedgerows and marine plants like seagrass also have the ability to capture carbon. There is also the potential for the development of similar offset schemes where credits could be bought to offset an environmental harm, such as a loss of biodiversity or a polluting nutrient outflow which is unavoidable. Resources & Whitepapers For example, a building project may increase the flow of nutrients to a local water course, damaging the ecology of a local stream. If it is not possible to offset or prevent the damage on site, the person doing the damage could be required to buy nutrient credits which would generate funds to prevent, remove or reduce nutrient outflows which also affect that water course. The whole area of carbon capture is complex and growing but to date much of the focus has, naturally, been on increasing scientific research and understanding and developing projects. However, as more individuals, businesses and landowners get involved, we will also need to ensure that there is clarity and certainty on the tax treatment of these new schemes to make sure that tax concerns don't get in the way of necessary environmental changes.

Reports from the ground and research on previous armed conflicts suggest that the ecological impact of the conflict could be enormous. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Tuesday warned that the  insane and  illegal war provoked by Russia was distracting international attention from the threat of climate change and contributing to the  catastrophic effects of global warming.  The world needs honesty, we must tell those who do not take the climate agenda seriously, that they are making a catastrophic mistake, he said in a video address to COP27 , the United Nations climate change conference taking place in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. He said that the conflict in Ukraine had forced countries to deal with the threat of Russian aggression rather than focus the necessary attention on the common goal of fighting climate change. There  can be no effective climate policy without the peace, on the Earth, he said. Russia, he added, must  shut the guns and hide its missiles. President Andrzej Duda of Poland also stressed the negative effect of the war in worsening climate change, noting that the conflict was a threat to the planet.  The consequence of Russia\' s aggression are crisis and huge costs which put at risk timely implementation of climate transition as well as timely attainment of the intended goals, Reuters quoted him as saying. Since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February, the world\' s attention has been focused on the human cost of the war, but experts say that HYPERLINK Ukraine\' s ecosystems and species are also vulnerable . The country is home to vibrant wetlands and forests and a large swath of virgin steppe. Russian troops have entered and sometimes conducted military operations in some of the country\' s protected natural areas. For instance, the war has contributed to the sudden and mysterious deaths of thousands of Black Sea HYPERLINK https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/world/europe/dolphins-dying-ukraine-war.html dolphins , some burned from bomb or mine explosions. However, the war may offer one unintended assist in the effort to combat climate change.

White and Case, a law firm, issued the following news release: Global law firm White & Case LLP has provided pro bono advice to the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility (LSF) on its inaugural US$100 million repo transaction, which was announced at COP27 and aims to bring liquidity to a diversified basket of African sovereign Eurobonds. "For the LSF, an innovative and scalable legal program has been established," said White & Case partner Ingrid York, who led the Firm's team advising the LSF on the deal. "The platform will help African sovereigns access international markets efficiently and for the long term. Our team included more than 40 lawyers based in nine of our global offices who provided advice on a variety of aspects including structured finance, financial services regulatory, tax, corporate, employment, technology, intellectual property and data." The LSF, designed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UN ECA) with support from African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), announced the transaction at COP 27 . The innovative deal, with funding support from Afreximbank, seeks to bring the benefits of a well-developed repo market to the African continent, with the goal of enhancing the liquidity of a diversified basket of sovereign Eurobonds including The Arab Republic of Egypt, Kenya and Angola as issuers. It relies on an innovative triparty platform designed for the LSF by BNY Mellon. The LSF is now in the process of signing-in clients to the platform, including potentially two of the largest American and European fixed income private investors. This first transaction marks the full operationalization of the LSF's business model, enabling it to start fulfilling its two objectives of supporting the liquidity of African sovereign Eurobonds, and incentivizing SDG-related investments such as SDG and green bonds on the African continent. The White & Case team which advised on the transaction included partners Ingrid York, Jonathan Rogers, Will Smith, Robert Nield, James Hardy, Anthony Colegrave, Nicholas Greenacre, Tim Hickman, Tom Falkus, Helen Joseph, Edward Attenborough (all London), Mara Topping (Washington, DC), Alexandra Ippolito (Paris), Debashis Dey (Dubai & London), Steven Gee (New York), Valerie Menard (Paris) and Philip Trillmich (London & Frankfurt), counsel Nate Crowley (Hong Kong) and Willem Van de Wiele (Brussels & Luxembourg), and associates Phillan Amin, Ben Cheng, Sylvia Julius, Prema Govind, Ece Kuregibuyuk, Daniella van Wyk, Yannis Lagdani, Kristen DiLemmo, Mark Smith, Thomas Harper, Shehnai Arora, Alec Buchanan, Victor Pierre, Harriet Baldwin (all London), Alexander Reid, Michael Iloegbunam (both New York), Allaa Mageid, Da Young Kim (both Washington, DC), Thibault Faivre-Pierret and Anais Caspar (both Paris).

South Africa has released the terms of two climate loans totalling \â¬ 600mn (about $612mn)\~to support the country's transition away from coal and towards cleaner energy sources, extended by French and German public development banks. The financing agreements were announced at a ceremony held at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. The funds will go directly to the South African government via its National Treasury. The Treasury described the loans from France's AFD and Germany's KfW as "highly concessional," saying they were substantially cheaper than market borrowing, Reuters reported. AFD's \â¬ 300mn loan is for 20 years and has a five-year grace period. The interest rate is 3.6%, or six-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) plus 129 basis points (bps), the Treasury said in a statement on November 10. KfW's \â¬ 300mn loan is also for 20 years and, with a five-year grace period and at 3% interest, or six-month Euribor plus 69 bps. According to the Treasury's statement, the estimated cost for the government of South Africa to raise an equivalent loan today in the market would be around 8.9%. Therefore, replacing market lending with much cheaper concessional loans, allows South Africa to reduce its cost of funding and overall debt burden. "By lowering debt service costs, the government of South Africa creates more fiscal space for critical social and other priorities," the Treasury said. Under President Cyril Ramaphosa, Africa's most industrialised nation has been trying to nurse its public finances back to health after a decade of steep debt accumulation, writes Reuters. South Africa's mid-term budget, presented by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana in October, showed an improved fiscal outlook, with deficits shrinking quicker than before and debt stabilising at a lower level. \</doc>

(TNSjou) -- Queen Mary University of London issued the following news: Ahead of COP27 , researchers are calling for the "massive" carbon footprint of the world's armed forces to be measured and managed, in an article published today by prestigious journal Nature. The new publication highlights that UK and US armed forces emit as much carbon dioxide per person as many carbon-intensive countries, and the American military alone (the world's largest in terms of expenditure) emits more greenhouse gases than many entire countries - including Peru, Singapore and Switzerland. If it were a nation, the US military would have the highest per-capita emissions in the world (at 42 metric tonnes of CO2 per staff member). Researchers also warn that a current lack of accurate ways to calculate emissions from military activities means these figures may be even higher, as estimates can increase dramatically when factoring in other energy supplies, raw materials, supply chains and equipment manufacturing - not to mention the carbon emissions from warfare itself. The military sector's share of global greenhouse-gas emissions is estimated to be around five per cent - comparable to emissions from the aviation and shipping industries. However, militaries have been left out of international agreements to declare emissions since the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, on the basis of preserving national security. A lack of published data makes it hard to estimate totals, and only a handful of forces (including those of the UK and US) have published strategy documents on climate action. One of the article's authors is Dr Benjamin Neimark, Senior Lecturer and Fellow at Queen Mary University of London, who's currently leading the Concrete Impacts research project to map the environmental footprint of the US military in Iraq. Dr Neimark commented: "We need robust independent research to properly calculate military carbon emissions, so we can fully understand how armed conflicts affect the climate and start developing low-carbon recovery pathways. "It's particularly apt, with the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 Seven academics give expert insight in the article: Dr Benjamin Neimark (Queen Mary University of London), Doug Weir (King's College London), Stuart Parkinson (Scientists for Global Responsibility), Kirsti Ashworth and Reuben Larbi (Lancaster University) and Mohammad Ali Rajaeifar and Oliver Heidrich (Newcastle University).

The following information was released by the office of Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree: Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) today celebrated the Governor Mills Administration's progress over the last two years to implement Maine's Climate Action Plan known as "Maine Won't Wait" and released the following statement: "Today we mark the half-way point of Maine's four-year Climate Action Plan. Maine's tremendous progress is truly something to celebrate, and I commend Governor Mills and her team for their hard work and leadership in our collective fight against climate change," said Pingree. "Whether through investments to improve climate resilience, weatherize and update infrastructure, or embrace clean energy, historic legislation like the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and Inflation Reduction Act are supporting this bold action plan. Coupled with climate investments in Maine communities such as those the Governor announced today, we have never been closer to achieving our climate goals. I'm honored to help put Maine further down that path, and I look forward to continuing this fight with the people of Maine." Pingree is Chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. She has championed a bold agenda to combat the climate crisis, including introducing legislation to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in U.S. agriculture by 2040 and is a cosponsor of over 40 bills in the 117th Congress to combat the climate crisis, including the visionary Green New Deal. Included in the Fiscal Year 2022 Appropriations Bill, Pingree secured $990,000 for the University of Maine's Climate Science Information Exchange, which will serve as the coordination hub called for in the state's Climate Action Plan and will support implementation of key strategies outlined in the plan. Pingree recently attended the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , also known as the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), in Egypt to convey the commitment of the United States Congress to continuing the robust progress made to tackle the climate crisis under the leadership of President Biden. She proudly supported and helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant climate investment in U.S. history, as well as the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. \</doc>

The following information was released by the University of Oxford: Commenting today, leading Oxford climate experts talk about the COP27 closing agreement, which creates a loss and damage fund, to support poorer nations struggling with the impacts of climate change, and restates the aims of limiting temperature rises to 1.5. Professor Lavanya Rajamani, professor of international environmental law and a country adviser during COP27 , said, 'The establishment of the Loss and Damage fund is a milestone in the UN climate regime that has struggled effectively to address this over for the last three decades. But a careful reading of, and between, the lines of the text makes it clear this is not a 'climate justice' mechanism that will result in rich countries compensating vulnerable countries for the loss and damage they are increasingly suffering as a result of a problem they did not create and can play little part in resolving. 'It is a mechanism that recognises their need for support but does not generate an obligation on developed countries to provide such support. Instead, it opens up conversations on 'innovative' sources of financing, expanding the donor base and determining who is 'most vulnerable' and, therefore, deserving of support. 'There has been much focus on the 1.5C goal, and whether it was or was not kept alive at COP-27 . While the 1.5C goal is clearly crucial, the exclusive focus on national target-setting is problematic. Most of the targets on which the modelling is based are just targets (not achieved or even achievable emissions reductions), and they are based on assumptions and conditions. 'Many are conditional on support, which has not materialised. Heightened pressure on target-setting will likely result in sketchier and sketchier assumptions, and less and less credible targets. The UN climate regime and the wider international financial system also need to focus on delivering the support necessary to implement the existing targets, and to enable new targets to be credible and deliverable. One without the other is a house built on sand.' Dr Philipp Trotter, Economics and Policy Co-Lead, Climate Compatible Growth programme, said, 'The outcome of COP27 is an unsettling paradox: On the one hand, developed countries have, for the first time, agreed to establish a fund to pay for (at least some of) the climate impacts they have caused. This is an important win for climate-vulnerable countries and campaigners. 'On the other, however, countries have made no meaningful progress whatsoever on limiting the climate impacts themselves going forward, despite being tilted as the "implementation COP". This inaction is incompatible with reaching the 1.5-degree target. 'Eventually, the hope is, loss and damage payments motivate stronger climate action because they could act as a significant monetary penalty for countries that do not do so.' Brian O'Callaghan, Lead Researcher and Project Manager, Oxford Economic Recovery Project, said: ' COP27 might be remembered as the "Loss and Damage COP". In my mind, having attended many of the LandD negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh, the most important takeaways are: This is the result of 30 years of tireless petition by developing countries and their supporters. It is not an overnight success story. Success came because developing countries stuck together: it is a great sign of hope for the world. We are all in this together. There remains much to be done on LandD. While there is now a fund, it has no money, nor any indication of where its money will come from. There are concerns rich countries might simply repurpose existing disaster relief as "loss and damage". That's why developing countries say this fund needs to be "new and additional" 'It is important to reaffirm, so far as mitigation is concerned, COP27 was a lame duck. The fossil fuel lobby very clearly influenced language to ensure that there was no progress from Glasgow on phasing out fossil fuels. Attempts for stronger language on fossil fuels (e.g., from India) were effectively vetoed by a set of rich countries, including the petro-states and the US. 'On finance, there remains significant work to be done. Since 1992, rich countries have failed to provide promised finance to transition the global economy to an emissions-sustainable pathway. Since 2020, failures have been measured against a promise of $100bn per year rich countries, and mainly the US, remain well short of keeping that promise. It is frankly embarrassing.' \</doc>

Nov 24, 2022( Moonbattery: HYPERLINK http://www.moonbattery.com http://www.moonbattery.com So long as Democrats remain in power, taxation and inflation will remain high, because the globalist looting spree will continue  as the blasphemous[1] and hypocritical[2] meeting of the Liberal World Order's climate cult[3] at COP27 reminds us[4]: While you might have spent the weekend marveling at the cost of a turkey, Joe Biden celebrated his 80th birthday by signing the U.S. up to a plan that could eventually commit Americans to transferring trillions of dollars to the rest of the world in perpetuity. Our moonbat rulers have determined that in the name of their religion, we owe climate reparations to the dictators of less successful countries, as punishment for theoretically causing inclement weather. Despite the alleged havoc Western industrialization has supposedly inflicted on parts of the world that feature more politically correct skin tones, weather-related deaths are Â£bout 80 times less frequent today than they were a century ago.' This is largely due to infrastructure and mitigation made possible by the very industrialization that Democrats want to punish us for. Climate reparations are not really about CO2 emissions. Here's how we know: China and India, as 'developing countries,' haven't agreed to contribute to the fund but have made only vague commitments to assist. So countries whose emissions have grown rapidly in the past decade will be exempt while the U.S., whose emissions have been declining, are on the hook. China emits more than twice as much CO2[5] as the USA, and with the Democrats tanking the economy, India is likely to pass us. The liberal elite's hostility is against European/American civilization, not plant-nourishing carbon dioxide. [T]he idea that the least developed countries in the world have received only the cost of industrialization and not the many benefits is ahistorical. If we in the West are to pay damages for the Industrial Revolution, shouldn't we also consider the extraordinary wealth that process has helped spread around the world? The answer is no, because liberals want to punish our virtues, just as they reward our vices through woke imperialism[6]. So, for having the genius to produce the ideas, create the economic system and develop the capital that has in a little more than a century given the world unimaginable prosperity, eliminated deadly diseases that once killed millions, reduced infant mortality, extended life expectancy and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of hunger and poverty, we must now be made to pay. The Biden Regime also took COP27 as an opportunity to announce an absurd Climate Gender Equity Fund[7] into which it will pour our money. Putting Democrats in charge of the government is equivalent to letting a Black Lives Matter mob manage a Target. On tips from Varla, Blackjack, and KirklesWorth.

PR Newswire Today, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation echoedAfrican leaders' callsfor countries to rapidly scale-up finance for climate adaptation and pledged to invest $1.4 billion to help smallholder farmers address the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. The announcement was made by Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 ). For many regions, climate change is a food and economic crisis without precedent. More than 2 billion people depend on smallholder farms for food and income, yet less than 2% of global climate finance is devoted to helping these farms adapt to climate change. Food and economic crises will last longer and become more severe as climate threats escalate and further threaten food security by limiting smallholder farmers' yields and resilience. "The effects of climate change have already been devastating, and every moment the world delays action, more people suffer, and the solutions become more complex and costly," said Suzman. "Our commitment will help smallholder farmers adapt today and build resilience for the future. It is essential for this climate summit to produce bold commitments that address immediate and long-term needs. Leaders must listen to the voices of African farmers and governments to understand their priorities and respond with urgency." The foundation's commitment will fund immediate action and long-term initiatives over four years to help smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia build resilience and food security. Funding will focus on spurring African-led innovation to build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects, new applications of digital technologies, climate-smart innovations for smallholder livestock farming, and support for women smallholder farmers to capitalize on their untapped potential. "Women in rural Africa are the backbone of their food systems, but they have never had equal access to the resources they need to reach their full potential or build resilience to looming climate threats," said Melinda French Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "As the climate crisis accelerates, women's vital role in their economies is too important to overlook. With the right financing and marketing support, women smallholder farmers could earn more in a day than they currently earn in a month, ultimately transforming these regional food systems and unlocking a healthier, more sustainable, and more prosperous future for families and communities across the continent." To improve the livelihoods of rural women in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the foundation is deepening its ongoing partnership with the\~International Fund for Agricultural Development\~(IFAD). The goal is to scale up initiatives that empower women farmers, support innovations at the nexus of gender and climate adaptation, and increase climate finance that gives rural women better access to the climate-smart resources they need to strengthen food systems.\~ To accelerate the development of new adaptation innovations, the foundation is continuing to work with a coalition of partners to double the budget for the CGIAR agriculture research system. The CGIARExcellence in Agronomy\~initiative partners with African research institutes, local businesses, and farmer organizations. Together, they are using big data, analytics, and digital platforms to deliver insights that can boost incomes, food security, and ecosystem health in smallholder farming communities.\~ "The climate crisis is causing enormous harm every day as it jeopardizes entire regions of people and economies," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "More funding is necessary to ensure agricultural and technological innovations are widely available to vulnerable communities, helping them to adapt to climate change, save lives and increase economic growth." Additional investments included in the commitment announced today will support: The Africa Adaptation Initiative (AAI) to quickly build a pipeline of climate-smart agriculture projects across 23 countries in Africa. Funding will provide targeted support for the technical capacity, planning, and project development required to implement programs.The development of new applications of digital technologies to ensure smallholder farmers can anticipate and respond to climate threats. This includes an innovative weather intelligence platform developed through a new partnership between the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO) and TomorrowNow, which provides climate-smart agriculture strategies to farmers in East Africa via text messages.African-led innovations to develop climate-smart options for improving livestock health and productivity while also reducing their climate footprint. This will be done in partnership with Canada's International Development Research Center (IDRC). This funding builds on more than a decade of investments and thefoundation'srecent announcement during the United Nations General Assembly of $100 million in funding to help alleviate the current food crisis in Africa and South Asia and address its underlying causes. It also builds on funding commitments focused on agriculture adaptation made at previous climate summits: 2021 at COP26: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Pledges $315 million to Support Innovations That Help Smallholder Farmers Adapt to Climate Threats2017 at One Planet Summit: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Commits $300M (\â¬ 255M) to Help Farmers in Africa and Asia Cope with Climate Change About the Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationGuided by the belief that every life has equal value, the\~Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\~works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives.

Paid Advertisement A delegation of Tufts students and faculty attended the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from Nov. 6 to Nov. 20. The 27th Conference of the Parties, or COP27 , is an annual opportunity for world leaders, activists and professionals across the climate field to share their work with an international audience and negotiate on foreign policies that mitigate the impacts of global warming.\~ The Fletcher School student Emily Dahl, who is studying to receive a master's degree in Global Affairs, attended COP27 to focus on nature-based solutions to climate change. She emphasized the significance of the conference. "The sheer volume of activity underway at COP27 is pretty astounding," Dahl said. "The idea that ... multiple organizations are sharing the initiatives that they've been undertaking ... and that people from around the world are interested in hearing about these experiences and learning from them and ... forging new connections ... [is] one of the really powerful things about the COP." Each year, Tufts allows a select group of community members to directly witness these historic negotiations and, in some cases, even present their own research. From master's students at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy to professors at the School of Engineering, representatives in this year's delegation came from a wide range of backgrounds, united by their shared interest in combating climate change.\~ Paid Advertisement Deborah Sunter, an assistant professor at the School of Engineering and a member of The Fletcher School's Climate Policy Lab, discussed the significance of the opportunity to attend the conference.\~ "[Attending the COP] is an opportunity for people in different parts of the university ... because it really is an experience for anyone who's passionate about climate change," Sunter said.\~ Sunter, along with her PhD student Emily Holt and Fletcher graduate student Abay Yimere, attended COP27 "What I was hoping to get out of this presentation at the COP is basically sharing the ... model with a broad international community so that many people would be able to use it," Sunter said. "I had given a very similar presentation during the Climate Policy Lab's Summer Academy... and it was through that presentation at the Summer Academy that the Ethiopia collaboration started. So the hope was that the presentation that would be given at the COP would then incite other similar collaborations." After presenting their work on Nov. 14, Sunter, Yimere and Holt devoted the rest of their time at the conference to attending other presentations, meeting with potential collaborators and learning about different climate initiatives being conducted across the globe.\~ "The few presentations I've seen so far have left me invigorated and hopeful for what's being done," Holt said. "[It's] just incredible to see these other presentations that were so outside my experience and really inspiring to see other efforts that I had no knowledge about be so successful." However, Rachel Kyte, dean of The Fletcher School and a leading expert on climate change, has attended over a dozen COPs and felt that the pace of progress at COP27 was far too slow.\~ "In [the] side events ... there was real, substantial, concrete, sleeves-rolled-up ... progress in terms of ways of thinking about transformation, the kinds of deals that have got to be done, the kinds of financial innovation that is needed, the kinds of support for different countries that is needed," Kyte reflected. "But when you went into the negotiating room, it was deadlocked." Despite the shortcomings of COP27 , Kyte recognized that some progress has been made, particularly towards investing more money into renewable energy and considering how the developed world can begin to address its climate impacts by compensating low-income countries. As the urgency of the climate crisis continues to heighten, Kyte hopes that encouraging discussions on climate is something that is enmeshed in the education of every Tufts student.\~ "Climate is something that every graduate of Tufts University should know, whether they are a philosopher or a physicist, whether they are an English literature major or a veterinarian," Kyte said. "You are faced with living in a world shaped by climate change. If we are going to put you out into the world as good citizens, which is what we stand for here at Tufts, then that becomes important. ... For me, climate is everything, and everything is climate."

Oct 28, 2022( Conservative Daily News: HYPERLINK http://conservativedailynews.com President Joe Biden's climate envoy John Kerry considering leaving the Biden administration as he wants to avoid defending his green agenda in front of a Republican-controlled House or Senate and is also seeking a return to the private sector to make more money, according to Axios. Kerry, who did not have to be confirmed by the Senate, is not eager to remain in the administration as a Republican Congress could call on him to answer questions about his climate negotiations with China as well as his family's private jet, Axiosreported[1]. The president's special envoy also wants to increase his alreadysubstantial[2]net worth and is preparing to vacate his role following the November United Nations Climate Change Conference which will take place in Egypt. 'I can't stress enough: Secretary Kerry has no plans to depart, and his sole focus is COP27 , period, and anything else is baseless speculation,' a Kerry spokesperson told Axios. Bidenappointed[3]Kerry as the U.S. climate envoy in November 2021 to help push the administration's ambitious 'net-zero[4]' emissions targets abroad. Kerry has continuously called for nations and corporations to invest in green energy, take action to cut carbon emissions and avoid expanding the use of fossil fuels. Kerry has indicated to his colleagues that he feels that he has done all he can to push environmentalism both domestically and internationally, according to Axios. Congress nowrequires[5]all presidential envoys to be confirmed by the Senate, meaning that Kerry's potential replacement could face difficulties getting confirmed should Republicans take control of the Senate in the November midterm elections.

The following information was released by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees: UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi is urging global leaders to curb the most devastating humanitarian consequences of the climate crisis and avert a catastrophic future for millions of displaced people. " COP27 Climate shocks are combining with conflict, acute food insecurity, rising prices, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to impact people across the globe, but those least responsible for the climate crisis and least able to adapt to its shocks are being hit hardest. This year's UN Climate Conference takes place against a backdrop of climate catastrophes from historic floods in Pakistan to the worst drought in decades across the Horn of Africa. Inside Somalia, nearly one million people have been displaced by drought and the threat of famine. Devastating cyclones in Mozambique have affected tens of thousands of people previously displaced by violence, while South Sudan and Sudan are battling record floods for a fourth consecutive year. More than 3.4 million displaced people and their hosts are facing the consequences of recent destructive flooding in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and the Central Sahel countries of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali a region already experiencing one of the world's worst displacement crises. In Cameroon's Far North, intercommunal violence has erupted between herders, fishers and farmers over dwindling water resources as Lake Chad and its tributaries have dried up from drought. Over 100 people were killed or injured late last year, and tens of thousands fled their homes. Meanwhile, drought in Central America's "Dry Corridor" has forced farmers to flee to nearby cities where they are vulnerable to violence from street gangs. And in other parts of the region such as Honduras, climate change is one more factor sparking displacement as hurricanes become ever more powerful and frequent. Over 70 per cent of the world's refugees and displaced people come from the most climate-vulnerable countries including Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Syria, and Yemen. They have an enormous stake in discussions about the climate crisis, but they are too often excluded. Only bold action and a massive boost in financing for climate mitigation and adaptation can alleviate the current and future humanitarian consequences of the climate crisis on displaced populations and host communities. Investments must be collaborative, inclusive and seek solutions for the most vulnerable. World leaders must look to transformational, lasting, and integrated action that involves local communities, governments, and partners already battling climate extremes. In some contexts, adaptation will not be enough and additional financing will be needed for inevitable "loss and damage", a stark example of which is being forced from home. The concerns and solutions for displaced people must be given a place not only in discussions like at COP 27 , but also must receive much more support in the climate "hotspots". Note to Editors: UNHCR will be represented at COP27 by Andrew Harper, UNHCR's Special Advisor on Climate Action, and UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Emtithal (Emi) Mahmoud, a world champion slam poet, and former Sudanese refugee whose family continue to be deeply affected by the climate crisis. Both will be at COP27 to explain how the climate crisis is driving displacement and making life harder for refugees and people already uprooted from home. They will also be reminding global leaders that climate action is needed now, not least because those least responsible for global warming are being hit hardest.

(TNStalk) -- The United Nations issued the following remarks on Sept. 5, 2022, by Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed: Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed's remarks to the Africa Adaptation Summit's High-Level Dialogue for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), in Rotterdam, Netherlands, today. I would like to start by warmly thanking the hosts of today's conference, the Heads of State and Government and institutional leaders present. I must say this while regretting the absence of leaders of the G7 and the European Union at today's important meeting towards the twenty-seventh United Nations climate change conference . Now is the time for solidarity and keeping the promise to humankind while protecting our planet. Let me also express my solidarity with people of Pakistan facing the worst floods in the nation's recorded history. Over 1,100 lives lost. Over 6 million people needing immediate support. Over 33 million people in total affected. Nearly 1 million homes, 3,000 kilometres of roads, 2 million acres of crops destroyed. It is clear that millions who are suffering contributed very little to the causes of this climate crisis. Meanwhile, searing heatwaves, violent floods and brutal droughts continue to wreak havoc in the Horn of Africa, Pakistan, Spain and many other regions. Therefore, the twenty-seventh United Nations climate change conference comes at a particularly challenging time. Impacts from the war in Ukraine, exacerbating rising food and energy prices and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are affecting lives and livelihoods around the world, and eroding international ability to confront the climate crisis. We simply cannot afford to abandon the climate emergency. The science is clear. As is the Paris Agreement [on climate change] and the commitments made to people and planet. Yet, global emissions continue to rise. If you are living in Africa, Central or South America, South Asia or in a small island nation, you are 15 times more likely to die from a climate disaster. Africa stands on the front lines of the climate crisis. Years of progress are being lost and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals is in jeopardy. The Horn of Africa is experiencing its worst drought in more than 40 years, putting up to 20 million people at risk of acute food insecurity. At least 7 million livestock have perished affecting the long-term livelihood and sustenance of millions. Against this backdrop, global adaptation finance needs are set to grow to at least $300 billion a year by 2030. Yet, even as the human toll of climate impacts mounts, adaptation commitments from Glasgow have stalled. This inaction has deepened the trust deficit between developed and developing countries. But, more importantly threatening hope for our young people. Yesterday, at the youth adaptation forum, I heard the voices of young people across the world demanding inclusive climate action. This is short sighted and self-defeating in both the long and short term. It is abundantly clear that investments in adaptation pay huge dividends on all sides. Investing $1.8 trillion in adaptation solutions this decade can lead avoiding $7.1 trillion in costs. Every dollar invested in adaptation can bring up to $10 in net economic benefits. There is no mystery to what is required. First, developed countries must make good on the contributions that were announced to the Adaptation Fund at the twenty-sixth United Nations climate change conference . Nine months later, the Secretariat of the Adaptation Fund is still waiting; $230 million of the $356 million pledged to the Fund has not been delivered. Promises made must be delivered in full and on time for people and the planet we live on. This is critical to rebuild trust in the multilateral system and our ability to prevent further loss of lives, livelihoods and the environment. Second, the Glasgow decision urges developed countries to collectively double adaptation funding to at least $40 billion a year by 2025. This must be delivered in full, as a base line. Developed countries need to provide, by the twenty-seventh United Nations climate change conference , a clear road map of how and when they will deliver on this commitment. This needs to start with the replenishment of the African Development Fund of the African Development Bank, which has supported bold adaptation action in the Sahel, the Great Green Wall, the Zambezi basin and the Horn of Africa. And a substantial replenishment of the Green Climate Fund will also be needed in 2023. This will be a litmus test for countries honouring their end of the Glasgow Pact. Third, we also need to dispel the myth that adaptation is not "investment ready". At the request of the Secretary-General, we are working on an Adaptation Pipeline Accelerator that demonstrates that collaboration among public and private financiers and developing countries must be the rule for how adaptation finance is delivered. The Accelerator is supporting countries in moving from identifying adaptation priorities, to developing an investment plan, to setting a pipeline of investable projects. The accelerator builds on existing initiatives, such as the partnership between the Global Center on Adaptation and the African Development Bank to deliver the Africa Accelerated Adaptation programme, pledging $25 billion into adaptation within five years. Fourth, adaptation finance cannot be disconnected from the dire fiscal situation in many developing countries. In addition, countries need options to refinance crippling existing debt, including debt for climate adaptation swaps, where vulnerable countries can reduce their debt stock and free up resources for adaptation. We applaud the leadership of Kristalina Georgieva in bringing to fruition the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, opening up financing to vulnerable countries especially those facing climate emergencies. Finally, we need genuine leadership from the multilateral development banks. It is no longer tenable for multilateral development banks to continue business as usual, when so many vulnerable people are losing their lives and livelihoods as the climate crisis worsens. Management and shareholders must overhaul their antiquated models to make them fit for purpose and take more risk to support the transition of developing countries to renewable energy-based, climate resilient economies. This means multilateral development banks must mainstream resilience building and vulnerability in all their investments and commit 50 per cent of their climate finance to adaptation. The private arms of the multilateral development banks, must also make quantitative commitments to finance adaptation. The Secretary-General's initiative on Early Warning for All aims to ensure everyone on Earth is covered by early warning systems within the next five years. Today, 6 out of every 10 persons in Africa lack coverage. The twenty-seventh United Nations climate change conference must also deliver a breakthrough on implementation for adaptation, and outcomes on loss and damage that address the question of finance and fully operationalize the existing institutional arrangements. This would strengthen global efforts towards resilience and reinforce that loss and damage is about international solidarity. Adaptation must be about more than survival in this era of climate crises. It must mean a commitment to improving livelihoods and translate to development with dignity for all. I look forward to the outcomes of this important meeting feeding with urgency the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group, G20 and twenty-seventh United Nations climate change conference .

COP 27 \\x92s official Youth Envoy, Dr Omnia El Omrani, realised the impact of climate change in 2017, and Hurricane Irma slammed Miami. As a doctor, she witnessed the influx of emergency patients into the hospital as a result of the hurricane, which piqued her interest in environmental and climate issues. She described it as a significant milestone in her life. "As a result, I decided to become an activist in the areas of public health and climate change over the ensuing years. I did this by attending events as a representative of a global organisation of medical students and young doctors, starting with the COP24 Climate Change Summit in Poland in 2018 and continuing through the Glasgow Conference in Britain in 2021," Omnia said in an interview with IPS. El Omrani is an Egyptian plastic and reconstruction surgery resident, community leader and climate change activist. She was appointed by the President-designate of the 27th Session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), Sameh Shoukry. Host country Egypt has committed to empowering youth. It sees the role of the youth envoy as a way to encourage and promote youth perspectives before COP27 and throughout the negotiations and conference itself. El Omrani sees herself as central to involving the world's young people at COP27 to promote climate action and implementation with the critical interventions necessary for the conference\\x92s implementation-focused strategy. The Youth Climate Summit COY17\\x92s most significant outcome is to develop a statement that reflects the youth's perception of the problem \\x96 and to suggest solutions. The youth statement\\x92s coordination began ahead of the COY17 youth summit, and YOUNGO with working groups will review and edit a draught version in Sharm El-Sheikh from November 2\\x964, after which it will be sent to the COP27 president, she explained. \\x93The unique thing that we will do this year On the Young and Future Generations Day (November 10), we will have a roundtable discussion instead of a panel discussion at COP27 . Here we will bring together high-ranking officials, negotiators, and ministers and YOUNGO to discuss the statement and (debate) how to get it implemented,\\x94 El Omrani said. YOUNGO is the UNFCCC's official youth constituency. These approaches include providing solid evidence on the impact of climate change. For example, Pakistan floods this year caused massive damage to the country's economy. Small island countries share similar issues. Likewise, severe heat waves swept through Europe. El Omrani, who is 27, has represented over 1.3 million medical students, leading their global advocacy and policy work on climate change with the UNFCCC, UNEP, and WHO, while also being engaged in climate action projects across Egypt and the world. El Omrani was the International Federation of Medical Students' Association's National Public Officer, MENA Focal Point, and Liaison Officer for Public Health Issues. She has participated in climate discussions at COP24, COP25, and COP26, environmental projects, and international climate conferences, such as the WHO Civil Society Group to Advance Climate and Health. \\x93I believe it is my responsibility to inform people about the significance of climate change in my community and at the institution where I work as a doctor. I also believe I must deliver these messages to decision-makers and urge them to act on this issue,\\x94 she added. "I am now developing a curriculum to be taught at universities to increase awareness of climate change issues, not just in Egypt but also throughout Africa, in collaboration with Ain Shams University in Egypt."

"Sorry to get so dark, so quick," the actor who played Dwight Schrute HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/rainn-wilson-favorite-episode-theoffice-1597674?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships on the sitcom said in the video and added, "see what happens in the Arctic, doesn't stay in the Arctic." "As the polar ice caps melt it drives up risk throughout the world. Including extreme weather events that affect us all." Wilson, a board member of Arctic Basecamp, revealed he changed his name on a website called Arctic Risk Name Generator. "So as a cheap little stunt to help save planet Earth, I've changed my name on my HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships Twitter , HYPERLINK Instagram and even on my fancy writing paper," he said holding up an envelope with his name on it with handwritten changes to show his new name. The name on the envelope read, "acid Rainn kills trees Wilson." It is not clear if Wilson changed his name officially on legal documents, but his social media handles remain @rainnwilson, but he has update the name section of his accounts. He encouraged fans and other to also change their names "to help tell the world leaders and influencers that we need to act now." The actor also had some suggestions for other celebrities to change their names including, "Cardi the Arctic B is Melting", "Harrison why not drive an electric HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/ford?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships Ford " and "Amy Poehler bears are endangered." "With the help of my scientist friends at Arctic Basecamp, I've changed my name to Rainnfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson," he later said in a statement. "This is not a joke, I'm as serious as the melting Arctic, which amplifies global risks including extreme weather events around the globe." Wilson added: "I'm hoping this name change brings attention to this growing ... er, melting issue. We need world leaders at COP27 to take notice and take action. The Arctic is melting at millions of litres per second, yet this problem can't seem to make a name for itself, so it's up to us to make a name for it. "Go to ArcticRiskName.org and create a name that will bring attention to this problem. Then and this is the important part change your social media profile or display name to match your new ArcticRisk name. And if enough of us do this, then maybe COP27 will be where our world leaders sit up and notice Arctic risks and introduce a solution." But his climate change stunt was met with mixed reviews online with some fans calling it "annoying." "On one hand, this is very Dwight behavior. On the other hand, more annoying than the tomato soup shit. This guy actually has more resources to do something meaningful," wrote one fan on Twitter. Another added: "That is truly something Dwight would do." And a third wrote: "Wow! This completely stupid and insane thing has really educated me in climate change! Thank you rich white people!"

Dec 09, 2022( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com This must be a decade of action, yet many experts warn that we are heading in the wrong direction. On the eve of COP 27 , we lay down the critical role of ICT and public-private partnerships in helping our world mitigate, adapt to and build resilience against climate catastrophe More and more, I think the questions we need to ask ourselves are no longer just 'what is climate change?', and 'why should we care?'. But now, the questions become even harder: what concrete solutions can we use to deal with it? On the eve of the COP 27 summit[1], I find my mind going back to last year's event that ended on a bit of a sour note. In a first for a COP, a plan to reduce coal-fired power generation had been agreed, but objections from India and China led to the text being weakened from an agreement to 'phase out' coal, to a commitment to a 'phasedown of unabated coal.' Since last year's COP26, it feels like there has just been a barrage of bad news. Many reports, from many organizations, have highlighted that we are heading in the wrong direction. Greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise. Fossil fuel emission rates are now above pre-pandemic levels. Catastrophic weather has had devasting effects across the globe, particularly in Pakistan where massive flooding has left over 2.1 million people homeless. Now, more than ever, we need to spend time on coming together to talk about specific solutions that businesses and society can contribute to climate action. At COP27 , we want to bring all kinds of solutions to the table from nature-based solutions to energy solutions. That is why we are excited to announce the 6[2]th[2] Exponential Climate Action Summit[2], hosted by Ericsson alongside our partners, the Exponential Roadmap Initiative, We Don't Have Time and UNDP. Hosted in Nature Zone, close to the COP negotiations and action, we will gather thought leaders from business and society to tackle the big issues we have in front on us when it comes to climate mitigation, adaption and resilience. What do we mean by climate mitigation, adaptation and resilience? Mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases. This is basically a focus on slowing the rate of global warming. Adaptation refers to humans adapting to life in a changing climate and adjusting to the actual or expected future climate. Resilience is a measure of an area's ability to deal with the effects of climate change and 'bounce back' or recover. To think of it in real terms using the example of catastrophic weather: mitigation works to minimise climate change, so we don't get increasingly severe storms, adaptation helps prepare for the more severe storms which we are already beginning to experience, and resilience helps us bounce back more quickly following these storms. You could think of these as the three pillars of climate action and technology can help with all three. For mitigation, the research is clear: ICT solutions can enable a reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions by up to 15 percent by 2030, while being responsible for only 1.4 percent of the global carbon footprint. With new emerging technologies like 5G[3], AI[4] and IoT[5] we can likely achieve even more reductions, if we implement them correctly. Technology can help with adaptation as well. One of the most visible consequences of a warming world is an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events from wildfires to flooding and hurricanes. In fact, there has been increase catastrophic weather over the last several years but the death toll has not increased in the same way. In fact, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the number of disasters has increased by a factor of five over the 50-year period, driven by climate change. Yet despite these growing risks, around the world, disasters in general are becoming less deadly. According to the WMO, the number of disaster-related deaths has fallen by two-thirds. One reason for that is the increased monitoring and alert systems that are possible with ICT. For example, just this summer we teamed up with China Mobile Zhejiang[6] and other partners to deploy 5G technology in public-safety-focused natural disaster management. The solution spans early-warning analysis, natural disaster monitoring, command and dispatch, and post-disaster assessment, focusing the region's vulnerability to large-scale natural disasters and flash floods during the increasingly severe wet season. And then there's resilience. Even as we work to avert the worst possible impacts of climate change, we must become more resilient to those impacts that are now unavoidable. One example is our award-winning Connected Mangroves project[7]. By planting mangrove saplings with connected sensors, we have been able to have a full reforestation of the important mangrove forests in communities in the Philippines and Malaysia. These forests are one of Earth's most natural protectors against the impacts of climate change, particularly as they protect the local communities from catastrophic weather like typhoons and flooding, as well as protecting ecosystems vital for fisheries. By helping their reforestation, we help the local communities guard their homes and their livelihoods. I'm looking forward to hearing about more solutions at COP27 . We need to stay positive and show the world that it is possible, otherwise we will not be able to make it. And we need to make it. After all, this is the decade of action; it's more important than ever to work side-by-side with governments to scale up public-private efforts in the drive to Net Zero emissions globally.

The following information was released by the Government of India: - LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment, theme of India Pavilion - India a part of the solution not the problem: Shri Bhupender Yadav at COP 27 Posted On: 06 NOV 2022 6:31PM by PIB Delhi Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Shri Bhupender Yadav, inaugurated India Pavilion at the 27th Session of Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, today. The Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) is scheduled from 6-18 November, 2022. Welcoming the delegates from all the countries to India Pavilion, Shri Yadav said that Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi has provided a simple solution to the complex climate change problem. He said that India believes that climate action starts from the grassroots, individual level and hence designed the India Pavilion with the theme of LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment. On this occasion, Shri Yadav also felicitated the COP Young Scholars from India who worked towards Positive Climate Change solutions. I am confident that, throughout the duration of COP, India Pavilion will continue to remind the delegates that simple lifestyle and individual practices that are sustainable in nature can help protect Mother Earth, said the Union Environment Minister Shri Yadav. India looks forward to substantial progress in the discussions related to climate finance. We also look forward to the introduction of new technologies, and new collaborations to facilitate technology transfers, said Shri. Yadav. Mission LiFE connects the powers of the people for the protection of this earth and teaches them to utilize it in a better way. Mission LiFE makes the fight against climate change democratic in which everyone can contribute according to his or her capacity. Mission LiFE believes that even small efforts can have a huge impact, Prime Minister of India Shri. Narendra Modi. LiFE @ India Pavilion at COP 27 India is hosting a pavilion with the theme of LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment at COP 27 . The Pavilion has been designed to send out the message of LiFE through various audio-visuals, Logo, 3D models, set up, dcor and side events. The guiding thought in the design of the pavilion is that for centuries, Indian civilizations have practised and led sustainable lifestyles. Eco-friendly habits are encoded in the Indian culture. Several practices are rooted in the daily life showing respect for the natural environment. They can prove to be invaluable in our fight against climate change. This deep-seated knowledge on sustainability passed through generations over a thousand years has led the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi into giving the World a Mantra of LiFE - that aim to have a substantial impact on the health and wellbeing of the planet. LiFE movement is India's contribution to handling global climate crisis. The LiFE movement seeks to transform persons into pro-planet people, who would adopt sustainable lifestyles in the modern world. LiFE Pavilion From The Past, For The Future In respect of the Pavilion logo, the color green which is indicative of Green Earth has been used in gradient shades in the logo. The leaf on the periphery represents nature and icons represent how balance and harmony with nature can be achieved through various initiatives of the Government of India. The central part of the logo represents a balanced nature with the Sun encompassing trees, mountains, water and biodiversity. Shri Bhupender Yadav also attended the ceremonial opening of COP 27 where Egypt took over the COP Presidency from UK. The Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi gave the mantra of LiFE to the world in 2021 at COP 26 in Glasgow and this movement has since been widely supported by world leaders. India has spearheaded Mission LiFE as a global mass movement that harnesses the power of individual and collective action across the world to address the climate crisis. It aims to resurrect the delicate balance between man and nature by encouraging a shift from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation to protect and preserve the environment. Mission LiFE is designed with the objective to mobilise at least one billion Indians and other global citizens to take individual and collective action for protecting and preserving the environment in the period 2022 to 2027. Within India, at least 80% of all villages and urban local bodies are aimed to become environment-friendly by 2028. \</doc>

The following information was released by ActionAid: Ahead of the COP27 climate talks, ActionAid is setting out five climate justice benchmarks to build trust and deliver the action needed to address the Loss and Damage and Climate Justice. Commenting on COP27 , Teresa Anderson, ActionAid International's Global Lead on Climate Justice, said: "Communities and countries on the front lines of climate change are pinning their hopes on COP27 to deliver the help they urgently need to recover from disasters. As the climate crisis escalates, a new UN funding facility to cover the losses and damages caused by floods, droughts and cyclones would be a game-changer in helping vulnerable countries to avoid deepening debt and poverty. Morally, it's a no-brainer. All eyes will be on the US, the EU, the UK, and Australia to see if they will finally act with the compassion required and allow the UN to set up this long-overdue solution." Susan Otieno, ActionAid Kenya's Executive Director, added: "The drought that we are facing in East Africa right now is both tragic and terrifying for us. A hotter planet means that the rains have now failed five seasons in a row. Our crops have failed, our livestock have died, and our water sources have dried up. 22 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia are at risk of starvation that's more than twice the entire population of Sweden or four times the population of Ireland. We're not even getting the humanitarian support we urgently need to ensure that people can eat and survive from one day to the next. And without support to cope with the loss and damage from this disaster, our region will be condemned to even deeper debt and poverty for many more years to come. It makes me furious, because the women and girls that are starving right now have done absolutely nothing to cause climate change, and yet their suffering is so, so terrible." ActionAid's five climate justice benchmarks for a successful COP27 It is shocking that after decades of climate negotiations, there is still no financial support provided to countries harmed by climate change. COP27 must agree to set up a new Loss and Damage Funding Facility so that climate-impacted counties can access much-needed funds to recover from the consequences of the climate crisis. Without sufficient climate finance, lower-income countries simply will not be able to cope with impacts, or adopt green technologies and strategies to lower global emissions. The new global target for climate finance must be ambitious enough to meet the scale of the crisis and be based on both the science and the assessment of need. It is crucial that climate finance is in the form of grants, and not loans which are pushing countries further into debt and poverty. Wealthy countries most responsible for our warming world must pay their fair share of climate finance. Agriculture is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. However industrialised agriculture based on agrochemicals and factory farming make the sector the second biggest polluter, after fossil fuels. Negotiations on agriculture must bring about a shift to agroecological farming practices which help farmers adapt to climate impacts while cooling the planet. Carbon offsets can allow polluters to claim that they are meeting "net zero" climate targets while polluting -as-usual and delaying climate action. Negotiations under Article 6 must not be allowed to open loopholes that could drive land grabs, infringe on human rights, permit double counting, or do other tricks that lead to escalating emissions. A lack of funding available for adaptation is leaving marginalized communities especially women and girls - exposed to climate change impacts and escalating costs of loss and damage. No real progress has been made on pledges made last year at COP26 in Glasgow to double adaptation funding. COP27 needs to deliver on real finance in the form of grants for adaptation, as well as progress on the Global on Adaptation, to ensure that sufficient funds are being delivered and truly benefiting the women and girls in the world's most marginalized communities.

Nov 03, 2022( International Business Times Australia: HYPERLINK / Delivered by Newstex) Some of the best-known glaciers worldwide, including the last one in Africa, will melt by 2050 because of climate change, according to a new United Nations report.[1] The report[2] released Wednesday warned that one-third of the glaciers found in 50 World Heritage sites can't be saved, including Africa's last glacier on top of Tanzania's Mt. Killamanjaro. The other two-thirds can be spared if the world-wide temperature rise can be kept below 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 Fahrenheit, in that time. Glaciers in the Swiss Alps and the U.S National Parks of Yellowstone and Yosemite are also expected to disappear[3]. Scientists based their predictions on satellite data that tracked the movement of receding glaciers. The report identifies 18,600 glaciers across 50 U.N. World Heritage sites, which compose almost 10% of the Earth's glacier areas. The majority of the glaciers threatened also serve as major tourist destinations and are vital to local economies. The melting glaciers are putting the communities that rely on them at economic risk, the report concluded. A rescue helicopter flies over the partially collapsed glacier on Marmolada, the highest mountain in the DolomitesAFP / Pierre TEYSSOT The report called the glacial retreat and disappearance some of "the most dramatic evidence that Earth's climate is warming." A separate report [4]from the U.N. Environment Program found the world was failing to meet goals set by the Paris Climate Agreement and that there was "no credible pathway" to limiting temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius. The glacial report concluded that World Heritage ice melt potentially caused up to 4.5% of global sea level rise between 2000 and 2020. The glaciers cited in the study lose 58 billion tons of ice annually. The continuous melt leads to increased flooding, rising sea levels, loss of fresh water and economic decline. In August, it was reported that glacial melt in the Swiss Alps[5] threatens Europe's water supply and loss of ice is causing a culture shift in Greenland[6], threatening the local way of life. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 [7], opens Sunday in Cairo and world leaders are expected to gather and discuss climate-change solutions.

PR Newswire Chemonics' climate experts will be at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt this November. Climate change affects every corner of our planet and every development sector, from expanding the range of infectious diseases and driving conflict over limited natural resources to threatening energy supplies and agricultural outputs. As one of the most urgent challenges of our time, climate change requires collaboration and innovation to support countries on their journey towards inclusive, climate-resilient development and net zero carbon emissions economies. From November 8-10, we will be in Sharm El-Sheikh during COP27 hosting a series of in-person discussions with climate experts and advocates from around the world. "Addressing the global climate crisis is more urgent than ever, and we are proud to be part of COP27 this year to represent the issues \- and opportunities for change \- in the global development sector," says Anna Slother, Chemonics' executive vice president.\~ At Chemonics, we leverage our decades of experience in international development and environmental management to support implementation and decision-making based on empirical, science-informed climate information while bolstering the capacity of communities to address climate risks and vulnerabilities and build more resilient livelihoods. "Information about changes in climate and related changes in vulnerability and risk needs to be conveyed to users in a way that they can use it to inform decisions that strengthen rather than threaten their livelihoods," says Chris Perine, managing director of Chemonics' Climate Group. "This is critical to get the buy-in for sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies that actually work." Climate change stresses social, economic, and political systems, acting as a multiplier for development challenges and enhancing the likelihood of \- and impacts from \- conflict. On Tuesday, November 8, 2022, we will focus onExploring Climate and Fragility in Conflict Prevention, Mitigation, and Recoverywith\~Dr. Ruth Citrin, Executive Director of\~the Cross-Border Conflict Evidence Policy and Trends (XCEPT) research program funded by UK Aid,Emma Whitaker, Senior Advisor at adelphi,Paul Currie, Associate Director of the Urban Systems Centre at ICLEI Africa, and Brian App, Chemonics' Senior Climate Services Director.\~ Lack of regulation, comprehensive standards, and equitable stakeholder engagement in nature-based carbon projects has led to pervasive issues for communities and could undermine the credibility of these projects and credits in the voluntary carbon market. On Wednesday, November 9, 2022, join us for a discussion onEnhancing the Quality of Nature-based Carbon Credits\~withCandace Vinke, Senior Director of Nature-based Innovation at Verra, Dr. Daniel Nepstad, Founder and President of the Earth Innovation Institute, Roberto G\'f3mez, Director of Innovative Conservation Models on the USAID Paramos and Forests Activity, and Maxwell Mcgrath-Horn, Chemonics' Senior Climate Finance Advisor. Over the last decade, there has been an increase in adaptation programming but only scant evidence of what has \- or has not \- worked under different contexts. On Thursday, November 10, 2022, we will host our final conversation onMeasuring the Effectiveness of Climate Adaptation Interventions\~with Laurie Ashley, Resilience and Climate Adaptation Advisor at USAID, Emilie Beauchamp, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning Lead at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, David Nicholson, Chief Climate Officer at Mercy Corps, and Nik Steinberg, Chemonics' Senior Climate Risk Advisor.

Conservation International issued the following news release on Nov. 15, 2022: Today at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), Conservation International Aotearoa (New Zealand) launched the Hinemoana Halo Ocean Initiative, in partnership with Maori tribes, to deliver self-determined and Indigenous-led Ocean climate leadership. Mere Takoko, Vice-President of Conservation International Aotearoa said: "Hinemoana Halo provides a high impact and scalable solution that will value and finance natural climate solutions in Aotearoa. This will reconnect the nation to their Ocean heritage and legacy as kaitiaki (guardians) of the moana (ocean)." Conservation International supported the largest Maori delegation to ever participate in a side event in a Climate COP in support of Hinemoana Halo. Delegation participant, Lisa Tumahai, Chairperson of the Tribal Parliament of Ngai Tahu and Deputy Chair of the New Zealand Climate Commission, said: "Hinemoana Halo is an opportunity for Iwi to create one of the first indigenous-led voluntary blue carbon regimes in history and to be progressive in this space, building our knowledge and leadership for Aotearoa." The new ocean initiative supports Maori to protect, care, manage and monitor Aotearoa's coastal waters and high seas in partnership with local communities, using both traditional approaches and current science. Efforts will focus on marine conservation and providing direct benefits to Maori Tribes and coastal communities, from jobs to infrastructure. This will promote inter-Indigenous economic relations and trade across Aotearoa and the Pacific. Hinemoana Halo will also establish a marine recovery plan with Maori to accelerate the recovery of populations of taonga (scared) species, from whales to sea lions, dolphins and manta rays. The ocean initiative is named for the Maori ocean goddess Hinemoana and Conservation International's new Blue Halo model, launched at G20 on Sunday, November 13. Blue Halo is a conservation solution designed to pay for itself. This integrates two elements of marine management often seen as being at odds: environmental protection and economic production. Under the Blue Halo model, the economic benefits of sustainable marine management are reinvested in environmental protection, sustaining the natural resources which underpin economic and livelihood security.

(TNSjou) -- The University of Leeds issued the following news:    The 2020s have been described as the critical decade for climate change.    The COP27 Even keeping within an average of 1.5 degrees centigrade rise in warming will have an impact on people and on biodiversity, already evident with an increase in extreme weather events such as heatwaves, storms, flooding and drought. But scientists warn that even a small increase in warming above that target will result in more devastating and extreme weather events. For the next nine days, an eight-strong delegation of researchers from Leeds will be at COP27 to raise awareness of the work they are doing to reduce the impact of climate change. Professor Richard Beardsworth, an expert in the politics of climate change and Head of the School of Politics and International Studies, said: "The delegates will play a role as key ambassadors for the University on an issue that affects everyone on the planet. "They are at COP27 Leeds at COP27 These are some of the activities that the delegates at COP27 will be involved with: Congo peatlands: Professor Simon Lewis, from the School of Geography, has published research in Nature which reveals how vulnerable the peatlands of the Congo Basin are to drought. During drying conditions 5,000 years ago, the peatlands switched from being a carbon store to emitting carbon dioxide before eventually switching back to storing carbon about 2,000 years ago. If modern-day climate change causes the Congo Basin to become dryer, then the peatlands could once again emit carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas. That could have a devastating impact on climate change. The peatlands hold around 30 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide: that is equivalent to the global emissions from burning fossil fuels for three years. At COP27 Climate co-benefits tool: climate action can often have benefits that go beyond reducing the risks of climate change. For example, climate policies may have wider benefits in terms of promoting better health, reducing pollution, or creating jobs. And of course, there are climate policies that require a trade-off. An online portal has been developed by the University and the UK's Met Office that will enable policymakers to identify the wider benefits and trade-offs of different climate policies. Dr Bianca van Bavel, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Climate Change and Health, showcased the online portal at COP27 . The launch of the online tool was streamed on the UK Government YouTube channel. Just transformation: Rebecca Sarku, Research Fellow in Climate Change and Food Systems, has been involved in research analysing ways to ensure that policies adopted under the Paris Agreement at COP21 in 2015 can be applied to the agricultural sector in such a way so as not to see a repeat of historical injustices where people were the victims of land grabs or were denied workers' rights. Rebecca was presenting her research in the Food System Pavilion at COP27 . COP27 at Leeds Artist and University manager James Mckay has painted a large mural on campus with his vision of what a greener and cleaner Leeds - a zero carbon city - would look like. His mural can be found near the benches on the path linking the social sciences building with side entrance to the students' union building. Simon Jenkins, from the University's engagement team, used a time-lapse camera to capture the artwork being created. At Leeds, researchers and academics are providing expert insight and commentary on the progress of COP27 COP27 with an analysis of how political leaders need to square the circle of the transition to a net-zero carbon economy while ensuring short-term energy security. Ask a researcher: the Priestley International Centre for Climate has also produced a series of videos addressing some of the key issues surrounding COP27 . In each short video, an experts answers questions including 'What is COP?' and 'What are the links between climate change and gender?' 'Who Ya Gonna Call?' On Wednesday, a one-man show called "Who ya gonna call?" by Steve Scott-Bottoms asked why more has not already been done given the scale of the climate challenge facing the world. Hosted by Stage@Leeds, the show drew on research with sustainability officers, flood risk managers and others. The performance was one of the outcomes from Steve's research project which saw him embedded with the flood risk management team at Leeds City Council and Yorkshire and Humber Climate Commission's adaptation and resilience panel. Water security: On Monday (Nov14) Water@Leeds is hosting an online seminar to discuss the six important themes that should help guide research into water and sanitation and water security. The online seminar takes place between 13.00 and 15.00 and tickets are available from Eventbrite. Full details about events being held at Leeds around COP27 are available on the Priestley International Centre for Climate website.

The following information was released by Conservation International (CI): Today at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), Conservation International Aotearoa (New Zealand) launched the Hinemoana Halo Ocean Initiative, in partnership with M\'c4ori tribes, to deliver self-determined and Indigenous-led Ocean climate leadership. Mere Takoko, Vice-President of Conservation International Aotearoa said: "Hinemoana Halo provides a high impact and scalable solution that will value and finance natural climate solutions in Aotearoa. This will reconnect the nation to their Ocean heritage and legacy as kaitiaki (guardians) of the moana (ocean)." Conservation International supported the largest M&#257;ori delegation to ever participate in a side event in a Climate COP in support of Hinemoana Halo. Delegation participant, Lisa Tumahai, Chairperson of the Tribal Parliament of Ng\'c4i Tahu and Deputy Chair of the New Zealand Climate Commission, said: "Hinemoana Halo is an opportunity for Iwi to create one of the first indigenous-led voluntary blue carbon regimes in history and to be progressive in this space, building our knowledge and leadership for Aotearoa." The new ocean initiative supports M\'c4ori to protect, care, manage and monitor Aotearoa's coastal waters and high seas in partnership with local communities, using both traditional approaches and current science. Efforts will focus on marine conservation and providing direct benefits to M\'c4ori Tribes and coastal communities, from jobs to infrastructure. This will promote inter-Indigenous economic relations and trade across Aotearoa and the Pacific. Hinemoana Halo will also establish a marine recovery plan with M\'c4ori to accelerate the recovery of populations of taonga (scared) species, from whales to sea lions, dolphins and manta rays. The ocean initiative is named for the M\'c4ori ocean goddess Hinemoana and Conservation International's new Blue Halo model, launched at G20 on Sunday, November 13. Blue Halo is a conservation solution designed to pay for itself. This integrates two elements of marine management often seen as being at odds: environmental protection and economic production. Under the Blue Halo model, the economic benefits of sustainable marine management are reinvested in environmental protection, sustaining the natural resources which underpin economic and livelihood security. Conservation International Aotearoa launched Hinemoana Halo at two COP27 panel events, at both the Moana Blue Pacific Pavilion and the Indigenous Peoples Pavilion. There they explained their plans with Iwi/M&#257;ori and Pacific peoples along with scientists, economists and investors to deliver the Initiative within Aotearoa and how they will further scale this to the Pacific Islands region.

The question of how to finance the energy transition is emerging as one of the most divisive topics at the UN's COP27 conference in Egypt \'e2\â¬ and some of the world's biggest financial institutions are getting caught in the crossfire. Poorer countries are clamoring for much greater financial support from the world's more affluent nations. And there are also growing divisions among richer countries about how the rules for "net-zero" investment should be drawn up. Producer nations and oil and gas companies are arguing that an overly ambitious transition away from fossil fuels is already causing price spikes and energy shortages. And banks, insurance firms and investment funds are trying to make good on their own energy transition plans. Doing so will require balancing investment in and lending for energy transition opportunities around the world with further funding for the oil and gas that continues to drive the global economy for the time being. "Cut Emissions, Not Corners" The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) \'e2\â¬ formed at last year's COP26 gathering in Glasgow \'e2\â¬ is the world's largest grouping of financial institutions that have pledged to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. It has some 550 members with more than $150 trillion under management and is led by UN Special Envoy for Climate and Finance Mark Carney. GFANZ recently eased its rules on fossil fuel investment, prompting UN watchdogs to accuse it of being too soft when it comes to evaluating the energy transition plans of its members \'e2\â¬ and in particular their continuing support for fossil fuels. A high-level expert report on net-zero commitments by non-state actors commissioned by the UN Secretary General and published on Tuesday said it was unacceptable for investors and lenders to continue to fund fossil fuels. "Non\'e2\â¬ state actors cannot claim to be net-zero while continuing to build or invest in new fossil fuel supply \'e2\â¬ \Â£6 this is about cutting emissions, not corners," the report said. "Right now, the planet cannot afford delays, excuses, or more greenwashing," it added. Oil companies and hydrocarbon-producing countries argue, however, that prohibiting investment in oil and gas is precisely the kind of action that has led to the current global energy crisis. And in the US, there is a growing backlash \'e2\â¬ especially in hydrocarbon-producing states \'e2\â¬ against financial institutions that pledge to curb investment in or financing of traditional fossil fuels. One GFANZ advisor told Energy Intelligence that governments need to take a firmer stance on investments in fossil fuels before private companies can take more decisive steps themselves. "They are caught in a trap," James Vacarro, executive director of the Climate Safe Lending Network and an advisor to GFANZ told Energy Intelligence at COP 27 . "JPMorgan will say, well if we don't do it, Citi will do it. And Citi will say, if we don't do it, well Bank of America will do it," Vacarro added. Members of GFANZ and like-minded groups that are trying to encourage the financial services sector to support the energy transition also find themselves caught up in the recent tensions between hydrocarbon producers and consumers. Producers maintain that although the world needs to invest in renewable energy it must also invest in oil and gas, because an additional 5 million barrels per day of new capacity is needed each year just to offset the natural decline at existing oil fields. "Understand Our Plight" Less affluent countries \'e2\â¬ both those that produce energy and those that depend on imports \'e2\â¬ argue that policies adopted by financial institutions will have a huge impact on their ability to navigate the energy transition. GFANZ estimates that emerging economies will need about $1 trillion a year of investment in clean energy by 2030 for the world to attain net-zero emissions by 2050. The issue of compensation for "loss and damage" caused by climate change has been included in the official agenda for the UN climate change conference this year. Developing countries like Pakistan \'e2\â¬ which suffered major flooding this year \'e2\â¬ have been arguing that they should be compensated for damage caused by extreme weather triggered by climate change because this is a shared responsibility. "It is the responsibility of the Global North to understand our plight," Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told the conference. "How on earth can you expect from us that we undertake this gigantic task on our own?" he asked, noting that in addition to the costs of flood relief, Pakistan \'e2\â¬ like other developing countries \'e2\â¬ is also facing soaring costs for basic foods. Sharif complained that current financing arrangements cannot "sustain any real recovery needs of those on the frontlines of climate catastrophe." On Wednesday the US is expected to present a plan at COP27 to expand an agreement designed to help South Africa transition from coal to low-carbon energy to other middle-income countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Also at COP27 on Tuesday: The Global Offshore Wind Alliance was launched to promote a six-fold increase in offshore wind generation capacity, from 57 GW today to at least 380 GW in 2030. The New Africa Carbon Markets Initiative was launched, targeting 300 million carbon credits annually by 2030, and 1.5 billion credits annually by 2050. Its sponsors claim this could generate revenues of $6 billion by 2030 and more than $120 billion by 2050. Egypt and the United Arab Emirates signed a memorandum of understanding for a 10 GW offshore wind project. Saudi Arabia's Acwa Power, Egypt's Hassan Allam Holdings and Oman signed a $1.5 billion project for a 1.1 GW wind farm in the Gulf of Suez, with start-up scheduled for 2026.

(PRWeb) - HonorHealth, a leading Valley healthcare system serving 1.6 million people in the greater Phoenix and Scottsdale area, was celebrated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on November 10, 2022 for pledging ongoing action to decarbonize the health care sector and make health care facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. HonorHealth has formally committed to pursuing the Biden administrations climate goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To date, HonorHealth has invested in several sustainability initiatives, including engagement as an active member of Practice Greenhealth and serving as co-chair for the Southwest Healthcare Sustainability Collaborative comprised of other healthcare systems, universities and local governments. Supply Chain Operations implemented a medical equipment no waste project, centralized management of their 80-vehicle fleet and began a Styrofoam recycling project. Lastly, Food Services now offers meatless Monday entrees, sourcing produce locally and utilizing compostable food container products across all campuses. A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the number one threat to global public health. It exposes millions of people in the United States to harm every yearwith disproportionate impacts on communities that are often already the victims of longstanding discriminationthrough increases in extreme heat waves, wildfires, flooding, vector-borne diseases and other factors that worsen chronic health conditions. The healthcare sector also contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8.5 percent of U.S. domestic emissions. The HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge to help focus industry response to climate challenges. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities for both chronic and acute catastrophic climate impacts. One hundred two prominent health companies in the U.S. have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including organizations representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more. Federal systems like the Indian Health Service (IHS), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and Military Health System (MHS) are working together to meet similar goals to those these private sector organizations have embraced. Combined, this means that over 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing over 15 percent of U.S. hospitals. Our commitment to those we serve includes becoming more resilient and proactive to mitigate the health threats associated with climate change, especially in service of communities at disproportionate risk of climate-related harm, said Todd LaPorte, CEO at HonorHealth. HHS returns this year to COP27 to report great progress, said ADM Rachel Levine, the Assistant Secretary for Health. Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector. \</doc>

More than 100 health systems, payers, drug manufacturers, associations and other industry organizations have signed on to the Biden administration's greenhouse gas and climate resilience pledge, according to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announcement timed with the HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/ United Nations HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/ HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/ Climate Change Conference HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/ ( HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg/ COP27 ) .  The organizations that signed the pledge are demonstrating to the health sector that climate smart investments are not only possible but are becoming standard for the industry, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. HHS joined the United Nations' health program last year, which included commitments to supporting climate resilience and reduced carbon emissions. On Earth Day this year, the department partnered with the White House HYPERLINK https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/hhs-calls-hospitals-make-voluntary-pledge-cut-emissions-zero-2050 to launch its Health Sector Climate Pledge, a voluntary commitment that includes a 50% greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. Signees of the pledge are also committed to designating an executive-level lead for emission reduction by 2023, releasing a climate resilience plan for continuous operations by the end of 2023 and conducting an inventory of supply chain emissions by the end of 2024. HHS said 102 healthcare organizations have signed onto the pledge. The group includes entities representing 837 hospitals, HHS said, though adding federal systems like the Veterans Health Administration bumps that tally to over 1,080 hospitals, more than 15% of the country's total hospitals. Standout names on HYPERLINK https://www.hhs.gov/climate-change-health-equity-environmental-justice/climate-change-health-equity/actions/health-sector-pledge/index.html the full list of signatories  Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector, Rachel Levine, M.D., assistant secretary for health at HHS, said in a statement.  We see great promise in the combined force of international and domestic action to combat the global health threat of climate change. HHS' announcement also noted a new joint plan with England's National Health Service to devise a proposal addressing healthcare supply chain emissions. The healthcare sector represents nearly a fifth of the nation's gross domestic product and was responsible for 10% of the nation's smog formation, 12% of acid rain, 9% of criteria air pollutants, 1% of stratospheric ozone depletion and 1% to 2% of carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic air toxins, according to 2016 study data cited in HYPERLINK https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/extreme-weather-derailing-healthcare-delivery-across-country-providers-tell-congress a recent congressional report U.S. greenhouse gas emission increases between 2010 and 2018 were estimated to result in the loss of 388,000 disability-adjusted life years, per the same report, while provider groups faced an average 4.2 climate change-fueled extreme weather events within the past five years. Environmental resiliency efforts among provider organizations solicited by Congress for its report broadly differed, with about half saying they used at least one tool to measure emissions while fewer said they would be in a good position to meet the White House's 50% greenhouse gas emission reduction goal for 2030. \</doc>

After a tense impasse and many hours of negotiations, almost 200 countries struck a deal to set up a loss and damage fund to assist nations worst hit by climate change \\x96 a demand considered not-negotiable by the developing countries. COP27 was extended by a day after negotiators couldn\\x92t agree on the fund \\x96 leading to UN Secretary-General Ant\\xF3nio Guterres saying on Friday, November 18 2022, that the time for talking about loss and damage finance is over. He alluded to a growing breakdown of trust between developing and developed countries. Guterres, early on Sunday, November 20 2022, welcomed the fund saying: \\x93I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period. Clearly, this will not be enough, but it is a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust.\\x94 He added that the voices of those on the frontlines of the climate crisis must be heard. Speaking in the closing plenary, COP President H.E. Sameh Shoukry said: \\x93The work that we\\x92ve managed to do here in the past two weeks, and the results we have together achieved, are a testament to our collective will, as a community of nations, to voice a clear message that rings loudly today, here in this room and around the world: that multilateral diplomacy still works\\x85 despite the difficulties and challenges of our times, the divergence of views, level of ambition or apprehension, we remain committed to the fight against climate change\\x85 we rose to the occasion, upheld our responsibilities and undertook the important decisive political decisions that millions around the world expect from us.\\x94 Shoukry noted: \\x93This was not easy. We worked around the clock. Long days and nights. Strained and sometimes tense, but united and working for one aim, one higher purpose, one common goal that we all subscribe to and aspire to achieve. In the end, we delivered.\\x94 Under the previous global climate summit, which took place in Glasgow, Scotland last year, parties agreed on the roadmap where developing countries, which did little to cause the climate crisis, arrived with a determination to win a commitment from rich nations to compensate them for this damage. On several occasions during negotiations, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, also the COP27 President, stated that climate finance remains key for Africa since the continent contributes 4 percent to global emissions and is adversely affected to a much higher degree by global warming-relate events. On losses and damages, some climate finance experts believe that ongoing climate talks on finance at COP27 are one of the most painful examples of the African proverb that when the elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled. IATP is a think tank that analyses the interconnection between agriculture, trade, and climate in developing countries. Since 2015, loss and damage have served as the main catalyser under the UNFCCC process, especially for enhancing financial support for adaptation to avert, minimise and address climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Murphy pointed out that the G77 includes a very wide range of countries and interests, and the climate crisis is not suffered equally across the South. \\x93Currently developing nations at COP27 are likely showing that everyone is responsible for the negative realities of climate change and loss and damage negotiations is the most recent iteration of this long-standing fight,\\x94 she said. While many negotiators in Sharm El Sheikh believe that rich countries are lagging in measures to allocate loss and damage funding, there is a consensus that the current negotiations on climate finance did not go very well, particularly with respect to the expectations for COP27 . \\x93Unfortunately, if the trust is broken, it may affect other issues being negotiated and ultimately affect our collective action of combatting climate change,\\x94 the senior financial expert said. The bank published the 2022\\xA0African\\xA0Economic Outlook report on the needs of\\xA0African\\xA0Countries for\\xA0loss\\xA0and damage\\xA0in 2022-2030 at between USD 289.2 to USD 440.5\\xA0billion. The estimated adaptation\\xA0finance\\xA0needs are in a similar order of magnitude. For many Africans, according to Olufunso, the negotiations were not aggressive enough in finding solutions urgently needed at both scale and speed. Until the end of the summit, loss and damage fund remained a major sticking point. \\x93Negotiations are going well in some items and not well in other items (...) Rwanda and other vulnerable countries had much expectation in securing a decision of adopting the establishment of loss and damage fund,\\x94 Faustin Munyazikwiye, the Deputy Director General of Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA) and Rwanda\\x92s Lead negotiator, told IPS in an interview. According to him, this item [on loss and damage] did not go well. African negotiators at COP27 prioritised filling gaps between present risks associated with climate change and financing for adaptation. However, most developing countries prefer to ensure that finance for loss and damages is channelled through the private sector and is not necessarily a liability for rich countries. But other experts believe that cost of repairing these damages is staggering and the countries which should pay are the ones who contributed to climate change in the first place. While some climate finance experts observe that the commitment by rich nations to pay the developing world $100 billion cannot even compensate what Africa\\x92s needs, others point out that COP27 must deliver a bold finance facility to pay for loss and damage to communities already impacted by climate change on the continent. Kelly Dent, the Global Director of External Engagement at the UK-based World Animal Protection, told IPS most vulnerable countries, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, are considering the climate emergency as a matter of life. \\x93Without a coherent and meaningful agreement on finance, COP27 will fall short of its mission and put millions of lives at risk,\\x94 she said. From Dent\\x92s perspective, a roadmap to track and deliver a doubling of adaptation finance is critical. COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, indicates that the continent requires 7 to 15 billion US dollars annually to enhance adaptation to climate change besides the nearly 3 trillion dollars investment that is needed to implement nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and cap emissions in line with the Paris climate deal.

Presidential envoy HYPERLINK http://www.upi.com/topic/John_Kerry/ John Kerry urged some of the worst contributors to pollution to take action Thursday to address the effects of climate change, particularly in Africa. Kerry met with Bronwen HYPERLINK http://www.upi.com/topic/Maddox/ Maddox , chief executive of the British international affairs think tank Chatham House, ahead of the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference . During the meeting, Kerry highlighted the disproportionate impact climate change has on African nations. "Seventeen out of 20 countries in the world most impacted by the climate crisis are in Africa. Yet, Africa as a whole is only 2.5-3% of all the emissions in the world," Kerry said. "They're not causing this problem." "How do we develop the developing world?" Kerry asked. "We've been falling short grossly. We have to help these countries be able to jumpstart." Maddox asked Kerry for thoughts were on providing developing countries with loss and damages funding. This subject is expected to be discussed further at COP27 , taking place Nov. 6-18 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The funding means industrialized nations would pay developing nations for the impact climate change has on their country. Many of these countries lack the resources to counter those effects adequately. "We need to help them with a lot of aspects of their challenge right now, including some of the damage," Kerry said. "If it becomes just sort of liability and compensation -- that's not going to advance the dialogue. The dialogue has to advance around finding ways to address damages. We have to put more into adaptation -- development." Kerry said 65% of the world is on board with some type of coordinated mitigation efforts. Some of the largest countries that make up the other 35% include Russia, China, Indonesia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and South Africa. "If we can move those countries, we have a chance," he said. " It's a multilateral, global threat to the planet itself. I believe it needs every voice on the planet to come together to find a way forward." \</doc>

November 11, 2022 2:48 AM U.S. President Joe Biden is attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP 27 , in Egypt, on Friday. He is expected to talk about what the United States has done to fight climate challenges, at home and abroad. However, he will likely find that some delegates at the conference are not interested in what the U.S. has done. Instead, many are more interested in what wealthy countries can do immediately for countries that have been stricken with environmental disasters. For example, Pakistan wants immediate compensation for the climate-fueled floods that have overwhelmed the country and caused tens of billions of dollars of damage this year. "The dystopia has already come to our doorstep," Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's climate minister, told Reuters. In 2015, 196 parties signed the Paris Agreement, a legally binding treaty that, among other things, committed wealthy nations to provide $100 billion a year to help developing nations deal with loss and damage from climate change. Tracking of contributions by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that countries have fallen short of this goal. Environmental campaigners say wealthy nations need to focus on meeting their $100 billion pledge to cover losses and damage from climate change. Meanwhile, Pakistan's foreign minister, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, has devised a novel plan for paying for what countries need for their climate change costs. "We can envision a scenario where developed countries," Zardari said, "the debt that we owe developed countries, instead of transferring that into the bank accounts of richer countries, we could spend that directly on greener reconstruction, rehabilitation, on our energy transition, on adaptation, on mitigation, on our loss and damage. And the developed countries, without having to transfer hard cash, will be able to say that they're meeting their commitments on that front." Biden heads to a pair of international summits in East Asia after his departure from the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh Friday. \</doc>

The following information was released by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO): (As delivered) Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, Chairman of the Munich Security Conference: Thank you very much for being with us here. We know you have limited time, we really appreciate that you spend this time with us. Can I ask you at the beginning: just a few months ago, NATO adopted its new strategic concept. And there it is: NATO commitment concluded that it will be the leading international organization when it comes to understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on security. If I can ask you before we zoom in more on the region on Middle East and Africa, how are you succeeding in implementing this commitment? Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Thank you very much for inviting me to this event and many thanks to the Munich Security Conference, to the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany for co-hosting the event, and to you, Ambassador Heusgen, Christoph, because for me it is an honour to be part of a COP again. As the first ever Secretary General of NATO, I participated at the Conference of the Parties - the COP - in Glasgow last year and even though it's only virtual, it's good to be back at the COP this time. My understanding is that your question about whether we are or to what extent we're able to follow up what we agreed in the strategic concept that was agreed at the NATO Summit in June of this year, and where we actually make climate change an issue for NATO for the first time. We have to realize that in the strategic concept that was abandoned until we updated or made a new one in June, climate change is not mentioned. Then we have realized over the last couple of years that climate change of course, it's something that NATO has to address. And there are 3 things that NATO has to do. One is to fully understand the link between climate change and security. Climate change Impacts security. Climate change is a crisis multiplier. It increases competition over scarce resources, water, food, land. It forces millions of people to flee. So, climate change creates conflict. It exacerbate conflicts. And since climate change matters for security, climate change matters for NATO. We need to fully understand that link because we need to understand the different threats we are faced with. So we are building off our capacity when it comes to analyse, understand and assess the link between climate change [...] conflict and security. The second thing, which matters for NATO is that, of course, climate change, more extreme weather, windier, wilder, wetter weather matters for military operations. We have a training mission in Iraq and they have experienced more than 50 degrees Celsius. Our equipment, our uniforms, how to adapt to more extreme weather - we have the melting of the ice in the Arctic - matters for the strategic importance of the Arctic. Increased sea levels matters all over naval bases. So we just had to adapt our operations or missions, our equipment, our uniforms to climate change, to more extreme weather. And we are in the process of doing that by incorporating climate change in our military planning, our capability targets and everything we do. And thirdly, of course, our armed forces have to be part of the efforts to reduce emissions. If you look at what's as a traditional military equipment, heavy battle tanks, battleships, planes, they are not normally very green. They emit a lot. So we need to find a way to reduce military missions. I attended my first COP in 1997 in Kyoto and there I remember that military emission was explicitly exempted from reporting on the missions from different countries. So they were exempted from the whole equation. Now military missions are part of what is counted, but the data is not good. So we are now, we have launched a project in NATO to standardize how we report on emissions from military operations because that's the first step towards reducing emissions. And I strongly believe that in the future, we need green, but also of course, effective military capabilities. But in the future, the most effective military capabilities will be the green and environmentally friendly ones. So that's the three things we need to do and are doing at NATO: understand the link between climate change and security; adapt our military missions and operations to more extreme weather; and, thirdly, reduce military emissions starting by mapping military missions in a much, much better way than we do today. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen: Thank you very much for this. I think that's very important that NATO so to speak, from 1997 to today, has been mainstreaming in the efforts to see how we can reduce climate change. And I think it's very important that that also comes from Brussels to all NATO members. Now, Secretary General, you spent time on this issue, but you spent most of the time now on Russia. Its aggression against Ukraine. What are, again in the context of what we have been discussing, from your perspective, what are the global implications of Russia's war against Ukraine, in particular for food and energy security? How does it impact the fight against climate change and the path to net zero? Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: The war in Ukraine is a brutal war of aggression launched by President Putin against the independent sovereign democratic nation. It's a blatant violation of territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. And it causes bloodshed, suffering, death, killing of civilians every day in Ukraine. Therefore, the war has to end because it causes so much suffering for Ukrainians. But, on top of that, the war in Ukraine has global ramifications. It has triggered a global food crisis, a spike in food prices and global energy crisis. Because we have to understand that it's not the sanctions imposed by the European Union, by NATO Allies, by the United States, that has caused a spike in energy prices. That is the more, it is the fact that because there are no sanctions against food, no sanctions against the export of grain from Ukraine. So what has caused this food and energy crisis is the war itself. And that's a deliberate war by President Putin. He has deliberately weaponized energy food in this attempt to crush, to take control over Ukraine. It has caused a lot of damage for the most vulnerable people in the world because they have to pay a high price for energy and high price for the food than before the war. Then I am glad, I'm glad that we have the United Nations, Turkey, a NATO ally, and an international community that has been able to negotiate, to agree the grain deal that has enabled export of grain out of Ukraine to at least reduce the pressure in the global food market. I just visited this weekend Istanbul. I actually saw the main ships sailing through the Bosporus Strait. I spoke with President Erdogan and, of course, I also praised him for the efforts of Turkey to facilitate the grain deal. And we continue to call on Russia to respect the grain deal and also to be willing to extend the grain deal because the war is catastrophic for the people of Ukraine to suffer every day. But the war in Ukraine has also global ramifications caused not by the sanctions, but by the war. The best way of addressing this is for President Putin to end the war, to stop fighting and respect Ukraine. Then we'll see more food exports, we'll see more energy exports and that would be the best way to also alleviate or to address the ramifications of war. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen: this is, of course, a topic that is also been discussed here in Sharm El Sheikh. What is your prediction. How long will this war last? Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Wars are by nature unpredictable. And, therefore, I will be very careful about predicting how long it will last. But I strongly believe that NATO Allies, partners around the world, we must continue to provide support to Ukraine. Because if President Putin wins, if Russia wins in Ukraine, that will send the message to President Putin, but also to other authoritarian leaders, that they can get their way, that they can achieve their goals by using brutal military force. Of course, as most wars, this war will, at some stage, most likely end at the negotiating table. But you know that what happens around the negotiating table is fundamentally linked to the situation on the battlefield. And the only way for Ukraine to achieve a result around in those negotiations that will most likely happen at some stage, which is acceptable for them, and which ensures that Ukraine can prevail as a sovereign independent nation, is that they have the strength on the battlefield that enables an acceptable outcome at the negotiating table. So we need to support Ukraine, to strengthen their hand in what most likely at some stage come, the negotiations to end the war. The last thing I will say is that we have to remember this is a war of aggression. One country, Russia, attacking another country. So the best, if President Putin and Russia stop the fight, then we will have peace. If President Zelensky and Ukraine stop the fight, then Ukraine will cease to exist as an independent nation. So this is the difference between an aggressor and the victim of aggression. We support Ukraine and the right for self-defence, the right actually enshrined in the UN Charter. So if President Putin will stop the war that will be good for Ukraine. It will be good for our security, and it will be good for global food and energy prices. And that makes it just even more important for him to stop the war. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen: Well, thank you very much for this important statement and let me dwell on that one more time. When you talk to people in Africa or Latin America, Asia that really are suffering now, from what you have mentioned, the rising energy prices and food prices. They say, well, this war has to come to an end. Can there be a ceasefire? Can there be now negotiations and put pressure on both sides to stop the war? And you have just been explaining what that would mean for Ukraine but I get the feeling that many people in the global South say, well, you know, when we have conflicts, of course, we get pressured to have a ceasefire to stop and here now we are saying no, this has to go on. I think we have to do a lot of explaining there and I would like to give you this opportunity again. Why it is not a simple solution that you just say okay, now we will stop and have a ceasefire? Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Because if the Ukrainians give in to the Russian demands and accept that Russia can just move in, invade that Ukraine and then take that away, then there is a risk that that will not only encourage them to attack and then they achieve more and more of after every invasion. We have to remember that this war did not start in February 2022, it started in 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Crimea and took control over the eastern part of Ukraine, and now they attacked again and launched a full-scale invasion in February. And if then, the Russia [inaudible] that's a catastrophe for Ukraine. But it's also dangerous for all of us, because it then sends the message that the use of brutal force is the way to achieve political goals, to take control over a neighbouring country. We also have to remember that at the start of war, Russia stated ambitions not only regarding Ukraine, but also regarding NATO Allies. They wanted to prevent Finland and Sweden from becoming NATO members as then actually be invited to become. They wanted NATO to remove all its forces from the eastern part of Alliance, to introduce some kind of second-class membership of this Alliance. And of course, that's not acceptable. So, the main problem is that Russia wants to establish a system, a sphere of influence, where they can decide what neighbours can do or not do. And that is a more dangerous world. That's reason why it's enshrined in the UN Charter, and every country has a right to self-defence. Ukraine is defending themselves. NATO, NATO Allies are not part to the conflict, but we support Ukraine in upholding the UN enshrined right for self-defence. That is what we are doing. And again, as I said, everyone wants this war to end. But if Ukraine stopped the fight, they will cease to exist as an independent nation. If Russia stops, we will have peace. Then, the global ramifications, they are posed by the fact that Russia blocked ports, Ukrainian ports, for many months. They stole grain, they stole ships, and they have made it very hard to export critical commodities. And this has caused global ramifications, consequences for food and energy prices, which factors then for the global south. So yes, we should end the war and the best and easiest way to do that is for President Putin to respect the sovereignty over a neighbour, Ukraine. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen: Thank you. Thank you very much for this explanation. Now. We have about eight more minutes and this is a chance for you to ask a question to ask the Secretary General of NATO question. who is ready to do that? We have the microphone right here in the middle. Please, you just have to stand up and we put the mic right next to you and introduce yourself please Sir. Question: Thank you so much, Mister Secretary and Moderator. My name is [inaudible], I work for a Swiss energy. And of course, my question goes into the energy security and the security topic...Perhaps it would put some risk perspective of how does this impact energy security as well going forward and what would be the key priorities of trying to address this topic as well? Thank you. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Well, I strongly believe that what we have seen in Ukraine and Russia's attempts, or the use of energy as a weapon against NATO Allies and other countries, is a stark reminder of the need to transition from dependence on fossil fuels to renewables because that will make us less dependent on Russian gas and Russian oil. And that's exactly also why I strongly believe that actually, the more we can be able to help NATO Allies and countries all around the world to go from fossil fuels to renewables, that will be good for our security, but it also be good for climate change and our efforts to mitigate climate change. So the good news is that there is a kind of common interest, both our security interests but those who are interested in fighting global warming climate change, to be less dependent on fossil fuels, especially from Russia. That's exactly what we are addressing in NATO ,how to help them facilitate support that transition. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen: Thank you very much. There is a second question. Question: Thank you very much Secretary General for speaking today. Last year, NATO released its climate action plan. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen: sorry, could you introduce yourself. Question: I am [inaudible] with our Canadian delegation. I was wondering if you could speak more about the specific targets that NATO has released its climate action plan last year. I'm wondering if you can specify what the targets are for 2030. I'm also wondering if NATO was tracking the climate and environmental impacts of the weapons being sent to Ukraine and finally, on climate financing, NATO members have increased their military spending. Two, it's approximately $1.2 trillion. It's over $200 billion annually, but we are struggling to find money for climate financing for loss and damage for adaptation. I'm wondering about the possibility of reducing military spending and then investing in developing countries and in their climate challenges. Thanks. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: First of all, on defence spending. I fully understand that it is hard for NATO Allies to meet the NATO guidelines on spending more on defence - 2% of GDP. And I was Minister of Finance. I was a minister, Prime Minister Norway for 10 years. And at least in the beginning of that period, we, as most NATO Allies, actually all of NATO Allies, we reduced defence spending because tensions went down. We lived in a more peaceful and secure world after the Cold War. But then the brutal reality is that we live now in a more dangerous world. We live now in a world where we see especially Russia using military force against its neighbours. We saw it in Georgia in 2008. They have forces in Moldova without the consent of the government in Moldova. Then they used to military force against Ukraine in 2014. And now again, full-fledged invasion in this winter. So all of that has just regrettably made the world more dangerous. And when we reduce defence spending when tensions are going down, we need to increase defence spending when tensions are going up. I regret that because I fully understand that there are many other aims or purposes that politicians like to spend money on like climate change, support for developing countries, education and many other purposes. But, if we don't have peace, if we don't have security, then we'll fail with all the other tasks that lie ahead of us. So a precondition to be able to address climate change is that we preserve peace. And that's reason why we also need to invest. Because we have seen for instance, that the only way to support Ukraine is actually also to provide them with military support. We are now, what we have done so far is to dig into our own stocks of ammunitions and weapons but then we need to replenish those stocks that has a price tag. And therefore, I regret to say that there is a need to invest more in defence. Again, if we saw a less aggressive Russia then the need would have been not so big to invest so much in defence as we now have to do. Without peace, we will not be able to address development issues or climate change issues. Let me also just, since you are from Canada, congratulate Canada and commend Canada for now establishing a centre of excellence on climate change that will actually enhance our understanding, as we work together as allies in addressing the security consequences of climate change. Then, our concrete target we have agreed is to cut emissions from NATO bodies and commands by at least 45% by 2030. And towards net zero by 2050. We have to do this many different ways. Some have expressed some scepticism that can we have effective green battle tanks and I strongly believe in the future the most effective military capabilities will be environmentally friendly. I don't think that NATO can remain a kind of fossil fuel Alliance in a world of renewables. When you see the civilian sector developing more and more advanced modern engines, electric cars, electric vehicles, which are green and effective. I'm absolutely certain that in the future there will be no contradiction between green and effective, the most effective military capabilities will also be green. And NATO has to be part of that technological revolution. That's also reason why we are investing in technology as part of our climate adaptation. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen: Thank you very much. A last very short question. Go ahead. Question: Thank you. Moderator. Thank you, General Secretary. My name is [inaudible] from Berlin here I'm representing the ACT Alliance, a faith-based organization of more than 150 churches and church-based organizations and humanitarian aid. I have been climate justice ambassador since quite some time. The human security or people security has been very high on the agenda of the UN for the very important aspect of this concept. Already in 2008 or something, the climate change was made a very important part of the concept of human security, people's security. I'm wondering I'd like to ask you, whether and how people security, as part of or linked to climate security is part of the strategy when you try to address climate change in all your operations and all your missions. So what role would then there be for the concept of people's security? Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: climate change affects human security, people's security, every day. We see that with the droughts, with the flooding, the extreme consequences that is caused by climate change and that's in the discussions in Sharm El Sheikh, as we all can read. Event those who are not attending the conference as I, we, of course, we read reports and we see that this is the main topic of the conference. And that's the other reason why I think the meeting in Sharm El Sheikh is so important. For NATO, there is the link between climate change and security. As I just stressed, it's that climate change is a crisis multiplier. The effects on security matters for NATO. Human security is violated every day. Weather is warmer than ever. We see now in Europe that human security is violated every day in Ukraine. The best way to prevent that is to preserve peace and NATO's core and main task is to prevent war, preserve peace. Our task is not to provoke conflict, but it's actually prevent the conflict. We do that by standing together, protecting each other and for more than 70 years that has preserved peace in Europe. For those Allies who are, for those countries who are NATO allies. Ukraine is not the NATO Ally but Ukraine is a close partner, and therefore we support Ukraine [inaudible] to stop a meaningless suffering bloodshed that is caused by the war of aggression by President Ambassador Christophe Heusgen: Thank you. Thank you very much, Secretary General and thank you so much for spending time with us. Sorry for the technical troubles at the very beginning. We hope to see you in February at the Munich Security Conference, this time in person. Again, thank you very much for being with us. Thank you so much. \</doc>

(TNSres) -- Queen Mary University of London issued the following news:    Eight representatives from Queen Mary University of London attended the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt, helping to advance the implementation of effective climate change policies.    COP27 , held from 6 to 18 November, saw around 90 world leaders, ministers, and negotiators, along with climate activists, mayors, civil society representatives and CEOs seek to accelerate global climate action through emissions reduction, scaled-up adaptation efforts and enhanced flows of appropriate finance. Queen Mary was one of only a small number of UK universities awarded passes to the Blue Zone, the point at which a badge is required to enter, at COP27 . COP27 representatives included the following academics, with some writing insightful and engaging blogs about their experience and impressions of this global event:  Franziska Arnold-Dwyer, Lecturer in Insurance Law and Deputy Director of the Insurance, Shipping & Aviation Law Institute at the Centre for Commercial Law Studies.  Fernando Barrio, Senior Lecturer in Business Law and Director of International Engagement for the School of Business and Management. His blog Tackling the climate crisis beyond COP asserts that outputs and results are far from what the world expects and what the planet needs.  Professor Chris Griffiths, Professor of Primary Care, Wolfson Institute of Population Health. His blog Reflections on COP27 talks about COP27 as a catalyst for change and how the climate crisis won't be solved by people working in silos, scattered across the globe.  Professor Laleh Khalili, Professor of International Politics. Her blog The Many Contradictions and Unspoken Issues of COP27 examines the myriad politics of the conference.  Teidor Lyngdoh, Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Marketing, School of Business and Management. His blog On the ground at COP27 : Championing Indigenous Peoples looks at COP27 's unique opportunity to discuss the issues of scaling Indigenous and regenerative agriculture practices and food systems around the world.  Thiago Jesus, Head of Indigenous Exchange and Climate Action at People's Palace Projects (PPP).  Dr Heather McMullen, a social scientist in the Global Public Health Unit at the Centre for Public Health and Policy.  Professor Kostya Trachenko, Deputy Head of School of Physical and Chemical Sciences Centre for Condensed Matter Physics (CCMP), Professor of Physics, Director of Graduate Studies. These delegates represented a range of different schools and each of the three faculties, importantly showcasing the variety of specialisms from Queen Mary given the multidisciplinary approach needed to solve climate challenges. All delegates represented their vast array of research and built valuable connections with stakeholders and academic peers. In doing so, and lending their diverse expertise, our researchers were able to not only help shape better climate and energy practices, but also develop collaborations with those seeking to influence policy at an international level. The connections made with industry and their peers will also enable them to develop their own research interests. The first week of Queen Mary delegates was led by Dr Fernando Barrio. He spoke on a panel addressing 'The African imperatives of resilient water-energy-food systems under a changing climate' and also met with the Eswatini Climate Coalition, a grassroots collective promoting awareness, action and civic engagement around climate change in Eswatini. Dr Heather McMullen, a keynote speaker at COP26, led Queen Mary's week 2 delegates and built on her work into sexual and reproductive health and rights and its intersection with climate change and environmental sustainability. She leads on a partnership agreement between Queen Mary and the United Nations Population Fund. This year, with colleagues, she has analysed 111 climate policies and presented the findings to a global audience at COP27 . COP27 , he is currently researching how arts organisations are engaging environmental issues with their programmes and with their artists, partners, audiences, and diverse communities.

Farmers' interest will keep climate on the congressional agenda regardless of whether Republicans, who have said the issue is not a priority, win control of the House, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday. In a call from Egypt, Vilsack said U.S. commodity and farm organizations are attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference , known as COP27 "What I have been most impressed with in all of this conversation about climate is the degree to which American farmers, ranchers and producers have been supportive. I would anticipate and expect that climate will continue to be a focus not because I want it or not because any member of the House or Senate wants it, but most importantly because farmers, ranchers and producers recognize and appreciate the importance of it," Vilsack said. Glenn "GT" Thompson, House Agriculture ranking member and the likely chairman if final midterm results give Republicans the majority, said in September that a GOP farm bill would focus less on the Biden administration's climate priorities and more on retooling conservation programs to be innovative and economically useful to farmers. But Vilsack said farmers' interest in Agriculture Department initiatives such as multiyear grants from the Commodity Credit Corporation for climate-smart projects and the department's plans for using $20 billion included in the August reconciliation package (PL 117-169) for major environmental programs is high. During the call, Vilsack also said the $2.8 billion for climate-smart projects has been increased to $3.1 billion, with new projects to be announced in December. The additional money will fund 65 new projects intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions. He said side events on agriculture at COP27 reflect a heightened world interest in making food production more resilient in light of reports that a shifting climate could make raising crops and livestock more difficult because of drought, floods, increased heat and erratic weather. The side events also looked at ways agriculture can reduce emissions such as methane from livestock. Egypt is so interested in the potential climate effects on food production that it held an agriculture and adaptation day, Vilsack said. During the conference, Vilsack and John Kerry, the special presidential envoy for climate, announced a U.S. commitment of $20 million for the Agriculture Department to work with governments and local organizations worldwide to advance fertilizer efficiency and nutrient management. Brazil, Colombia, Pakistan and Vietnam will be the first round of participants. The U.S. also will provide $5 million for the Efficient Fertilizer Consortium that the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research will establish in partnership with Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate to do applied research on efficient fertilizer products and practices in collaboration with the private sector. AIM for Climate is a joint initiative of the United States and the United Arab Emirates formed in 2021. Vilsack also announced during COP27 that AIM for Climate will hold a conference in Washington on May 8-10, 2023. The coalition has grown to 42 member countries and 235 partners that include nonprofits and corporations. "There's an opportunity for us to talk about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning and what that is going to do in terms of providing additional opportunities. There's also going to be a call to action focused on the venture capital community," Vilsack said. He said investors need to pick up the pace of funding startup technology companies focused on climate and agriculture. The Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research is co-sponsoring the event with the Agriculture Department. The foundation's executive director, Saharah Moon Chapotin, said the conference will provide a "critical opportunity" to focus on research and funding. "The scope and scale of climate change requires not only ambition, but also demands unprecedented global collaboration," Chapotin said in a statement.

The following information was released by the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF): With COP27 now in full gear, we have plenty to be excited about when it comes to forest conservation. Last year's climate convening in Glasgow put nature at the center of the climate agenda. We celebrated the declaration signed by more than 100 countries in Glasgow to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. The funding promises of almost $20 billion toward forest conservation were equally groundbreaking. Despite those milestones, in the year since COP26 , the deforestation crisis has actually worsened . Deforestation in the Amazon, for example, increased by 48% over 2021. Yet there is hope. Countries and companies are realizing the importance of conserving rainforests at scale. Commitments to end deforestation, along with promises to fund and compensate forest conservation, are growing. We're also seeing more robust standards for emissions reductions credits from natural climate solutions, including forests. This all bodes well, and COP27 is an opportunity to keep the momentum going on ending deforestation. So, what can we expect in Sharm El-Sheikh when it comes to conserving forests? Here's a quick overview of the first three days' action on forests, why they're important, and what we expect to see over the rest of the conference. Keeping track of forest conservation goals Following up on the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, 25 world leaders convened on the first day of COP to hold each other accountable on their pledge to end deforestation by 2030. Known as the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership (FCLP), this group is comprised of countries that will convene each year to chart progress on their commitments to end deforestation. Accountability is key at COP. Declarations are great, but we need action to keep pace with the climate crisis. We need to end and reverse deforestation by 2030 to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and financing forest conservation is essential to achieving this. On the same day that world leaders gathered for the first FCLP meeting, the UN Environment Programme released a report showing that financial commitments needed to meet deforestation goals, known as the Green Gigaton Challenge, are way off track. The Green Gigaton Challenge aims to mobilize funding to reduce one gigaton of emissions from tropical deforestation by 2025, and a gigaton each year thereafter until 2030. The report revealed that less than a quarter of the finance needed to meet the goal has been mobilized to date. Last month, the Forest Declaration Platform released its latest progress report on the global goal of ending and reversing deforestation by 2030. It found that not one global indicator showed us to be on track toward these goals. However, the report also contained some promising signals. According to the assessment, the rate of forest degradation is decreasing globally. And some regions, like Southeast Asia, are reversing deforestation at the rate needed to meet the 2030 goal. The LEAF Coalition An important step forward for tropical forests at COP27 came from the LEAF Coalition. On Monday, November 7th, LEAF announced that it had increased financial commitments to $1.5 billion for large scale emissions reductions from tropical forests. Volkswagen Group and HandM Group joined the coalition as corporate participants while the Republic of Korea joined as a country backer. The $1.5 billion in commitments to purchase high-quality, jurisdictional-scale emissions reduction credits represents an important demand signal from the private and public sectors. The promise of LEAF is only fulfilled, of course, if tropical forest countries are able to move forward expeditiously to transact credits for tropical forest protection. So it is equally as encouraging to see that Ecuador, which is working to put into place a robust jurisdictional REDD+ plan, is the first country to sign an agreement with LEAF setting out a roadmap for the signing of an Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement by April 2023. Other forest countries and jurisdictions are expected to follow Ecuador in signing agreements with LEAF in the coming days. Importantly, LEAF's continued growth shows that governments, companies, Indigenous Peoples and civil society can and must work together to stop deforestation at the scale the world urgently needs. Forest credit integrity While LEAF's financial commitments are important, it's only a fraction of what is possible and necessary. Halting and reversing widespread deforestation will require financing at orders of magnitude higher than current commitments. A thriving voluntary carbon market can play an important role in protecting forests and putting the world on a pathway to net zero by bringing much needed funding to forest jurisdictions. But the voluntary carbon market can only thrive if it is backed by standards that ensure high integrity of emissions reductions. That's because companies will only invest in forest carbon credits to meet their net zero goals if they're confident in the credit's integrity. They don't want to risk greenwashing. Efforts to increase the quality of forest credits include the Tropical Forest Credit Integrity Guide, a collaboration among eight NGOs representing the environment and Indigenous Peoples. The Guide helps companies interested in purchasing carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market differentiate among forest carbon credits and move the market toward credits with high social and environmental integrity. The authoring organizations issued the first version of their guidance in May of this year, and at COP27 EDF and Forests at COP Throughout COP27 , you'll likely hear EDF and other environmental organizations discuss the need to support Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities, who play a critical role in conserving nature. They are the strongest frontline forest protectors, and we must ensure that they are protagonists in the design and implementation of global, national, and local efforts to conserve forests. You'll also hear about our support for jurisdictional REDD+ and its importance for the voluntary carbon market. Why is does EDF take this approach? REDD+, or Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, i s a global policy framework to provide economic incentives for forest conservation. Expanding REDD+ to the jurisdictional level (country or state) could have added benefits. In fact, when it comes to protecting tropical forests, jurisdictional REDD+ credits provide a triple win. They prevent further emissions from tropical deforestation, protect one of the world's most important carbon sinks, and preserve critical biodiversity and other ecosystem services we rely on for the global climate and economy to function. Beyond forest conservation, jurisdictional scale approaches have distinct intrinsic benefits for high environmental integrity. For example, jurisdictional scale approaches are proven to increase confidence in additionality and permanence, and reduce risks associated with additionality and non-permanence relative to project-based credits. They also uphold stringent environmental and social safeguards, and generate various social, environmental, cultural and biodiversity co-benefits. For the reasons above, it is crucial that market solutions and other finance mechanisms further incentivize and support jurisdictional REDD+ programs. The Nature Zone at COP27 EDF is co-hosting the Nature Zone Pavilion at COP27 , a space at COP that will showcase the climate and nature nexus through panel events and discussions. Check out their programming at nature4climate.org/ cop-27 -nature-zone-pavilion. And if you're attending COP, you don't want to miss these Nature Zone events: As we head into the second week of COP27 and beyond, we must stay focused on turning words into action to conserve forests. To fuel that action, the public and private sectors must increase finance to the level needed to truly scale and speed up the fight against deforestation. And Indigenous People and local communities must have a seat in the international climate table. \</doc>

The following information was released by the World Bank: The World Bank has approved a $30 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA) to enable Mali to improve agricultural productivity and strengthen the resilience of rural households living in the targeted drylands. This additional financing is made available under the Mali Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Development Project in Semi-Arid Zones (PDAZAM). These additional funds will cover the costs of an emergency response to food insecurity as well as those generated by inflationary pressures, due in part to the Ukrainian crisis and insecurity. The project activities target the poor and vulnerable, including women, young people, and internally displaced persons. "These additional resources will increase the number of households receiving direct cash transfers from about 40,000 to 193,000 households, and will help alleviate the food insecurity they face," says Clara De Sousa, World Bank Country Director for Mali. She specifies that in addition "with women playing a dominant role in subsistence farming and in the sale of processed foods in rural and urban markets, the households headed by them and women farmers will be targeted to amplify the benefits of the project." With these additional funds, PDAZAM will be able to assist a larger number of eligible recipients in the intervention area, i.e., the regions of Kayes, Koulikoro, Segou, Mopti, and elsewhere in the event of a food crisis declaration. The rapid spread of food insecurity across the country has led to the emergence of affected areas needing support. These additional funds, provided a few days after the launch of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt, address the World Bank's objectives of strengthening the production and resilience of food systems, facilitating trade, developing inclusive value chains, and supporting vulnerable households and producers. The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the world's poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people's lives. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world's 76 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. Resources from IDA bring positive change to the 1.6 billion people who live in IDA countries. Since 1960, IDA has supported development work in 113 countries. Annual commitments have averaged about $21 billion over the last three years, with about 61 percent going to Africa. \</doc>

Nov 11, 2022( Deutsche Welle Germany: HYPERLINK http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex) The 1994 Energy Charter Treaty allows utility firms to sue governments if they make changes to energy policies. Several EU states say the pact is incompatible with the urgent need to tackle climate change.Germany will pull out of the 1994 energy treaty that has been widely criticized for protecting investments in fossil fuels, a spokesperson for the government said Friday. Franziska Brantner, parliamentary state secretary at the Economy Ministry, said the decision to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) was part of the country's commitment to "consistently aligning our trade policy with climate protection." She added that the move was also an important signal to the United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , underway in Egypt. Europe's largest economy joins France, the Netherlands, Spain and Poland in withdrawing from the pact. The other countries have said the pact is incompatible with their commitments to the 2015 Paris accord to combat climate change. What is the Energy Charter Treaty? The ECT, which has more than 50 signatories including the European Union, was designed to secure energy supplies and offers protection to companies investing in the energy industry. Its focus was mostly on energy infrastructure investments in volatile ex-Soviet states in Central Asia and Eastern Europe, A key element of the treaty allows energy companies to sue governments over energy policy changes that could hurt their investments  exposing states to multi-billion-dollar compensation claims. German utility company RWE has used the ECT to start legal action against the Netherlands, alleging that the government failed to allow adequate time and resources to transition away from coal. The case may have partly motivated the Dutch decision to quit the treaty. In June, the European Union struck a compromise deal  to come into force next month if no signatories object  to revise the treaty to limit legal actions where they jeopardize climate goals. But climate groups have criticized loopholes left in the update and say it continues to put efforts to curb global warming at risk. 'Obstacle to energy transition' Green parliamentary group leader Katharina Dr\'f6ge hailed the German decision as a "milestone." "No other international trade or investment agreement in the world has triggered more investor lawsuits than the Energy Charter Treaty," she told the dpa news agency. "This pact is an obstacle to the energy transition and costs the state billions." mm/aw (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters) HYPERLINK https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-pull-out-of-fossil-fuel-treaty/a-63732431?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_germany-6123-xml-mrss Link to the original story. \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 27 -- The United Nations Economic and Social Council's Economic Commission for Africa issued the following news release: Two weeks shy of the UN conference on climate change ( COP27 Namibia's Minister for Mines and Energy Tom Alweendo who spoke on behalf of the Environment Minister, Shifeta Pohamba heaped praise on the organization of the CCDA-X which he said has become an annual event that discusses fundamental climate issues touching on Africa and resonates with the global climate agenda as envisaged in COP27 . "We believe that this conference is taking place at the right time as we a marching toward COP27 in Egypt, which is an African COP. Therefore, it is our hope that the outcomes from this conference would further solidifies the African position on COP27 ." Alweendo said. Minister Alweendo reiterated on the importance of Africa to continue pressing on the large emitters "to halve carbon emissions by 2030 in order to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as required by science. And demand its fair share on climate finance, including technology transfer and capacity building, to pursue efforts toward decarbonization and build resilience to the adverse impacts of climate change." Now in its tenth year, CCDA-X is running under the theme "Just Transitions in Africa: Transforming Dialogue into Action" and like previous summits continues to enjoy the joint working partnership of the African Union (AU), African Development Bank (AfDB) and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) who are its main organizers. Speaking on behalf of the Executive Secretary of the ECA, Jean Paul Adam, who is Director of the Technology Climate Change and Natural Resources Division said that "Climate resilience and just transitions are about rethinking development for our continent... Let me re-affirm that to be truly just, the transition must be people-centred, inclusive, and equitable, leaving no one behind. There can be no net-zero by 2050 without universal access to energy by 2030." Adam said. According to Adam, Africa has considerable renewable energy resources which can "be harnessed to accelerate the push for industrialization, create green employment and contribute significantly to global climate action." COP27 which participants are deliberating upon before final outcome document on Friday. The issues outlined by Wanambwa included just transition, loss and damage financing facility, adaptation finance, Africa's special needs and circumstances, technology transfer, among others. James Kinyangi, the coordinator of Climate and Development Special Funds at the African Development Bank urged the continent to lay more emphasis on climate financing as a top agenda item for COP27 negotiations. Kinyangi enumerated estimates by the AfDB on the major climate financing gaps experienced by the continent indicating that the continent is in dire need of between $7billion to $15billion billion to shore up its adaptation capacities and enhance resilience. Ulla Andrienne of the Swedish aid agency SIDA, who are among the key international partners supporting CCDA-X called for more focus on emerging opportunities and solutions as keystone attributes to facilitate sustainable climate action. The civil society perspective for the conference was shared by Mithika Mwenda the Executive Director of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) who called for climate action on loss and damage and made a passionate plea for inclusion of youth in the continental and global climate processes. The conference closes Friday and Namibia has been tasked to present the outcomes during the Africa Day at the COP27 on November 8th at the African Pavilion.

(TNSres) -- The American University in Cairo issued the following news release: The American University in Cairo (AUC) joins the Race to Zero campaign, a UN-backed global initiative aimed at achieving a zero-carbon world. AUC has pledged to halving its emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. "Race to Zero aims to rally leadership and support from colleges and universities across the globe for a healthy, resilient, zero-carbon recovery that prevents future threats, creates decent jobs and unlocks inclusive, sustainable growth," says Yasmin Mansour, AUC's sustainability director. With AUC's Climate Change Initiative ramping up ahead of Egypt hosting the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), joining the campaign was a no-brainer, according to Khaled Tarabieh, University architect and associate professor in the Department of Architecture. "AUC is always looking for opportunities to join models of excellence and best practices," he said. "In line with our preparations for COP27 , we believe our participation would situate us perfectly and align well with our work." AUC will now set up an action plan with short-term goals. The University will focus on improving areas such as energy use, transportation, solid waste disposal and campus design - drawing from recommendations made in its biennial Carbon Footprint Report ( HYPERLINK https://documents.aucegypt.edu/Docs/about_sustainability/Carbon%20Footprint%202021%20Sixth%20Edition_web.pdf https://documents.aucegypt.edu/Docs/about_sustainability/Carbon%20Footprint%202021%20Sixth%20Edition_web.pdf ). "Curbing our emissions on campus is a primary operational goal and key for our mitigation of climate change challenges," Tarabieh said. "We have so far reduced our carbon footprint by 35% using a smarter set of operational strategies since we started looking at our emissions 10 years ago." Moving forward, AUC is committed to furthering reductions, institutionalizing sustainability in both operations and curricula, optimizing the performance of our existing buildings, and planning for greener buildings with minimum environmental load and emissions. "As a leader of sustainability in the MENA region, we hope AUC's commitment to the Race to Zero campaign encourages other institutions to join us in taking meaningful action towards reducing our carbon emissions in the face of climate change," says Mansour. Net zero refers to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as closely as feasible to zero, with any leftover emissions being reabsorbed from the atmosphere. At AUC, this means reducing energy usage and air travel and rethinking waste disposal. "Climate change is one of the most significant environmental challenges facing humankind," adds Mansour. "Universities play a vital role in helping to solve the climate crisis. Higher education does this through research, community engagement, student activity and sustainable operations." With this move, AUC is joining what Mansour described as "a well-established international alliance" that includes more than 1,000 educational institutions including Goldsmiths University of London, University of Cambridge, Stockholm University and Concordia University and represented by over 10 million students worldwide in the race for a healthier, fairer, and cleaner world.

Nov 16, 2022( DeSmogBlog: HYPERLINK http://desmogblog.com http://desmogblog.com Eighteen of the 20 companies sponsoring[1] U.N. climate talks in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh either directly support or partner with oil and gas companies, according to a new analysis shared with DeSmog. COP27 , which have become a focal point for deals to exploit African natural gas[2]. 'These findings underline the extent to which this COP has never been about the climate: It's been about rehabilitating the gas industry and making sure that fossil fuels are on the agenda,' said Pascoe Sabido of Brussels-based Corporate Europe Observatory, which co-produced the analysis with Corporate Accountability, a nonprofit headquartered in Boston. 'These talks are supposed to be about moving us away from fossil fuels, phasing them out,' Sabido told DeSmog. A previous analysis[3] by the two organisations and research and advocacy group Global Witness identified at least 636 fossil lobbyists who have been granted access to COP27 - an increase of more than 25 percent compared to the previous COP26 talks held in Glasgow a year ago; and twice the number of delegates from a U.N. body representing indigenous peoples. 'This is part of the bigger problem which is linked to the overall corporate capture of the U.N. climate talks,' Sabido said. 'We need to kick big polluters out.' Social license As documented in the latest edition of DeSmog's Gaslit[4] column, fossil fuel sponsorship of COP27 represents an extension of a decades-long effort by oil and gas companies to buy social legitimacy by bankrolling sports, arts, and education around the world. COP27 partner Hassan Allam Holding[4], one of the largest privately owned corporations in Egypt, has announced plans to invest $17.1 billion to turn North Africa into a regional natural gas hub, and $830 million in oil projects over the next two years, the analysis found. Sponsors also include Cairo-based Afreximbank, which plans to finance new oil and gas projects through the creation of a multi-billion dollar 'energy bank', and Mashreq, the oldest private bank in the United Arab Emirates, which refinances oil and gas projects. Microsoft, which uses cloud-based artificial intelligence to help companies such as Chevron optimize oil and gas extraction, is a partner at COP27 , along with rival Google. Google says it has cracked down on climate misinformation on its platforms. But the company is still taking money from oil and gas companies to placeadverts in search resultsthat present their industry as environmentally friendly, a report[5] found. German engineering company Siemens, another COP27 sponsor, services firms such as Cairo-based Orascom Construction, which built one of the world's biggest gas power plants in Egypt in 2018. IBM, also a sponsor, works with pesticide and fertiliser companies[6] to promote 'carbon farming' - a carbon offsetting[7] technique that generates carbon credits for storing carbon in soils. Many climate groups believe such practices will provide an excuse for big companies to continue polluting. Conflict of interest The predominance of fossil fuel sponsorship at COP27 cuts a stark contrast with demands from countries facing an existential threat from climate change for urgent action to cut emissions. Advocates of the campaign for such a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty[8], including a growing number of cities and municipalities, also want to ban fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship. 'We've got numerous countries calling for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty and yet COP27 is sponsored by the same companies either directly funding them [fossil fuels], facilitating the extraction of oil and gas, or using their products,' Sabido said. The Boston Consulting Group, an American consulting firm and one of the main COP27 partners, works with Anglo-Dutch oil major Shell. COP27 lead partner Coca-Cola, which relies on plastic bottles derived from hydrocarbons, was named the world's top plastic polluter for five years in a row by the Break Free From Plastic movement in its annual brand audit. The oil industry is banking on expanding production of plastics and other petrochemicals for its future growth. Only two out of the 20 COP27 sponsors, renewable energy provider Infinity Power and real estate developer Sodic, have no strong ties to the fossil fuel industry, the analysis found. Corporate Europe Observatory and Corporate Accountability are calling for the U.N. body that organises the annual climate negotiations to adopt a conflict of interest policy that would exclude fossil fuel companies and their partners from attending or sponsoring the events. More than 450 organizations have already supported a campaign to Kick Big Polluters Out [9]of COP27 'What we need to do is end big polluter sponsorships of the talks, they shouldn't be allowed to bankroll this process,' Sabido said. 'They shouldn't be allowed to greenwash their image through their presence at COPs.' The post Fossil Fuel-Linked Companies Dominate Sponsorship of COP27 [10] appeared first on DeSmog[11].

The renowned British general health journal's document lists the wide range of interlinked issues triggered by climate change and urges countries participating in the world climate conference in November to walk the talk. The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , designated as COP27 , will be held from November 6 to 18 at Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt. Ahead of that, the noted British general medical journal Lancet has issued a document stating the multifarious and serious issues created by climate change and how the world has to walk the talk on mitigating its ill effects. Among ordinary folk, climate change triggers images of devastating floods, depressing droughts, cyclones, forest fires and other climactic natural disasters. But Lancet makes the point that climate change has deep and multifarious effects on people's lives across the globe though not always instantly and dramatically. Here are some key points from the document: The year 2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the signing of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). But little meaningful action has followed its adoption. The carbon intensity of the global energy system has decreased by less than 1% since the UNFCCC was established. Global electricity generation is still dominated by fossil fuels, with renewable energy contributing only 8\'b72% to the global total. The current strategies of 15 of the largest oil and gas companies would lead to production exceeding levels needed to limit the global average surface temperature rise to 1\'b75\'b0C by 37% in 2030, and 103% in 2040. Therefore, emissions from the oil and gas sector need to be reduced drastically to enable a healthy future. The total global energy demand has risen by 59%. The resultant increase in energy-related emissions was a historical high in 2021. But current policies have put the world on track to a catastrophic 2\'b77\'b0C increase by the end of the century. Advertisement Even if countries implement the commitments that they gave in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), global emissions could be 13\'b77% above 2010 levels by 2030. This will be a far cry from the 43% decrease from current levels required to meet Paris Agreement goals. The global fossil fuel market is volatile, and during supply disruptions, millions across the world do not get access to the energy needed to keep their homes at healthy temperatures and preserve food and medicines. Even in normal times, 59% of healthcare facilities in low and middle-income countries do not have access to reliable electricity. The day when renewable sources will be a major player is still a far cry. In 2020, only 1\'b74% of electricity came from modern renewables (mostly from wind and solar power). In most under-developed countries, the main source of domestic energy is biomass, which is unhealthy. Biomass accounts for as much as 31% of the energy consumed in the domestic sector globally. In low-income countries, the dependence on biomass is as high as 96%. As is well known, biomass creates illnesses of various kinds, such as chronic bronchitis, respiratory issues, and lung infections. It is well known that climate change creates floods, droughts and heatwaves. Rapidly increasing temperatures exposed people to 3\'b77 billion more "heatwave days" in 2021 than between 1986 and 2005 annually. Heat-related deaths increased by 68% between 2000-04 and 2017-21. Of course, the death toll had been significantly increased by the COVID-19 pandemic. Heat exposure led to 470 billion "labor hours" lost globally in 2021. Potential income losses were equivalent to 0\'b772% of the global economic output. The figure went up to 5\'b76% of the GDP in low Human Development Index (HDI) countries. Extreme heat was associated with 98 million more people reporting moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020 than annually in 1981-2010 in the 103 countries analyzed. The changing climate is affecting the spread of infectious diseases. Coastal waters are becoming more suitable for the transmission of Vibrio pathogens which are bacteria that can cause foodborne infection. The number of months suitable for malaria transmission increased by 31\'b73% in the highland areas of the Americas and 13\'b78% in the highland areas of Africa from 1951-60 to 2012-21. The likelihood of dengue transmission rose by 12% in the same period. Between 2014-21 and 1982-89, because of changes in sea-salt concentrations and temperatures, coastlines suitable for Vibrio pathogens increased from 47\'b75% to 86\'b73% in the Baltic; from 30\'b70% to 57\'b71% in the US northeast; and from 1\'b72% to 5\'b77% in the Pacific Northwest. These are three regions where Vibriosis is regularly reported. The ongoing seventh cholera pandemic, which started in the 1960s, is responsible for more than 2\'b78 million cholera cases and 95,000 deaths annually. Although inadequate sanitation is a leading cause, climate conditions are increasingly favoring the survival of Vibrio cholerae in natural waters. Non-cholera Vibrio bacteria survive in brackish waters. These can cause gastroenteritis, if they enter the body though food. Potentially, lethal wound infections could take place if direct contact is made with contaminated water. Extreme weather caused damage to the tune of over US$ 253 billion in 2021, particularly burdening people in low HDI countries. Higher temperatures threatened crop yields directly, with the "growth seasons" of maize becoming shorter by nine days in 2020, and the growth seasons of winter wheat and spring wheat becoming shorter by six days as compared to the period 1981-2010. The threat to crop yields adds to food insecurity across the globe. Improvements in air quality would help to prevent 1\'b72 million deaths resulting from exposure to fossil fuel-derived ambient PM2\'b75. PM2.5 are tiny particles in the air that affect people's health when their levels in the air are high. Red meat and milk contribute to 55% of global agriculture emissions. Per capita emissions from red meat and dairy consumption are very high in HDI countries. In 2019, 11\'b75 million deaths were attributable to imbalanced diets, with 17% associated with a high intake of red and processed meat and dairy products. Therefore, an accelerated transition to a balanced and more plant-based diets would not only help reduce agricultural sector emissions coming from red meat and milk production but also prevent up to 11\'b75 million diet-related deaths annually. It will also substantially reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases. Increases in palm oil production account for some of the greatest changes since 2000. Emissions by the palm oil sector in southeast Asia (mainly Indonesia) increased by over 600%. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. Signs of change are emerging in the energy sector. Zero-carbon sources accounted for 80% of investment in electricity generation in 2021 Renewable energies have reached cost parity with fossil fuel energies. As some of the highest emitting countries attempt to cut their dependence on oil and gas in response to the war in Ukraine and soaring oil and gas prices, many countries are focusing on increasing renewable energy generation, raising hopes for a health-centered response to climate change challenges. There is an increase in awareness of the ill effects of climate change. But commitments made in terms of spending and execution should be translated into action urgently, so that hope turns into reality, the Lancet document said. \</doc>

Nov 23, 2022( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com http://www.jdsupra.com While many headlines tout the news that on Saturday (in talks that were supposed to end Friday) nation delegates at COP27 agreed to an historic 'loss and damage' fund for climate impact in developing countries, the fund is far from final. Wealthy countries had long blocked the idea of such a fund. Finally achieving agreement on such a fund is a milestone and, as a nod to such reluctance, the agreement reached at COP27 states nations cannot be held legally liable for payments. However, many issues remain open - the fund must be set up and filled with cash. It is likely will be several years before the fund exists, with the COP27 agreement setting out only a roadmap for resolving lingering questions including who would oversee the fund, how the money would be dispersed - and to whom. Still, major hurdles remain. The United States and the European Union are pushing for assurances that China will eventually contribute to any fund created  and that China would not be eligible to receive money from it. The United Nations currently classifies China as a developing country, which would make it eligible for climate compensation, even though it is now the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases as well as the second-largest economy. China has fiercely resisted being treated as a developed nation in global climate talks.

The following information was released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO): Across Europe, parts of Asia, the Americas, Africa and Australia, record-breaking droughts have created huge water shortages. This has, in turn, affected food and energy production, sanitation and the economy. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that at least 36.1 million people were affected by severe drought in the Horn of Africa in October 2022. Other parts of the world have experienced extensive flooding, as in Pakistan. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has described the flooding in Pakistan as being the most severe in the country's recent history. Flooding has left 10 million children in need of immediate, lifesaving support and at a heightened risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition. Climate change is also accelerating glacier melt, threatening freshwater supplies and augmenting the risk of natural hazards. In a recently released report, UNESCO has warned that, unless global temperature rise is kept below 1.5C relative to pre-industrial levels, all of the planet's glaciers may melt. Were this to happen, half of humanity would face water shortages. It is against the backdrop of these current hydro-climatic challenges that UNESCO's Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme (IHP) is taking part in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change ( COP27 ) in Egypt, bearing a message to the world. "Water is the connector. Linking mankind to all of nature, contributing to global growth and climate action. It is time to move from planning to action. This has to include: How to finance and scale up tools, The importance of early warning systems, The emergence and important role of citizen science The use of indigenous knowledge to complement "hard" science, Using all these (above) to adapt to a climate that is increasingly unpredictable". This message is being shared via several events organized by IHP at the UNESCO and Water Pavilions at the COP 27in Egypt, from 9 to 16 November. \</doc>

The following information was released by the SnowSports Industries America (SIA): Happy December, winter is here! The last couple of weeks have been very busy on the climate front, so I thought I'd provide a quick recap of COP27 , the annual global climate conference that took place in Egypt in November. As you may remember, back in 2015 at COP21, 196 countries agreed to The Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty and a global commitment to address the climate crisis. Countries now convene annually to assess progress and negotiate the many challenges in the way of accelerating progress at scale. This year in Egypt at COP27 , 200 counties came together to continue the work outlined in Paris and there were some important wins, but overall, negotiations inched along when we really needed a massive shift. First, the good news: World leaders agreed to create a fund that would help poor, vulnerable countries pay for climate impacts. This was a huge accomplishment and a breakthrough on one of the most contentious issues at past United Nations climate negotiations. For more than three decades, developing nations have pressed rich, industrialized countries to provide for the costs of destructive storms, heat waves and droughts linked to rising temperatures so this goes a long way towards truly global engagement. Unfortunately, the climate summit did little to advance the root causes of global warming. Most notably, over 80 countries wanted more specific commitments to phase down all fossil fuels (not just coal, but more oil and gas) which was blocked by oil-rich countries such as Canada, Saudi Arabia and China. Once again, progress was stonewalled by some of the world's largest carbon emissions producers. It's vitally important for all nations to slash their emissions much more rapidly now, but this year's commitments did not go much beyond what countries agreed to last year. It's beyond maddening that we inch along with half measures when instead, we need the most ambitious of climate plans. We now have to keep moving forward and the winter outdoor industry is no exception. I am a firm believer that the business voice is the most powerful component of real progress on climate, and that's why SIA is part of CERES, an advocacy organization that is galvanizing the immense power of the business sector to drive a shift in climate policy. Most recently CERES led a huge effort from the business community to help get the historic Inflation Reduction Act passed. Every business in our $79 billion industry has a powerful voice and we'll give you consistent and meaningful opportunities to use it yours. Despite the shortcomings at COP27 , I know we can do this we have the business imperative, the influence, and the achievable solutions, now it's a matter of making climate part of every business strategy and truly acting urgently on it. \</doc>

Nov 12, 2022( Digital Journal: HYPERLINK http://www.digitaljournal.com http://www.digitaljournal.com French giant TotalEnergies' chief executive was confronted by climate activistsFriday at the COP27 As he was readying to join a conference, Patrick Pouyanne was confronted by a number of activists, forcing him to briefly take cover in the Guinean pavilion, an AFP correspondent reported. This was followed by a tense exchange with the activists, who criticised TotalEnergies' continued presence in Russia, its projects in east Africa and its representation at the UN climate talks. 'I have the right to be here,' Pouyanne told the activists. 'I respect you so respect me, that's all I'm asking you. 'We deliver gas to Europe because Europe is needing this gas,' said the chief executive, as the energy giant maintains its presence in its Yamal natural gas facility in Russia. British watchdog Global Witness commented on the events, saying: 'Today Mr Pouyanne was confronted by the destructive impact of his company, from Eastern Europe to East Africa. 'He is just one of more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists that have flooded these UN climate talks, a sharp increase from the previous year.' Groups including Global Witness estimate that the number of lobbyists at this year's climate summit has increased by 25 percent compared to last year's gathering in Glasgow.

The Rockefeller Foundation issued the following news release: During the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), The Rockefeller Foundation announced more than US$11 million in grants to ten organizations scaling Indigenous and regenerative agriculture practices around the world. Evidence makes clear the central role food systems can play in mitigating climate change. The funding will help scale the development, data analysis, financing, and education around regenerative agricultural practices, which can improve global food systems and mitigate the global food crisis. Regenerative agriculture, a process with roots in Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge and food systems, takes a holistic approach to production that starts with the soil and includes the health of people, animals, and the environment. Together, these grants will establish the foundation to rapidly scale regenerative approaches by 2030 from Indigenous agroforestry in the Amazon to carbon-market financing of smallholder farmers in Africa and elsewhere. "Regenerative agriculture offers a needed alternative to dominant, extractive food systems that have threatened people and planet alike," said Sara Farley, Vice President of The Rockefeller Foundation's Global Food Portfolio. "Our goal is to develop the know-how, networks and innovations needed to realize the full potential of regenerative agriculture at a moment of crises and climate change." Food systems produce about one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and agricultural expansion accounts for almost 90 percent of global deforestation. Conversely, new research finds that transitioning to more sustainable food systems could contribute about 20 percent of the global mitigation needed by 2050 to keep temperature increases below the 1.5 C target. This change could also improve the nutrition and health of 3.1 billion people who currently cannot afford a healthy diet. "Food systems impact every person on the planet and the planet itself," said Roy Steiner, Senior Vice President for the Food Initiative at the Foundation. "Continuing to rely solely on conventional approaches cannot generate the profound shifts needed to improve food systems. The integration of traditional knowledge with other scientific and technological knowledge can transform food systems to be more resilient, nutritious, and equitable." The flagship grant is to the Meridian Institute, which will expand upon the work of Regen10, a global coalition galvanized to answer the question of what it would take to produce 50 percent of the world's food in ways that benefit people, nature, and climate by 2030. This effort will directly support food producers and landscape stewards to adopt and scale regenerative practices and work collaboratively with other organizations to better define and measure the impacts of regenerative agriculture. By bridging outcomes measurement with landscape-level demonstrations, Regen10 will support landscape leaders practicing or advancing regenerative agriculture to access financing, technical assistance, and data.    The Foundation is also providing funding and support to: Grants for Indigenous Peoples' Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Food Systems  Amazon Conservation Team to advance and monitor Indigenous agroforestry and regenerative agricultural practices in two landscapes in tropical South America using a community-led approach. The project will engage traditional elders, women, and youth in the Andean Amazon and Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (which is currently dominated by palm oil monocropping). The grant will support dialogue between the two communities as they connect biodiversity conservation, ecosystem management, and sustainable agriculture.  Deep Medicine Circle to support its Farming as Medicine program by returning land to Indigenous People; recognizing farmers as health stewards; elevating evidence of the regenerative impacts of Indigenous food systems; decommodifying food; and removing fruits, herbs, and vegetables from the market economy and returning them to a system of care. The grant will support Indigenous land management on the 38-acre Te Kwe A'naa Warep (Honor Mother Earth) farm in rural Ramaytush territory (San Gregorio, California).  Indigenous Partnership for Agrobiodiversity and Food Sovereignty to demonstrate how people and landscapes thrive through Indigenous Peoples' Food Systems, working with Indigenous youths in Northeast India; Northern Thailand; Mau Forest, Kenya; and Quintana Roo, Mexico. The organization will provide training, build capacity, and networks to support a cadre of skilled and passionate Indigenous Peoples Youths who will anchor future activities. The grant will also support a global Indigenous Regenerative Food Systems Summit in 2024.  RSF Social Finance in support of the Pawanka Fund, which aims to deepen collaboration among community-oriented NGOs in Kenya, Brazil, Nigeria, Fiji, and Canada. The NGOs will work with their communities to operate Indigenous Food Systems Solution Lab and provide microgrants to implement the most promising Indigenous-led and locally developed regenerative agriculture solutions. Lessons will be shared across countries and contexts.    Grants for Regenerative Data and Networks  Dalberg Catalyst to make a package of climate-smart agricultural technologies available to smallholder farmers in Africa, and to understand the price of carbon needed for farmers to benefit. The package contains solar irrigation systems, biodigesters, and soil carbon measurement. The project aims to overcome market limitations around the uptake of climate-smart practices and demonstrate that smallholder farmers provide an important climate solution.  Ecdysis Foundation to develop a Fellowship for Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color to train under-represented groups in regenerative agriculture and related science through the North American-based 1000 Farms Initiative. The project will also collect and analyze farm-level data on yield, profitability, biodiversity, water quality, and more around sustainable regenerative agricultural practices across 1,000 farms in the United States before expanding globally. This data will also be used by the Foundation-funded Periodic Table of Food Initiative (PTFI), which is creating a global public database of the biochemical composition and function of foods grown under different conditions.  Smallholder Data Services to collect and analyze data from smallholder farmers practicing regenerative agriculture in Southeast Asia, South America, and the Caribbean, ensuring that their experience and voice is fully represented in the ongoing development of regenerative agriculture. The project will synthesize this data into recommendations, best practices, and guidelines for global use. Grants for Regenerative Impact and Scaling  AGRA to advance the availability of biofortified foods (iron-and zinc-rich beans and Vitamin A-enriched maize) for institutional markets in Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania, with a focus on school meals reaching 1.2 million children. The project will regenerate soil health across an expanded area cultivated with soil nitrogen-fixing beans.  Naandi Foundation to apply a home-grown economic model for regenerative agriculture in India, as an alternative to the existing system that has left 35.5 percent of children under five stunted, and 67.1 percent anemic. The project will support the testing and scaling of regenerative, nourishing food systems, applying a True Cost Accounting Additionally, the project will offer evidence on the capacity to integrate regeneratively produced food into India's Public Distribution System of subsidized foods, a procurement system that serves around 800 million people. "Though we are still learning, available data reveals regenerative agriculture not only sequesters carbon, conserves soil and water, protects biodiversity, and enables farm communities to prosper," said Betty Kibaara, Director of the Food Initiative at The Rockefeller Foundation's Africa Regional Office. "These sorts of approaches promote resilient and nourishing food systems." The funding is part of The Rockefeller Foundation's March 2022 commitment of USD 105M to make healthy and sustainable foods more accessible globally. In addition to its focus on regenerative agriculture, the Foundation's initiative is revolutionizing the science of nutrition and working with governments to transition food procurement programs for school meals--which serve 388 million children globally--to whole grains and other healthy foods. Other Good Food work envisions the future food system and supports food system visionaries.

(TNSres) -- The Queensland University of Technology issued the following news: The COP27 climate summit, which begins in Egypt this week, will again focus the world's attention on the global threat from climate change, with nature, food, water, industry decarbonisation and climate adaption identified as key issues. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in the lead up to the conference, has delivered the timely and urgent reminder that no country and no economy is immune from the climate crisis. "We are in a life-or-death struggle for our own safety today and our survival," Mr Guterres said. Pro Vice-Chancellor (Sustainability and Research Integrity) Professor Kerrie Wilson said QUT's vision for a sustainable world was to move to a low carbon future and reduce activities that result in greenhouse gas emissions. "QUT is responding to the climate emergency on every front - through our research and teaching programs and the way we manage our campuses and operations," Professor Wilson said. 'We're investigating climate impacts and solutions through research centres focused on areas ranging from clean energy, agriculture and the environment to justice and health law. "Our Sustainability Action Plan outlines the many actions we are taking across 13 domains, including carbon, energy, transport, waste, the built environment and climate adaptation and resilience. "We teach a wide range of climate-related subjects, including climate science, environmental science, engineering, health, law, economics and policy, sustainable design, corporate social responsibility and disaster management." QUT experts available for media comment on COP27 and related issues are: Climate change and the law Associate Professor Felicity Deane has published extensively on climate change policy, in particular on market-based instruments and emissions reductions. Her publications have particularly focused on the convergence of trade law and climate change policy. Her first book, Emissions Trading and WTO Law: A Global Analysis, examined the impact of trade rules on climate change market-based instruments. Her recent monograph Natural Capital, Agriculture and the Law considers how the law is relevant to improving sustainability and the role of landholders in doing so. Over the past 10 years, Associate Professor Deane has collaborated with industry partners on projects that focus on land use practices in Australia, export markets and impacts on natural resources. She is a research program lead with the Centre for Clean Energy Technologies and Practices. Smart cities, sustainability and "more-than-human" design Professor Marcus Foth is the leader of the QUT More-than-Human Futures research group, which looks at the complex interrelationships between humans and non-human others (such as animals and plants, as well as soil, rivers, data and sensors). He also founded the Urban Informatics Research Lab in 2006 and the QUT Design Lab in 2016. Professor Foth has focussed on the philosophical and societal issues and challenges of sustainability. His work has looked at smart and sustainable cities, and how they are responding to climate change, rapid urbanisation, pandemics, as well as innovations in technologies such as blockchain, media architecture and the Internet of Things. He strongly argues for the importance of a humanities, arts, social science perspective in sustainability discourse. Young Planners and Climate Change QUT PhD student Nicholas Kamols, the 2022 Australian Young Planner of the Year, is attending the United Nations' COP27 summit as part of the Australian Youth Delegation, in a bid to promote better climate strategies in Australia. Mr Kamols is the co-founder of PowerWells, a company that repurposes lithium-ion batteries - diverting waste from landfill - and pairs them with solar panels to provide renewable energy to off-the-grid communities in Indonesia. He said town planners were well suited to contribute to tackling the global challenge of climate change with their focus on cities and the built environment, and he aimed to bring a number of climate mitigation strategies and approaches to climate-positive design to a number of luminaries on the world stage. This is particularly timely, as the Brisbane 2032 Olympics are contracted by the IOC to be climate-positive. Mr Kamols has written about this in a new 2022 book chapter: "The promise of the first climate-positive Olympics for regenerative cities." Mr Kamols is a town planner who worked in local government and private practice before returning to QUT in 2019 where he graduated with a Master of Philosophy in urban informatics. He is doing his PhD with the QUT Design Lab, where he investigates the formational and operational processes of virtual built environments in the open metaverse. His studies are supported by ARUP. Intellectual property and climate change Professor Matthew Rimmer, from the QUT Faculty of Business & Law, studies intellectual property, climate change, and sustainable development. He has followed the debates over intellectual property and technology transfer in international climate talks over many years. Professor Rimmer has also been focused on climate litigation - including the recent victory of the Torres Strait Eight over the Australian Government in respect of the impact of climate change on human rights, including the right to culture. He has also been exploring regulatory action in respect of the problems of greenwashing by corporate actors and national governments. He has highlighted the need for open innovation to address the challenges of climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development. Climate finance and gender Associate Professor Rowena Maguire, from QUT's Centre for Justice, studies gender and climate policy with a focus on the land sector. Associate Professor Maguire will be available to comment upon COP 27 outcomes related to gender, agriculture and climate finance. Associate Professor Maguire is examining who benefits from climate finance in Fiji, Samoa and Solomon Islands and whether it meets women's requirements for adaptation to climate change funded by the Australian Centre for International Agriculture Research (ACIAR). Professor Maguire's project aims to understand the flow of climate finance, who gets the money and identify how to better channel international climate finance to benefit vulnerable communities. A member of the research team, Dr George Carter from ANU, will be presenting research findings to an ACIAR event as part of COP. Professor Maguire is the lead author of a report prepared to assist UNFCCC Negotiations teams on the topic of gender and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Nov 05, 2022( Dissident Voice: HYPERLINK http://www.dissidentvoice.org http://www.dissidentvoice.org Dateline: November 7-18, 2022, Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Dignitaries from every country will be meeting to discuss climate change at COP27 . Based upon early confirmations, 90 heads of state will attend, lending an aura of importance. The Secretary-General has been beating that same drum for some time now, which prompts a thought: Should the UN stop holding annual COP 'Conference of the Parties' climate change meetings? For 30 years straight, following each COP meeting, CO2 emissions have climbed higher than the year before. That's thirty years, or an entire generation, of failure to slow emissions by even a teeny bit. It's starting to get embarrassing. For historical perspective, Global CO2 emissions in 1992, when COPs started, were just over 22 billion metric tons. In 2021 CO2 emissions were a record high 36 billion tons or an increase of 65% since nations signed up to protect the planet from excessive greenhouse gases. This equates to thirty-years of blabbering and more blabbering with nothing to show for it, except big increases in greenhouse gases, an amazing anti-achievement! The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) formed at the Earth Summit in May 1992 with 178 member nations unanimously agreeing to bring CO2 emissions down to 1990 levels of 354 ppm by the year 2000. May 2000 CO2 @ 371.82 ppm - missed the 354 target October 2022 CO2 @ 427.01 ppm - Oh, well! COP meetings are the Super Bowl of climate change but not quite as extravagant but still pretty darn plush. And, millions are expended to house (multi-star hotels) and feed (30,000 registered delegates for COP27 ) to annual COP two-week get-togethers, not including airfare expenses as well as CO2 exhaust fumes. So far, taxpayers or grants or private funding or institutional funds that support attendees have witnessed CO2 emissions increase every year ever since UNFCCC formed, never a down year. It's been a bad investment, but offsetting that misfortune is effective PR. 'Climate Change' is universally recognized. Meantime - The All-time Worldwide Killer is Fossil Fuels That puts fossil fuels in the all-time standings list with World War I and World War II, actually in first place. Wars end. Fossil fuel emissions do not. Why not use that statistic for more effective (compelling) PR? Alas, there is no known 'urgent system-wide transformation' that 'can avoid climate disaster' on the drawing boards even as the United Nations insists it's the only way to avoid climate disaster. But, of course, the IPCC does not control fossil fuels, which, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), plan nearly $1 trillion of new fossil fuel projects, oil & gas, by 2030, and the IPCC does not control coal emissions. According to Bloomberg, US Edition, September 21, 2022: 'A year after President Xi Jinping promised China would stop building coal power plants overseas, the country has completed 14 such facilities beyond its borders and will finish another 27 soon.' The soon-to-be completed plants will emit more emissions than the Philippines or 140 million tons of CO2/yr. Additionally, India May Boost Coal Power Fleet By 25% By 2030 Amid Rising Demand, Bloomberg, US Edition, September 22, 2022. India's PM claims reliable electricity supply is the nation's priority, and thus, according to Bloomberg and COP26: He aims for net zero by 2070, not 2050. Why not make it 2170? That's likely what'll happen over time, assuming an excruciating pounding summer heat, like the summer of 2022, doesn't bring on mass protests or more likely mass deaths well ahead of net zero by 2070. And, just for good measure: 'The US government has funneled more than $9bn (7.7bn) into oil and gas projects in Africa since it signed up to restrain global heating in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a tally of official data shows, committing just $682m (587m) to clean energy developments such as wind and solar over the same period.'4[4] In the face of all of that, expectations are high for COP27 in Egypt, but they're always high before every COP. In all honesty, maybe COP meetings should be stopped in favor of an altogether different approach because whatever they are doing is clearly not working. As a practical matter, maybe scale down the meetings to much smaller delegations and omit the edit of policy measures by individual country bureaucrats or economists or fossil fuel reps and leave the fixit policy measures to scientists/engineers and establish strict enforcement by monitoring country promises of CO2 reductions, abandon voluntary country emission reductions. That has never worked! Of more than passing interest, people have already expressed trepidation about holding COP27 in Egypt with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisis's massive crackdown on dissent. It's over-the-top excessive and whether intentional or unintentional, may serve to diminish street protests at COP27 . According to the Arabic Network for Human Rights, at least 60,000 political prisoners are held behind bars for expressing political beliefs. Amnesty International ranks Egypt as the 3rd worst country by numbers of executions. Highlighting Egypt's troubling repressiveness, Naomi Klein referred to COP27 as the 'Carceral Climate Summit.' In order to better understand what to expect at COP27 , Dr. Peter D. Carter, director, Climate Emergency Institute and IPCC expert reviewer analyzed a major preliminary meeting to COP27 at the Bonn UN Climate Change Convention of June 2022 with insight to COP27 , which Dr. Carter boldly labels: 'Bad Beyond Belief' Following the Bonn meetings on June 16th, according to Dr. Carter: 'It is my unpleasant duty and with profound sadness that I'm going to report on what happened I've called it an unbelievably abysmally bad Bonn United Nations Climate Change Convention meeting.' UN June Climate Meeting Bonn: Bad Beyond Belief[5] COP27 , which brings to mind: Who listens to the Secretary-General? It's even worse than the Secretary-General realizes, according to Dr. Carter: 'Today there is no agreement, not even a plan, to put emissions into decline Bonn this June 2022 was yet another international meeting that refused to stop the rapid, rampant wanton destruction of the sacred earth.' Accordingly, the most amazing media report by BBC that came out of Bonn: 'To Bridge the 1.5C Degree Gap.' Countries agreed to a new 'work stream' for this current decade. But that is one more decade following one more decade 'work stream' or work program, a-work-in-progress. At the Bonn meeting, both the EU and the US said the 'work stream should continue until 2030.' According to Carter: Effectively, they've advocated keeping on blah blah blah until 2030: 'Which is definitely a delayed death sentence.' Rather than discussing emissions decline, Bonn has reinforced the 1.5C climate catastrophe by more climate action delay. In contrast, the world's most eminent climate scientist James Hansen said it is scientifically impossible to limit to 1.5 degrees. Evidently, nobody at Bonn was focused on that and what to do, if anything, about it. Much more disturbing yet: 'There are scientists supporting the 1.5C falsehood, wrongfully proclaiming there is no climate emergency. Instead they claim we can still limit to 1.5C.' (Carter) According to Carter, Bonn has written the future off once again. The truth: 'We face global climate hell at 1.5 degree C.' This fact was made obvious in the 6th Assessment by the IPCC itself. Hmm. Meanwhile according to Carter: 'We are getting severe extreme weather events at an increasing rate affecting all habitable regions on the planet. These will increase over time, heat waves, droughts, forest fires, superstorms, hurricanes and cyclones, torrential rains, floods. And the heat waves, unprecedented heat waves across the Northern Hemisphere.' For example, practically all of India was only recently under an unprecedented pounding heat wave. People died. In spite of everything mentioned above, at the Bonn climate talks, no one could agree on what a work stream should look like. Thirty years of negotiations, and nobody knows what their recommendations for a work stream on climate action will look like. Amazingly disturbing. However, Bonn did discuss carbon markets under the 2015 Paris agreement Article 6, which are really only mechanism for emissions trading or what many refer to as 'junk or zombie credits,' worthless credits but now approved and used for greenwashing. In total 320 million of the credits equivalent to the annual emissions of 86 coal-fired power plants have been made available for countries to count towards climate emission reduction commitments. Hmm. Bottom line: 'There was not a hint of putting emissions into decline at the two-week Bonn meetings. All agreements result in continued emissions.' (Carter) The inertia is shameful. Adding insult to injury, as part of COP negotiations, way back in 2009, rich countries agreed to provide 200 billion dollars a year to underdeveloped countries by 2020. As of today, they have failed to pay the first 200 billion. Bonn meetings ended with nothing more done about this 200B failure. Ever since 1992, major countries have stalled. This is a recurring source of distrust in the process by underdeveloped countries. A BBC headline regarding Bonn's two-week meetings stated: 'Climate Change: Bonn Talks End In Acrimony Over Compensation.'5[6] Additionally, it's hard to accept, but Bonn caved in to major emitters. China rejected any references to being labeled a 'major emitter.' However, they are a major emitter. In fact, China's emissions are double the next largest emitter, which is the US. India, China, and Middle East all objected to any language about 'major emitters,' which, in fact, was deleted. They also agreed to omit any emissions accounting by the UN climate secretariat for NDC or voluntary national emissions targets, even though these are, in fact, 'paltry targets' which will not even come close to limiting global warming to 2C. And, what they did agree to will not even be new national emissions accounting until 2023. Only Australia promised deeper cuts. Alas, it's hard to believe, but there is no plan for how countries will work out and submit their emission targets. Different countries are using different methodologies. 'This is a basket case. It's chaotic how national emissions targets are being accounted and registered with the UN.' (Carter) Dr. Carter: 'This is absolute madness. You read thru the accounts of these meetings and you cannot believe it is true we will not survive if these unbelievably sky-high greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 are allowed to continue to increase at the accelerating rate. We're on a global suicide proposal.' Postscript: COP26/Glasgow/2021 news not covered by mainstream media: Commentary of Dr. James Hansen (Ex-NASA Climate Chief) re COP26/Glasgow: 'In amemo[7] published last December - unreported until now - Prof Hansen warned that world governments and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are severely under-estimating the speed and impact of global warming this century.'6[8] 'Conventional climate models, he said, do not sufficiently account for the Earth's paleoclimate history or ongoing observations of the climate system Prof Hansen criticized Boris Johnson's 'claim that COP26 salvaged the chance to keep global warming below 1.5C' and that 'we'll look back at COP26 as the moment humanity finally got real about climate change. Describing the UK Government's claims about the success of the COP26 as 'unadulterated bullst', his memo warned that 'the 1.5C global warming ceiling will be breached this decade' and that pledges made by Johnson's administration at COP26 will do nothing to stop the world hitting dangerous climate change.'

PR Newswire Dozens of religious leaders from around the world gathered today Sunday November 13th, simultaneously in London, Sharmel - Sheikh, Jerusalem and other locations around the world to held a groundbreaking Climate Repentance Ceremony. The leaders walked together, in a prayerful, penitential march with scrolls bearing the Ten Principles for Climate Repentance \~Dozens of religious leaders, Jews, Muslims, Christians, Hindus and Buddhists from Egypt, the USA, Israel, India, Spain and Great Britain gathered Sunday, November 13th .22 at the base of Parliament Hill in London and at the same time in Sharm el-Sheikh, Jerusalem, and other places around the world in an excited call to the leaders around the world to act for climate repentance and to act according to the ten universal principles on climate, this is in the midst of the UN conference being held in Sharm el -Sheikh. For the first time,\~ a Climate Repentance Ceremony, calling for people to repent and change people's destructive lifestyles and systems in order to save the planet. Ecumenical\~Patriarch Bartholomew, also known as the Green Patriarch, issued a statement ahead of the climate repentance ceremony and said that "The abuse of nature and the exploitation of its resources are a sin against God the Creator and the gift of creation". The climate repentance ceremony was supposed to take place at Mount Sinai as part of the COP-27 climate conference taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, part of the Sinai Peninsula and only 200 km from Mount Sinai. There, according to the Bible, the Ten Commandments were revealed to Moses. The organizers hope that the ceremony of the ten principles and the climate repentance ceremony, inspired by the biblical event thousands of years ago, will inspire the people to act modestly and carry out actions for climate justice. Among the dozens of leaders participated in the events: Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople (Istanbul), Swami Chidanand Saraswati from India, Imam Faisal Abdul Rauf (USA), Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg and more. The event is being held at the initiative of Yosef Abramowitz - green energy entrepreneur, CEO of Gigawatt Global, and is being implemented by Peace Department, the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development, the Elijah Interfaith Institute and the Adam Teva Va Din organization. Hopefully, events will encourage and empower religious communities in the world to mitigate climate change caused by humans, and promote the use of\~renewable energy. The Ten Principles for Climate Repentance (mini versions) are: We are stewards of this worldCreation manifests divinityEverything in life is interconnectedDo no harm\~Look after tomorrow\~Rise above ego for our worldChange our inner climateRepent and return\~Every action mattersUse mind, open heart In addition, many houses of worship around the world joined together today with prayer and study focused on climate action to protect our environment. James Sternlicht, founder of the\~PeaceDepartment, co-initiator of the eventstated that: "The ceremonies around the world is a milestone for a global coordination system, where we will prove that religion and science, and ultimately politics, can work together to guide humanity towards a brighter future." Climate activist Yosef Abramowitz - co-initiator of the eventsaid: "Religious leaders from around the world are issuing an unequivocal call to world leaders and citizens to take responsibility and act with urgency to make the immediate switch to life-affirming good energy.\~ We have pioneered 100% solar power from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea and have demonstrated that it is technologically possible and economically advantageous. COP27 should not endorse incrementalism.\~ Religion can power hope and action; green energy can power the planet". Rabbi Yonatan Neril, founder and CEO of the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development\~noted that "we must move from greed, short-term thinking and individualistic behavior to spiritual satisfaction, long-term thinking and altruism. By doing this we will address the root causes instead of just the symptoms of the problem." About the co-organizers: Yosef Abramovitz\~- a green energy entrepreneur.

PR Newswire Mount Sinai Health System was celebrated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on Thursday, November 10, for pledging ongoing action to decarbonize the health care sector and make health care facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2022 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Mount Sinai Health System was celebrated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) on Thursday, November 10, for pledging ongoing action to decarbonize the health care sector and make health care facilities more resilient to the effects of climate change. Mount Sinai has formally committed to pursuing the Biden administration's climate goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and has already made large-scale efforts to decarbonize. A September 2021 consensus statement from more than 200 medical journals named climate change the No. 1 threat to global public health. It exposes millions of people in the United States, and countless more around the world, to harm every year through increases in extreme heat waves, wildfires, flooding, vector-borne diseases, and other factors that worsen chronic health conditions. These impacts disproportionately fall on communities that are often already the victims of longstanding discrimination. The health care sector also contributes to climate change, accounting for approximately 8.5 percent of U.S. domestic emissions. The HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, developed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge to help focus industry response to climate challenges. In addition to reducing their carbon footprint, signatories also commit to producing detailed plans to prepare their facilities for both chronic and acute catastrophic climate impacts. One hundred two prominent health companies in the United States have signed the White House/HHS Health Sector Climate Pledge, including organizations representing 837 hospitals as well as leading health centers, suppliers, insurance companies, group purchasing organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and more. Federal systems like the Indian Health Service, Veterans Health Administration, and Military Health System are working together to meet similar goals to those embraced by these private-sector organizations. Combined, this means that more than 1,080 federal and private sector hospitals have made such commitments, together representing more than 15 percent of U.S. hospitals. "HHS returns this year to COP27 to report great progress," said Admiral Rachel Levine, the Assistant Secretary for Health. "Through the efforts of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity and several other HHS agencies, we have made significant strides in introducing resources and supports to help communities and care providers accelerate their work to reduce harmful emissions and increase climate resilience in the health sector." Mount Sinai has already reduced its energy-related carbon footprint by more than 30 percent since 2005. Key to these efforts were chiller and heating plant optimization projects at The Mount Sinai Hospital, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Mount Sinai West. Additional investments in electric cooling and heating technology are underway at Mount Sinai's new laboratories and health care facilities throughout New York City to further reduce the Health System's reliance on fossil fuels. "Mount Sinai is excited to join with other leaders in the health sector to expand on the progress we have already made. We understand the impacts that climate change has on the health of the communities we serve. Thus, we are committed to reducing our impact on the environment while also ensuring that we are resilient to the impacts of climate change," said Christina McNeilis, MPH, Associate Director of Sustainability at Mount Sinai Health System. Additionally, Mount Sinai is working with its suppliers to better understand and decarbonize its supply chain-related emissions. Earlier this year, Mount Sinai signed on to The Cool Food Pledge, a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food purchases by 25 percent by 2030. For more information about how Mount Sinai is responding to our nation's climate challenges, visit HYPERLINK http://www.Mountsinai.org http://www.Mountsinai.org . About the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity The Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE) plays a vital role in protecting the nation's health from climate change-related risks, including extreme heat, natural disasters, vector-borne diseases and more. Among the supports OCCHE provides for health sector companies that wish to reduce their environmental impact and become more resilient to the effects of climate change are a webinar series and associated compendium of federal resources to support emissions reduction and resilience. OCCHE also publishes a regular Climate and Health Outlook, an effort to inform health professionals and the public on how our health may be affected in the coming month(s) by climate events and provide resources to take proactive action. About the Mount Sinai Health System Mount Sinai Health System is one of the largest academic medical systems in the New York metro area, with more than 43,000 employees working across eight hospitals, over 400 outpatient practices, nearly 300 labs, a school of nursing, and a leading school of medicine and graduate education.

The following information was released by Friends of the Earth: But little progress made in phasing out coal, oil and gas. A historic COP27 However, the environmental campaign group warned that little progress has been made during the climate talks in phasing out coal, oil and gas, and securing the action needed to avert catastrophic global warming. Friends of the Earth's international climate campaigner, Rachel Kennerley, said: "The welcome decision to create a loss and damage fund was the only just outcome of COP27 . This is an important step forward in re-addressing the balance between those that have done the most to cause climate change and those least responsible but who suffer the worst impacts. "Wealthy countries must now support the setting up of this fund - and crucially its financing - to ensure it reaches the frontline communities hardest hit by the climate crisis. Countries like the UK must now provide the necessary cash, and ensure the scheme isn't undermined by nations trying to avoid their obligations. "Elsewhere in the talks, the rich, industrialised countries worked hard to avoid ending their addiction to coal, oil and gas - instead favouring dangerous and ineffective distractions, like offsetting, over cutting emissions. "Accelerating energy efficiency programmes and fast-tracking green energy are not only good for the environment, they will also help build the clean, fair and prosperous economies of tomorrow. "And with the world on a climate change collision course, we don't have time to waste." Friends of the Earth also expressed concern that COP27 was held in a country where protest and criticising the government are punished harshly. Friends of the Earth's international climate campaigner, Rachel Kennerley, said: "We join the wider climate justice movement at COP27 in calling for the release of prisoners of conscience here in Egypt including Alaa Abd El-Fattah, a British-Egyptian political prisoner. There can be no climate justice without human rights." \</doc>

PR Newswire Egyptian COP27 Presidency team meets representatives of previous COP Presidencies to discuss ultimate objectives of COP27Current geopolitical issues identified as one of the challenges to addressPrevious COP Presidents and their representatives joined workshop to offer insights Members of the Egyptian COP27 Presidency Team and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have held an all-day consultation ahead of the convening. Facilitated by the Centre for Multilateral Negotiations (CEMUNE), the workshop discussed how COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh will engage with, and advance, the many climate and economic challenges that are currently underway. Along with the UNFCCC and COP27 Presidency members, also present offering their expertise were 14 speakers including COP20 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, COP26 Lead Negotiator Archie Young, Tomasz Chruszczow (former High Level Climate Champion for COP24), Dr Hakima El Haite (former High Level Climate Champion for COP22), and Kaveh Guilanpour (Former Co-lead Negotiator on Climate Change for the EU). Group sessions discussed how best to ensure that global political leadership can further guide the process and identified the risk of existing and evolving challenges impacting on COP27 , more so than at previous editions. With the current situation in Ukraine, high energy prices, and predicted economic recession, attendees acknowledged possible factors that could affect the long- and near-term ambitions that the world agreed upon under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Eliminating roadblocks to productive dialogue and eventual agreement were central points discussed. The COP27 Presidency Team and other attendees worked to put in place the right framework to facilitate global consensus focused on the implementation of existing commitments, and how best to enhance that ambition. COP President Designate H.E. Sameh Shoukry said, "The role of the COP Presidency is to align and converge multiple views, and facilitate transparent, inclusive, and fruitful discussion, while consistently advocating for more progress, ambition and solidarity." "Sound substantive and organizational preparation is essential to ensure that COP27 results in the most positive outcome possible. This workshop gathered several experts and resource persons with extensive experience in climate action and climate conferences, and allowed for useful sharing of best practices and lessons learned," added Wael Aboulmagd, COP27 Special Representative. \~\~ COP27 will take place from 6 to 18 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt Photo - HYPERLINK https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1927356/COP27.jpg https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1927356/ HYPERLINK COP27 .jpg For more information, please contact Ambassador Amr Essam: HYPERLINK mailto:comms@cop27.eg comms@ cop27 HYPERLINK mailto:comms@cop27.eg .eg +20 (0) 2 23588326 HYPERLINK http://www.cop27.eg http://www. cop27 HYPERLINK http://www.cop27.eg .eg Twitter: @COP27P "Act Now" video - HYPERLINK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0k-EXPLmm4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0k-EXPLmm4 View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/continuous-engagement-ramping-up-to-a- cop27 -success-301656697.html SOURCE COP27 \</doc>

The International Council of Nurses issued the following news release on Nov. 22, 2022: The International Council of Nurses (ICN) welcomes the decision by leaders at COP27 to set up a fund to alleviate the damage caused by climate change in the most affected countries. However, ICN says COP27 missed the opportunity to take the necessary urgent action to reduce emissions. ICN President Pamela Cipriano underlined that climate change is a significant driver of inequalities in health that mean billions of people are unable to access essential healthcare. Dr Cipriano said: "The decision to set up a loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries is welcome, but it is extremely disappointing that COP27 delegates, which included many heads of state, did not take the urgent action needed to bring the planet back from the brink of a global humanitarian catastrophe. 'Nurses everywhere are witnessing the health effects of climate change every day and ICN, on behalf of the world's 28 million nurses, is appealing to politicians and policymakers to act now. Many argue it may already be too late to reverse the devastating effects of global environmental change, and the world can ill afford to kick the can down the road to COP28." ICN believes that the nursing profession has a duty to contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, to protecting health and wellbeing, and promoting social justice. ICN is a member of the Global Climate and Health Alliance and it has recently signed the petition calling for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, which calls for an end to the expansion of fossil fuel use, and the management of the global transition away from the use of coal, oil and gas. Last week ICN added its voice to warnings that too few women are taking part in the COP27 climate negotiations, despite evidence that they bear a disproportionate burden from the effects of climate change.

Interested in writing a letter to the editor or guest column for\~the Indiana Daily Student? Check out our guidelines and submission details here.\~\~ If you had told me freshman year that I would be attending the 27th Conference of Parties in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, I would have never believed you. I remember sitting in INTL-I 102 Climate Change and International Studies with Professor Jessy O'Reilly freshman year learning about international climate governance, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and COPs, dreaming that one day I would maybe have the opportunity to attend.\~\~ That class set the trajectory for my college career at IU, as I studied international studies, geography (climate and environmental change) and minored in atmospheric science. This all ultimately led to the opportunity I took to be a part of the student delegation to COP27 , and it was such an honor to attend on behalf of IU.\~\~ To become a part of the delegation, you must apply to the course with a proposed research question or topic that relates to COPs. I went into COP27 looking at ecological restoration and utilization of nature-based solutions in international climate agreements. Nature-based solutions are climate solutions that center around nature and utilize the natural world to build adaptation and resilience. Ecological restoration is an example of a nature-based solution, which focuses on restoring environments which have been degraded due to human actions.\~\~ This is timely and necessary because the biodiversity crisis is occurring in tandem with the climate crisis. It is critical that both are taken into consideration when establishing the plans for the fight against climate change. During my time at COP27 , it was clear that nature and biodiversity were given the spotlight, with an entire presidential thematic day dedicated to biodiversity.\~\~ It was impossible to walk through the venue and not hear people speaking about nature. COPs have the ability to bring together experts and specialists from all around the world into one space, which allows this beautiful sharing of knowledge. I have often joked since returning that COP27 felt like a "master class," where I walked away with significantly more knowledge than I could have ever imagined about ecosystem restoration and nature-based solutions.\~\~ COP27 can be considered a win for nature as it was the first time that the term nature-based solutions was utilized in a cover decision. The meeting last year, COP26, laid the groundwork for this achievement by giving nature the international platform it warrants. This year's thematic day on biodiversity highlighted how nature intersects with almost every aspect of human life and how we must work to protect it. While nature is beautiful and must be restored, it is critically important to remember that ecological restoration and nature-based solutions are only one element in the fight against climate change. These must be done alongside decarbonization, not in place of it.\~\~ COP27 was a whirlwind of a week, and it went by quicker than I think any of us on the delegation expected. It is often easy to be dismayed about the state of climate policies and plans across the world but attending COP27 demonstrated that while the climate crisis may seem hopeless at times, there are thousands of people from all walks of life all across the world who are fighting to make a difference. While COP27 had a positive outcome for nature, that cannot allow us to become complacent.\~ There must be a continued push for the involvement of nature in climate change at the international level, and I plan on being a part of that.\~\~ Liv Davis is a senior majoring in international studies and geography with a minor in atmospheric science.

The following information was released by the Business Roundtable: On Wednesday, November 9, Business Roundtable CEOs and other company leaders participated in a panel discussion, "CEOs Accelerating the Global Low-Carbon Transition," at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The discussion focused on the unique initiatives their companies have undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and help advance a low-carbon future through data-driven innovation and strategic partnerships, with appropriate policy that supports both. The panel was moderated by Kara Hurst, Chief Sustainability Officer at Amazon, who facilitated a discussion between business leaders from four additional Roundtable member companies. Panelists included George Oliver, Chair of the Business Roundtable Energy and Environment Committee and Chairman and CEO of Johnson Controls; Michael Kasbar, Chairman, President and CEO of World Fuel Services Corporation; Pedro Pizarro, CEO of Edison International; and Solomon Assefa, Vice President at IBM Research. What They Are Saying On What Companies Are Doing: Hurst: "At Amazon, we have committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions across our operations by 2040 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. We are on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 and by the end of 2021 the company had reached 85%. As the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally, Amazon now has a total of more than 375 renewable energy projects, representing 18.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity." Oliver: "From a digital standpoint, our OpenBlue Platform allows us to bridge all of the systems into one data platform, be able to apply AI and achieve different outcomes ... that can [lead to] more efficiency in the building. More important, with that efficiency we can reduce the energy consumed 30, 40, 50%. So, our focus has been combining that technology with all of our systems that ultimately creates a net zero building as a service." Pizarro: "How do you get there? Renewable power and storage on the supply side, electrifying three-quarters of transportation and 90% of buildings, using clean fuels like hydrogen and carbon capturereally using all the tools in the toolbox." Kasbar: "In terms of SAF [Sustainable Aviation Fuel], these are pioneers, these are folks that have dedicated decades, without really a lot of support, without a lot of people believing them...it's admirable and the thing that we do is support those individuals wherever we can, we will invest in them and certainly support them [by] ... underwriting a lot of energy distribution ...we just try to be in the good column." Assefa: "Leveraging technologies such as AI and the cloud to drive well-informed reduction of their own carbon footprint. ... The most exciting thing for me is the innovation side. ... We have about 3,000 research scientists around the world and if you ask them now what are they working on, they will tell you 'we're working on climate and sustainability.'" On the Business Community's Leadership: Oliver: "The business community over the last few years has really elevated the commitment to ultimately protect the environment and execute in our individual industries ... now, there's an urgency to work together and drive progress to protect the planet's health." Pizarro: "We're seeing a greater sense of urgency in the business community. ... We also see an important role for increasing U.S. competitiveness in global markets by having more of these technologies [produced] here [in the U.S.]." On the Need for Supportive Policy and Partnerships to Accelerate a Transition to a Clean Energy Future: Hurst: "[decarbonizing our transportation network] is intended to drive innovation across the industry and encourage more public charging infrastructure, which will help enable the broader transportation industry to more quickly reduce emissions. But it will take time to remove carbon emissions from heavy transportation systems, including ocean shipping, aviation, and trucking. Governments and the private sector need to come together on this important work." Oliver: "As we're doing that [working to reduce energy consumption/GHG emissions], there's been a big focus on how do we now drive the partnerships, the policies and then the standards to really drive a significant step forward to decarbonize. ... There's an urgency now in the private sector but working with the public sector globally to be able to drive standards to what we believe is possible today. ... That can make a real big difference." Pizarro: "It's been helpful to see the support through the bipartisan infrastructure bill ... the CHIPS Plus Act. I think all of [that legislation] will help to strengthen the manufacturing base and the research and development base in the U.S. to contribute that globally." Kasbar: "We're really dealing with triangulating the trilemma of resiliency, security, affordability and access and sustainability and we've got the triumvirate of public, private, and societal factors that you need to navigate." Assefa: "Everyone needs to be able to partner together so that we can really drive and accelerate innovation." On Sustainability with an Eye Toward the Future: Oliver: "Instead of [some business leaders] resisting, embrace and act. ... This is the one single issue globally that brings us all together." Pizarro: "As we look forward ... so much of the investment is linked directly to sustainability and clean energy." Kasbar: "We have this incredible transformation, and it does take everybody. Every bit counts, so just get started." Assefa: "Sustainability isn't something you do on the side. It's a business imperative." Business Roundtable members have been helping to lead the charge when it comes to reducing GHG emissions in the United States and globally by executing on initiatives to reduce energy consumption, accelerate technology adoption and shape smart energy and sustainability policy. The Roundtable also recognizes the U.S. will not meet its climate goals without reforming the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects. For the U.S. to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, an unprecedented amount of new infrastructure must be planned, permitted and built within the next decade. The current permitting system is a roadblock to the new infrastructure projects. Business Roundtable is calling on Congress to pass bipartisan legislation reforming the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects this year. The reforms the Roundtable supports would reduce emissions, uphold environmental protections and pave the way for the U.S. to become a clean energy powerhouse. \</doc>

The United Nations Climate Change Conference , commonly referred to as COP27 , convened November 8th in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. Among other things, this conference aims to fulfill the Paris Accords' goal of aligning "the finance flows with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilience development". The world is showing more interest in the environment and in controlling greenhouse emissions than ever before. Here in the United States, our mindset concerning environmental regulation has improved recently. The gist is this: you attract more bees with honey than with vinegar. Treasury Secretary Jane Allen had previously proposed a carbon tax to combat greenhouse gas emissions, but this policy failed because it would have made what we do more expensive. It would have used vinegar to make other countries go along. Therefore, this policy was divisive and was vehemently opposed by conservatives, dying on the vine and never coming to fruition. Policies to combat greenhouse gas emissions come mainly in three categories: carbon tax, cap and trade, and green energy subsidies. The first policy proposes imposing a dollar tax per unit of pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2). As I mentioned. It has been controversial and has not made real progress. Cap and trade allows companies that pollute less than the permitted amount to sell their remaining permits, while companies that pollute more than their permitted amount are allowed to buy these permits. There is a market for cap and trade in the European Union like our market for stocks, commodities, etc. In the US, the House of Representatives passed a bill for cap and trade, but the Senate rejected it. Energy subsidies give an incentive to produce renewable energy that emits less carbon. This makes activity less expensive, in contrast to the tax policy. Tech companies have aided and abided by this policy. During the last decade, the cost of solar energy has dropped significantly, and is now equivalent to the cost of wind energy in terms of dollars per one million kiloWatt hours-lower than the cost of natural gas. Moreover, electric cars have become more acceptable as more charging stations are being built. This has helped renewable energy become more acceptable.\~ The impact of the third policy will become obvious as the Reduction Indication Act of 2022, a $750 billion health care, tax and climate law, starts taking effect over time. We can conclude that, after all this time, the controversial Green New Deal in the U.S. has not died.

The following information was released by the Scottish Government: First Minister calls on leaders to build on Glasgow promise. The First Minister will today call on world leaders to deliver on the commitments they made in the Glasgow Climate Pact, as she attends the first full day of the COP27 climate conference in Egypt. The First Minister will take part in an all-female panel discussion on financing decarbonisation with government leaders, including the Prime Minister of Barbados. The First Minister will also meet representatives of countries from the Global South to hear their experiences of the climate crisis and what they want to see delivered at the climate talks. Ahead of the formal opening of COP27 the First Minister met on Sunday with the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC Simon Stiell, Director General of the International Organization for Migration Antonio Vitorino and Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados. The First Minister said: "COP26 in Glasgow delivered real progress on tackling the climate crisis, with strengthened commitments to curb emissions, build resilience to climate change, and provide the finance needed to reach net zero. World leaders must use the next two weeks to take meaningful steps to deliver on the promises made in the Glasgow Climate Pact. "We are gathering against a tense backdrop and the geopolitical landscape has changed significantly in the last year, not least as a result of Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. However the climate crisis has not gone away and the answer to many of the global crises we face, such as energy security and food shortages, lies in going faster. "For many countries, particularly in the global south, this must be the COP where the global north not only delivers on our promises to finance adaptation and mitigation, but recognises the need to address the loss and damage experienced by countries already impacted by climate change. "Last year, Scotland became the first developed nation to pledge finance to address loss and damage and others have now followed suit, including Wallonia and Denmark. This shows just how important the action of smaller governments can be, and I know many countries and campaigners hope to see other countries, particularly in the north, step up and make COP in Egypt the loss and damage COP." Background Scotland was the first developed nation to pledge finance to address loss and damage, with a commitment at COP26 of 2 million from our Climate Justice Fund. This was followed by contributions of 1 million from the Wallonia government and $3 million from philanthropies. In September, Denmark pledged around $13 million to developing nations affected by climate change. \</doc>

The following information was released by the United Nations: Independent human rights experts are in dialogue with Egyptian and UN authorities over the harassment of civil society representatives at the COP27 climate change conference, according to a statement issued on Friday. Climate activists and civil society have been subjected to intimidation, harassment and surveillance during the two-week gathering, held in the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh, they reported. End harassment, ensure safety "We are deeply concerned by reported acts of harassment and intimidation by Egyptian officials, infringing the rights of Egyptian and non-Egyptian human rights and environmental defenders at COP27 , including their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, expression, and effective participation," their statement said. They urged Egypt to end all harassment and intimidation, and to ensure the safety and full participation of human rights defenders and civil society. The four experts are all Special Rapporteurs appointed by the UN Human Rights Council. They monitor and report on issues such as the situation of rights defenders worldwide, and the right of everyone to a safe, clean and healthy environment. Interrogation and surveillance COP27 was due to end on Friday but is almost certainly set to continue into the weekend. Last month, the experts issued a press release raising concerns ahead of the conference and calling for full and safe participation of civil society and human rights defenders without reprisals. However, they said they have received multiple reports and evidence of civil society members, including indigenous peoples, being stopped and interrogated by Egyptian security officers. Local security and support staff were also repeatedly monitoring and photographing civil society actors inside the conference. Widespread 'chilling effect' One human rights defender scheduled to attend COP27 "We are concerned that these actions by Egyptian authorities have a chilling effect, impacting wide segments of civil society participating in COP27 as many groups have expressed concern about the need to self-censor to ensure their safety and security," the experts said. Concerns after COP27 The experts received reports of activists being subject to intrusive questioning at the airport when entering Egypt, sparking fears that information collected on the activities of civil society organisations during COP27 could be misused. They also expressed concern that once the spotlight shifts from Egypt when the conference ends, local human rights defenders could be targeted and risk reprisals for their engagement during the event. "We call on Egypt to immediately end harassment and intimidation, to ensure the rights to participation, freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly at COP27 , and abstain from reprisals against civil society, human rights defenders and indigenous people's representatives who attended COP27 ," they said. The experts are engaging with the Egyptian Government and the UN climate change secretariat, UNFCCC, on this issue. About Special Rapporteurs The statement was issued by Mary Lawlor, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; Fionnuala N Aolain, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, and David Boyd, Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment. They receive their mandates from the UN Human Rights Council, which is based in Geneva. These experts are independent of any government or organization, and work on a voluntary basis. They are neither UN staff, nor are they paid for the work. \</doc>

Sep 15, 2022( NEI: https://www.nei.org/news https://www.nei.org/news Delivered by Newstex) Leaders across the world are committing to climate goals, and in growing numbers, countries are seeing nuclear energy play an essential role in sustainable development and decarbonization. This fall, governments, NGOs, the private sector, academia and more are meeting at three big international events where nuclear energy and climate action are on the agenda. Global Clean Energy Action Forum September 20-23 | Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA Later this month, the United States will host the Global Clean Energy Action Forum[1]. Governments, international organizations, the private sector, academia, innovators, researchers and policymakers will gather to reflect on the steps taken so far in 2022 to build a new energy economy, improve energy security, and tackle climate change while looking toward the most important transition human society has ever seen. Nuclear energy will be a large part of the clean energy transition, providing always-on, carbon-free power, as well as jobs and affordable, reliable electricity. The event's topical roundtables, panels, side events and other activities will feature the benefits nuclear energy can bring to the global community. There will also be an Advanced Nuclear Energy Business Forum that will provide information on the financial investment landscape of nuclear, opportunities for growth to deliver at scale, stakeholder perspectives, and more. IAEAMinisterial Conference on Nuclear Power in the 21st Century October 26-28 | Washington, D.C., USA For the first time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)Nuclear Power Ministerial will be hosted by the U.S., which operates the largest fleet of reactors. The conference will provide a forum for ministers, policymakers, senior officials and experts to engage in high-level dialogue on the role of nuclear energy in the clean energy transition, as well as its contribution to sustainable development and climate change mitigation. According to the IAEA[2], about 440 nuclear power reactors operate in 32 countries, producing over a quarter of the world's low-carbon electricity. Recently, we're seeing even more countries express interest in the introduction of nuclear power. The sessions at this conference will cover maintaining the operating fleet, as well as charting a path forward to achieve net zero through improved regulatory oversight, wider deployment of nuclear energy, and increased engagement with younger, more diverse perspectives. United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 November 6-18 | Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt Over 35,000 people are expected to gather at this year's annual climate change conference hosted by the United Nations in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. The latest IPCC report[3] recognized that urgent action needs to be taken to keep the 1.5-degree target set by the Paris Agreement within reach. Egypt is assuming the incoming Presidency of COP27 [4] 'with a clear recognition of the gravity of the global climate challenge and appreciation of the value of multilateral, collective and concerted action as the only means to address this truly global threat.' The vision for this year's conference is moving from planning to implementation, harmonizing global efforts, and strengthening our ability to create a resilient planet. Nuclear energy is key to achieving these goals, and its importance will be highlighted at the event. The nuclear community will use this opportunity to work with policymakers on enhancing global support for nuclear energy, providing access to financing, and expanding capacity for new builds. Stay tuned at nei.org/news[5] for the latest developments coming out of this fall's climate events.

"We absolutely need greater cross-sector collaboration to overcome the barriers that impede the rapid adoption at scale of climate innovation and to realise the full value of the 14 cents of every venture capital dollar spent on climate tech," said Ramadori. "We must collectively think about real, concrete ways that we can motivate adoption at scale, particularly in the traditional sectors of our economy that account for an important part of global GHG emissions, but that have not been accustomed to rapid innovation changes. This is the only way we can achieve the United Nations' objective of reducing emissions by 45% by 2030, reaching net zero by 2050, and ultimately saving the human race." Innovators like BrainBox AI, whose technology lowers commercial real estate carbon footprints by up to 40% and offers energy cost savings of up to 25%, will join established industrial technology leaders like ABB and Arup for a series of panel discussions. The companies will together utilise the global COP27 platform to discuss ways in which climate tech can help ensure a low carbon future. BrainBox AI will join MaRS Discovery District, Resilient LLP, KPMG, and other prominent Canadian climate innovators at COP27 on November 8th for a panel discussion titled ' HYPERLINK Innovative Approaches to Accelerating Cleantech Adoption' . The session, taking place in the Canadian Pavilion, will point to the importance of inclusiveness, collaboration, and coalition-building as features of some Canadian programmes designed to effectively scale and speed up the adoption of low-carbon innovations. Tyler Hamilton, Director of Ecosystem, Cleantech at MaRS said "Cleantech is one of the core sectors we work with in our drive to empower Canada's most promising innovators to make global connections. At COP27 , we are collaborating with BrainBox AI to drive positive economic and environmental impact and help address some of the world's most pressing problems." BrainBox AI has also been invited by leading global technology company and partner ABB to appear at an energy efficiency panel in the International Chamber of Commerce area of COP27 on November 11th. The company will speak about HYPERLINK accelerating energy efficiency in the built environment , alongside the World Green Building Council, the International Standards Organization, and others. Sam Ramadori will speak alongside leading contributors including Morton Wierod, President of ABB Electrification. COP27 is geared towards supporting this transition and highlighting how we can address the world's energy challenges through improved energy efficiency and safe, smart, and sustainable solutions. Much of the technology to achieve this is already available, but it requires more commitment, investment, and collaboration to fully optimise. Innovation also has a key part to play, and we look to partners like BrainBox AI with fresh ideas and approaches to achieve the sustainable future we all need." In addition, BrainBox AI will participate in a webinar hosted by Anton Kotov, Head of Strategy and Business Development, ABB Electrification, on November 15th, alongside Mary de Guzman, Director of ESG at Sleep Country Canada, on the subject of ' HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhopin.com%2Fevents%2Ficc-climate-action%2Fregistration&esheet=52963867&newsitemid=20221108005720&lan=en-US&anchor=Decarbonizing+the+Built+Environment%3A+The+Role+of+IoT%2C+Cloud+and+Artificial+Intelligence%26%238217%3B&index=5&md5=ff2e1d4068f62011227d5ede3a37da8e Decarbonizing the Built Environment: The Role of IoT, Cloud and Artificial Intelligence' .

The following information was released by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES): Statement of Kaveh Guilanpour On the conclusion of COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh: "Against all the odds, and after protracted and tense negotiations that extended well past its scheduled end date, countries at COP27 reached agreement on a way forward on providing loss and damage finance to help the world's most vulnerable countries cope with the devastating impacts of climate change, as well as on a work programme to urgently scale up and implement action to reduce emissions. "That this outcome was achieved in the face of great geopolitical and economic challenges shows that addressing the climate crisis remains at the top of global political priorities. And that is perhaps the most important signal from COP27 . There has been no backsliding. "The agreement on loss and damage finance a highly contentious issue and the top demand of developing countries will offer a glimmer of hope to the most vulnerable people around the world, who are already suffering the devasting impacts of human caused climate change. "Importantly COP27 "While the conference's achievements do not fully respond to the urgency of the climate emergency, they do help to accelerate us along the path toward doing so. "Achieving a significant outcome at COP27 was always going to be difficult, given both the high expectations of responding to the gap in ambition needed to stay on track to remain within the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit of the Paris Agreement, combined with the thin negotiating outcomes mandated for delivery in Sharm El-Sheikh. COP27 was never going to end in a fanfare. But it has ended in modest but real success, despite the challenging context."

The following information was released by the City of Phoenix: One year after attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Councilwoman Yassamin Ansari will be traveling to Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt as the sole representative of the City of Phoenix as part of the U.S. Department of State delegation. Since her inauguration on April 19, 2021, Ansari has led on the passage of Phoenix's Climate Action Plan, chaired the Mayor's Ad Hoc Committee on Electric Vehicles, and unanimously passed the city's Transportation Electrification Action Plan (TEAP). During that time, Phoenix also established the world's first publicly funded Office of Heat Response and Mitigation, hired the city's first Public Health Advisor, and unanimously approved a $150 million request for proposals for zero-emission buses. Ansari will be speaking on these accomplishments on behalf of the city while attending COP27 . "As one of the largest desert cities in the world on the front lines of extreme heat and drought, we need to set an example on how we address these crises, share our successes, and speak directly with other cities and governments to learn more about what has worked in their countries," said Ansari. Meeting with government leaders is not Ansari's only goal for her trip. " COP27 will not only bring governments together, but also NGOs, corporate and industry leaders, and activists. I am working with Phoenix's Community and Economic Development office to set up meetings with executives in the industries of clean energy, public health, and innovation and invite them to bring their high-paying, green jobs to Phoenix." She will be participating in panel discussions on the topics of climate migration, the nexus of extreme heat and homelessness, and water scarcity.

(TNSres) -- The University of Aberdeen issued the following news: The University of Aberdeen will showcase its world-leading research at the upcoming United Nations Conference of the Parties, COP27 . COP27 takes place from 6-18 November in Sharm El-Sheik in Egypt and is an opportunity for the University to discuss its ground-breaking research and global impact with opinion leaders and climate specialists. Last November the eyes of the world were on Scotland when the 26th UN climate change conference, COP26, was held in Glasgow with the University playing its part in the historic event. As part of its 'Road to COP26' activities a series of events were held to encourage staff, students and the north-east community to engage with the climate conference. These included a 'Mock COP' for local school pupils, a series of online seminars on topics such as renewable energy, transport and net-zero and more than 40 staff and students attending the conference, facilitated by the University. A time capsule was also placed in the Cruickshank Botanic Garden containing messages from schoolchildren about their hopes for the environment and future, and from University Principal George Boyne and Chancellor Her Majesty, Camilla, The Queen Consort. The capsule will be opened on Founders' Day 2040 (10 February and the University's 545th birthday). Interdisciplinary Director for Environment and Biodiversity Professor David Burslem said: "Through the Aberdeen 2040 strategy, the University is fully committed to showing leadership in developing a sustainable future for the planet. "We take with us to COP27 expertise in among others environment, climate change, conservation and energy transition and our delegates are dedicated to keeping the conversation going as well as inspiring the next generation of leaders. COP27  The role of soil carbon in mitigating climate change, recently acknowledged by the award of a Queen's Anniversary Prize.  Development of a tool designing sustainable diets that optimise reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture while delivering nutritious food.  Development of the Cool Farm Tool, to aid decision making for climate-smart agriculture.  A tool to examine the environmental impact of peatland windfarms on carbon emissions.  Uncovering the benefits of Assisted Natural Regeneration to enhance carbon accumulation of logged tropical forests. Members of the public will have the opportunity to learn more about COP27 at an online event on Friday 25 November at 2pm. Reflections of COP27 will include a panel discussion on the role of various COP climate change conferences as well as insights from the Aberdeen experts on the debates held at COP27 . A second online event Communities, Biodiversity & Natural Capital - Understanding our relationship with nature is also planned for Friday 16 December which will explore COP15 and the biodiversity theme. Registration for the Global Challenges Seminar Series will open soon.

The following information was released by the Association of European Businesses (AEB): On December 8 , 2022, the AEB held an open event "World Climate Day. Results of COP27 ". COP27 The most discussed outcome of the conference was a step toward climate justice in the form of the launch of a new fund to help countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Renewable energy sources are a priority. Among the positive outcomes was the importance of developing a clean energy system and the explicit mention of renewable energy sources (RES) in this context. This year, a number of countries have made statements about the goal of switching to 100% renewable energy sources. Russia has a huge untapped potential in this direction. The goal of keeping 1.5 degrees Celsius is in jeopardy. At the conference there was a serious debate about the phase-out of all fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), the participating countries could not come to a consensus. Observers from around the world attribute this to pressure from states whose economies are heavily dependent on fossil fuels. The AEB team, for its part, notes the importance of everyone's contribution to improving the environmental situation and minimizing harm to the environment. \</doc>

A sad, dried-out tree with brown crisp leaves stood defeated at the entrance of the Blue Zone at the HYPERLINK United Nations Climate Change Conference , COP27 , in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt. It was potted and surrounded by plexiglass emblazed with the logo of the event; behind it draped massive, colorful vertical banners with the taunting pictures and words, "Water," "Solutions," and "Agriculture & Food Systems." The world leaders who gathered for the past two weeks knew they had to reduce burning fossil fuels by half by 2030 to effectively fight climate change, just like the landscaper who placed the formerly green tree at the entrance knew there should be a drip-irrigation pipe to water the tree. Yet neither happened. " COP27 As a participant, there is something misleadingly exhilarating about these annual global climate gatherings. When you walk through the well-designed pavilions, hear the inspiring speakers, and tap into the renewable energy of the tens of thousands of diverse people who have gathered to save the planet, there is a feeling that perhaps there may be just enough momentum for the kind of political breakthroughs that would be necessary to stave off what the secretary-general called "climate hell." And then I kept walking by the dead tree consumed by the punishing Sinai sun and neglected by the COP27 organizers. COP27 failed. And worse, it failed the most vulnerable people on earth. Yes, there was a moral victory to create a "loss and damage" fund by the rich nations for the poor nations. But those funds, should they ever really materialize, will be to replace bridges in Mozambique destroyed by increased cyclones, provide clean water treatment for communities in Pakistan and Nigeria devasted by recent floods, compensate farmers in Kenya for failed crops due to increased desertification, rebuild key infrastructure in nations in the path of now super-charged hurricanes and more. But the most cost-effective way to help these least developed and most vulnerable nations is to stop beating around the climate bush. Just like no water reached that poor tree in the Blue Zone, next to no climate funds have actually flowed to the poorest of nations since the Paris Climate Accords in 2015. Indeed, the most important yet ignored report issued at COP27 was by Luiza Demoro of BloombergNEF that demonstrated that less than 1 percent of climate finance went to Africa and from that drop in the climate finance ocean, the super majority went to South Africa, Morocco and Egypt and not to Burundi, South Sudan, Malawi, Uganda, Liberia, Mali, Sudan, and the other poorest nations. In other words, the international community has not only failed to cut emissions enough to prevent costly disasters from striking the poorest communities, it has cultivated the lie that the billions it has pledged and deployed actually was utilized where it is needed most. Four painful truths coming out of COP27 : First, making climate loans to poor countries is not climate aid or good policy. It is perpetuating the downward spiral of these fragile economies. Second, the investment strategy of the international community has also failed because it essentially is rooted in a culture of waiting around for specific projects to be developed and de-risked without nurturing them with project development grants or catalytic blended finance. Therefore, advancing transformative climate projects takes forever or projects wither and die before they can reach maturity. I just completed a solar field in the world's poorest country, Burundi, that is supplying 10 percent of the country's generation capacity. Truth be told, it took seven expensive and painful years to develop largely because the international community here I will name the HYPERLINK https://www.newsweek.com/topic/world-bank?utm_source=Synacor&utm_medium=Attnet&utm_campaign=Partnerships World Bank , the African Development Bank and United States Trade and Development Agency found convenient, safe reasons to deny a life-saving flow of funds during its most fragile years, almost killing the endeavor completely. Third, when the international community does eventually get around to financing climate projects in the poorest of countries, it does it so painfully slowly, with cumbersome bidding processes rather than speedy direct deals, project by project, which is no way to scale. The solution is to invest in pan-African platforms that can deliver results across a wide array of markets on the ground faster than any government or fund-of-funds or yet another intermediary body or commission or alliance or consortium to create the appearance of judicious stewardship. Climate wimps. Water the damn tree already and it will blossom. And fourth: Africa could be powered 100 percent by the green energy by 2030 with one simple policy shift by the international community: Give investors certainty and eliminate opportunities for corruption by declaring that all green energy projects across all 54 countries over the next seven years will receive 10 cents per kilowatt hour for 25 years. For smaller projects, provide grants to make up for lack of economies of scale. For larger projects, let investors make money, trillions will flow and a thousand climate projects will bloom from the Sahel to the Kalahari. Water the damn tree already or, at the very least, end the farce that the international community intends to accomplish something transformative on the ground.

Nov 10, 2022( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com http://www.thewrap.com Rainn Wilson, well-known for his popular role as Dwight Schrute in the American version of 'The Office,' has amended his name to Rainnfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson in an effort to bring attention to climate change. 'Hi there, I'm Rainn Wilson, or should I say Rainnfall Heatwave Rising Sea Levels and We Have To Do Something About It Now Wilson. Sorry to get so dark, so quick,' said Wilson on Thursday in a video he posted to his Instagram and Twitter accounts. He went on to explain the environmental changes that are taking place around the Arctic region and how its impacting the world. 'You see what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic. As the polar caps melt, it drives up risks throughout the world, including extreme weather events that affect all of us,' Wilson continued. So, as a cheap little stunt to help save planet Earth, I've changed my named on Twitter, Instagram and even my fancy writing paper.' He went on in his video, sharing he's referring to himself as an 'Arctic Risk Name-changer,' adding that his new name is related to his support of a campaign launched by Arctic Basecamp, a team of Arctic experts and scientists who are working to bring more attention to climate change in the Arctic region by setting up camp in the Arctic and reporting their research findings. Wilson, who plays Dr. Demento in the new film 'Weird: The Al Yankovic Story,' has only written out his new name on his profile; his social media handles haven't changed from '@rainnwilson.' 'Join me@rainnwilson&@arctic.basecampin bringing attention to this growing er, melting issue.We need world leaders atCOP27to take notice and take action. The Arctic is melting at millions of litres per second, yet this problem can't seem to make a name for itself, so it's up to us to make a name for it,' said Wilson in the caption of his video. 'If enough of us do this, then maybe COP27 will be where our world leaders sit up and noticeArctic risks and introduce a solution,' Wilson said, referring to the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference . The conference takes places Nov. 6 to Nov. 8. There, climate change leaders will discuss and strategize ways to Â£ccelerate global climate action through emissions reduction, scaled-up adaptation efforts and enhanced flows of appropriate finance,' per a description for this year's summit.

What's the news? AT&T, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) today announced the launch of the HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anl.gov%2Fccrds%2FClimRR&esheet=52962684&newsitemid=20221107005748&lan=en-US&anchor=Climate+Risk+and+Resilience+Portal+%28ClimRR%29&index=1&md5=8e74c60c08e7d66a5cb4ab332d7caddf Climate Risk and Resilience Portal (ClimRR) , which advances access to cutting-edge science for climate projections to help improve America's preparedness for future climate extremes.

One in three Americans HYPERLINK https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.gallup.com%2Fpoll%2F391508%2Fextreme-weather-affected-one-three-americans.aspx&esheet=52962684&newsitemid=20221107005748&lan=en-US&anchor=say&index=3&md5=4a311798858ea2a266ddf354a54e488e say they have been personally affected by an extreme weather event in the past two years. These impacts, which are becoming more frequent and intense, can vary not just from state to state, but even at the local level. ClimRR provides peer-reviewed climate datasets in a non-technical format into the hands of those who need them most. Community leaders and public safety officials can now understand how increasing climate risks will affect their populations. Access to this information will assist leaders as they invest in infrastructure and response capabilities to protect communities for future generations. What are people saying? "Harnessing the power of our supercomputers, we are making cutting edge climate data available to local planning officials to help them take the needed actions to become more climate resilient," said Argonne Director Paul Kearns. "While fortifying the AT&T network against climate change is critical for the millions of people who rely on the connectivity we provide, resiliency can't be built in a vacuum," said Charlene Lake, chief sustainability officer and SVP-Corporate Social Responsibility at AT&T. "That's why we're excited to work closely with FEMA and Argonne to get it into the right hands."

The following information was released by Greenpeace: After an anti-climatic two weeks, the 27th UN Conference on Climate Change has officially ended. Was it a success? After a weak second week, battling the polluting interests of the record high fossil fuel industry representatives in attendance, negotiations went into overtime through Saturday night, with the dash to a finish line resulting in the last minute establishment of the Loss and Damage facility fund early on Sunday morning, officially closing the climate talks. This fund was desperately needed to begin addressing the climate impacts already affected communities and countries around the world, and represents a high point in an otherwise disappointing COP. Although the fund is a victory for climate justice, an agreement on an urgently needed fossil fuel phase out did not materialise and resulted in yet another year of lack of accountability for polluters. A critical number of countries did, however, call and rally for fossil fuels to be addressed in this year's final agreement and this will only increase pressure at COP28 next year to finally end the era of fossil fuels. What was decided? COP27 was billed as an 'implementation COP' and the 'Africa COP' but little was put on the table to actually implement and even less support for the African nations on the frontlines of the climate crisis. The long overdue loss and damage fund was indeed a success but politics got in the way of achieving impacting progress in realising 1.5C targets agreed in Paris. Governments had pledged to come to COP27 with strengthened national climate plans that will limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Those pledges went unmet, despite some encouraging initiatives earlier in the week, and Sharm el-Sheikh may be remembered as the moment when leaders gave up on limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Despite what did and did not end up in the final agreement at COP27 , meaningful climate action will only continue to become more urgent than ever. What's next for climate action globally? The new climate deal is a long way from the action we need now. Moving forward into discussion of the details of the Fund, ensuring that the countries and corporations most responsible for the climate crisis make the biggest contribution, is vital. But climate justice will only be served when there is new and additional support and finance for climate vulnerable communities not just distributed for loss and damage, but for adaptation and mitigation too. But tackling climate change and promoting climate justice is not a zero sum game. It's not about winners and losers. Either we will make progress on all fronts or we all lose. The planet will not compromise. \</doc>

Anna Granskog: I see one imperative in particular for leaders at COP27 , and that's to stop treating sustainability, resilience, economic growth and the well-being of the population as a trade-off-rather than two objectives moving towards the same goal. And what do I mean by that? I'll give you three examples. Take green business building, the scaling of clean technologies. There's an enormous opportunity to put in place the things we need to get on a net-zero pathway, from which we are now too far away. But it's also a way to generate a lot of new jobs, to generate growth, and to generate wealth. So it's absolutely not a trade-off, but two things moving in the same direction. Second would be efficiency. It's an old story, but we've seen with the current European energy crisis how we actually managed to significantly improve energy efficiency very rapidly. And that applies to both economic value creation as well as better sustainability. The same goes for material circularity, and the need to really push ourselves to implement existing solutions we know will work. And finally, the well-being of people and sustainability actually go hand in hand. People would enjoy more clean water and clean air, although it will, of course, require investments to scale green and clean technologies. But there is a clear alignment, and I would wish that leaders see this alignment, rather than a false contradiction between well-being and sustainability. And I hope we can make progress by accepting these conclusions at COP27 .

PR Newswire On November 6, 2022, the 27th UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) kicked off in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The conference focuses on "implementation" and discusses climate issues from\~a practical level. As the only Chinese bus brand serving COP27 , thirty units of Higer's electric buses provide the zero-carbon shuttle service for the conference. Higer bus, China's leading clean technology bus company, shows the commitment and strength to serve such international conferences and provides China's solution to climate challenges in the global public transportation industry. The buses, jointly built by Higer and\~its Egyptian partner, G Company, are operated between Sharm el-Sheikh, the blue zone and green zone of the venue, providing excellent services for government officials and international organization representatives. The futuristic design language, zero-carbon emissions and comfortable riding experience have attracted the attention and praise of people from all walks of life.

The following information was released by United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR): Coming on the heels of a year that saw many climate-driven disasters, including the recent devastation in Pakistan, it is no wonder that addressing the impacts of these disasters was front and centre at COP27 , which was dubbed the "implementation COP." The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction went into this COP with a central message of creating a world with "Zero Climate Disasters." At the heart of this approach is the need to reduce emissions to prevent the creation of new climate risks, and the need to accelerate climate change adaptation to manage current and future risks. Indeed, it was clear at the COP that disaster risk reduction is one of the key means to accelerate action against the climate emergency. As COP27 closes, UNDRR warmly welcomes the establishment of a loss and damage fund as a historic achievement for climate justice. Its establishment is a recognition that the countries that have contributed the least to creating the climate crisis, should not be left to bear the costs of disasters, on their own. Another welcome achievement is the agreement on defining the operational and institutional arrangement of the Santiago Network. This paves the way for the provision of technical assistance to vulnerable developing countries to avert, minimize and address losses and damages. UNDRR was also honoured to join the UN Secretary-General and the World Meteorological Organization for the launch of the Action Plan to realize the s Early Warnings for All initiative, which aims to ensure that every person on the planet is protected by early warning systems by the year 2027. Accomplishing this initiative would be transformative for the world, leading to drastic reductions in disaster mortality, the number of affected people, and economic losses. As a result, it would significantly contribute to the achievement of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and enable the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We also congratulate our partners on several other launches at COP27 , including: The launch of the Global Shield Against Climate Risk, by the G7 and the V20 group of climate-vulnerable countries; The launch of the International Drought Resilience Alliance by Spain and Senegal, with support from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification; and The launch of the Infrastructure Resilience Accelerator Fund, by the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). We are also pleased to have strengthened our collaboration with partners, such as the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) and the InsuResilience Global Partnership, to better deliver support to countries and communities. This includes joining the Adaptation Action Coalition to lead its workstream on disaster risk reduction, which was launched at COP. These are only some of the accomplishments at COP27 that UNDRR has been involved in and which we are glad to support. That said, we are disappointed to see that COP27 fell short in some key areas. Most notably, we had hoped to see greater commitments to reducing emissions to keep the 1.5 degree limit within reach. In the absence of such reductions, new climate and disaster risks will continue to be created, which threatens to overwhelm adaptation and response capacities. As the UN Secretary-General said, "a fund for loss and damage is essential but it's not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map or turns an entire African country to a desert." That is why as we look ahead to COP28, under the Presidency of the United Arab Emirates, we hope parties will take a giant leap in climate ambition to match the crisis at hand. We also hope to see better progress on delivering more funding for climate change adaptation. Countries must make good on the long-delayed promise of delivering $100 billion a year for developing countries. This includes dedicated funding for the Early Warnings for All initiative and the Santiago Network, in addition to expanding access to lending through the Bridgetown Initiative. COP27 broke new ground in key areas but fell short in others. Nevertheless, we remain determined to build on the progress made to date and to help all countries realize a future with no disasters. \</doc>

The COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh has triggered a negative fallout for Egypt\\x92s authoritarian regime which stands accused of human rights abuses -- and has been widely condemned for its longstanding repressive campaign against dissidents and civil society organizations (CSOs). Writing in the current issue of Time magazine, Sahar Aziz, a professor at Rutgers University in the US, says "the Egyptian government has given summit access only to local governmental NGOs that support the regime". COP27 should be an opportunity for Egypt to lead by example. Instead, hosting the event seems like a political cover for its self-defeating repression of civil society, writes Aziz, author of \\x91The Racial Muslim: When Racism Quashes Religious Freedom\\x92. In a hard-hitting statement released last week, Amnesty International (AI) said the arrest of hundreds of people in the past two weeks alone, in connection to calls for protests during the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), is a reminder of the grim reality of Egypt\\x92s policy of mass arbitrary detention to crush dissent. At least 151 detainees are currently being investigated by the Supreme State Security Prosecution, while hundreds more have faced shorter arrests and questioning. \\x93The arrest of hundreds of people merely because they were suspected of supporting the call for peaceful protests raises serious concerns over how the authorities will respond to people wishing to protest during COP27 \\x96 an essential feature of any UN climate conference\\x94. \\x93The Egyptian authorities must allow peaceful demonstrators to gather freely and refrain from using unlawful force or arbitrary arrests to deter protests,\\x94 said Philip Luther, Amnesty International\\x92s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director. \\x93World leaders arriving in Sharm El-Sheikh for COP27 must not be fooled by Egypt\\x92s public relations (PR) campaign. Away from the dazzling resort hotels, thousands of individuals including human rights defenders, journalists, peaceful protesters and members of the political opposition continue to be detained unjustly,\\x94 \\x93They must urge President Abdelfattah al-Sisi to release all those arbitrarily held for exercising their human rights. As a matter of urgency, this should include imprisoned activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, who today escalated his hunger strike to stop drinking water.\\x94 Mandeep S. Tiwana, Chief Programmes Officer at CIVICUS, the global civil society alliance, told IPS that hosting a global conference such as COP 27 places a special obligation on Egypt\\x92s government to respect and enable the exercise of fundamental freedoms as per international law. \\x93The right to protest peacefully and the right against arbitrary detention are essential elements of international law. In the present instance, Egypt\\x92s government can easily order the release of arbitrarily imprisoned prisoners of conscience and allow protests to take place without impediments as a sign of good faith,\\x94 he declared. In a joint op-ed piece last week, Gadir Lavadenz, Global Coordinator, Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice and Lidy Nacpil, Executive Director, Asian Peoples\\x92 Movement on Debt and Development, write: climate conferences are increasingly becoming spaces for greenwashing of not just the big polluters' crimes, but also of the regimes and presidencies hosting COP. \\x93COP27 is taking place in the Southern Sinai city of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, and as all eyes turn to Egypt, the campaigns to Free Alaa and other political prisoners, as well as for civic space to open up in Egypt, is gaining momentum\\x94. At a UN press briefing November 7, several questions were raised about reports that the official COP app apparently requires access to the user's location, their email, and their photos. \\x93This is in Egypt, but it's a UN run conference. What is the UN's view on the fact that this seems to be trolling for sensitive data and could be tracking people?\\x94 And secondly, the wi fi at COP, which is a UN conference, is apparently restricting access to human rights organizations and some news organizations. What's your reaction to those?\\x94 In her response, St\\xE9phanie Tremblay, Associate Spokesperson, said: \\x93We have seen these reports. Let me start with the app. First of all, this app does not belong to the UN, so I will not have more comments on that.\\x94 \\x93But one thing that is important to note is that the UN itself through the UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] has an app, and everyone at the UN has been encouraging everyone to download and use this app\\x94. And then, as a general rule, \\x93we advocate freedom of information, freedom of the press. That applies to everywhere around the world. For us, access is important, and we want to make sure that everyone that has to work is able to do the work they are there to do to the best\\x94, said Tremblay. Meanwhile, in its World Report 2022, Human Rights Watch said Egyptian authorities escalated the use of abusive Emergency State Security Courts to prosecute peaceful activists and critics who joined thousands of dissidents already in the country\\x92s congested prisons. And Courts issued death sentences in mass trials, adding to the sharply escalating number of executions. \\x93The government in January issued implementing regulations for the 2019 NGO law that codified draconian restrictions on independent organizations. The authorities failed to appropriately investigate a high-profile gang-rape, and key witnesses remain under extrajudicial travel bans after being jailed for months in apparent retaliation for coming forward.\\x94 HRW also said the army continues to impose severe restrictions on movement and demolished hundreds of buildings in north Sinai in the name of fighting Wilayat Sinai, a local affiliate of the Islamic State (ISIS). Yet over the same period, Amnesty International has documented the arrest of double that number; 1,540 people who were questioned over the exercising of free speech and association. In the past six months, Amnesty International has gathered data from dozens of lawyers who regularly attend interrogations and detention renewal hearings, reviewed court decisions and other official documents, and interviewed former prisoners as well as relatives of detainees. In recent weeks, security forces have arrested and detained hundreds of people in downtown Cairo and town squares across Egyptian cities over content on their phones \\x97 a tactic often employed by police ahead of expected protests. While most were released within hours or days, some were taken to prosecutors, while others remain subject to enforced disappearance according to 11 lawyers in Cairo, Alexandria, Sharqiya and Dakahliya. In September, Abdelsalam Abdelghani, 55, was arrested at his home on the outskirts of Cairo. Prosecutors questioned him about a Facebook group called \\x93Our right\\x94, including posts calling for protests on 11 November. The prosecutor questioned him on accusations of spreading \\x93false news\\x94 and being \\x93a member of a terrorist group\\x94 before ordering his detention pending an investigation, according to Amnesty International. According to the website of the Egyptian presidency for COP27 , anyone wishing to organize protests in Sharm El-Sheikh must inform the authorities 36 hours in advance and show the organizers a COP27 badge. Protests will only be allowed between 10:00-17:00 in an area far from the conference and monitored by cameras. The authorities have also limited the content of protests to climate related issues. Amnesty International finds these measures to be unnecessary and disproportionate, aimed at restricting the ability of individuals to protest safely in a way that allows them to be seen and heard.

Nov 18, 2022( African Arguments: HYPERLINK http://www.africanarguments.org http://www.africanarguments.org A panel of experts and institutional actors reflect on what's happened at the climate talks so far. This year's UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) is taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Credit: Ministry of Environment, Rwanda. COP27 asking 'is this really Africa's COP?'. This is some of what the participants had to say. John Asafu-Adjaye[2], Senior Fellow, ACET COP27 . Historically, Africa has received more finance for mitigation than adaptation, so going into the conference, African negotiators have been pushing to increase funding for adaptation. This is especially important as we have all seen the rise in climate-related extreme events such as floods, insect infestations, cyclones, and droughts in recent years. However, rich countries seem to prefer funding mitigation, likely because the results are very easy to see. You can count how many megawatts of solar panels have been installed, and how much carbon has been removed. With adaptation, there are more human factors that are harder to quantify. There are three things that need to happen next: unlocking the climate finance for adaptation that is already available; holding the rich countries to their commitments; and reforming the global financial architecture, to make climate finance more accessible to African countries. These reforms go beyond COP27 , but they are urgently needed. With the current global financial architecture, it is very complicated for African countries to access finance. There is a lack of flexibility in the process, leading to long delays. Many countries have to co-finance to access climate funds, which is difficult when they have debt and other fiscal challenges. There are also internal challenges of poor governance and corruption, with climate funds not ending up in the right places. So we need to put our houses in order to make sure that we are able to utilise the funds. Kabo Nginya, strategic communications/climate change activist, Botswana As youth, we have a strong platform right now, because leaders are open to hearing what we want to say, even though our ideas are not always taken into account. What we want is to have the opportunity to also help implement policies coming out of COP27 . The main worry of the youth is that the policies will not be implemented. We do not want to have the same talks at COP28 next year because nothing has been done. To ensure that this happens, we need to act as a collective, and we need to be unified. A lack of implementation is a big concern, particularly for loss and damage. There has been a lot of loss and damage as a result of climate change, and this is disproportionately affecting the youth. It is a remarkable point for the topic to be on the agenda for this COP, but it remains an open question whether countries will actually commit to paying for loss and damage and follow through. Bogolo Kenewendo[3], UNFCCC High Level Climate Champions' Africa Director and ACET Board Member At COP27 , people are tired of hearing about pledges; we want to see the money. Many delegates have badges saying WTF - 'where is the finance?'. Fortunately, on the non-state actor side, there has been good momentum in this regard. The African Development Bank and partners have launched the green investment platform, and money is flowing in from philanthropists, the private sector, and other non-state actors. For the first time, we see African insurers and reinsurers make a commitment to underwrite sudden and extreme climate shocks and work towards creating a climate risk facility of $2 billion which will cover well over $14 billion worth of losses for the most vulnerable African populations. This facility will help build early warning and response systems. There has also been a commitment by the Africa Business Leaders Coalition - 60 of the biggest African businesses that in total employ over 1 million people around the continent - on key actions to meet the Paris Agreement and support Africa's just transition. The African Carbon Markets Initiative is another crucial development, even though there remains a large discrepancy in carbon pricing - with carbon credits in Africa priced much lower than the global average - that should be resolved. This kind of momentum is really what has given us more fuel to last through the next three days of COP, but much work remains to be done post- COP27 . COP27 We have done a lot to ensure that the voices of young people from Africa are being taken into account in deliberations at COP27 . Leading up to the conference, we conducted a series of consultations to identify the needs and challenges faced by young people. At the Africa Climate Week in Gabon, where 100 young Africans attended, we talked about the need for capacity building and the importance of having an intergenerational dialogue rather than siloed conversations. Since then, we have held two roundtable discussions on Youth Day in November, where young experts and practitioners interacted with ministers and other global leaders. We have also held a series of virtual consultations with different youth-led coalitions in Africa. For the first time, there is a Children and Youth Pavilion, and there are discussions every other day between the youth and Prime Ministers, Ministers, and different key actors to make sure we can come up with solutions together. Through all that work, we are placing youth voices at the forefront - and we are ensuring that the perspectives of those who could not join us here physically are represented. Margaret Impraim[5], Capacity Building and Education Officer, Youth Climate Council, Ghana African youth wanted participation and representation at COP, and this has largely been achieved - we are well represented. I am very happy with the youth pavilion, and with the degree of access that young people have to policymakers. At COP27 , and at the previous COP in Glasgow, government stakeholders have come to the youth and listened to us. However, my concern is that, in as much as the stakeholders hear our voices, they also tend to hide our voices. Often leaders seem to listen to us out of a sense of obligation, but when we look at policies, very little is actually implemented. Looking post-COP, we want to make sure that the youth - who are the main victims of climate change - are also taken seriously because we are also the creators of climate change solutions. Implementation is crucial and so far, we have not had our inputs taken into consideration. Tim McDonnell,[6] Reporter with Quartz The level of leadership from African heads of state, community leaders, and others has been an important development at COP27 . With these voices taking a more prominent role in the process, there has been a strong push for more accountability on adaptation financing. At the same time, there has been movement on the African carbon markets initiative, which is an interesting climate finance solution to keep track of, as it could connect African countries more closely to net-zero initiatives in Europe and the US. There has also been a greater level of scrutiny on fossil fuel development in Africa, with leaders and activists asking important questions: What should Africa's energy pathways look like moving forward? Are fossil fuel extraction projects - which are mostly backed by oil and gas companies from Europe and the US - actually beneficial to African economies? Are they increasing the access to energy for the people living in those countries? I have also been really heartened to see the role that human rights activists and Egyptian civil society groups have played at COP. The conference has provided a platform for them on the international stage to raise domestic concerns, and provided them with opportunities like holding a press conference, or having a protest or a rally - things that are ordinarily either impossible or very risky to do in Cairo. Natasha Kimani[7], Research & Media Program Lead, Africa No Filter Narrative matters: our opinions inform beliefs, beliefs inform actions, and actions inform investment, programme developments, and interventions on climate change in Africa. So when we think about narratives in the context of COP27 , are we actually centring the voices, opinions, and thoughts of Africans? Or are we assuming that there is a lack of agency and lack of involvement? Our initial research carried out between 2021 and 2022 shows that a majority of the conversations that are taking place around climate change do not centre African voices. The people who are leading the conversations, programmes, and investments around climate change are not the people who should be at the centre of these conversations. In fact, the face of climate change in Africa is not an African - it is Greta Thunberg. And that is problematic. Our research also shows that - despite this lack of representation - there is a lot of work taking place on climate change in Africa, especially at the grassroots level. We need to ensure that we are centring and framing those African voices and reflecting African everyday experiences - at COP27 and beyond. This means a narrative that is focused on young African voices and the things that are affecting their lives. It also means ensuring that Africans are not viewed as lacking agency or needing salvation, but as people very aware of what they need, especially when it comes to loss and damage finance. Programmes need to be developed in a way that reflects those needs and actually helps the affected people to recover from the impacts of climate change. Agnes Kalibata, President of the AGRA One of the things that I am most proud of is that - for the first time at a COP - there have been serious conversations about climate and the food system. The food system pavilion has given everybody an opportunity to chime in and ensure that the right conversations are being had around food insecurity, which is urgently needed as the number of food-insecure people is on the rise. However, there is a serious lack of urgency at COP27 when it comes to the fact that we might exceed 1.5C of global warming. I keep saying it and I will say it again: there is no place for Africa in a 1.5-degree world. And we need stronger commitments to come through for people who are already struggling. There has been some positive movement: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation committed $1.4 billion and the IFC $16 billion towards adaptation, and a number of countries including Sweden, Ireland, and the Netherlands, recommitted to this agenda. But all of this is not strong enough, given the warnings from the IPCC reports about what is coming our way. As a continent, while we put pressure on the world to come through on adaptation and mitigation, we also need to think of a plan B, which means we start finding our own solutions. We have things we can start doing and double down on - like working together to plant more trees, regenerate our soil, and reduce post-harvest losses.

Science was front and center at the UN's COP27 climate change conference in Egypt on Thursday, with experts presenting the latest findings and many sounding the alarm about the dangers of missing the Paris Agreement's goals. The day started with a session on the latest assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which warns that none of the more hopeful scenarios will be attainable without swift action to slash emissions. "Today, the scientific community has never been more certain and clearer about man-made climate change," said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee. In another live-streamed session, independent research group Climate Action Tracker (CAT) presented its latest update , suggesting that the world is still on track for 2.4\'c2\'b0C of warming under current 2030 targets \'e2\â¬ with no improvement seen since last year. CAT called for stronger policies to meet the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5\'c2\'b0C and also warned that the "goldrush for gas" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine risks further undermining efforts to tackle climate change. CAT's analysis also emphasizes the importance of curbing methane emissions, which will be discussed at COP27 on Friday. Methane Pledge Host country and COP27 president Egypt has designated Friday as decarbonization day, with leading oil and gas industry executives expected to speak. The US and EU will use the occasion to highlight the Global Methane Pledge they unveiled last year at COP26 in Glasgow. Around 100 countries committed in Glasgow to collectively reduce methane emissions 30% by 2030. That total has since climbed to 122, with more potentially ready to join. China could be among those edging closer to membership. It didn't sign up in Glasgow last year but it did say that it would draw up an "ambitious national action plan" to address its methane emissions. At a COP27 side-event on Tuesday hosted by the World Bank, China's climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua confirmed that plan was now ready and said China was willing to cooperate with other countries to curb methane emissions. Action Plans The Clean Air Task Force says it expects around 40 countries to turn words about methane emissions into deeds at COP27 by unveiling action plans, detailed roadmaps, stronger regulations and new financing. The US and EU may also unveil some additional methane initiatives that could target the energy sector, as well as steps to improve the monitoring and reporting of methane emissions. Kayrros, which uses satellite data to track methane emissions, says that there has not been a significant reduction in emissions from the largest sources around the world this year, "leaving Global Methane Pledge ambitions out of reach." But Kayrros co-founder and president Antoine Rostand suggests it is not too late to turn things around. "Based on our analysis, it is entirely achievable that with the right policy and incentives, we could eliminate all serious emitters and even exceed the Global Methane Pledge commitments by 2030," he said. Similarly the UN Environment Programme has recently stated that the oil and gas industry could reduce its methane emissions by up to 75% by 2030 and that reining in methane emissions is the single fastest way to tackle climate change.

(TNStalk) -- WWF Global issued the following statement on Nov. 17, 2022:    As COP27 negotiations enter their final hours, WWF calls for parties to intensify their efforts to deliver breakthrough agreements on key issues that are far from agreement and have seen little progress so far this week. For WWF, so far the summit is failing to deliver on the 'implementation' theme prioritised by the Egyptian presidency. Negotiators must channel all their energy into ensuring this COP leaves a positive impact on the global challenge of tackling the climate and biodiversity crises.    Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF Global Climate and Energy Lead and COP20 President, said: "Parties and the Egyptian Presidency must inject renewed purpose and energy into negotiations to secure breakthrough agreements on key issues in the final hours at COP27 . Faced with the possibility of a low ambition outcome with gaps in key areas, talks must rapidly intensify, and culminate in new agreements and a powerful cover decision that sets the tone for the year ahead. We cannot afford to have so many negotiation areas go unresolved until the next COP. We don't have time for more delays and excuses. "This was intended to be a COP for implementation, where governments could showcase their progress and commit to significant new climate finance, action and targets, but that is not what we have seen. Hopes were then placed on technical negotiations delivering new processes, structures, and frameworks to drive emission reduction, resilience building and finance. But yet again, we have also seen talks stall, with parties and groups at odds on a range of issues, and some looking to delay key decisions. "However, from loss and damage financing to mitigation, adaptation, and the Koronivia agriculture and food talks, there remains hope that COP27 can still achieve a strong outcome. Negotiators must seize this moment and do everything possible to secure a positive legacy. Every moment matters now. We are in a race against time to prevent the climate crisis spiraling out of control." On the pivotal issue of loss and damage, WWF is urging negotiators to agree to a finance facility. After a year of devastating climate-related weather impacts around the world, including devastating flooding in Pakistan and droughts in Eastern Africa, it is vital a facility is established with concrete money on the table. And on adaptation, WWF wants to see a roadmap agreed that doubles adaptation finance, with 50% of public climate finance earmarked for adaptation that builds community and ecosystem resilience. This is particularly important when the COP is happening in Africa, one of the most vulnerable continents to climate impacts. Other key issues that need to be resolved include the establishment of the landmark new Mitigation Work Programme; a way forward to meet existing finance commitments and agreement on a new overall climate finance target to replace the existing $100bn annual target; a way forward for the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture; and agreement on the details of carbon market and non-market mechanisms (Article 6). As the two-week summit in Sharm El-Sheikh draws to a close, parties will also be looking to influence the COP27 cover decision - the talk's main political outcome, that has the potential to send powerful political and policy signals. WWF is urging parties to raise their ambition further from COP26 in Glasgow and commit to limiting warming to below 1.5 C by agreeing on phasing out all fossil fuels in the COP27 cover decision and closing the emission, finance and resilience gaps. A WWF report published this week, Our Climate's Secret Ally, highlighted that nature has absorbed 54% of humanity's carbon dioxide emissions over the past 10 years, slowing global warming. WWF argues that the value of nature should be appropriately recognised in the final COP27 cover decision, including a mention of the important role of nature-based solutions to address the climate crisis. On the inclusion of civil society at COP27 , Pulgar-Vidal added, "From the outset, this COP did not create the conditions for the effective participation of civil society. WWF strongly believes that the organisation of all COPs must be based on full access and effective participation of civil society in all UNFCCC-related processes and events." The climate crisis will affect different people and places unevenly, and so is likely to lead to inequalities within and across nations, and create injustice. All climate action must ensure it also helps improve human rights and social equity, according to WWF.

The following information was released by the U.S. Grains Council: Pictured from left to right, Isabelle Ausdal, U.S. Grains Council (USGC) manager of global ethanol policy and economics; Jad Wakileh, USGC consultant; and USGC Ethanol Advisory-Team lead Doug Berven, vice president of corporate affairs at POET, attended the COP27 event earlier this month in Egypt. The event brought together representatives from 197 nations to discuss how to jointly address climate change. Earlier this month, U.S. Grains Council (USGC) representatives traveled to Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to participate in the 2022 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), an event held each year where 197 nations come together to discuss how to jointly address climate change. While attending COP27 , the Council participated in two panels and met with representatives from climate and agricultural associations to discuss ethanol as a climate solution pathway for the transport sector at the regional and global levels. USGC Manager of Global Ethanol Policy and Economics Isabelle Ausdal and Jad Wakileh, USGC consultant, along with Ethanol Advisory Team lead Doug Berven, vice president of corporate affairs at POET, took part in the event. "The future of our food and energy systems are interlinked in climate. It's not about tradeoffs between greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions, nutrition availability and energy security. If we properly communicate the benefits of conventional fuels such as ethanol, we can achieve all of the above," Ausdal said. Berven represented the Council on two panels at the event. "Seven years ago, at COP21, agriculture and biofuels were viewed as a problem for climate change. This year at COP27 , agriculture and biofuels were very well represented and offered potentially the greatest solutions for climate change and other global challenges," Berven said. "Biofuels are a catalyst to successful agriculture. Successful agriculture is key to solving the world's most pressing issues, including climate change, poverty, hunger and disease. It was clear at COP27 that this message is being heard around the world." The first panel, "Are we faltering on the fossil fuel phase-out?," was hosted by the Sustainable Innovation Forum. In this diverse panel, Berven highlighted ethanol as an immediately available tool for decarbonization that supports local economies while also providing food and fuel. The second panel, "Agriculture's Role in Decarbonizing the Economy and Reducing GHG Emissions," was hosted by the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) and organized by Solutions for the Land, a nonprofit offering national and global advocacy for land-based solutions to world problems. Berven highlighted new technologies being deployed by ethanol plants to further lower carbon intensity (CI) score through enhanced carbon capture and storage (CCS) and lowering emissions at the farm level. "There has previously been little-to-no representation for first-generation biofuels, especially ethanol, at large-scale, global events such as COP27 . It is important to further elevate ethanol's profile at such events in the future to be included in the climate narrative. The ethanol industry has a critical story to tell and more people need to hear it," Ausdal said. As a result of COP27 participation, the Council introduced and advocated for ethanol within the visible, formal global climate conversation, and by doing so, positioned it to be on the agenda at COP28 through the Council's involvement with universities, related NGOs, the U.S. government and multilateral entities. Post navigation About The U.S. Grains Council The U.S. Grains Council develops export markets for U.S. barley, corn, sorghum and related products including distiller's dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and ethanol.

The following information was released by the World Resources Institute (WRI): Add to Calendar10/18/2022 8:00 am 10/18/2022 9:00 am 15 COP27 Priorities: An African Perspective COP27 October 18, 2022-3 - 4pm EAT The climate catastrophe has placed some of the toughest obligations on African nations. In the coming ten years, rising temperatures, droughts, and floods will continue to worsen. With many of Africa's countries yet to meet development targets, the continent grows more vulnerable as these impacts of climate change intensify. Despite significant commitments made to support Africa mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis, there remains a long way to go. COP27 , slated to take place in Egypt this November, is an opportunity for leaders, particularly those from developed countries, to show how they'll step up to support vulnerable developing countries in their efforts to address frequent and severe climate impacts, irreversible losses and damages, and their transition to a low-carbon future. On October 18th, join WRI Africa and our partners to hear about the continent's challenges, the progress needed - across restoration and food, energy, cities, adaptation and loss and damage, the possibilities for achieving them, and where the path might lead through COP27 and beyond. The event will be hosted in English with simultaneous interpretation in French. Moderator: Wanjira Mathai, Managing Director for Africa and Global Partnerships Speakers to be announced soon. \</doc>

Posted 11/7/2022 When incentivizing a greener, more sustainable economy, countries should ensure new subsidy programs do not discriminate against other World Trade Organization members, the head of the organization said on Monday, arguing that a "subsidy war" would prove counterproductive and put lower-income countries further behind. Speaking at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 Asked about the recent frustrations voiced by some WTO members -- including the European Union, Japan and South Korea -- over the U.S.' Inflation Reduction Act, which includes a slew of subsidies and incentives aimed at greening the economy, Okonjo-Iweala noted the parties are in talks on the issue and said that is exactly what the WTO encourages. "What we think is important is for members, when they feel this is the case, to be able to talk to each other and try to solve these problems through talking together, through dialogue," she said during a press conference at COP27 about the WTO's new report. "We hope these discussions will yield fruit so that we don't have to deal with trade frictions at the WTO." The goal is to avoid "some kind of race to the bottom," she said. Speaking to Bloomberg TV the same day, she added, "We don't want a subsidy war. We don't want it to degenerate to the lowest common denominator where, you know, countries cannot compete because they don't have the money to give these subsidies." Still, she said, many subsidies can be good -- and an important part of climate mitigation -- if they are not favoring domestic products over foreign ones. The director-general did not say whether she thought the U.S. measures -- in particular, a tax credit that favors North American-produced electric vehicles -- violated WTO rules, but she argued broadly that international trade has been undervalued and underdiscussed as a part of climate solutions, calling it "one of the missing parts of the puzzle" for more ambitious and effective climate-related measures. To that end, she warned countries not to create fragmented "trade blocs" during the green transition. "Despite forces threatening to pull apart the world community, we must not decouple economies and create separate trade blocs lest we impair the success of climate action. The fragmentation of supply chains into regional groupings and the reshoring of manufacturing risks delaying the transition to a green economy and making it far more costly," she said at COP27 . "Tackling climate change requires strategic cooperation right alongside the strategic competition that we know exists." Accordingly, she called on world leaders to "join the WTO in laying out a trade roadmap for a just and ambitious response to climate change." This roadmap, she said in an op-ed for the Financial Times, should be "a menu of trade actions for countries to draw upon when revising their national climate targets (or nationally determined contributions) -- in line with their different levels of development." She cited a few examples of such "concrete actions," including "to help facilitate trade in environmental goods and services, put a price on greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonise supply chains and make them more resilient to climate shocks, scale up circular business models and promote secure and sustainable food systems." A previous effort at the WTO to lower tariffs and other barriers for environmental goods stalled in 2016, but calls to revive it, in some form, have grown in recent years, including from U.S. lawmakers in both parties. Asked at the press conference about the previous version, she said she would like to see the negotiations restarted, suggesting WTO members start with "a limited set of environmental goods and services." "By lowering tariff and regulatory barriers to trade in environmental goods and services, we can further drive costs down and accelerate even broader clean energy deployment," she added in her op-ed. Okonjo-Iweala, to Bloomberg TV, also echoed her past calls for governments to task the WTO and other international organizations with establishing a global carbon price and said a "framework" was already in the works. The framework would create a global carbon pricing system that takes into account factors like countries' historical contributions to emissions and level of development and income, among others. -- Hannah Monicken ( HYPERLINK mailto:hmonicken@iwpnews.com hmonicken@iwpnews.com \</doc>

(TNStalk) -- The Center for American Progress issued the following statement on Nov. 21, 2022:    After the close of the United Nations' 27th Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), Frances Colon, senior director for International Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress, issued the following statement. For the first time, COP27 leaders have acknowledged the urgent need to help developing countries on the front lines of the climate crisis by agreeing to establish a financial mechanism to address loss and damage. This was the defining issue of COP27 . The final text also calls for multilateral banks to step up and mobilize climate finance at the scale required to reach the goals set forth by the Paris Agreement. These are critical steps in tackling the disproportionate impacts of climate change on the world's most vulnerable communities. Unfortunately, without immediate and significant emissions reductions, the world faces a near-term future where loss and damage will overwhelm our institutions and undermine our ability to adapt. The final text reflects the outsized and corrupting presence of fossil fuel and big agricultural lobbyists at COP27 , compounded by a lack of ambition from key, high-emitting countries. The agreement makes only a passing reference to the 1.5-degree Celsius warming goal and does not include any new language on phasing down or phasing out all fossil fuels - the only way to reach emissions reduction goals and secure a livable future. World leaders also failed to reference the twin, interlocking crises of nature loss and climate change, and declined to link COP27 to next month's U.N. biodiversity summit in Montreal. Further progress on global climate action is only possible when all voices are represented in the discussion. There was a jarring lack of female negotiators at COP27 - making up a mere 34 percent of country negotiating teams. Women, young people, and Indigenous communities continue to lead the movement for greater climate ambition centered on justice. It is because of their continual advocacy that the loss and damage process made progress and they must have a greater seat at the table moving forward.

The following information was released by Dartmouth College: Climate scientists Melody Brown Burkins, Justin Mankin, and Jonathan Winter, and Kate Yeo '25who moderated a panel at COP27 on youth climate activismreflect on the United Nations climate summit. Kate Yeo '25 talks to Channel News Asia about youth climate activism at COP27 . PreviousNext For climate activists and scientists alike, this year's global climate change summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, yielded mixed results. COP27the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changeestablished a global fund to compensate countries that are the most vulnerable to climate catastrophes, but no steps were taken to reduce carbon emissions and fossil fuels, or to stop global average temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsiusa threshold beyond which scientists say the risk of climate disasters rises significantly. In an effort to better understand the summit's outcomes, we checked in with four of the many Dartmouth community members whose work focuses on climate change: Institute of Arctic Studies Director Melody Brown Burkins, Guarini '95, '98, geography professors Justin Mankin and Jonathan Winter, and climate activist and environmental studies major Kate Yeo '25. Burkins also serves as a senior associate director at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, an adjunct professor of environmental studies, and as a governing board member and fellow at the International Science Council. Leading up to COP27 , research by Mankin and doctoral candidate Christopher Callahan, Guarini '23, detailing the economic costs of climate change was cited in major media outlets including the BBC, Reuters, and Forbes. In his research and teaching, Winter focuses on climate prediction and the impacts of climate variability and change on water resources and agriculture. Yeo joined the conference in person as an observer from her home country of Singapore, which organized its first COP27 paviliona space separate from the negotiation halls where organizations host events and showcase research. She moderated a panel on youth climate activism and participated in a panel on climate education at the newly launched Climate Justice Pavilionwhich for the first time convened representatives at the global climate conference from the Global South, U.S. environmental justice movement, and Indigenous peoples. Frustration and Hope Justin Mankin: "If I were to sum the whole thing up, I'd say that the COP27 results are a drop in the bucket. But before the summit, not everyone agreed that there was even a bucket that needed to be filled. The creation of the financial facility is a big win, but it came at the sacrifice of both redress for past harms and a focus on climate mitigation. Given where negotiations were when this summit started, and that people have been working for three decades to even get liability and damage on the agenda, it's a clear victory. But the fund's substance isn't that clear. It has some pledged contributions, and more are to be urged, but as far as I can tell, none are guaranteed, the accessibility of the funds is undetermined, and the facility itself will likely be underfunded. The monies promised so far are considerably less than the damage estimates folks like Chris and I have provided, which themselves represent lower bounds on the losses from global warming to date. So while the pledges are nice, it seems like the fund was a palatable way for the developed world to skirt liability and damage claims, which were coming to a head." Jonathan Winter: " The biggest accomplishment of COP27 was the creation of a fund for loss and damage, essentially a pool of money from the countries most responsible for climate change, such as the U.S., Europe, U.K., and China, to help vulnerable countries recover from climate disasters caused or made worse by climate change. While wealthy nations have historically funded climate change adaptation or mitigation in developing nations for years, this is an important shift towards acknowledging responsibility for the harm caused by climate change. It's important to caveat that while the framework for the loss-and-damage fund has been established, there's still a lot to work out. How big will it be? How will the money be disbursed? Will China (a developing country but large greenhouse gas emitter) contribute to the fund? Can the U.S. allocate money without approval from Congress (which is unlikely)?" Melody Brown Burkins: "I'm appreciative that the fund was created, but it's very frustrating that there were no next steps for mitigating and stopping fossil fuel exploration and increases in emissions that we had hoped for after COP26 in Glasgow. Many of us believed that we would finally take more permanent and legal measures to ramp down emissions or stop fossil fuels more rapidly, but that did not happen. I've been a climate-focused person since I was an undergrad in geology at Yale, during my doctoral work here at Dartmouth, and when I worked in policy as an aide on energy and the environment to Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy in the 1990s. And it was frustrating then when we couldn't move forward even in a bipartisan way. Taking global action, changing cultures and our whole ways of lifewhich is how we have to think about climate changehas always been frustrating. But if we don't do anything, it's not just frustratingit's devastating. We have to balance our frustration with hope." Kate Yeo: "On one hand, I'm grateful that a loss-and-damage fund was finally establishedit's a huge victory for the climate justice movement. Yet it should not have taken this long and so hard a fight for the world to agree to save lives. Developing countries have been calling for loss and damage funds since 1991. Given the current state of the climate today, the loss and damage fund is, at best, just a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. The most critical mitigation strategy of allthe rapid phasing out of fossil fuelsstill remained excluded from the final text in Sharm El-Sheikh. I'm frustrated and disappointed but also remain stubbornly hopeful." COP27 in Person Yeo: "One word: Hectic! I was running from negotiation rooms to panels to side events and back to negotiation rooms every dayall while doing my best to keep up with lectures, assignments, and revision for finals in between. I was primarily tracking Article 6 negotiations on carbon markets which were incredibly technical. Nothing you learn in school can really quite prepare you for thisit took me nearly the whole two weeks to finally begin to understand all the jargon and power plays at hand. I spent a fair bit of time at the Singapore Pavilion. I was grateful for the opportunity to moderate a panel there on the role of youth climate activism on the opening day of the conference. I was also able to engage with many of Singapore's key decision makers and highlight youth concerns' while learning more about the tradeoffs the government must balance. I also spoke on a panel about climate education at the Climate Justice Pavilion, and one on the role of civil society at the Zambia Pavilion. We often learn about climate change in class as just another set of data to analyze or another topic to revise for a test. In spaces like COP27 I am able to put a face to the issue: whether it's youth activists from Pakistan calling for reparations, or Indigenous communities who show up to protect their land. Dartmouth is ultimately a bubbleand no amount of advocacy or writing or research will be meaningful if we don't first put these lived experiences at the heart of our work." The Human Dimension of Climate Change Yeo: " Overall, the negotiations at COP27 were extremely frustrating to me as a young person who cares deeply about climate issues. Discussions move slowly, go in circles, get blocked by major powers like the US, and at times you begin to wonder if our world 'leaders' really grasp the urgency of this issue. But COP27 is also a place of community and global solidarity. I met so many passionate young people, researchers, scientists, Indigenous people, female negotiators, and more, each person reminding me that this is ultimately a collective fight for a livable future. COP27 also featured the first ever Children and Youth Pavilion, and the first ever Climate Justice Pavilion, a real testament to the power of civil society!" Winter: "The prominence of agriculture in the COP27 decisions, which broadly recognized the importance of ensuring food security and ending hunger under a changing climate, was particularly notable. By being highlighted in the COP27 agreement, hopefully agriculture will have a more central role in future climate change negotiations, including both how vulnerable countries can adapt their agriculture systems to a changing climate and how we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, which is responsible for roughly 1/3 of all greenhouse gas emissions. Previous COP agreements have not or only tangentially addressed agriculture. This brings attention to a set of problems that I both work on and think is critical to managing and solving the climate crisis." Burkins: "Arctic Indigenous Peoples were at COP27they had a platform for their knowledge and perspectives, and for advocating for the interests of their communities. This growing recognition that there are communities and knowledge in the Arctic that we need to engage with helps put the human dimension of climate change on the map. The Arctic is warming at four times the rate of the rest of the plant. It's already experiencing things like animal migrations and sea ice loss that we talk about happening to the planet later. Studying climate change that is happening now alongside the voices and perspectives of Arctic Indigenous Peoplesthis has been central to our work at the Institute of Arctic Studies for 30 years. We have students from across disciplines engaging with climate change through activities such as our recently launched Arctic Innovation Scholars Program, which connects them with experiential education and service opportunities, independent research projects, and other endeavors related to the Arctic, climate, sustainability, and the environment. When students say 'I'm frustrated,' we say, 'How can we help get you involved?'" \</doc>

(TNSsel) -- The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee issued the following news: COP27 was watched closely by eyes around the world as representatives from government, industry, and civil society gathered to discuss the largest threat to our planet: the climate crisis. Among those in attendance were seven UUSC partners, each from small island developing states (SIDS) in the Pacific and Caribbean. It is well documented that SIDS are living with the impacts of climate destruction and thus are most immediately impacted by its effects, however they are systematically excluded from major climate policy decisions. These were some of the partner's takeaways from the event.    On inclusion, advocacy, and the protection of human rights: Partners expressed that the deliberations inside the closed negotiation rooms by developed countries did not match the spirit of advocacy occurring outside. The common tactic of denial, delay, and deception continues to divert real and meaningful climate justice. Maina Talia of the Kioa Island Community Organization (KICO) notes that he has "lost trust in the UN process." Further, partners juxtaposed UUSC's mission to support human rights and justice with the blatant human rights violations and the suppression of civil society voices by the COP27 Presidency. COP27 was held in Egypt under the leadership of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is well known for his repressive and abusive human rights record. After all, protesting was discouraged during COP27 , and the few protesters present were under heavy surveillance and control. Our partners call on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and all Parties to the Convention to consider the human rights records of governments when selecting host countries. Additionally, our partners call on the UNFCCC to reform its processes to reflect a more just, rights-centered platform for multilateral discussions. This includes the way in which human rights language is crafted and utilized. The inclusion of "human mobility" and "displacement" language in the adopted texts to come out of the conference is good, but is also not enough. UUSC will continue to support its partners in advocating for legal protections and human rights-centered approaches to addressing climate-forced displacement through the mechanisms of the Convention and in other multilateral spaces. Lastly, UUSC joins our partners in recognizing the critical role of the caucuses, especially the Indigenous Peoples, Women & Gender, and Youth caucus. These caucuses include grassroots leaders from around the world representing frontline communities and UUSC recognizes the time, sacrifice, and commitment that members provide outside and inside of COP spaces.    On Loss and Damage and other climate change policies: The decision to create a loss and damage fund, which was seen as the litmus test of COP27 's success by developing countries and NGOs, was a hard-fought win reflecting the brilliant and challenging work of many of UUSC's partners. Replenishing the fund and holding developed countries accountable to this commitment will be the next big challenge, and both UUSC and its partners are invested in the equitable development and distribution of the fund. UUSC partner the Loss and Damage Collaboration noted the "festival of pledges' made by a few developed countries to address Loss & Damage. Except for Wallonia and Denmark, all pledges were amendments to existing financial commitments, which diverts resources away from the necessary work required to address mitigation and adaptation. Finally, partners underscored the need for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels to "keep 1.5 alive," or limit global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius. Partners were disappointed at the weak language of "phase-down" included in the final text, as it fails to convey the extreme urgency of the situation, and they were also disappointed with the lack of ambition of our global leaders to take real steps towards keeping 1.5 alive. Overall, COP27 COP27 served as a reminder of the major political apathy that continues to impede tangible solutions to the climate crisis. UUSC and its partners will continue to place pressure on policy makers and government leaders in order to secure real and sustainable change that will support and protect the planet from climate destruction.

The following information was released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: Forests are a vital component of the earth's ecosystem, providing humans, animals and plants with clean drinking water, preventing natural disasters, and helping to slow climate change. Roughly one-third of humanity directly depends on forests and forest products, yet in the past 30 years forest destruction has been devastating. Since 1990, some 10 per cent of the world's total have been lost to deforestation an amount equivalent to losing 37 football pitches of forest every minute for 30 consecutive years. One common enabler of this loss is corruption. Large economic incentives, the remoteness of forests, and a lack of traceability for exploitative actions such as deforestation offer prime opportunities for corrupt practices to flourish. The continent that suffers the highest annual rate of deforestation is Africa, which loses 3.9 million hectares per year. Within this context, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has been identifying solutions to address corruption in the forestry sector. Last month, UNODC and the East African Community brought together government anti-corruption and environmental experts from 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants in the meeting shared regional trends and commonalities of practical interest in order to better identify and therefore deal with the issues undermining transparency, accountability, and good governance in the forestry sector. Nyabenyi Tipo, Tanzania representative for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, addressed the meeting on behalf of the UN Resident Coordinator. She noted that East Africa is a region home to a diverse range of biologically rich forests "critical for the livelihoods of at least 70 per cent of people in the region, either directly or indirectly. Despite their social, economic and environmental importance, forests in East Africa are facing numerous challenges that threaten and undermine their potential contribution towards the sustainable development agenda. While climate change threatens to change the types and condition of forests, unsustainable exploitation degrades and fragments forest," Tipo added. The three-day gathering helped drive forward harmonization of processes and information sharing between the attending countries, in line with UNODC's Strategic Vision for Africa 2030 which recognizes the use of strong partnerships to protect Africa's resources and livelihoods. Discussions looked at governance frameworks, the key drivers of forest loss and degradation and how they are shaped by corruption, and ways to strengthen coordination and cooperation in the region. The meeting culminated with a draft declaration, which when approved by national ministries and anti-corruption agencies will form the basis for a high-level gathering later this year. The declaration proposes adopting stronger anti-corruption measures within national and regional forestry policies. This proactive suggestion recognizes the links between corruption and the environment. It is indicative of the increasing volition of States to stop forest loss and address related corruption, as shown in recent commitments and resolutions at fora such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) and the Conference of State Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption. Looking towards this month's COP27 , the gathering in Dar es Salaam helped to create continuity and hammer home the importance of thinking about anti-corruption measures when designing climate policies. Participating nations in COP27 include many of those who attended the meeting, which was "a fundamental first step in framing the future work to slow down forest loss by putting in place measures to prevent corruption", according to Maria Adomeit, a UNODC Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Officer. \</doc>

(TNStalk)(TNScapv) -- Access Now posted the following joint letter with 23 organizations:    To: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Office of the Prime Minister, 80 Wellington Street, Ottawa, ON K1A 0A2 MP Ali Ehsassi, Chair, Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario, 1A 0A6 MP Sumeer Zuberi, Chair, Subcommittee on International Human Rights, House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0A6 Dear Prime Minister Trudeau, Chair Ehsassi, and Chair Zuberi, We, the undersigned members of civil society, write to express our solidarity and support for the wrongfully detained British-Egyptian citizen Alaa Abd el-Fattah and urge all elements of the Canadian government participating in the upcoming COP27 conference in Egypt to raise Alaa's case before Egyptian authorities and to utilize all possible leverage to secure his timely release from unjust and arbitrary detention. Alaa Abd el-Fattah is one of Egypt's most prominent political dissidents and activists, renowned for being an intellectual leader of the 2011 revolution and for his steadfast commitment to freedom, dignity, and justice for all Egyptians. Alaa was granted British citizenship through his mother in December 2021, and is now in desperate need of immediate intervention. Alaa's family fears that his life is in acute danger: he has now been on hunger strike for more than 200 days, consuming roughly 100 calories a day. When COP begins on November 6th, he will begin a full hunger strike and stop drinking water entirely. In a letter to his mother announcing this decision and explaining his rationale, Alaa wrote: "I've taken a decision to escalate at a time I see as fitting for my struggle for my freedom and the freedom of prisoners of a conflict they've no part in, or they're trying to exit from; for the victims of a regime that's unable to handle its crises except with oppression, unable to reproduce itself except through incarceration." As a result of his outspoken defense of human rights and democracy, Alaa has been wrongfully detained under every successive Egyptian president in his lifetime. Since the 2011 revolution, Abd el-Fattah has spent more time in prison than he has free. In September 2019, just five months after completing his previous sentence, Alaa was arrested on baseless charges of "spreading false news" in relation to a Facebook post critical of prison authorities. Alaa's pretrial detention was repeatedly renewed for more than two years, often without his physical presence in the courtroom and in violation of Egypt's legal limitation. While imprisoned in Tora Maximum Security Prison 2, he reported being subject to repeated torture and abuse at the hands of state officials, and at times prison authorities explicitly indicated his punishment was retribution for his human rights advocacy. In December 2021, Alaa was sentenced to five years in prison by an exceptional Egyptian Emergency State Security Court in Case No. 1228/2021. His trial, in which human rights lawyer Mohamed el-Baqer and blogger Mohammed "Oxygen" Ibrahim stood as co-defendants, was tainted by significant violations of due process and rule of law: their lawyers were prevented from reviewing the case file and were prohibited from mounting a proper defense on behalf of their clients. Furthermore, because charges from a previous case were copied into Case No. 1228/2021, the two years that Alaa spent in pretrial detention do not count as time served toward his current sentence. Since the trial took place before an exceptional court, there is no appeal process and President el-Sisi retains sole authority to issue a pardon or reduce Alaa's sentence. The rapidly deteriorating state of Alaa's health and well-being deserve sharp focus and immediate action from international leaders. Knowing that Canada prides itself as a leading advocate for global human rights, this is an opportunity for the government to live out its values and demonstrate its commitment to rule of law, fundamental freedoms, and participatory governance. Moreover, Egypt is one of Canada's largest trading partners in Africa and maintains important relations with the Egyptian government. As a founding member and 2022 Chair of the Freedom Online Coalition (FOC), we also realize that Canada is an ardent supporter of internet freedoms, of which Alaa's detention is an egregious abuse against. There is no doubt that the Canadian government is in a powerful position to speak out for Alaa and those wrongfully detained alongside him. The Egyptian government's apathetic response to British overtures on behalf of Alaa make it painfully clear that sustained, coordinated, and vocal international pressure is necessary to secure his release or improve conditions. It is imperative that the Canadian government and all those attending COP27 join the chorus of international leaders who have voiced their support for Alaa and Egypt's thousands of political prisoners. We believe that continued, coordinated pressure while the global spotlight is on Egypt can help save Alaa's life. We urge those responsible to intervene, and for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to release all victims of his senseless crackdown on freedom of expression in Egypt.

Preparations for COP27 in November are proceeding apace and we are now well past the halfway mark between the preparatory meetings in June in Bonn and the start of the summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The agenda for Sharm El-Sheikh is complex and challenging. Furthermore, the meeting is taking place during a time of international turmoil. So, what are the factors influencing whether Sharm El-Sheikh can be a success? And what, exactly, does COP27 need to deliver? Reasons for Optimism Those looking for positive signs can name several. For a start, the recent passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in the US dedicated some $369 billion for climate and energy action\\x97the largest investment in US history for tackling climate change. This will give the market more confidence to invest in green technology, whether it is solar, wind, microgrids, carbon capture and hydrogen, to name a few. It also shows commitment from the world\\x92s largest economy and second largest polluter. Second, the major weather events of recent months\\x97from heatwaves across Africa, Asia and Europe to the catastrophic floods in Pakistan of the past few days\\x97are a tragic reminder, if any were still needed, of the urgency of the climate crisis and the need for COP27 to deliver some strong, tangible outcomes. A third, quite different factor may be the caliber of the incoming Egyptian presidency. While there has been some criticism of the host country\\x92s human rights record and treatment of local NGOs in the lead up to COP27 , some climate insiders have been impressed by the incoming presidency\\x92s team led by Sameh Shoukry, Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs and COP27 president-designate, and Egyptian Minister for the Environment Dr. Yasmine Fouad, the COP Ministerial Coordinator and Envoy. Their quality has spurred hopes the Egyptian hosts could build on what is widely viewed as a fairly successful COP26 in Glasgow last November. Dark Clouds Loom Those are certainly reasons for hope. Yet the skeptics arguably have a stronger case. First, while the world\\x92s climate crisis may have affirmed the need for urgency, the geopolitical and economic situation may be pushing in the opposite direction. The war in Ukraine has badly damaged relations between the West and Russia, while tensions over Taiwan have had a similar (if not so extreme) effect with China. These are hardly good conditions for building mutual trust and understanding\\x97usually a prerequisite for a strong outcome in international negotiations. One major side effect of Russia\\x92s invasion of Ukraine, and the West\\x92s response, has been the energy crisis now engulfing Europe. There is also a predicted food crisis, not just from the war but also the impacts of climate change on harvests. Will this reinvigorate efforts at COP27 to find solutions or distract Western nations beset by inflation and a looming recession? Closer to home, the latest round of UN climate talks, the Subsidiary Bodies meetings held in Bonn in June, were not wildly productive. A few procedural outcomes could not mask the ongoing disagreements in key areas like loss and damage compensation (including calls for a new fund), as well as slow progress in talks on adaptation and financing. More recently, a G20 gathering of energy and climate ministers held in late August in Indonesia failed to approve a draft outcome document amid reports of disagreements and a \\x93breakdown\\x94 in negotiations. This is a worrying outcome so close to the COP. Another uncertainty, which may yet prove either negative or positive, is the change in leadership at the UN\\x92s climate secretariat. With Patricia Espinosa stepping down in July, Simon Stiell was named as her successor in August. Mr. Stiell boasts an impressive CV, having held ministerial appointments in his home country of Grenada, as well as executive corporate jobs overseas. An engineer by training, he has been involved in the climate negotiations and knows the characters and issues well. His experience in government at a high level should help him engage with dignitaries and senior officials at COP27 and he will undoubtedly bring energy and vigor to the job at a critical time. Furthermore, coming from a small island developing state should give him greater legitimacy given their vulnerability to sea-level rise, thus ensuring his voice is heard loud and clear. On the other hand, there is little time for him to get to grips with his new job if he is to have an impact on a COP that starts in early November. The runway for him to achieve liftoff at Sharm El-Sheikh is alarmingly short. Key Topics for COP27 to Tackle So what does COP27 COP27 has been pitched as the \\x93implementation\\x94 COP, where the goals of the Paris Agreement, helped by the rulebook adopted in Glasgow, begin to be delivered. What should this implementation look like? Nationally Determined Contributions: Keeping 1.5 Alive: Revisiting countries\\x92 nationally determined contributions (NDCs)\\x97essentially their pledges and plans\\x97at COP27 is important. Many feel it is imperative to maintain the pressure to improve the many NDCs delivered in time for COP26. However, only a dozen or so countries have submitted new or revised NDCs since Glasgow. Of these, the new targets by Australia (43% by 2030 from 2005 levels) and India (45% by 2030 on 2005 levels) are noteworthy. But the pre-Glasgow \\x93flood\\x94 of ambitious, headline-grabbing NDCs has now reduced to a trickle. Depending on whether you just take the commitments by governments into account or include those of other stakeholders, we are currently still looking at a temperature rise of 1.8-2.7oC. Of course, this is much lower than estimates prior to Paris (2015), when some predicted a rise of 4-6oC by the end of the century. Nevertheless, those lower numbers still rely on all stakeholders delivering their promises. And they still take us well beyond 1.5oC. For these reasons, more ambitious NDCs in the lead-up to, or during, COP27 , would help deliver a major boost. Climate Finance: The commitment made in Copenhagen in 2009 for US$100 billion a year for climate finance by 2020 was not achieved. This is particularly disappointing since the $100 billion was intended as a floor not a ceiling. Furthermore, most of the funding that was delivered came in the form of loans, not grants, which recipients would usually prefer. It is evident, therefore, that we are locked in the basement when it comes to climate funding, and that major progress is needed for us to climb out of the hole. The reality is that we need trillions, not billions, to address climate change and that government aid will not be enough. Still, progress by government negotiators on a new collective quantified goal on climate finance is needed. While this goal is not supposed to be agreed until 2024, COP27 will need to show significant progress and demonstrate we are heading firmly in the right direction. Outside the government negotiations, observers will also be looking for progress by other stakeholders. For instance, the launch in 2021 of the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) as a coalition of the willing will need to play a critical role. GFANZ represents two-fifths of the world's financial assets, $130 trillion, under the management of banks, insurers and pension funds that have signed up to 2050 net-zero goals including limiting global warming to 1.5oC. This includes targets for asset managers (halve emissions by 2030), asset owners (by 2030 net zero aligned portfolios covering emissions reductions), banks (net zero emissions from all activities and portfolios by 2050) and insurers (by 2030 net zero aligned investment, insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios). The realignment of the market is critical to achieving our 1.5oC goal. The state of play with GFANZ and what transparency systems have been set up should be critically reviewed by NGOs and other stakeholders at COP27 , with clear signs that these goals are real and not just empty promises. Article 6--the Carbon Market: Another outcome from Glasgow was adoption of the rulebook covering Voluntary Carbon Markets under the Paris Agreement. This should open the door to billions of dollars of investments (in 2021 it was $2 billion). Furthermore, the rules agreed in Glasgow were generally seen as fairly stringent. This is important because demand is set to grow for carbon offsets (removing/reducing emissions in one place to compensate for emissions elsewhere). Yet if these offsets are of poor quality\\x97as some currently are\\x97then we will not have a chance of staying within our 1.5oC goal. To be successful, this market will need to improve its approach. For instance, certification should ensure that tree planting and other similar efforts address both climate change and biodiversity as an integrated set of challenges. More broadly, COP27 will provide an opportunity to assess early progress as we move towards implementing Article 6. Loss and Damage: Given the number of extreme climate events recently, a long-term issue for negotiators\\x97compensation for loss and damage caused by climate change\\x97has developed into a major, pressing challenge for COP27 . While developing countries in particular are looking for rapid progress, the Glasgow Loss and Damage Dialogues in Bonn in June did not set a well-defined narrative. Clear disagreement could be discerned around the use of existing funding arrangements to address the issue versus the creation of a new loss and damage financial facility, which many developing countries favor. Progress on this issue will be important at COP27 . COP27 should recognize the different levels of development countries are in and the challenges they face and how this might inform the Global Stocktaking process in future. There was also a commitment in Glasgow to double adaptation funding by 2025. This should raise the amount to US$40 billion annually. Again, COP27 provides an opportunity to give some early signals this goal will be achieved. A Voice for Africa: With Egypt hosting this meeting, COP27 provides an opportunity to amplify regional voices from Africa in the conversation and to highlight issues of global justice and equity. A successful COP would, in our view, show a growing solidarity between the Global North and South on issues such as financing and loss and damage. Navigating Complexity Clearly, COP27 faces some significant headwinds given the current geopolitical situation. Nevertheless, we believe the Egyptian presidency has an opportunity to build on a solid COP26 and that its efforts to focus on implementation and secure some tangible outcomes is the right choice. With the United Arab Emirates set to hold the Presidency for COP28, it will be fascinating to see whether this triad of presidencies\\x97the UK, Egypt, and UAE\\x97can help guide this complex and critical period in the negotiations to some positive conclusions. Felix Dodds and Chris Spence are co-editors of the new book, Heroes of Environmental Diplomacy: Profiles in Courage (Routledge Press, 2022). It includes chapters on the climate negotiations held in Kyoto (1997), Copenhagen (2009) and Paris (2015). \</doc>

(TNStalk) -- Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives issued the following commentary on Dec. 1, 2022:    COP27 : One Step Forward, Two Steps Back By Mariel Vilella, Climate Program Director, with contributions from GAIA staff and members In general terms, COP27 will be remembered for the agreement to a Loss and Damage Fund to support vulnerable nations. The Fund, despite coming empty and without much clarity on exactly who will pay for what and where, it's a major achievement credited to all the civil society organisations and vulnerable countries in the Global South that have been demanding it for decades. Indeed, it is a first step towards securing the provision of rescue and rebuilding support to areas stricken by climate change impacts, and can be seen as the opening of a space for cooperation between developed and developing countries. On the other hand, COP27 did not advance any further ambition to reduce GHG emissions and close the existing gap between current national pledges and the Paris Agreement goal - analysis shows that the world is still on track to 2.4 C by 2100 (unchanged from last year). After last year's unambitious round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), countries pledged to bring new, more ambitious plans this year. But few did and, while the goal of keeping the temperature rise under 1.5 degrees is still formally in place, it is slipping farther out of reach. The final text fails to provide a stronger mandate on how to get there, reflecting a failure of the "ratchet mechanism," the Paris Agreement's fundamental lever to increase ambition over time. Once again, the core of the stagnant negotiation is related to the use of fossil fuels, with countries blaming each other for failing to cut ties with these polluting energy sources particularly in rich countries of the Global North, which continue to avoid their historic responsibility in causing climate change in the first place. This historic divide may play out even more significantly next year, where the COP will be hosted by the petro-state UAE. While there was no language on phasing down fossil fuels at COP27 , countries have another opportunity this week at the global plastics treaty INC1 to advance a restriction on the production of plastic, which would effectively deliver a reduction in the use of fossil fuels. COP 27 Last but not least, an important general consideration worth noting was that the COP was hosted by a repressive state, with such a critical track record of human rights violations, which brought issues around freedom of speech and political prisoners to the forefront of the climate battle. Also, the reported surveillance, the ever-increasing presence of fossil fuels lobbyists, and questions over Coca-Cola's sponsorship contributed to an atmosphere that felt hostile to civil society. Ultimately, the fact that the traditional climate justice march could only be hosted within the UN territory was a testimony of how civil liberties were limited and severely restricted, signaling the interconnections between climate chaos and authoritarianism. HIGHLIGHTS ON WASTE MANAGEMENT The agenda for waste management at COP27 had remarkably high stakes - considering that waste has never really been at the centre of the climate negotiations previously. This time, two main global policy initiatives - the Global Methane Pledge and the Egypt-hosted Global Waste Initiative 50 by 2050 - put waste into the spotlight in an unprecedented way, pushing a wide range of organisations, researchers and policy-makers to reflect on the interlinkages between waste and climate change, and engaging with the GAIA delegation like never before. THE GLOBAL METHANE PLEDGE The Global Methane Pledge (GMP), launched at COP26 and supported by more than a hundred countries that pledged to cut collective methane emissions 30% by 2030, renewed its momentum and increased the number of committed countries. At the high-level ministerial hosted by CATF, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and European Commission Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans launched a joint statement to mobilise further support for the Global Methane Pledge. Twenty four new countries announced that they will join the Global Methane Pledge, increasing the total number to more than 150 countries. Of those 150, many countries have developed national methane action plans or are in the process of doing so, with progress being made on new pathways to drive emissions reductions from the energy, agriculture, and waste sectors. From GAIA's point of view, the renewed commitment to the GMP is worth celebrating, yet it remains to be seen how it will be implemented in the waste sector (read our reaction here: HYPERLINK https://www.no-burn.org/cop27-reaction-to-the-global-methane-pledge-ministerial-meeting/ https://www.no-burn.org/ HYPERLINK cop27 -reaction-to-the-global-methane-pledge-ministerial-meeting/ ). The new Global Methane Pledge Pathway on waste includes five strategies (see full details here: HYPERLINK https://www.state.gov/global-methane-pledge-from-moment-to-momentum/): https://www.state.gov/global-methane-pledge-from-moment-to-momentum/):  Enhancing Measurement and Tracking: with several initiatives undertaken by Carbon Mapper, RMI, and CATF are looking at identifying critical sources of methane in landfills and dumpsites and leveraging the data to drive the policy-making towards methane emissions reductions.  Scaling up Subnational Action: the new initiative Subnational Climate Action Leaders Exchange (SCALE), supported by the U.S. State Department and Bloomberg Philanthropies, aims to help cities, states, and regions develop and implement methane reduction plans. This initiative complements the Pathway Towards Zero Waste joined by 13 cities at the October 2022 C40 World Mayors Summit.  Reducing Food Loss and Waste: several initiatives are aiming to act on food loss and waste, including the set up of a Food Waste Management Accelerator in 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean; a new effort to quantify and track food banking methane mitigation with the Global Food Banking Network; plus other projects on food loss by IDB and the USAID, scaling up efforts in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, and/or Tanzania.  Regional Platforms: at the regional level, the IDB is planning to fund methane reduction projects in Latin America and the Caribbean and will be launching the Too Good to Waste facility to implement waste projects related to methane mitigation.  Mobilising Investment: the implementation of the GMP Waste Pathway will require scaling up investment in waste methane abatement, which so far it has involved the Government of Canada, the U.S. government, the African Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Global Methane Hub, the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, and Bloomberg Philanthropies. Importantly, the methane reductions pledges have been followed by more than 20 philanthropies announcing combined commitments of over $200 million to support implementation of the Global Methane Pledge. This funding will "build upon and sustain action from civil society, government, and private industry, including in the more than 100 countries that have signed on to the Pledge by meaningfully investing in methane reduction solutions." THE GLOBAL WASTE INITIATIVE 50 BY 2050 The host nation Egypt launched the Global Waste Initiative during COP27 , aiming to catalyse both adaptation and mitigation solutions by treating and recycling 50% of the waste produced in Africa by 2050. In a series of workshops held at the Green Zone, the Egypt government fleshed out some of the vision behind this initiative. The GAIA Delegation, including several representatives from GAIA Africa membership that has been following this policy process for several months, engaged in conversations with the representatives from the Egypt government and reiterated the recommendations that had already been submitted in previous occasions. In the first place, the 50 by 2050 initiative needs an accurate baseline for recycling rates in the African continent as recycling infrastructure and waste collection varies significantly. Moreover, the initiative must clearly define the technologies accepted under the "recycling" umbrella to avoid promoting false solutions such as waste-to-energy incineration and waste trade as acceptable remedies to the plastic crisis, ignoring the fact that these only perpetuate historical injustice and concentration of power and wealth. Waste management in Africa has the potential to generate employment opportunities for vulnerable populations and to recognize the contribution of waste pickers and waste cooperatives to waste recovery rates. Before focusing on a 50% target recycling rate, 50 by 2050 should define, in a consultative process with input from multiple countries and the civil society, the means by which that rate will be pursued. Furthermore, there needs to be a mechanism at each national level where the critical stakeholders in the waste sector are informing the best national approaches and how best they can transpose this regional effort into local action. Waste pickers and other GAIA members in those countries who are championing zero waste initiatives are best placed to help Africa achieve the ambition of this initiative and they are the local experts we should be taking advice from and not multinational corporations from the Global North whose only objective here is to promote false solutions and keep Africa trapped and perpetuating this cycle of waste colonialism. GAIA'S IMPACT AT COP27 The COP27 GAIA Delegation engaged at COP27 to promote zero waste solutions as essential tools for climate mitigation and adaptation, particularly for communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis. GAIA also hosted and our delegation spoke at over a dozen official side events and at other events and Pavilions within the official COP27 venue, reaching hundreds of people spanning from national delegates, climate NGOs, media, and other influencers with our key messages. We had a Zero Waste Hub to engage the general public at COP, with a "Gallery of Zero Waste Solutions to Climate Change" and a "Gallery of Climate Trash," sparking conversations with other members of civil society on the connection between waste and climate. We engaged with national delegates from key countries (for example, Brazil), hand-delivering our recent Zero Waste to Zero Emissions report to government leaders. We held a press conference on the Global Waste Initiative 50 by 2050, raising the voices of local waste pickers as well as African government officials and activists on the key ingredients for a successful zero waste initiative in the region. We participated in the climate justice march held at the UN COP27 venue and strengthened our links and global coordination on waste and the climate justice movement. We held polluters accountable for their role at the COP, including calling out Coca Cola's sponsorship, and the failure of the COP's waste management systems, calling on the UNFCCC to do better.

REFLECTIONS ON COP27 FROM OUR MEMBERSHIP Victor H. Argentino M. Vieira - Zero Waste Advisor and Researcher - Polis Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil The COP27 was my first COP and an amazing experience, thanks to GAIA and all our delegation! Unfortunately, the amazingness does not come from the results of the climate negotiations, political will or the hope that COP is the arena for effective social participation yet. Actually, it comes from the meetings with different people from all over the world doing amazing work that fuel our hope to go forward in the climate justice struggle. It shows us that no matter the insensibility of political leaders and ineffectiveness of current politics, when organised we are the real change we need which is happening despite these. The changes are happening, not in the speed we need, but by the people who need the most. The day the neediest people are properly represented at COP is arriving, and this day will be a turning point in the climate agenda. Together and connected we are stronger, our role is to keep pushing forward and fighting for the future we want and the future we need! Nazir Khan, Campaigns Director with Minnesota Environmental Justice Table, Minneapolis, US. If we are pinning our hopes to address the climate emergency on the UNFCCC, we truly are in grave and profound danger. What I saw at COP27 was a feeding frenzy of false solutions and disaster capitalism (first day: Egypt Pavilion proudly discussing "Decarbonizing Oil and Gas Sector"); unceasing obstruction and time-wasting on the part of the global north, especially the United States; and a framework that simply is not working to address this emergency. Without significant structural change to the United Nations itself, I cannot see how these state-state negotiations can work. And even that may not be enough at this point. The glimmers of hope I felt arose because of the unrelenting and courageous protests and clarion calls of civil society and social movements, as well as the united stands of the global south, G77 in particular, again and again in negotiations. I could not help but think of the once-powerful Third World movement-- which gave the United Nations the few teeth it has. And I could not help but remember Egypt's own Gamal Abdul Nasser, one of the great leaders of the Third World movement. I believe it is this long history of struggle against colonization that laid the foundation for the one victory emerging from COP27 --the Loss and Damage fund. We will see whether this fund is real or becomes yet another unfulfilled promise and failed commitment. But the united stands of G77 and the tireless work of social movements, I believe, are our best hope for addressing this crisis. And those of us within the United States must do everything in our power to support them. Ana Le Rocha, Executive Director of Nipe Fagio, Tanzania, Steering Committee member of Break Free from Plastic. As I celebrated 30 years of activism at COP27 I experienced inspirational moments as well as frustration with the limited progress on climate action. I admire the strength and resilience of climate and human rights activists standing in power despite the limited freedom of speech and the disconnection between our demands and the outcomes of the negotiations being held by member states. The split was unapologetically felt in the way that the spaces were organized and protests were restricted. On the other hand, the rooms were also filled with representatives of the power structures responsible for the climate crisis that we are in, and watching companies and countries in the Global North insist on relying on the resources of the Global South to enable their wealth was painful. 30 years later, I keep myself accountable to the girl inside me, who became an activist at Rio 1992 with very ambitious dreams. The need for environmental activism never decreases, it only grows stronger. Connecting global advocacy with local action is a powerful strategy to drive change." Iryna Mironova, Zero Waste Liviv and co-founder of Zero Waste Ukraine Alliance Iryna: Not only was this my first COP, it was also the first time my country, Ukraine, had its own pavilion, which told the world the story of how its precious black soils are impacted by war. At various events I presented local cases from the Ukrainian city of Lviv, which despite the war continues its way to zero waste and zero emissions. I got a unique chance to contribute to the discussions on the intersection of world food security caused by war, methane emissions and waste management, and local climate policies. COP is mainly about global policies that leave many communities around the world feeling unheard and out-powered to act even if their representatives and NGOs have the opportunity to observe the COP negotiations. Working together with the GAIA delegation, we showcased how zero waste is a powerful tool to act on climate change on all levels and cross-sectionally. Many cities have more ambitious climate, targets and plans than countries, but the risks and damage costs are higher for them as well. I would like to see more cities' leadership and voices at the next COP pressuring their countries' representatives on more ambitious targets and commitments together with NGOs on behalf of citizens.    General Summary The development at negotiations was an agreement to a Loss and Damage Fund, which although empty and low on specifics, is an important step forward for climate justice in the Global South.

November 6, 2022 6:18 PM In Kherson, residents were without lights and water Sunday, as the city's Russian-installed officials accused Ukraine of "sabotage" without evidence. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson said an airstrike, the "result of an attack organized" by Ukraine, damaged "three concrete poles of high-voltage power lines." The authorities said energy specialists were working to "quickly" resolve the issue, according to Agence France-Presse. However, Yaroslav Yanushevych, the head of the Kherson regional administration, blamed Russia for the power outages. Yanushevych wrote on Telegram: "In temporarily occupied Beryslav, Russian troops blew up high-voltage power lines. About one and a half kilometers of utility poles and lines were destroyed." The "damage is quite extensive," he added. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other officials have said in the past month that between 30% and 40% of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian airstrikes. He said in his nightly video address Sunday, "As of this evening, stabilization blackouts continue in Kyiv and six regions. More than 4.5 million consumers are without electricity. Most of them are now in Kyiv and the Kyiv region. It's really difficult." Residents told to prepare for worst In Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko warned the city's residents Sunday that they must prepare for the worst this winter -- such as having no electricity, water or heat in the freezing cold - if Russia keeps striking the country's energy infrastructure. "We are doing everything to avoid this. But let's be frank, our enemies are doing everything for the city to be without heat, without electricity, without water supply, in general, so we all die. And the future of the country and the future of each of us depends on how prepared we are for different situations," Klitschko told state media. The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 , opened in Egypt Sunday and with the summit being overshadowed by Russia's war in Ukraine. U.K. representative Alok Sharma, who was the president of COP26, said at the ceremonial opening speech at COP27 : "(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's brutal and illegal war in Ukraine has precipitated multiple global crisis, energy and food insecurity, inflationary pressures and spiraling debt. "These crises have compounded existing climate vulnerabilities and the scarring effects of the pandemic," Sharma added. Sameh Shoukry, incoming COP27 president and Egyptian foreign minister, expressed concern Sunday that crises related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine should not sidetrack action on climate change. Ukrainians cautious in Kherson In Kherson, Russia is increasing its evacuation of residents from the conflict zone and acknowledging the deteriorating situation in the region. At least 70,000 civilians have been moved from Kherson, which fell to Russian forces within days of the start of the conflict in February. While a bloody battle for the city is predicted, the "situation in Kherson is clear as mud," Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Virginia, wrote in an analysis this week, The New York Times reported. "Russian forces seemed to withdraw from some parts, evacuated and drew down, but also reinforced with mobilized personnel." Residents of the city report abandoned checkpoints and no more Russian patrols, but Ukrainian officials are cautious, believing Moscow is setting a trap. Russian military commanders dismissed, says intelligence report Also Sunday, Britain's defense ministry said in its daily intelligence report about Ukraine that there has been a "series of dismissals of senior Russian military commanders since the onset of the invasion in February 2022." The report said, "These dismissals represent a pattern of blame against senior Russian military commanders for failures to achieve Russian objectives on the battlefield. This is in part likely an attempt to insulate and deflect blame from Russian senior leadership at home." In its intelligence update Saturday, however, the British defense ministry said "Russia is probably struggling to provide military training for its current mobilization drive and its annual autumn conscription intake. The Russian Armed Forces were already stretched providing training for the approximate 300,000 troops required for its partial mobilization, announced in September. "These issues," the ministry said, "will be compounded by the additional regular autumn annual conscription cycle" that begins in November for about 120,000 conscripts. Russia has resorted to training troops in Belarus, the ministry said, "due to a shortage of training staff, munitions and facilities in Russia." The intelligence update said that "deploying forces with little or no training provides little additional offensive combat capability." Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse. \</doc>

In the conversation about taking on the challenge of climate change, agriculture will have a role according to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, and the world is looking on as the Biden Administration pushes an investment of nearly $3 billion in spending on a range of projects. Vilsack moderated a panel discussing those partnerships for climate-smart farming during the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ).In his opening remarks he noted the scope of the initial spending in the Partnership for Climate Smart Commodities. The program, announced in February, offered the opportunity to support pilot projects through partnerships to help producers implement climate smart practices.  We wanted a broad range of applicants, so we gave them a choice," Vilsack told the COP27 audience during Adaptation and Agriculture Day.  You could submit an application for a large grant, one spanning up to five years, requesting anywhere from $5 million to as much as $100 million, or you could submit an application requesting a smaller grant of $250,000 to $5 million. Frankly, we were overwhelmed by the response."Related: HYPERLINK https://www.farmprogress.com/fertilizer/agriculture-gets-attention-cop27 Agriculture gets attention at HYPERLINK COP27 When the application deadline expired, USDA had more than 1,000 applications requesting nearly $20 billion in project funding. There was also strong interest in the private sector offering more than $8 billion in proposed matching funds. Vilsack authorized a commitment for more than $3 billion to support those partnerships. And in the first round, the agency selected 70 projects out of more than 450. The reach of these 70 projects is significant. It involves over 50,000 farms covering at least 20 to 25 million acres of working lands, reaching every state in the country, every commodity with one or more projects working in farms, fields and forests," he says.Over the life of the projects, Vilsack says the agency is hopeful of reducing or sequestering more than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.Climate-smart projects citedVilsack highlighted two examples of projects under the initial round of funding. The U.S. Rice Project, called the Rise Stewardship Partnership with Climate Smart Commodities is building a climate-smart rice market to work to reduce methane emissions in rice production. Another project led by the California Dairy Research Foundation will focus on methane mitigation in dairy cattle. Both projects aim to do more than simply reduce methane, they\' re also focused on creating infrastructure to support the practices.Vilsack also announced funding for a second pool of projects. In that second round, the agency received more than 650 applications amounting to nearly $2 billion.  I\' m excited today, during this discussion, to discuss the opportunity for us to invest approximately $300 million additional dollars in projects under the second pool of Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities," he announced.This second pool specifically aims to create markets for small and underserved producers and to support greenhouse gas reduction and carbon sequestration, monitoring, reporting and verification through minority serving institutions in both funding pools.Vilsack highlighted a few projects from the second pool including a Florida A&M University partnership with multiple universities, producer groups and food organizations to develop a biochar based climate smart practice and technology effort and market.Another project with Prairieview A&M University partnering with Texas A&M University, the University of Houston and Michigan Aerospace Corporation will work with small and underserved producers in Texas to implement climate smart production practices on working lands.The aim of all this work is to test and apply regenerative agriculture practices where they are best suited in different regions and farm types in the Southeast United States and the market. He notes that up to 35 projects will be funded out of the second pool.And Vilsack adds that the Inflation Reduction Act provides USDA with nearly $40 billion to invest over the next 10 years  to improve live and livelihoods in agriculture in rural communities. It will enable us to improve access to lower cost renewable energy and improve energy efficiency on the farm."Climate-smart projects citedAfter his remarks at COP27 , Vilsack moderated a panel with four participants \- Marilyn Hershey, chair of U.S. Farmers and Ranchers in Action; Rob Larew, president, National Farmers Union; Verity Ulibarri, a New Mexico farmer, who is also a farm credit loan officer; and Darci Vetter, global head, policy and government relations, The Nature Conservancy.Hershey acknowledged that dairy farmers have an issue with methane emissions, but  the dairy industry has committed to being carbon neutral by the year 2050." She adds that when setting those goals, the industry doesn\' t have all the answers.The work ahead will challenge the dairy industry, which in the United States is quite diverse, and the work ahead is about meeting that diversity.  We had to have commitments that helped all size farmers, that not every farmer was going to do everything, but every farmer would do something and it was a start to that," she says.Related: HYPERLINK https://www.farmprogress.com/carbon/side-event-cop27-event-looks-decarbonizing-ag Side event at COP27 event looks at decarbonizing ag \</doc>

(TNSres) -- Lightsource bp, a subsidiary of BP plc, issued the following news: The rapid deployment of solar power on a vast scale is essential to limit global warming to 1.5 C. Solar will have a huge part to play in the deep decarbonisation of economies around the world. It produces the lowest cost electricity of all time and is hugely scalable. Large volumes of cheap renewable electricity enable the electrification of more than just power grids - transport, heating and cooling, industrial processes. It can also be used to create green hydrogen and green ammonia opening the door to even deeper decarbonisation in sectors where electricity alone is not enough. Those applications are as diverse as fertiliser to steel making and aviation fuel. Solar also has a light-touch impact on the environments that host it. The land below the panels can continue to be used for agriculture. It has very low water requirements, is highly recyclable and projects can be decommissioned after their lifetime often leaving behind improved soils and heightened biodiversity. To tell that story and ensure the true potential it can have in delivering a timely, cost-effective transition Lightsource bp will be participating in the COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh. As a global leader Lightsource bp will take up the conversation with governments, business and civil society. Our aim is to demonstrate how solar, an established and proven technology, can immediately be unleashed to improve access to low-cost, low-carbon power and support major economies in their transition. Our team on the ground in Egypt will be available to discuss our plans as we race towards our goal of delivering 25GW of solar by 2025.

The following information was released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): Date 07 November - 18 November Location Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt The last seven years have been the hottest ever recorded. We are rapidly approaching dangerous tipping points for human health and safety, ecosystems, and property and infrastructure. However, the climate and nature crises are not inevitable. We know what we need to do, and how to make our planet clean, sustainable, and equitable. Now we need the political will and investment. The decisions we make today will impact every generation to come. COP27 , taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, is an opportunity to move the needle. UNDP calls on all governments, private sector, civil society, and communities to champion and invest in responding to this global emergency, and in supporting countries to realize their pledges on climate action. To deliver on the commitments made, we need to scale-up the political will, technical and financial support to drive the much-needed transformation toward net zero and climate-resilient pathways. The world has made promises through NDCs now we must fulfil them. UNDP at COP27 Our UNDP Pavilion will be the site of various side events and presentations. Have a look at our agenda, including our flagship event on Advancing Nationally Determined Contributions. UNDP's Flagship Event in partnership with UNFCCC and ILO "Advancing Nationally Determined Contributions: Signs of Progress" will be on November 15th, on advancing the implementation of, and investments in, the NDCs.

The following information was released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO): The Systematic Observations Financing Facility: Innovative finance for effective climate action Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, 9 November 2022 The partners of the Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF) met at a high-level event at the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP27 to mobilize additional funding to ensure that the most vulnerable countries have the means to acquire and exchange the essential weather and climate data that underpins all adaptation efforts. SOFF focuses on supporting Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to close the large gaps in basic weather and climate data which are essential to forecasts, build climate resilience and to ensure effective implementation of the new Action Plan to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected by early warnings in the next five years. "We must invest equally in adaptation and resilience. That includes the information that allows us to anticipate storms, heatwaves, floods and droughts", United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the World Leaders Summit at COP27 in reference to the Early Warnings for All Action Plan. "Early warning systems save lives and protect livelihoods. We must work to scale up SOFF in support of the Secretary-General's Early Warning Systems for All Initiative as an urgent priority." stated Selwin Hart, the United Nations Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Action and Just Transition. SOFF provides long-term technical and grant-based financial assistance to enable countries to acquire and internationally exchange basic weather and climate data. It was established at COP26 in 2021 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) as a United Nations Multi Partner Trust Fund (UNMPTF). One year later, SOFF is fully operational. "Today, less than 10% of required basic weather and climate observations are available from Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas told the SOFF high-level event at COP27 . SOFF is vital to fast-track implementation of the internationally agreed Global Basic Observing Network GBON). "Better global forecasts enable better local forecasts, applications and services that, in turn, can be used to prepare for extreme events and plan for specific environmental conditions and this ultimately benefits everybody" explained Florence Rabier, Director-General of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Target to support 100 countries As integral part of the Executive Action Plan of the Early Warnings for All initiative, SOFF has an ambitious target to support 100 countries in the next five years. 65 SIDS and LDCs with technical assistance, investments, and open-ended results-based funding and 35 ODA-eligible countries with technical assistance. Earlier this month, the SOFF Steering Committee selected the first 26 countries that will receive SOFF support. Mozambique's Minister of Transport and Communication, Mateus Magala, welcomed the start of SOFF support in these countries and encouraged funders and implementing partners to rapidly move ahead with SOFF implementation in all SIDS and LDCs. SOFF and its funding partners are rapidly stepping up their efforts Eight initial partners have already made a financial contribution to the SOFF UN Fund: Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, the United States and the Nordic Development Fund that serves as a co-chair of the SOFF Steering Committee. And support is growing at COP27 . Earlier this week, Spanish President Pedro Sanchez announced a financial contribution from his country, and Anne Beathe Tvinnereim, Minister of International Development declared that Norway will substantially increase its contribution. Monica Medina, United States Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs emphasized that "strengthening and sustaining climate data is critical if we want to provide high-quality climate information and early warnings at the local level where adaptation takes place. The United States is proud to support the Systematic Observations Financing Facility in filling observation gaps around the world." Speaking at the event, Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director thanked all partners for their support thus far and urged other potential funders to follow with concrete commitments: "If we back SOFF, we can save lives, protect assets and property and foster economic growth in the countries suffering most from climate change. This is solidarity and climate justice in action". Weather data are economic data The event provided an opportunity to highlight the value of basic weather and climate data for the global economy. Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, keynote speaker at the event, said "In the new climate economy, weather data are an important component of economic data and collecting and sharing this information is absolutely vital. Better data will improve climate models and climate risk assessments, and it will mean better targeting for critical adaptation investments". These data are also critical for the private sector. The CEO of the Africa Risk Capacity, Lesley Ndlovu, joined the event to emphasize the urgent need to fill these data gaps to ensure the effectiveness of disaster risk management and financing in Africa. In recognition of the foundational value of this data for more reliable and cost-effective responses to climate shocks and disasters, and sustainable resilience-building, SOFF formally joined the InsuResilience Global Partnership. Sigrid Kaag, Minister of Finance of the Netherlands and co-chair of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action highlighted the importance of weather and climate data for effective economic decision-making. The importance of improving basic weather and climate observations will be on the agenda for the Coalition's event on 10 November, co-hosted with WMO. Advocating a Global Goal on Observation SOFF partners gathered at the event are also working together to reflect the importance of systematic observation of the climate to meet the Paris Agreement adaptation goal. As part of the presentation of the 2022 Implementation of Plan of the Global Climate Observing System, at COP27 , a Global Goal on Observation and sustainable financing for its implementation, including through SOFF is being promoted at COP27 deliberations. This will contribute to ensure that the pressing needs for systematic observation in highly vulnerable countries are rapidly addressed. \</doc>

The following information was released by Greenpeace: As the second week of COP27 begins and the climate talks become critical, let's check in on what happened week one at COP27 and the action that needs to happen now. It was a frustrating first week in Sharm el-Sheikh. Quibbling over money, who is actually responsible for paying up (spoiler: we're still waiting for those who are to acknowledge it) and unusually long discussions only succeeded in putting both people and planet on the sidelines. As civil society on the ground in Egypt braces for a challenging second week, ministers arrive for final negotiations and finalisation of the final text, here's the better, the bad and the blah, blah, blah from week one. First the good: Loss and Damage was officially added to the agenda and the biggest polluting countries can no longer avoid talking about it The blatant attempt of rich countries to push this item off the COP27 table right from the beginning gave a sobering hint of the delay and diversion tactics that can be anticipated ahead but Loss and Damage on the agenda meant governments can no longer avoid the topic, and are now under growing pressure to pay their fair share for a crisis they are most responsible for causing. France declared support for a ban on deep sea mining By calling for an outright ban, France joined the growing number of countries opposed to deep sea mining and calling for a stop to the destructive activity before it starts, leading the way for more ambitious positions from governments at the International Seabed Authority. A call for a fossil fuel phase out to be added to the main COP27 main text More and more countries are now calling and declaring support for a fossil fuel phase out to be added to the COP27 main political decision of this climate conference. Doing so would not only mean actually getting to the root of the problem but also be clear progress from last year at COP26. The UN Expert Group on Net Zero released its recommendations, affirming what has been known for a long time Full stop, Net Zero claims are incompatible with fossil fuels and deforestation. The planet does not have time for debate and consideration about false solutions. Calling out and taking false solutions off the table for good will be instrumental in delivering climate justice. Civil society made their voice heard Don't Gas Africa Event during COP27 . Campaigners call for an end to fossil-fuel-induced energy apartheid in Africa and ask to scale up cost-effective, clean, decentralized, renewable energy to end energy exclusion and meet the needs of Africa's people. Marie Jacquemin / Greenpeace Unable to take the streets of Sharm el-Sheikh, and navigating tight guidelines for protest, civil society, led by youth, Indigenous Leaders and those most impacted by the climate crisis got creative in making impactful spaces within and around the UN venue. After a full week of activities, hundreds of people marched on the Global Day of Action, inside the UN venue as negotiations stumbled, to make clear that civil society will not accept the greed of polluters and lack of will from leaders, demanding more ambition in the climate negotiations. Now the not so good: A study published this week revealed that over 600 fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the COP27 climate talks 25% more than last year at COP26. Any number of fossil fuel advocates is an unacceptable amount and if the UN is serious about delivering any real climate action, they must kick out the big polluters. As a delegate from Africa said, "If you want to address malaria, you don't invite the mosquitoes." Governments signed an agreement to green light another decade of forest destruction, following years of failed promises on this exact issue. Tangible policies to actually deliver on promises of zero deforestation and protection of Indigenous Rights continue lacking, and major question marks surrounding the new funding that has been pledged remain. Feeble references from world leaders to adequate funding were plentiful while the fulfilment of the decade old promise of $100 billion a year from richer nations to less developed countries has yet to materialise. Current negotiations meanwhile don't give enough detail to say with any confidence that the new goal will be delivered. Every day that they delay will be measured in destroyed lives, livelihoods, ecosystems and economies. And the blah, blah, blah...? Negotiations will now begin on the text of the official agreement that will come out of Sharm el-Sheikh. There is a lot still to play for, given mounting political pressure from countries and communities most affected by the climate crisis. This is the progress we're pushing for progress this upcoming week: Establishment of a Loss and Damage Finance Facility COP27 on establishing the Loss and Damage finance facility that is urgently needed by developing countries. This is still with funding arrangements for responding to Loss and Damage being an agreed agenda item. Funding is needed to even begin to start responding to the increasingly destructive and more frequent climate impacts. Countries blocking these advances will have to answer as to why they were comfortable with further devastation. Fossil fuels: phase out, defund, and pursue a just transition to renewables The final COP27 decision text must follow through on calls made by countries this week and name fossil fuels as the main culprits of the climate emergency, and commit to adequate financing to support less developed nations to scale up renewable energy capacity. Anything less is climate injustice. Finance: deliver on the $100bn a year promise and more Wealthier countries need to come forward at COP27 with funding and a robust plan that shows how the $100bn will be met along with additional funding. It's really that simple. Recognise the role of nature in climate mitigation, adaptation, as a cultural and spiritual symbol and as a home to diverse flora and fauna We're also in a biodiversity crisis and the outcomes that come out of COP27 will influence the discussions and specific targets under the framework at the upcoming Biodiversity COP15 in December. - Let's be clear, the goal has not changed: for COP27 to still be a success, there's a lot of work to do. But lives are on the line out here. This week is a test for humanity and a time for action. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) - U.S. climate envoy John Kerry met Tuesday with his Chinese counterpart at the annual United Nations climate negotiations in Egypt in a further hint of improving relations between the world's top two polluters, seen as vital for substantial progress against global warming. The meeting between Kerry and China's top climate official Xie Zhenhua raised prospects for a full-fledged resumption of climate talks between the two countries, which Beijing put on hold three months ago in retaliation for U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan. Kerry and Xie met for about 45 minutes at the Chinese delegation's offices in the COP27 conference zone. Neither side revealed much after it was over. The Chinese officials left without commenting. "We had a very good meeting," Kerry said. It was "much too early" to talk about any remaining differences, he said. "But we're gonna go to work." A day earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed with U.S. President Joe Biden to resume the talks. COP27 -State-of-Negotiati_B14 \</doc>

The following information was released by the World Bank: The World Bank Group was at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to engage on critical climate and development issues and the actions needed to tackle the climate crisis. The biggest multilateral funder of climate action in developing countries, the Bank Group introduced a new partnership to ramp up results-based financing, showcased findings from new climate analytics, presented major initiatives to accelerate decarbonization and promote adaptation, and hosted over 80 hours of programming, bringing together over 220 government ministers, civil society representatives, experts and others to our first ever World Bank Group Pavilion. Here are 7 highlights from the World Bank Group's delivery at our pavilion in COP27 : Methane concentrations in the atmosphere saw their largest year-on-year jump in both 2020 and 2021 since measurements began nearly 40 years ago. At COP27 , World Bank Group President David Malpass hosted a discussion with John Podesta, US States Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation, Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change, as well as Odile Renaud-Basso, President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Werner Hoyer, President of the European Investment Bank, discussing actions to address emissions from this potent greenhouse gas. President Malpass outlined plans to bring much more finance to tackle methane, as well as the Bank Group's wealth of experience reducing methane emissions in the sectors that generate the most: agriculture, energy, sanitation and waste. At COP26, more than 100 countries committed to the Global Methane Pledge to collectively reduce methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 (relative to 2020). By the end of COP27 , more than 150 countries have signed the pledge. Replay the World Bank Live event. 2) Showcasing transformational climate and development reports The Bank shared key findings from the first batch of its new core diagnostic, Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs), covering 24 countries, with the key takeaway that countries can continue to grow and develop while reducing emissions if they embrace major change. Doing so could result in a 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050. The CCDR synthesis paper, launched before COP, highlighted the fundamental link between climate and development: the future impacts of climate change depend on the choices countries make today, particularly those investments that also boost development outcomes, including in critical infrastructure or to safeguard communities and livelihoods. CCDRs are country-specific roadmaps to green, resilient and inclusive development, showing which strategies will do the most, the fastest, to reduce GHG emissions in each country while achieving other development goals. Several CCDRs were showcased at COP, bringing together the Bank teams that worked on them with ministers and officials from China, South Africa, the Sahel G-5 countries, Philippines, Pakistan, Malawi, Rwanda, Argentina, and Nepal. Watch the replay of the COP27 event. Capacity, robust policies, finance is critical for Malawi to build infrastructure that can withstand climate shock and stresses, to halt and reverse forest and environmental degradation, as well as to address climate impacts for labor productivity, as well as household livelihoods.

The following information was released by the Scottish Government: Breakthrough with loss and damage fund. Commenting on the conclusion of COP27 in Egypt, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: " COP27 has finally seen an acknowledgement by developed countries that the people least responsible for global warming are the ones suffering its worst consequences and that we have an obligation to support those experiencing the impacts of the climate crisis in the here and now. "The agreement to establish a fund for loss and damage is truly groundbreaking and is a testament to 30 years of hard campaigning by the global south and civil society. I am pleased that Scotland, in being the first developed country ever to make a financial contribution, has been able to play a small part in that journey working with others over the last twelve months to build the momentum that has led to today's decision. "There remains a lot of detail to be worked out over the next year ahead of COP28, but from the inclusion of loss and damage on the agenda, to the agreement to establish a fund, this COP has delivered a real breakthrough for vulnerable and developing countries. "It is deeply disappointing that the recognition of loss and damage has not been matched by greater action to prevent a worsening of the climate crisis. Keeping 1.5 alive and delivering the fastest possible transition away from fossil fuels is key to preventing greater loss and damage in the future. Alongside loss and damage we needed to see progress on adaptation and mitigation, on the submission of new national contributions, a pathway to 2030 and a strengthening of the language of the Glasgow Pact. "It is simply not good enough that countries failed to make progress on that agenda, and that there has been such a strong push back on action we all know is needed if 1.5 is to remain truly within reach. It is vitally important that countries recommit themselves to doing everything they can to ensure we keep 1.5 alive and to building a coalition ahead of COP28 that protects and drives progress against any further push back. "Despite that disappointment, and the challenges faced by civil society in having their voice heard in Egypt, the breakthrough on loss and damage is what I hope COP27 will be remembered for, and that is a vital step forward for the developing world." \</doc>

The following information was released by United Nations Volunteers: From 6 to 18 November 2022, UN Volunteers are supporting the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Among these are nine UN Volunteers, predominantly youth and women, deployed by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). Their role? To lead a network of over 500 local youth volunteers servicing COP27 , under the overall supervision of Egypt's Ministry of Social Solidarity. COP27 represents the largest annual gathering on climate action. In particular, it aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen commitments to finance climate action in the Global South countries and ensure broad engagement towards a climate-resilient, carbon-neutral future. The conference's agenda includes several events which serve this purpose, such as introducing sustainable agriculture, renewable energy and biodiversity. These seek to make climate action relevant to everyday life and livelihoods, and help youth see themselves as leaders in climate action for the first time. Nine UN Volunteers, including seven women, have been involved in COP27 preparations for months. Initially, they were trained as trainers, completing courses on the Sustainable Development Goals and leadership development modules. Then, in September and October 2022, the UN Volunteers took part in assessing the skills of applicants keen to support the conference as volunteers. They then helped place the 500 successful youth in volunteer roles closely related to their interests and career aspirations. While training the youth volunteers for their assignments, UN Volunteers highlighted volunteering as a means of accelerating climate action. Our team is helping to organize activities, supervising large teams of volunteers and providing logistics, training and technical support. Thus, they are helping make COP27 successful and inclusive, even as they are networking, exploring career paths and finding their purpose. --Heba Nossier, UNV Country Coordinator in Egypt One UN Volunteer, Saif Ismail, is currently supporting the Ministry of Social Solidarity as a Volunteer Management Coordinator. He also helps manage social media and advocacy initiatives, with the aim of uniting people of all ages around a common cause. I create communications campaigns and ensure we post daily on all social media platforms. I have also built a team of volunteers with passion and skills in the media field to assist with high quality production. -- UN Volunteer Saif Ismail, Volunteer Management Coordinator with UNDP, placed in Egypt's Ministry of Social Solidarity The role of UN Volunteers in COP27 is part of a larger effort to strengthen the capacity of local teams and promote climate action year-round. There are currently several UN Volunteers deployed with UN partners in Cairo, whose roles include supporting climate action. One such volunteer is Cherryn Shin (Republic of Korea), who serves as Programme Analyst with the UN Population Fund's Arab States Regional Office in the areas of youth, peace and security. She recognizes the impact of climate change upon social protection mechanisms and the related inequalities which put the lives of youth and adolescents at risk. "In reality, their voices are rarely heard," Cherryn argues. I volunteer for climate action to ensure the voices of youth are heard and they can participate in important decision-making processes. --Cherryn Shin, UN Volunteer Programme Analyst with UNFPA, Egypt Together, these UN Volunteers facilitate the participation of UN agencies, ministries and non-governmental partners at COP27 , including youth-led local organizations. They also raise awareness of intersectional issues such as gender equity and health, where the youth voice has taken centre stage. \</doc>

November 7, 2022 2:59 AM Dozens of people who called for demonstrations during the COP27 climate conference underway in Egypt were arrested in the lead up to the opening of the conference, Human Rights Watch said in a statement Sunday. Security measures in Sharm el-Sheikh, the resort town where the conference is being held, have been stringent. Officials have required the installation of cameras in all taxis, a move that allows security agency surveillance of drivers and passengers, HRW said ( HYPERLINK https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/11/06/egypt-arrests-curbs-protests-cop27-nears https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/11/06/egypt-arrests-curbs-protests- HYPERLINK cop27 -nears ). In addition, Egyptian officials have imposed what HRW describes as an "unduly complicated process" for registering for access to the Green Zone outside the COP venue. In previous summits, the Green Zone has been open - allowing for an exchange of ideas on climate issues and giving summit participants the opportunity to interact with the public. The Egyptian government has also released a smartphone application for attendees that asks for personal information, including passport numbers. HRW said an analysis of the application by two local rights groups revealed the app required access to the phone's camera, microphone, location and Bluetooth connection. HRW said all the information gathered from the phone app could also be shared with third parties, raising privacy issues. HRW said the restrictions "would effectively hinder meaningful participation by nongovernmental groups and journalists during COP, preventing a successful and ambitious outcome of the climate summit." \</doc>

Sep 28, 2022( 3BL Blogs: http://3blmedia.com http://3blmedia.com Tetra Tech's Rodrigo Chaparro, senior climate advisor, looks at how international development agencies can advance carbon markets. This is the third in a three-part series exploring how Article 6 of the Paris Agreement can spur the clean energy transition. With the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference [1] ( COP27 Although the potential benefits of cooperation are clearly huge, how to cooperate remains a big question. 'The new market-based instruments approved by Article 6 encourage international carbon trading. Successful implementation will require funding, technical advice, and sustained support from development agencies.' Successful implementation of Article 6 rests on the capacity of countries to address four key issues, which will require funding, technical advice, and sustained support from international development agencies. First it is critical to classify the country's target mitigation efforts: Actions a country commits to implement on its own (e.g., unconditional targets such as reduction of fuel subsidies) Actions that need international financial support (e.g., conditional targets such as aggressive renewable energy goals) Actions that go beyond the country's NDC commitments due to financial or local capacity constraints or national priorities (e.g., introduction of emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage) Only projects in categories 2 and 3 are eligible for international markets, where emission reductions are transferred from one country to another. International trading must supplement domestic action. Therefore each country needs to define which mitigation efforts it will implement on its own and which ones will be eligible for international trading. This requires a careful review of the country's NDC targets, a cost-benefit analysis, and policy decisions on which sectors such as transportation, electricity production, agriculture, forestry and which greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide, methane, hydrochlorofluorocarbons are eligible for international markets. Key Issue 2 The Corresponding Adjustment Every country must address a long-standing stumbling block in Article 6 negotiations: the issue of double counting. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) established an accounting mechanism known as the 'corresponding adjustment' to ensure that only one country counts each emission reduction. If a country authorizes a transfer of emissions under Article 6, the mitigating country subtracts the emission reduction from its GHG balance, while the acquiring country adds the emission reduction to its GHG results. The corresponding adjustments are a means to ensure the integrity of carbon markets and the complementary relationship of voluntary carbon markets with the decarbonization efforts under the Paris Agreement. Determining when the corresponding adjustment is necessary will require a bit more fine-tuning. Once a country clarifies the sectors and gases covered under Article 6, it will need to specify if a corresponding adjustment is required when a credit is transferred to another country. If the credits are authorized by the host country, a formal process to transfer and apply the corresponding adjustments between the two countries will be required. This will involve some technical and legal work as not all countries have the same type of NDC targets. Some countries have established targets based on a percentage reduction compared to a base year, while others have a carbon budget or a target emission level for a specific year. Countries will need to define how to manage the accounting when the trade involves non-equivalent frameworks. Credits not authorized by the host country do not require a corresponding adjustment. However, they still may be eligible for international trading under the voluntary carbon markets. Key Issue 3 Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification Tracking emission reduction credits and preventing double counting will require a robust national emissions reporting system that is transparent and secure. This national reporting system should record data that is standardized internationally for ease of auditing to accommodate bilateral (Cooperative Approach) and multilateral (Sustainable Development Mechanism) approaches[3]. Additionally if information from different countries and registry systems is reflected in a common system, there will be less risk of the same carbon credit being sold twice. The ongoing development of national carbon markets in various countries adds to the complexity, though it also can contribute to transparency and expedite implementation. All this points to the need for significant monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) and administration capacity. Countries will need to establish guidelines for evaluating carbon credits and deciding which can be sold, how they should be priced, and how the country will report on them. The use of high-quality credits is crucial to the realization of net-zero emissions. High-quality credits are based on sound accounting principles and meet additionality criteria[5], meaning they represent emission reductions that would not have occurred otherwise. The system for monitoring and evaluation of credits needs to be constructed so that it works across sectors and incorporates all programs and policies related to achievement of the NDCs. A proper MRV system should track not only GHG and short-lived climate pollutants but also mitigation activities and climate finance. Digitalization of MRV processes will reduce the time, and consequently the transaction costs, required to generate emission reduction trades. This will help ensure that more of the carbon revenues flow toward mitigation projects. It also will enable an automated process of following every traded credit from its generation all the way to its transaction. Key Issue 4 Regulatory and Administrative Frameworks Carbon credits subject to a corresponding adjustment will require a formal endorsement by governments. This is required not only because those transfers will affect the NDC targets but also because they will be subject to international trade rules. Participating parties will need to establish robust administrative processes to guarantee the transparency of the approval protocols for specific projects. They also will need to establish the legal validity of final transactions and the proper and timely reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[6] of any changes in the NDCs. This implies the creation of new institutions or the appointment of committees with enough authority to endorse those transactions. Japan's Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) and the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)[7] provide examples of such regulatory bodies. Japan's JCM uses bilateral committees and the Kyoto Protocol's CDM requires approval from a national designated authority. Successful participation of countries and companies in international markets and the achievement of crucial NDCs hinges on the development of regulatory and administrative frameworks within countries and globally. 'Successful participation in international carbon markets and the achievement of crucial NDCs hinges on the development of national and international regulatory and administrative frameworks.' How can Tetra Tech collaborate with international development agencies to support countries' participation in carbon markets? Tetra Tech has extensive experience providing governments with comprehensive programmatic support to develop and implement their low-carbon development strategies and associated NDCs. Since the outset of the carbon market in the early 2000s, we have been deploying comprehensive low-carbon programs around the globe[8]. Our approach is to accelerate the implementation of clean technologies and policies to achieve net-zero emissions. We also aim to enhance the resilience of systems by maximizing the potential benefits of carbon credits. Our climate change services[9] include: Formulating national[10] and regional[11] decarbonization strategies and plans Developing policy, regulatory, and pricing frameworks that benefit from carbon markets Managing the transition to competitive markets[12] Assessing GHG mitigation options Supporting monitoring, reporting, and verification Enhancing institutional infrastructure for the deployment of efficient carbon markets Establishing public-private partnerships Read more from Rodrigo about how Article 6 of the Paris Agreement can spur the clean energy transition: Special thanks to Juan Pedro Searle Solar, chief of climate change unit and senior advisor for Article 6 negotiations under the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) Presidency Team, Ministry of Energy, Chile, for his review and feedback [ 1]: HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg https:// cop27 HYPERLINK https://cop27.eg .eg / [ 2]: HYPERLINK https://newsroom.unfccc.int/news/bonn-climate-change-conference-to-lay-groundwork-for-success-at-cop27-0 https://newsroom.unfccc.int/news/bonn-climate-change-conference-to-lay-groundwork-for-success-at- HYPERLINK https://newsroom.unfccc.int/news/bonn-climate-change-conference-to-lay-groundwork-for-success-at-cop27-0 cop27 -0 [ 3]: HYPERLINK https://www.tetratech.com/en/markets/energy/news-and-insights/using-carbon-markets-to-fuel-the-energy-transition [ 4]: HYPERLINK https://www.ieta.org/resources/International_WG/Article6/CLPC_A6%20report_no%20crops.pdf https://www.ieta.org/resources/International_WG/Article6/CLPC_A6%20report_no%20crops.pdf [ 5]: HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/IN.SBSTA2021.i15a.1_i15b.1_i15c.1.pdf https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/IN.SBSTA2021.i15a.1_i15b.1_i15c.1.pdf [ 6]: HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int https://unfccc.int / [ 7]: HYPERLINK https://www.tetratech.com/en/markets/energy/news-and-insights/three-new-business-models-to-achieve-carbon-reduction-goals https://www.tetratech.com/en/markets/energy/news-and-insights/three-new-business-models-to-achieve-carbon-reduction-goals HYPERLINK https://www.tetratech.com/en/experts/expert-qa-ara%C3%AD-monteforte-looks-at-the-transition-to-cleaner-more-sustainable-energy-around-the-world https://www.tetratech.com/en/experts/expert-qa-ara%C3%AD-monteforte-looks-at-the-transition-to-cleaner-more-sustainable-energy-around-the-world [ 9]: HYPERLINK https://www.tetratech.com/en/markets/international-development/services/climate-change-services https://www.tetratech.com/en/markets/international-development/services/climate-change-services [ 10]: HYPERLINK https://www.tetratech.com/en/projects/indonesia-clean-energy-development-project https://www.tetratech.com/en/projects/indonesia-clean-energy-development-project [ 11]: HYPERLINK https://www.tetratech.com/en/projects/scaling-up-renewable-energy-worldwide https://www.tetratech.com/en/projects/scaling-up-renewable-energy-worldwide [ 12]: HYPERLINK https://www.tetratech.com/en/projects/development-of-regional-energy-markets-in-eastern-europe https://www.tetratech.com/en/projects/development-of-regional-energy-markets-in-eastern-europe \</doc>

The World Bank issued the following news release on Nov. 9, 2022: The World Bank has approved a $30 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA) to enable Mali to improve agricultural productivity and strengthen the resilience of rural households living in the targeted drylands. This additional financing is made available under the Mali Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Development Project in Semi-Arid Zones (PDAZAM). These additional funds will cover the costs of an emergency response to food insecurity as well as those generated by inflationary pressures, due in part to the Ukrainian crisis and insecurity. The project activities target the poor and vulnerable, including women, young people, and internally displaced persons. "These additional resources will increase the number of households receiving direct cash transfers from about 40,000 to 193,000 households, and will help alleviate the food insecurity they face," says Clara De Sousa, World Bank Country Director for Mali. She specifies that in addition "with women playing a dominant role in subsistence farming and in the sale of processed foods in rural and urban markets, the households headed by them and women farmers will be targeted to amplify the benefits of the project." With these additional funds, PDAZAM will be able to assist a larger number of eligible recipients in the intervention area, i.e., the regions of Kayes, Koulikoro, Segou, Mopti, and elsewhere in the event of a food crisis declaration. The rapid spread of food insecurity across the country has led to the emergence of affected areas needing support. These additional funds, provided a few days after the launch of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt, address the World Bank's objectives of strengthening the production and resilience of food systems, facilitating trade, developing inclusive value chains, and supporting vulnerable households and producers. The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the world's poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people's lives. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world's 76 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. Resources from IDA bring positive change to the 1.6 billion people who live in IDA countries. Since 1960, IDA has supported development work in 113 countries. Annual commitments have averaged about $21 billion over the last three years, with about 61 percent going to Africa.

The Sierra Club issued the following news release: The 27th UN Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) climate negotiations ended, with countries agreeing to develop new funding arrangements, including a dedicated fund to help the most vulnerable countries cope with the adverse impacts of climate change and reaffirming the need to stay below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. At the same time, negotiators could not agree on language to phase down oil and gas use globally, which scientists agree is essential to keeping climate change within manageable limits. That language would have built on the agreement at COP26 to accelerate the phase down of coal use globally. Additionally, the US made notable commitments and announcements at COP27 , including  The EPA announced the long-awaited supplemental methane rule, which aims to establish strong, commonsense protections against methane and other harmful pollution from the oil and gas industry.  The Biden Administration announced a new federal contractor emissions rule requiring major federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions publicly and set targets for their reduction in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement.  During his speech at COP27 , President Biden also committed to doubling the US pledge to the Adaptation Fund, launching a new initiative to support Egypt in deploying 10 gigawatts of clean energy and retiring five gigawatts of methane gas generation and launching a Climate Gender Equity Fund and an Indigenous Peoples Finance Access Facility.  The United States announced with Japan and others a $20 billion package of public and private funding to help Indonesia retire coal plants and peak their emissions by the end of the decade.    In response, Sierra Club Senior International Climate and Policy Campaign Director Cherelle Blazer issued the following statement: "The progress made in Sharm El-Sheikh on creating funding arrangements for Loss and Damage is a landmark achievement. When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was first agreed 30 years ago, rich countries committed to help climate vulnerable nations cope with the adverse impacts of climate change. That promise, however, has gone almost entirely unfulfilled in the decades since. This agreement from COP27 is the most significant step forward on Loss and Damage that we have ever seen, and it will provide desperately-needed assistance for the countries who need it most. "Yet the work is still far from complete. Countries could not even agree on the need to phase down oil and gas use, which is absolutely critical to meeting the 1.5 degree limit. We are at a point in the climate crisis where we must do what is necessary to secure a livable planet for all, and failing to make progress toward all of our climate goals is unacceptable."

The following information was released by Chatham House: With so many issues urgently needing attention, it is vital countries put aside their differences and fund the solutions to worsening global climate impacts. Antony Froggatt Bernice Lee Ruth Townend Although global attention on COPs fluctuates from year to year, ultimately all of them are important, even those where big decisions are not expected. One of the reasons for this is that the coming together of all parties can act as push mechanisms for new political leadership on climate to emerge, in sometimes unexpected ways. At COP26, the US turnaround on climate following the election of President Joe Biden provided hope and momentum. For COP27 , it appears likely Brazil's president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil could be the star attraction, with the potential to inject new urgency into the process. Brazil's narrow bucking of the global trend towards more right-wing, less climate-committed leadership as seen in Sweden and the UK has raised hopes for positive outcomes from the summit. It will be interesting to see if US and Brazilian leadership might be greater than the sum of their parts, especially in the context of souring US-China relations leading to the downfall of the surprising alliance formed at the last COP. Although the negotiating framework of COP27 does not have a major delivery mandate, its overall success and impact will be judged on delivery in key areas. Progress must be made on the politically sensitive issue of Loss and Damage. The Glasgow Climate Pact includes a specific section on the requirement for a two-year dialogue to discuss funding arrangements for this, and the Egyptian presidency of COP27 has highlighted it would like to see significant progress too. Anticipating the fact that COP27 is unlikely to see a slew of raised ambition on the table, the incoming presidency has emphasized implementation over new pledges Some G77 members, such as members of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), are calling for there to be a decision to establish a facility in principle at COP27 . There is some reluctance for this particularly from some developed countries but if it does not go ahead, clear progress must be made to define how and when it will be established and the involvement of international financial institutions. Adaptation finance needs to plug gaps As COP27 will be an African COP, there are high hopes adaptation will receive much-needed attention. The Glasgow Climate Pact urges developed countries to double adaptation finance by 2025 but much more is needed. The IMF estimates developing countries require $2.5 trillion of external financing annually until 2030 to meet both the Paris Agreement and the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Climate risk is as much an issue of vulnerability as it is of climate hazard, and the IPCC classes around half the world's population as 'extremely vulnerable' to climate change. Current adaptation actions are making a difference but most are essentially 'firefighting' by prioritizing immediate and near-term risks. Progress is uneven and there are adaptation gaps where truly transformational action is needed. Adaptation lacks a clearly defined goal unlike mitigation's 1.5 and two degree warming thresholds and the two-year GlasgowSharm el-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation (GGA) which was agreed at COP26 seeks to remedy this. Parties at COP27 should work to enhance understanding of the GGA and to improve the process and measures of progress. Move from targets to implementation Since Glasgow, it is disappointing that only 24 countries have provided revised NDCs (national determined contributions) plans to achieve decarbonization targets by 2030 and that the majority of these did not raise ambition. Perhaps anticipating the fact that COP27 is unlikely to see a slew of raised ambition on the table, the incoming presidency has emphasized implementation over new pledges, calling for a move to 'specific, measurable, impactful initiatives to be delivered and implemented on the ground.' This move is vital because, although many countries have stated an ambition to reach net-zero emissions by or around mid-century, the United Nations (UN) notes many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now. Ambitious climate action, implemented well before 2030, is urgently needed to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. The role of the vulnerable countries is evolving as is the extent to which they will be setting the pace and the mood for COP27 This said, a huge emissions gap remains and, given the failure of the call for new NDCs, hopes of tackling this gap at COP27 are in part pinned on the agreement of the 'mitigation work programme' process which aims to urgently scale up mitigation ambition and implementation pre-2030. A draft decision on upscaling ambition could be adopted and progress is a crucial element of global governance in keeping 1.5\'cbC alive. The good news is that the clean energy agenda has demonstrated political and economic resilience in many parts of the world. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more than 80 per cent of new global capacity additions in 2021 were from solar (50 per cent) wind (25 per cent) and hydro (seven per cent) compared to only 15 per cent fossil fuel generation. Increased political strife can be sidelined With significantly higher fossil fuel prices due to the war in Ukraine, the economic advantage of renewables is even more apparent. However, remarkable geopolitical shifts of 2022 such as a deterioration in both US and European relations with China can have a significant effect on the mood music and outcome of COP27 . COP27 . They are aligned with China and India in challenging rich countries to step up their game on loss and damage, while on mitigation they are working with the European Union (EU) and the US in driving larger emissions reductions. \</doc>

Nov 15, 2022( The People's Vanguard of Davis: HYPERLINK http://davisvanguard.org http://davisvanguard.org By Kayla Ngai World leaders insist[1] on cutting pollution and energy expenses during this year's COP27 . Although this emphasis is generally stated annually, many countries recognize Putin's war on Ukraine as especially detrimental to the environment. The war is[1] primarily financed by Russia's gas which has led to more oil and gas drilling (and higher prices) which has, in turn, influenced the climate impacts on underdeveloped countries. At this time, our expenditure harms everybody. Unsurprisingly, however, it is hurting less-developed countries the most. As the larger and more developed nations are the ones contributing the most to climate change, it is our responsibility to slow our gas usage to protect our fellow smaller ones. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) is held every year in different places, and this year, it was held in Egypt. The conference began on November 6 and is set to end by the 18th. So far, most of their discussions concerned gas resources. During the event[2], Bill McKibben, who is a US environmentalist and founder of 350.org, reported, that 'this year we've fully understood the link between fossil fuels and fascism. Putin could not have invaded Ukraine without the profits from oil and gas, or cowered the west with threats of turning off the taps.' Thus, many European countries are looking to depend less on Russian gas and find new sources. The United Arab Emirates' prince bin Zayed responded[1] that their country is a '#8216;responsible' gas producer.' Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain still implored, however, that developed countries should look for more sustainable options: renewable energy. This conversation quickly escalated into a debate between the rich and the poor. Namibian President Hage Geingob called[3] out developed countries as 'criminals.' They reap the benefits of using excess gas and energy the most, but the ones that suffer are the poorer nations. In anotherinstance[3], Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas mentions how his country is battling sea-level rises. There are[3] also currently many flash floods in Pakistan which have killed thousands and affected millions of residents. Still, little has been done to prepare the communities for upcoming disasters. This reveals a real contention between developing and developed countries. Because of the way wealthier nations accumulated their income and status (mostly by using and selling fossil fuels), the more impoverished countries think that it should fall on the rich to rectify their damage. They believe that they should mainly foot the expense. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which is a group of smaller countries[4] (Belize, Tonga, Singapore, and more), believes that they '#8216;could carry a portion of their burden' by paying a tax on profits.' However, rather than address these concerns[3], 'leaders of richer nations said countries should stay the course in tackling climate change despite the war in Ukraine and global energy shocks.' Not only should citizens and representatives of developed countries help reduce the effects of climate change by implementing more renewable energy in our infrastructure, but there should be a spread of awareness on how our actions impact other people. On a similar note, actor[5] Rainn Wilson (most known as Dwight Schrute from The Office) has legally changed his name to 'Rainfall Heat Wave Extreme Winter Wilson' to protest Arctic climate change. Climate change has been an issue for years. This issue is saturated in many sectors of our government. Not only does it have an impact on our environment, but our economy, livelihood, and politics, as our gas usage pays for a war that many of us do not agree with. However, we should be more cognizant of how much climate change has affected the spaces of other countries. With China and the United States being the top contributors to carbon emissions and expended energy, we[1] need to work together to spread the word and also cut down our ecological destruction.

The New Development Bank issued the following news release: The President of the New Development Bank (NDB), Mr. Marcos Troyjo, and the Minister of Finance of Egypt, H.E. Dr. Mohamed Maait, met at the 27th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP27 ) in Sharm El Sheikh. They discussed plans for collaboration in the context of Egypt's participation as a member of NDB and shared their collective vision to advance on the objectives of the 2030 Agenda. "NDB is honored to forge a strong relationship with Egypt. We are deeply motivated by the breadth of opportunities that we have been exploring throughout COP27 . NDB looks forward to advancing jointly on key issues of sustainable development across emerging economies - including climate action," said Mr. Marcos Troyjo. "NDB's mandate stands in harmony with Egypt's vision for sustainable development. Working with the Bank represents an important opportunity to drive forward on our ambitions for green and sustainable economic growth. I am delighted to take another important step towards launching our full participation in this important institution by signing today the Instrument of Accession to NDB, which will be submitted to Parliament as one of the last-step procedures before Egypt formally joins the Bank as a full member," said H.E. Dr. Mohamed Maait. NDB started expanding its membership in 2021 with the admission of Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Egypt. Membership to NDB becomes effective once the admitted country completes its domestic processes and deposits the instrument of accession. The Bank's membership expansion is in line with its strategy to become a premier development institution for emerging market economies.

The following information was released by Fauna & Flora International (FFI): Written by Zoi Quiroz Cullen For two weeks, parties from across the world came together at COP27 in Egypt to negotiate how we can all work to both negate and navigate the impacts of climate change. Resulting from the discussions is the COP27 final decision text otherwise known as the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan which outlines commitments and priorities for nations to take forward. From a positive recognition of the twin climate and nature crises, to lacklustre decarbonisation and finance commitments, we analysed the key areas covered: Climate and nature COP27 got under way, we urged parties to remember the critical role that nature has to play in limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. Nature has a potentially immense influence on both climate change mitigation and adaptation; it is therefore crucial that the climate change crisis is approached in tandem with the other critical crisis the planet is facing: biodiversity loss. These two crises are deeply intertwined; w ithout biodiversity, we cannot have a safe and liveable climate, but the more the climate warms, the more nature is put at risk. In the COP27 The wins for nature are, however, bittersweet given the challenges of driving more ambitious action on reducing emissions. In this context, COP27 hasn't delivered much. In fact, it's barely been able to hold the baseline agreed last year in Glasgow and the world is still heading for 2.4C of warming by the end of century under current 2030 climate targets. Adaptation The enhancement of adaptation the process of helping people and nature to cope with the unavoidable impacts of climate change , in particular locally led adaptation, was another key FFI priority at COP27 . During the conference, the two-year-long GlasgowSharm el-Sheikh Work Programme on designing a framework for the Global Goal on Adaptation reached its midterm. Results were discussed and welcomed, and the final decision will be made at COP28. We are pleased that community- and ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation that take into consideration vulnerable groups, communities and ecosystems, and the knowledge of Indigenous Peoples are mentioned as cross-cutting considerations for the development of the framework. However, adaptation finance commitments still don't go far enough. During 2022, the Adaptation Fund received over US$230 million for action on adaptation from developed countries, but this is still just a fraction of what is needed. According to the latest UNEP Adaptation Gap Report , annual adaptation needs will reach US$160-340 billion by 2030 and US$315-565 billion by 2050. The COP27 decision urges developed countries to "urgently and significantly scale up their provision of climate finance" for adaptation, but, disappointingly, there is no call to prepare a concrete roadmap on how they are actually going to deliver last year's promise of "doubling adaptation finance from 2019 levels by 2025". Climate finance In general, there was little new climate finance on the table and the US$100 billion per year (promised in 2009) still hasn't been delivered in full by developed countries. While finance commitments are lacking, momentum was gained for the need to reform the international financial system to make it fairer and fitter for purpose to finance the transition and resilience needs of developing countries. A more detailed proposal will be developed by next spring. The decision to establish a dedicated fund to help vulnerable countries to address loss and damage caused by climate change is a huge step forward, and clarifying the further details is urgent. With the Loss and Damage fund, COP27 has given a strong push to treat the symptoms of the climate crisis, but finance needs will continue to escalate, and the prospects of keeping the 1.5C target within reach diminish with every year of weak action to address the causes of climate change. In terms of mobilising market mechanisms to foster greater international cooperation on meeting climate targets, and flows of public and private finance, there are still significant loopholes in the rules on carbon markets, which could potentially undermine the integrity and efficiency of markets, as well as the quality of carbon credits. At a time when the focus on integrity and transparency is ramping up significantly within the voluntary carbon markets, it is particularly important that this is also mirrored within the UNFCCC process. On a brighter note, corporates' behaviour will be under higher scrutiny to ensure credibility and effectiveness of their net zero commitments: at COP27 a UN expert group published its recommendations (including red lines) for industry, regions and cities, and a new task force was set up to develop rules together with regulators to improve integrity and transparency of net zero plans. Significantly for nature, reference to the REDD+ mechanism, which was removed during COP26 last year, was negotiated back into the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan. Rainforest nations, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Honduras, were active in negotiating to enshrine this mechanism for sustainable management and financing of forests in developing countries. Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) The COP27 What comes next? Despite greater recognition of the connections between climate and nature in the decision text, it's highly disappointing that there was no mention of COP27 's upcoming sister convention on nature the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) or COP15, taking place in Montreal from 7th to 19th December 2022. By failing to connect the two conferences, an opportunity has been missed to, firstly, ensure approaches to the twin crises are aligned and, secondly, highlight the significance of CBD for the future of nature and ergo, the climate. Without a 'Paris moment' at CBD and the formulation of an ambitious Global Biodiversity Framework, we put ourselves at grave risk of running out of time to halt biodiversity loss and mitigate climate change. Look out for more on this in the coming weeks. \</doc>

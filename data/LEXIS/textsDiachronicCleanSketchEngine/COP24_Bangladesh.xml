Bangladesh, Dec. 26 -- After two weeks of tension-filled discussions, the Katowice Climate Change Conference, mostly known as COP24 concluded on Saturday evening. In two weeks the delegates focused on outlining strategies for a common "Rulebook" for all nations that will govern the basics of how countries cut their emissions, provide finance to vulnerable countries and ensure that all countries are doing as promised. It is estimated that, nearly 23,000 delegates from all over the globe descended on the coal-tinged city and finally secured an agreement on a range of measures that will make the Paris climate pact operational in 2020.The agreement concerned the starting of a new international climate regime under which, all parties will have to report the status of their emissions and progress in cutting them every two years from 2024. At the end of the first week, many expressed frustration and disappointment when the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait objected to the conference "welcoming" the IPCC report which was launched last October on the impacts of a temperature rise of 1.5C. The report said that the world is now completely off track, heading more towards a global temperature increase of about 3C, inevitably leading to upheavals and a global climatic collapse. Saudi Arabia had fought strongly in Korea to limit the conclusions of the document and finally they gave in. But it now seems that they have brought their objections to Poland. Most of the parties felt that acknowledging the science was critical at this conference. The outcome incorporated hints at the need for more ambitious climate pledges before 2020. NGOs and CSOs representatives were disappointed at the absence of more forceful language. Yet, poor countries won the assurances that rich ones would help pay for their efforts to curb their greenhouse-gas emissions and to adapt to rising sea-levels, droughts, floods, storms and other climate-induced disasters. Meanwhile, new research released at the COP showed that global emissions were going up, not down. The Talanoa Dialogue concluded at COP24 with an appeal to update the climate pledges and increase finance flows particularly for developing or vulnerable countries to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change. However, the conclusions of this year-long process are only "noted" in the final decision text, and parties are "invited" to look at them. The issue of imposing legal binding for triggering climate change has long been rejected by richer countries. A stalemate between Brazil and other countries over the rules for monitoring carbon credits threatened to derail the discussions. Brazil was suggesting a weaker set of rules on carbon markets, in spite of facing a strong disagreement from many other nations. These talks have now been postponed to next year. One of the most striking things about this Katowice conference was the active participation of energized youth groups in far greater numbers particularly, in numerous side-events. Hosting COP 24 at Katowice, the home of Poland's coal miners, was meant to signify the transition from an old, dirty world to a new, clean one. During the conference, technical progress was made but thousands of people on the street didn't demonstrate for a rulebook, rather they demanded ambitious climate protection. We have more to do but we can move forward now, as the negotiators in Katowice have finally secured an agreement on a variety of measures that will make the Paris climate agreement operational in 2020 which is believed to ensure that countries will keep their promises to cut emissions. In this context, technical talks will continue as governments are yet to prepare for next year's conference in Chile. If COP24 and its successors want to make a long-term impact and have a realistic evaluation of global conditions, they must prevail on narrow conceptual enthusiasm and adopt specific actions.

Bangladesh and a number of other nations affected by climate change have called for the formation of a guideline to implement the Paris Agreement. The call was made at the high-level meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP24 ) in Poland. 'Affected countries have been pressuring the developed nations to implement the Paris Agreement,' said Abdullah Al Mohsin, Bangladesh's environment and climate change secretary heading the country's delegation. 'We will continue the discussion in the last three days of COP24 .' At Monday's COP24 meeting, speakers emphasised urgent action by developed countries to keep global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius. Negotiators from around the world met in Poland on December 2 for talks on climate change - three years after landmark Paris deal that set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. Envoys gathered in Katowice for the UN meeting that runs until December 14. It received a boost over the weekend after 19 major economies affirmed their commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord at the G20 summit. The only holdout was the US. \</doc>

With the eagerly awaiting global climate conference (Conference of the Parties - COP24 ) at Katowice, Poland knocking the door, talks are gathering momentum about whether it would reach the dream destination. Can the summit reach meeting of minds about the guidelines as to how the Paris Agreement can be implemented? Can the draft of Paris Rule Book be agreed and adopted? Can the nations get clear signals that they would strengthen their climate commitments by 2020? Can the vulnerable countries get the trust from the developing nations about delivering adequate finance? The COP24 The world experienced on how the global warming has already started playing havoc in different parts of the world. Winter has become more severe in many countries with massive snowfalls bringing life to a stand still. The Western Europe experienced unprecedented warm and humid summer, countries in Arabian deserts experienced torrential rainfall. Cyclones, Tsunami, earthquake, flooding etc. are destroying the life and properties more frequently in many countries. Nature is well and truly taking revenge of human-induced global warming. GHG emissions, global warming are no longer myths. The world community must no longer keep crossing their fingers and doing little. All countries must start implementing their respective NDCs. The developed countries must honour commitments of contribution to the Green Climate Fund. They must come forward to transfer technology, assist generously the most vulnerable countries in capacity building. As the time is ticking, the COP24 is going to be a critical assembly for agreeing to the Rule Book. Actions must start by 2020, but before that the pledged US$ 100 billion must be accumulated in GCF with the modality for accessing it and ensuring lions share of it to climate vulnerable LDCs. There have been significant parleys and preparatory meetings towards achieving a success. Key negotiators assembled in Bangkok, Thailand recently reviewed guidelines for implementing the Paris Agreement. Among others, the following key tasks came up on the discussion table for focussing in the COP24 :  Translating options into legal language; and  Compiling the negotiating text that facilitates the final discussion at COP24 . Opinions differed on how to provide flexibility for reporting and accounting requirements to developing countries in view of their capacities. It needs further clarification on how comprehensive the reporting need be in the context of review and global stocktake process. The developing countries need clarification whether the reports need including only mitigation, adaptation and support or also include loss and damage, adverse impacts of mitigation actions etc. The developing countries also need clarification on addressing equity in operation of the global stocktake and dealing with the forward looking finance information and process to set a collective finance goal for the period following 2025. The two of the most important issues which remains unresolved are: whether and how guidance should apply differently for developed and developing countries on sharing information about mitigation components of the parties\' NDCs. There still needs discussion on broader aspects beyond mitigation. Two aspects of climate finance still not agreed. These are how to deal with information communicated by the developed and other contributor countries on future climate finance. The other is establishment of a process for setting the post-2025 collective finance goal, beyond the US$ 100 billion a year, developed countries have agreed to mobilize by 2020. The developed countries still maintain that there is no mandate from the Paris Agreement for discussing the above two finance related areas. They insist that the other areas of Paris Agreement Work Program should be agreed before discussing the finance issues. Developing countries were frustrated by the lack of developed countries' engagement on these finance issues and for having their proposals on the mitigation elements of the NDCs. It is to be noted with attention that the Bangkok negotiation lacked the spirit of solidarity that swept over the Paris Agreement. Discussions on the critical issues could not reach meeting of minds for developed and developing countries\' dynamics. However, the Bangkok negotiation expressed optimism through developing around 300-page document, tracking mandate into balanced, legally binding negotiating text. We hope that the countries would assemble in Poland with clear mindset for resolving outstanding matters for adopting a clear, robust, cohesive and incentivizing set of guidelines for all key aspects of the Paris Agreement. The Rule Book will be the integral part of broader COP24 package. This must also signal that the countries would strengthen their climate efforts and offer clarity on climate finance for the developing countries, especially the climate vulnerable ones. The Poland conference is one last opportunity. We hope everything discussed and agreed in Global Climate Action Summit, the One Planet Summit and Climate Vulnerable Forum would be taken on board. The entire world would look forward with optimism for the success of the COP24 . \</doc>

Representatives of civil society organizations recently criticized the outcome of the global climate change negotiation ( COP24 ) in Poland\' s Katowice, calling it frustrating. They also slammed the proposed  Paris Rulebook that ignored interests of the most vulnerable countries. The criticism came at a press conference at the Jatiya Press Club, moderated by M Rezaul Karim Chowdhury of EquityBD. The same organization\' s Syed Aminul Hoque presented the keynote paper. Among others, Qumrul Islam Chowdhury of Federation of Environmental Journalist in Bangladesh, Md Shamsuddoha of Centre for Participatory Research and Development, and Badrul Alam of Bangladesh Krishak Federation, spoke in the event. Aminul said there was hardly any particular text in the proposed Paris Rulebook on financial commitment, technology and capacity building issues for vulnerable countries. He criticized the developed countries for going back on their commitments. Shamsuddoha said the refusal of the developed countries to accept the IPCC report will seriously hamper the implementation of Paris Agreement, which will further aggravated the suffering of the most vulnerable countries. Rezaul Karim said Bangladesh needed to continue to raise its voice on the climate change issue. He also advocated for setting up a climate commission. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 22 -- The COP24 UN Climate Change Conference 2018 closed in Katowice, Poland on December 15. Over the past two weeks at the conference, demand for climate action has been increasing. However, despite the last minute efforts to put together the rulebook of the Paris climate accord, delegates failed to deliver a strong enough set of guidelines. Although the talks failed to deliver a functional rulebook for the Paris agreement, there were plenty of signs of emerging leadership to carry the climate agenda forward. A press conference held in Katowice during the COP24 celebrated 1,000 people powered divestment commitments and highlighted some major wins till date spanning 37 countries since 2012. The commitments came from cities like New York, Berlin and Cape Town, medical institutions like the American Public Health Association, faith groups like the Diocese of Assisi, insurance giants and investment funds like Norway's sovereign wealth fund and the country of Ireland. Responding to teen activist Greta Thunberg's call for school strikes, youths in Poland, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and Australia skipped school in demand for climate action. The climate strike continues to spread. Parents, young people, teachers and others can all take part in the climate strike. In the United States, over 1,000 young people flooded the halls of Congress to demand action on a Green New Deal before the end of the year, resulting in over 100 arrests. As the Sunrise Movement steadily pushes new representatives to go on record, the call for a Green New Deal is spreading. It has already spread to Canada. Meanwhile, in South Africa, people gathered in Cape Town during the country's Energy Week to oppose the national Development Bank's (DBSA) plans to fund Thabametsi coal plant. Their actions coincided with a push to showcase eight inspiring campaigns of people-power against carbon bombs all over the world. Three of the eight projects spotlighted during the COP are in countries where very little energy comes from coal. These were Sendou in Senegal, Rampal in Bangladesh, and Lamu in Kenya. Even before the Talks officially began, people were setting the tone. A day before the start, 75,000 marched in Brussels, Belgium and 35,000 came out in Germany, split between Berlin and Cologne. That momentum came through again on December 08, with a peaceful march in Katowice to sound the climate alarm around France and Europe. But it was not easy. Some 15 activists were turned away at the border in Poland. There was more good news in the form of climate actions. Wales, the birthplace of the fossil-fuelled industrial revolution, committed to phase out fossil fuels in favour of renewable while the leading public health body in the UK ended investment in all fossil fuels. Also in the UK, 200 members of the British Parliament committed to push Parliament to divest its own pension fund. The city of Mountain View, in California, has also divested, along with Lambeth in the UK. So much inspiring activism around COP24 has come from the growing climate movement in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. However, fossil fuel projects are still being planned around the world. COP has shown that people power is the only thing that will stop these carbon bombs from going ahead and pushing us towards climate breakdown. People have the ultimate power in power (energy) sector, where all the commitments at COP can be accomplished by bringing about a fossil-fuel free world. This can be ensured through a global campaign led by local groups demanding that local communities and institutions commit to: a fast and just transition to 100 per cent renewable energy for all; no new fossil fuel projects anywhere, and, no longer paying even a single penny for 'dirty energy'.

Bangladesh, Dec. 11 -- The UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) began on December 03 at Katowice, Poland. It is scheduled to continue till December 14. This conference is an important bridge between the Paris conference (COP21) and another to be held in 2020, when all the signatory countries would need to revise their climate commitments upwards. There was a lot of expectation for actions following the Paris conference. In reality, no significant achievements were made during this period. So, what can be expected from COP24 ? As the world leaders have said at the conference, dealing with climate change is the world's biggest challenge right now for the future survival of mankind. Frequencies of different natural disasters and catastrophic events like floods, cyclones, wildfires, heavy rainfall, extreme cold or warm temperature etc. are increasing across the globe. Numerous initiatives taken to minimise global temperature and reduce climate change consequences are not having an impact. This is leading to more deaths, increasing financial losses in damaged crops, houses and properties and causing displacement of population, with every passing year. There is still a glimmer of hope from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), which estimated in its recent report that it is still possible to maintain an under 1.5C of global temperature increase till 2100. Additionally, many development banks have claimed that they are bringing about changes to their dimensions of investing in projects. For example, the World Bank has set an objective to support 28 per cent of projects, aimed at ensuring climate co-benefits by 2020. The organisation's achievements have already exceeded its target and now stand at the 32 per cent mark. Considering the different level of outcomes from all the conferences, the agenda is still focused at the strong commitment by leaders and following through on them. The experts at the ongoing conference have said that enough strategies were decided in the previous years. But immediate and radical actions were yet to be taken by the respective stakeholders in order to restrict global warming to 1.5C. Even the countries, who had committed to decrease their carbon emission at COP21, have pushed the world on a path that will suffer more than 3C of global warming from now till the end of this century. Only 16 signatories out of more than 150 of the Paris Agreement are executing their commitments, according to recent information. Unfortunately, none of the steps are coming from the biggest emitters. So, the reality of "actionable" commitments is a great concern in making agendas for ongoing and future meetings. The commitments by countries in COP21 could be localised among citizens of the signatory countries. Awareness of citizens about the commitments by their leaders can force the latter to take significant actions. So, more awareness about climate action should be emphasised upon at COP24 , where the governments need to negotiate about the so-called rulebook applied in the Paris Agreement. As there is still no common framework for measuring greenhouse gas emissions, the following areas can be considered as common platform to reduce global warming, especially in the high carbon emitter countries. The awareness mechanism can lead to: 1. PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF GREEN ENERGY: For example, an energy-saving bulb usually consumes five times less energy than the consumption of a normal bulb. Encouraging the use of such power-saving products can play a significant role. 2. CHANGES IN HUMAN BEHAVIOUR AND ATTITUDE: Changes in human behaviour and attitude can also help. For example, many people forget to switch off lights and fans after leaving a room. This accounts for 20 to 40 per cent of regular consumption of power. If such carelessness can be addressed, then less power will be consumed. Similarly the wastage of water, fuel and other resources can also be addressed in this manner. 3. NATURAL AIR CONDITIONERS: Green energy can be used to heat and cool rather than using air conditioners and other electrical devices. 4. CUTTING DOWN ON ELECTRICAL DEVICE AND GADGET USE 6. DEVELOPING ZERO WASTE STRATEGIES in all organisations, especially at the time of product choice and its end use. 7. GRADUALLY DEVELOPING PAPERLESS WORK ENVIRONMENT: Most paper being used is manufactured from trees. The cutting down of trees is also contributing to climate change. Paperless offices can address this problem. 8. CHANGING AGRICULTURE PATTERN AND FOOD CONSUMPTION HABIT: Arable farming is better for the global climate than the traditional form of farming. Finally, it is important to raise the voice for a common platform that would reduce greenhouse gas sources along with identifying practical gas reduction techniques. COP24 must ensure that the momentum of the climate-change initiatives taken by countries increase and this continues till 2020 and beyond.

Bangladesh, Dec. 20 -- Three years on since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, more than 23,000 delegates from across world came together at the 2018 United Nations (UN) Climate Change 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) in Katowice of Poland. The conference that continued from December 02 to 15 had one aim: to finalise the rulebook for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Three years earlier, at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) held in Paris, France, the agreement's language was negotiated by representatives of 196 state parties. As of November 2018, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the agreement, while 184 have become party to it. The Paris Agreement's long-term goal is to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 02 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as this would substantially reduce the risks and effects of climate change. The world would need to achieve zero emissions sometime between 2030 and 2050 in order to achieve the 1.5 degree Celsius goal. At COP24 ActNow.bot, an innovative campaign by the UN was created with the support of Facebook and advertising company Grey. The campaign harnesses the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with social media messaging to engage people in the growing movement of taking climate action. The campaign was launched on December 04. In an address at the opening session of COP24 , renowned naturalist and media personality Sir David Attenborough spoke for "The People's Seat" initiative. He called it the result of new activism shaped by people from around the world and collected through social media. The collective actions taken through the initiative will be presented during the Secretary-General's Climate Summit in New York in September 2019. Also, at the conference, international home furnishing business IKEA showcased the ways through which people can be inspired and enabled to live within the limits of the planet, and how to take climate action for a greener and a cleaner world. A special report, titled "Health and Climate Change" and launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) during COP24 , revealed that burning fossil fuels is not only heating up the planet, but also polluting clean air. In the process, around 07 million people in the world are dying every year. This is also leading to losses in the form of welfare costs worth $5.11 trillion. The report also presented recommendations for policymakers to mitigate the multifaceted impacts of a changing global climate on human health. Dr. Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, the lead author of the special report and Team Leader, Climate Change and Health at WHO said that the sources of air pollution are the same as those of greenhouse gas emissions which are driving climate change. Hence steps to protect the climate will also pay for themselves in terms of health benefits. Research has shown that what the world is experiencing now is just the beginning of what global warming will mean for our planet. A study released this August predicts that heat wave mortality rates will skyrocket in coming years. A lot of hope was riding on the COP24 summit as climate change consequences are becoming severe around the world with every passing year. In 2017, carbon dioxide levels were the highest that they have been in 3-5 million years. As a result, 2017 was the second-hottest year globally since 1880. Additionally, 18 out of the 19 warmest years on record have happened since 2000. A recent UN report found that global emissions of CO2 in 2017 were 53.5 gigatons (a gigaton is 1 billion tons), the most ever released into the atmosphere, representing an increase of more than one per cent over 2016 emissions. Global emissions are increasing with every passing year causing extreme weather events. The brunt of these consequences is being faced by developing and least developed countries. A World Bank report revealed that Bangladesh saw around 234,000 deaths, including 80,000 in urban areas, due to environmental pollution and related health risks in 2015. Additionally, Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change disasters including floods, river erosion, droughts, cyclones and more. The Bangladesh government is trying to address this issue in its national policy and has a national action plan on Short-lived Climate Pollutants (SLCP). Moreover, the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) 2009 may be updated this year. Also, the 1992 environment policy, updated in 2018, shows the linkages between air pollution and climate change. Now it is focussing on transitioning to clean energy. IPCC says by 2050, around 50 million people will migrate because of climate change. Due to riverbank erosion, people are already forced to migrate from their places of origin to other places in Bangladesh. Major rivers like Jamuna, Ganges and Padma has already eaten up around 1,590 square kilometres of floodplains rendering 1.6 million people homeless since 1973, according to Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services in 2009. Around 4.7 million people were displaced between 2008 till 2014 due to natural disasters in Bangladesh, according to 2015 estimation by Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. It is imperative for the developed countries of the world to consider the consequences being faced by countries like Bangladesh because of climate change. They should act responsibly and aim towards taking climate actions under the new international climate regime. Tarequl Islam Munna is a conservator of wildlife and environment.

A high-level meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( CoP24 ) on global warming will be held in Poland on Monday. Participants are expected to emphasize urgent action by developed countries to keep global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius to avoid the most adverse impact of climate change. The Bangladeshi delegation is being led by Abdullah Al Mohsin Chowdhury, the secretary at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Team member Dr Ainun Nishat said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its report had highlighted what the developed countries should do to minimize the global warming. Her colleague Ziaul Haque said this year's main focus would be discussing decisions taken in 2015 CoP21 and form some rules, guideline and modernity to implement the Paris agreement. On December 2, negotiators from around the world met in Poland for talks on climate change, three years after sealing a landmark deal in Paris that set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Envoys gathered in Katowice, a day earlier than originally planned, for the UN meeting that runs until December 14. The meeting received a boost over the weekend after 19 major economies at the G20 summit affirmed their commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord. The only holdout was the United States. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 16 -- Divisions among the governments in favour of real actions to address the issue of global climate change have been putting obstructions to work out effective action plans to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. This division has surfaced at the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which began in Katowice, the century-old coal miner's town in Poland, on December 02. The Guardian reports (December 11, 2018) that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report produced by scientists following the Paris Climate Summit in 2015 invited fierce debate in the COP24 on the findings on global temperature rise between 1.5 and 2.0 celsius. Most of the country representatives remained in favour to 'welcome' the report and to restrict fossil fuel use and promote greater role of renewable energy. But the four major oil producing and exporting nations - the USA, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - insisted that the study should merely be "noted". The Donald Trump administration had earlier decided that it no longer wanted to be part of the Paris Climate Agreement (which was signed by 193 countries in 2015). Many observers consider that the Trump administration not only wants to withdraw from the Paris climate deal but to prevent any progress on the deal. Vanuatu's Foreign Minister, Ralph Regenvanu, while speaking at the COP24 stated that the United States and other high carbondioxide-emitting developed countries had deliberately tried to frustrate the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland. The US administration preferred so far not to comment on such remarks. On the other hand, Australian government's position is that 'fossil fuels can be used as efficiently and cleanly as the use of emission free nuclear energy'. Practically, Australia and the host Poland have reaffirmed their commitment to coal and supported US position. Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, strongly criticised the position of the four major oil producing countries that have been refusing to "welcome" the IPCC special report on 1.5C global warming, and termed the rejection as indefensible. In his statement Mr. Guterres said, "We're running out of time...To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal." He further added, "The IPCC special report is a stark acknowledgment of what the consequences of global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people around the world, especially those who call small island states home. This is not good news, but we cannot afford to ignore it." The COP24 COP 24 . Unless drastic measures are taken to reduce carbon dioxide and other Green House Gas (GHS) emissions by the world community, scientists consider that hundreds of thousands of people living in the low lying islands and in the coastal areas will be forced to leave their homes and loose livelihoods within next few decades due to global warming and sea level rises. A study by researchers at the US Geological Survey (USGS), the Delters Institute in the Netherlands and Hawaii University, found that many small islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans would be uninhabitable for humans by the middle of this century due to rapid sea level rise. Drastic GHG emission reductions may help to cope with the race to reverse the rapid rate of global warming by 2030 through de-carbonisation of electricity production and improving energy efficiency in different sectors such as transportation and manufacturing industries. It further requires technological innovations and unprecedented adjustments in society's behaviour and lifestyle. Unfortunately, the major contributors of GHG emissions in the atmosphere prefer little meaningful action but want to continue the debate on the impacts of climate changes.

The 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will take place during 02 to 14 December in Katowice, Poland. Apart from COP 24 , the 3rd part of 1stConference of the Parties serving as Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1.3), the supreme body on Paris Agreement and the 14th Conference of the Parties serving as Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 14) will be held in conjunction with COP 24 . In order to operationalize and effective implementation of the historic Paris Agreement adopted by COP 21 in 2015, the COP decided that the relevant modalities, procedure and guidelines (popularly known as Paris Rule Book) would be adopted no later than December 2018 by COP 24 . As the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol came to an end in 2012, negotiations for a successor instrument began. In these negotiations, some developed countries such as the United States (who initially agreed to a 7% reduction compared to 1990 levels but later decided not to ratify the Protocol) opposed what is sometimes called a  top-down determination of targets and pressed instead for national determination of climate ambition. Many developing countries initially opposed taking on reduction targets in the Kyoto Protocol\' s successor, calling instead for developed countries, with greater responsibility to reduce their emissions and allowing developing countries the  atmospheric space to develop. They eventually gave in to pressure from developed countries and agreed to take on  nationally appropriate mitigation actions (or NAMAs),  supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measureable, reportable and verifiable manner  in the 2007 Bali Action Plan at COP13. They also supported national determination of what came to be known as climate  contributions , to acknowledge that climate actions not only include emissions reductions, but also encompass adaptation, and possibly other elements such as the provision of  means of implementation (which usually includes finance, capacity building and technology development and transfer). Under the Bali Action Plan, COP13 decided to launch a comprehensive process conducted by the Ad hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action (AWG-LCA) to enable the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through long-term cooperative action, up to and beyond 2012, in order to reach an agreed outcome and adopt a decision at COP15. However, Parties did not succeed to conclude their negotiations at COP15, and decided to extend the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) for one year each at COP16 in 2010 and COP17 in 2011 respectively. Finally, the work of AWG-LCA was concluded at COP18 in 2012 by an agreed outcome pursuant to the Bali Action Plan. In the meantime, some Kyoto Parties such as Canada (officially withdrew herself from Kyoto), Russia, Japan, New Zealand declined to participate in 2nd phase of Kyoto Protocol starting from January 2013. As a result, the impacts of Kyoto Protocol on global emission reductions became less significant considering low share of global emissions (less than 20%) by the Kyoto Parties.However, a number of major decisions were made at COP16 and COP17 under different thematic areas of the Bali Action Plan such as enhanced actions on adaptation, enhanced actions on developed and developing countries\' mitigation as well as finance, technology and capacity building. Importantly, COP17 decided to launch a process to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties through the Ad hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP), which was concluded with the adoption of historic Paris Agreement by COP21 in 2015. The Paris Agreement is considered universal global agreement on climate change with bottom up facilitative approach as well as with highest possible participation by the countries. Under the decision of COP21, the Adhoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA) was established to facilitate and oversee the specific follow-up work towards implementation of the work program (PAWP-Paris Agreement Work Program) resulting from the relevant decisions of COP21 and provisions of the Paris Agreement. In fact, under the work program developing specific modalities, procedures and guidelines (Paris Rule Book) is being discussed and negotiated. Apart from APA, COP21 also mandated permanent subsidiary bodies (SBI and SBSTA)under UNFCCC to do specific follow-up works under PAWP. In accordance with their mandates, the APA, the SBSTA, and the SBI have been advancing work on PAWP during 2016, 2017 and 2018. The key agenda items being discussed and negotiated are as follows: 1. The features, information and accounting of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 2. Adaptation Communications 4. Indicative qualitative and quantitative biennial information on financial support by developed countries and clear biennial information on fanatical support provided by developed countries (Article 9.5 and Article 9.7 of the Paris Agreement) 5. Transparency Framework (Article 13 of the Paris Agreement) 6. Global Stocktaking (Article 14 of the Paris Agreement) 7. Compliance Mechanism (Article 15 of the Paris Agreement) In the negotiations, Bangladesh delegationsmaintain consistency and integrity while presenting their viewpoints taking into account the positions of LDC Group, and group of developing countries (G-77 and China). Bangladesh delegations remainvery careful on the critical issue that flexibility and notion of national circumstances must be respected in finalizing the Paris Rule Book before adoption by COP 24 . \</doc>

Bangladesh, Nov. 23 -- Bangladesh along with other Least Developed Countries (LDCs) should raise voice about creation of proposed 'special fund for climate adaptation' to address loss and damage caused by climate change in the upcoming COP-24 . The above opinions were given by the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) at a press conference, held at its office in the city, on the eve of the upcoming 24th conference of the parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. The COP-24 TIB also put special emphasis on a legally-bound treaty in the Conference. TIB executive director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said the climate change occurrence is a global observable fact, which is mainly a result of rapid and unplanned industrialisation by the developed countries. "But the countries like Bangladesh are most affected and vulnerable to climate change," he noted. Dr Iftekharuzzaman said the developed countries will have to set up necessary funds and release those in time for the countries facing loss and damage caused by climate change. A fund allocated internationally to Bangladesh or any other affected country to tackle climate change is neither charity nor a loan; it is compensation," he observed. He also opined that Bangladesh should overcome its shortcoming through negotiation. Government officials are transferred regularly and their knowledge also moves to a different place with them, he said. Dr Sumaya Khayer, adviser, executive management at TIB, said government officials and experts should work in unison for good climate diplomacy. M Zakir Hossain Khan, head of climate finance governance at TIB, presented a written statement, suggesting that Bangladesh along with other LDCs should raise voice to create separate climate adaptation fund to address the loss and damage. Timely release of the fund should also be ensured, said the statement. The countries, including Bangladesh, who signed the 'Paris Agreement' on climate change should ensure transparency and accountability both at home and abroad, it said. And adaptation financing should get most priority, it added. Mr Hussain said Paris Agreement has no legal binding which has created immense uncertainty for the vulnerable developing countries to secure the required finance especially for adaptation. He said the most vulnerable seven countries including Bangladesh have received only 7.0 per cent of the total adaptation fund from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and other international climate funds. GCF itself has received only USD $ 7.0 billion so far while the pledged figure was $100 billion. To ensure transparency of financing under the Paris Agreement, a 'transparency framework' under Article 13 has been proposed. As this framework does not have any legal binding, a doubt has arisen whether the target set by the Paris Agreement would be achieved, he said. Funding ratio of adaptation to mitigation was supposed to be 50:50; but only 32 per cent of the approved amount has been allocated for adaptation so far, he added. TIB, however, placed eight proposals for the LDCs for consideration in the COP-24 , which include 'finance must be in the form of grant not loan or other form'. 'Polluters Pay (Compensation) Principle' should be considered in defining the climate finance that recognises only public grants instead of loan, it proposed.

Bangladesh, Dec. 25 -- This month's United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland succeeded in producing a rulebook to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Every UN member state signed on. But that will not be enough to head off climate catastrophe. It's time to call in the engineers. The diplomatic success at COP24 was remarkable, given relentless lobbying and foot-dragging by the fossil-fuel industry. The diplomats have read the science and know the truth: without a rapid move to a zero-carbon global energy system by mid-century, humanity will be in grave peril. In recent years, millions of people have suffered the hardships of extreme heatwaves, droughts, flood surges, powerful hurricanes, and devastating forest fires, because the Earth's temperature is already 1.1Celsius (roughly 2 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average. If warming exceeds 1.5C or 2C later this century - temperatures never experienced in the entire 10,000-year history of human civilization - the world will become vastly more dangerous. The Paris accord commits national governments to keep temperatures "well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and [to pursue] efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels." We now have a rulebook for measuring greenhouse-gas emissions, sharing know-how, and measuring financial transfers from rich to poor countries. Yet we still lack the plans for shifting the world energy system to renewable energy by mid-century. The diplomats, of course, are not technical experts. The next stage needs the world's engineering experts on power generation and transmission, electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, artificial intelligence for energy systems management, urban design for energy efficiency and public transport, and related specialists. Diplomats, rather than engineers, have been at the forefront at UN climate summits for the past 24 years. The time for engineers to take centre stage has arrived. The Paris accord assumes that each government consults with its own country's engineers to devise a national energy strategy, with each of the 193 UN member states essentially producing a separate plan. That approach reflects a deep misunderstanding of how the global energy transition must work. We need solutions that are agreed and coordinated at the international scale, not country by country. Global engineering systems require global coordination. Consider civil aviation, a triumph of globally coordinated engineering. In 2017, there were 41.8 million flights without a single fatal passenger jet accident. The transition to renewable energy can be greatly accelerated if the world's governments finally bring the engineers to the fore. Consider that in May 1961, President John F. Kennedy called on Americans to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth before the end of the decade. NASA quickly mobilised hundreds of thousands of engineers and other experts, and completed the moonshot in July 1969, meeting JFK's remarkably ambitious timeline. I was recently on a panel with three economists and a senior business-sector engineer. After the economists spoke about carbon prices, internalising externalities, feed-in tariffs, carbon offsets, and the like, the engineer spoke succinctly and wisely. "I don't really understand what you economists were just speaking about, but I do have a suggestion," he said. "Tell us engineers the desired 'specs' and the timeline, and we'll get the job done." This is not bravado. Here are the specs. To limit warming to 1.5C, the world's energy system must be decarbonised by mid-century. This will require the vast mobilisation of zero-carbon energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro power, implying a power system that can handle intermittent energy sources that depend on when the sun shines, how hard the wind blows, and how fast the rivers flow. This zero-carbon electricity will power electric vehicles that replace our internal-combustion engine cars. It will also be used to produce zero-carbon fuels such as hydrogen for ocean shipping and synthetic hydrocarbons for airplanes. We will heat our homes and office buildings with zero-carbon electricity rather than with coal, oil, or natural gas. And energy-intensive industries such as steel and aluminum will also replace fossil fuels with zero-carbon electricity and hydrogen. These zero-carbon solutions will extend beyond any country's borders. The lowest-cost and most plentiful renewable energy is often found far from population centres, in deserts and mountains, and offshore for wind. This energy will therefore need to be transmitted long distances, often crossing national boundaries, with the use of special high-voltage transmission lines. The advantages of a long-distance, internationally connected transmission system have been powerfully emphasized by the Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization, a worldwide partnership of engineering companies and institutions launched by the State Grid Corporation of China in 2016. In a sensible global decarbonisation plan, many of today's fossil-fuel exporting countries and companies will become tomorrow's exporters of zero-carbon energy. The oil-producing Gulf countries should export solar energy from the vast Arabian Desert to both Europe and Asia. Coal-producing Australia should export solar power from the enormous outback to Southeast Asia via submarine cable. Canada should increase its exports of zero-carbon hydropower to the US market and finally end its efforts to export products from its high-carbon oil sands. At the Katowice climate conference, the diplomats delivered the climate rulebook on time and as promised - an enormous accomplishment. The next big act belongs to the engineers. Energy transformation for climate safety is our twenty-first-century moonshot. When heads of state convene at the UN next September, the world's leading engineers should greet them with a cutting-edge framework for global action. Jeffrey D. Sachs, Professor of Sustainable Development and Professor of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University, is Director of Columbia's Center for Sustainable Development and the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

On May 10, the United Nations Climate Change Conference drew to a close in Bonn, Germany. A key focus of the negotiations has been the Paris Agreement Work Program, under which countries are designing the guidelines that will implement the Paris Agreement. At the conclusion of the session, Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group, Mr. Gebru Jember Endalew, said: "The LDC Group came to Bonn ready to shift gears and make concrete progress on the numerous issues that need to be addressed this year to translate the Paris Agreement from concepts to actions. The Group hoped that the negotiations would advance further at this meeting, and we are disappointed that many vital topics are still at conceptual stages. The Group is concerned by the lack of urgency we are seeing to move the negotiations forward. It is time to look at the bigger picture, see the severe impacts that climate change is having across the world, and rise to the challenge." "Finance is key to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. In the face of climate change, poor and vulnerable countries are forced to address loss and damage and adapt to a changing climate, all while striving to lift their people out of poverty without repeating the mistakes of an economy built on fossil fuels. This is not possible without predictable and sustainable support." \</doc>

Governments have adopted a set of guidelines, dubbed \' Katowice Climate Package\' , for implementing the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which is expected to benefit people from all walks of life, especially the most vulnerable. The package is designed to operationalize the climate change regime contained in the Paris Agreement. Under the auspices of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat, it will promote international cooperation and encourage greater ambition, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Some termed it a robust, but some of the most vulnerable countries as well as the non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups found clear gaps in the package, particularly in market mechanism issues such as carbon markets, urging the global leaders to overcome the differences in the next conferences by 2020. The rulebook was adopted in the 24th Conference of the Parties to UNFCCC ( COP24 ) that took place from 2-14 December in Katowice of coal-dependent Poland, presided over by the Polish government. The conference was extended by one more day to reach a consensus. It brought together ministers and government officials, as well as a wide range of stakeholder representatives. Nearly 200 countries overcame political divisions late on December 15 to agree on rules for implementing the Paris Agreement. Nations finally reached consensus on a more detailed framework. At the 11th hour, ministers managed to break a deadlock between Brazil and other countries over the accounting rules for the monitoring of carbon credits, deferring the bulk of that discussion to next year. Still, ministers managed to bridge the divisions and prepared a 156-page rulebook. A statement by U.N. Secretary-General Antunio Guterres, who left the talks on December 12, stressed the need for more work.  From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition, it said.  And ambition must guide all member states as they prepare their (emissions cut plans) for 2020 to reverse the present trend in which climate change is still running faster than us. The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C. It entered into force on 4 November 2016 while 195 UNFCCC Parties have signed the Agreement and 184 have now ratified it. According to the UNFCCC, the guidelines are expected to promote trust among nations that all countries are playing their part in addressing the challenge of climate change. It would enable the Parties to the Paris Agreement to implement, track and progressively enhance their contributions to tackling climate change, in order to meet the agreement's long-term goals. The rulebook contains detailed rules and guidelines, covering all key areas including transparency, finance, mitigation and adaptation. The key COP24 outcomes include:  The first-ever universal system for the Parties to track and report progress in climate action, which provides flexibilities to those countries that genuinely need it. This will inspire all Parties to improve their practices over time and communicate the progress made in clear and comparable terms.  A good, consensual outcome on adaptation issues. The Parties now have guidance and a registry to communicate their actions as regards to adapting to the impacts of climate change.  As to the global stocktake process, the next moment to review collective action, which the EU considered vital for the Paris Agreement, the result provides a solid basis for further elaboration on the details of the process. The global stocktake will invite Parties to regularly review progress and the level of ambition based on the latest available science.  Finally, with the decisions on finance and technology, there is now a solid package that the EU trusts will provide reassurances to our partners on our commitment to continued global solidarity and support. COP24 The Katowice package includes guidelines that will operationalize the transparency framework. It sets out how countries will provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that describe their domestic climate actions. This information includes mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries. The package also includes guidelines that relate to:  The process for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow-on from the current target of mobilizing USD 100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries;  How to conduct the global stocktake of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023;  How to assess progress on the development and transfer of technology. President Abdul Hamid was scheduled to lead the Bangladesh delegation to the COP24 , but he could not make it eventually. Later, Forest and Environment Secretary Abdullah Al Mohsin Chowdhury led the team. Bangladesh Ambassador to Poland did not also join the delegation, but Honorary Consular of Bangladesh in Katowice Omar Faruque joined the delegation, Besides, representatives from the non-government organizations and civil society took part in the conference. NGOs and civil society groups raised a point that there was a scope for further detailing the rulebook. But a member of the Bangladesh delegation to COP24 , requesting anonymity, told the EP that the delegation initially considers hardly any problem in implementing the Paris Agreement after adopting the rulebook. However, he said, Bangladesh would make its position clear on the development soon. But the initial assessment suggests that the rulebook has clear guidelines on how the assessment report on the NDC would be prepared, what information it should contain and how to prepare the assessment reporting. And, in case of adaptation, what information should contain and how the reporting will be done. It was also finalized in the rulebook on how transparency reporting will be done every two years and how the technical committee will work. How the works on global stocktaking and compliance issues to take place has also been finalized in the rulebook. Most of all, the developed countries will provide their quantitative and qualitative report on financing the vulnerable countries.  Overall, it\' s a great achievement for the whole world, said the Bangladesh delegation member. Chair of the Least Developed Countries Group, Gebru Jember Endalew, said: "While there are parts of the package that could and should have been stronger, the implementation guidelines adopted today provide a strong basis to start implementing the Agreement. The next step, of course, is for countries to take urgent, ambitious action to fulfill their Paris Agreement commitments." "Parties need to revise and enhance their NDCs before 2020 in line with their fair share ... To achieve the visions and the goals of the Paris Agreement, countries must commit to greater levels of climate action and support, and follow through on those commitments." To avert the devastating loss and damage of 1.5\'b0C warming, all countries, and particularly those most responsible for causing this crisis who have the greatest capacity to respond, must urgently cut emissions and provide the climate finance needed to poor countries that are still developing. This is a matter of justice and a matter of survival." "Levels of climate finance must meet the actual costs for our countries to adapt and address the impacts of climate change, to protect our people and our communities. Our countries also have ambitious plans to tackle climate change and develop sustainably, but we currently lack the resources to make those plans a reality." The UN\' s Climate Chief, Ms. Patricia Espinosa, said:  This is an excellent achievement! The multilateral system has delivered a solid result. This is a roadmap for the international community to decisively address climate change.  The guidelines that delegations have been working on day and night are balanced and clearly reflect how responsibilities are distributed amongst the world\' s nations, she said.  They incorporate the fact that countries have different capabilities and economic and social realities at home, while providing the foundation for ever increasing ambition, she added. The guidelines mean that countries can now establish the national systems that are needed for implementing the Paris Agreement as of 2020. The same will be done at the international level. Functioning together, these systems will ensure that nations can act in an atmosphere of trust and assess progress of their climate actions.  While some details will need to be finalized and improved over time, the system is to the largest part place, Ms. Espinosa said. The main issues still to be resolved concerning the use of cooperative approaches, as well as the sustainable development mechanism, as contained in the Paris Agreement\' s article 6. These would allow countries to meet a part of their domestic mitigation goals through the use of so-called  market mechanisms . Market mechanisms provide flexible instruments for reducing the costs of cutting emissions, such as carbon markets. Here, the Paris Agreement recognizes the need for global rules to safeguard the integrity of all countries\' efforts. These global rules are important to ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. In this way, progress towards the emission limitation goals of the Paris Agreement can be accurately measured.  From the beginning of the COP, it very quickly became clear that this was one area that still required much work and that the details to operationalize this part of the Paris Agreement had not yet been sufficiently explored, explained Ms. Espinosa.  After many rich exchanges and constructive discussions, the greatest majority of countries were willing to agree and include the guidelines to operationalize the market mechanisms in the overall package, she said.  Unfortunately, in the end, the differences could not be overcome. Because of this, countries have agreed to finalize the details for market mechanisms in the coming year in view of adopting them at the next UN Climate Change Conference (COP25). Talanoa Dialogue and Action The Fiji-led Talanoa Dialogue, a yearlong inclusive dialogue around ambition as it relates to the Paris Agreement, concluded at COP24 , with the global warming of 1.5C report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a major input.  As the decision adopted indicates, there is a clear recognition of the IPCC\' s role in providing scientific input to inform countries in strengthening their response to the threat of climate change, Ms. Espinosa underlined, thanking all experts for their hard work and important contribution to the IPCC\' s work. The final high-level session in Katowice resulted in the Talanoa Call for Action, which calls upon all countries and stakeholders to act with urgency. Countries are encouraged to factor the outcome of the dialogue into efforts to increase their ambition and to update their NDCs, which detail the nations\' climate actions, in 2020. A high-level stocktaking of actions taken before 2020 gave countries the opportunity to assess their current level of ambition. Another stock-taking is planned for 2019.  While there are clearly gaps that remain, the stock-take of actions taken before 2020 and the Talanoa Dialogue have clearly shown that the world has built a strong foundation for climate action under the Paris Agreement, said Ms. Espinosa. Major Announcements Many developed countries pledged financial support to enable developing countries to act. This is especially important for the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Countries have sent significant positive signals towards GCF\' s first formal replenishment, with Germany and Norway announcing that they would double their contributions. The Adaptation Fund received a total of USD 129 million. The engagement of multilateral development banks (MDBs), international organizations, businesses, investors and civil society at COP24 helped to build the political will towards the outcome in Katowice. According to UNFCCC, many made key announcements that were critical to build momentum. These include:  The World Bank\' s pledge of $200 billion in climate action funding for the period 2021-2025;  The MDBs announcement to align their activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement;  The commitment by fifteen international organizations to make their operations climate neutral;  The announcement by the C40 Cities coalition, which includes cities across the globe, to work with the IPCC to identify how the Global Warming of 1.5C report can apply to cities\' climate actions. Many more announcements were made and inspiring examples of climate action showcased at the Global Climate Action high-level events. The next United Nations Climate Change Conference will take place in Chile and consultations will provide clarity on the city and exact date of the conference in due course. Climate Action Network (CAN), a global network of over 1,200 NGOs, says in a statement that countries struggle to muster collective political will to take on the climate crisis. The IPCC 1.5C Report made it clear that every tenth of a degree of warming matters and the world needs to act now to cut emissions in half within the next 12 years. But over the two weeks, the governments did not respond with the political will to tackle the urgency of the climate crisis informed by the latest science. The United States and a handful of rogue nations like Saudi Arabia sought to routinely disrupt the process but far too many countries came unprepared to strengthen the international climate regime and chose to stay on the sidelines. Countries agreed to a comprehensive set of rules that will help operationalize the Paris Agreement, despite failing to establish any rules for carbon markets post-2020, CAN said. On transparency, guidance for NDCs and accounting, a strong basis has been created that ensures parties will be accountable for their commitments. A robust framework has been created for the global stocktake, taking into account equity and best available science. The framework for carbon markets proved to be too contentious to land an agreement. The dearth of adequate finance of most countries continues to undermine trust. The replenishment process to the GCF in 2019 must be a race to the top with countries following the example of Germany to at least doubling on their current commitments. Developed countries must also honor the $100bn in the next two years. May Boeve, Executive Director of 350.org, said:  Hope now rests on the shoulders of the many people who are rising to take action - the inspiring children who started an unprecedented wave of strikes in schools to support a fossil free future; the 1,000+ institutions that committed to pull their money out of coal, oil, and gas; the many communities worldwide who keep resisting fossil fuel development and calling for a fast and just transition to 100% renewable energy systems for all. Mohamed Adow, Christian Aid\' s International Climate Lead, said:  This was the first opportunity since the IPCC report for countries to prove to the world that they were taking this seriously. We have great confidence in the capacity of the American people to lead morally and technologically, in business and in civil society\- our challenge is to build political will and to elect leaders who will act courageously on behalf of vulnerable people and our common destiny. Gilles Dufrasne - Policy Officer, Carbon Pricing - Carbon Market Watch, said:  The last minute article 6 standoff showed that financial interests still trump environmental integrity in some countries, despite the indisputable evidence of the climate crisis. Alden Meyer, Directory of Strategy and Policy at Union of Concerned Scientists, said that while the United States and three other major oil-producing countries prevented the urgency of action from being fully reflected in the final decision, the vast majority of countries indicated they have heard the dire warning from scientists.  World leaders must come to next September\' s climate summit in New York being organized by UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres with a clear indication of how they intend to substantially raise their climate ambition by 2020. This will be the acid test of how serious they are in their professed commitment to averting a climate catastrophe. Rachel Cleetus, Policy Director in the Climate and Energy Program and lead economist at Union of Concerned Scientists, said that in Katowice, the world leaders failed to adequately address the needs of people suffering from climate change right now, including small island nations and even some US communities who face existential threats.  The barely adequate outcome in Katowice means there\' s much work ahead to ensure countries live up to their responsibilities to put more ambitious action on the table by 2020. Harjeet Singh, Global Lead on Climate Change, ActionAid International, insisted that the rich countries have a moral and a legal responsibility to provide money and technology to developing countries to make their economies greener and tackle the impacts of climate change.  Instead of taking this seriously, they pushed through a rulebook riddled with loopholes allowing them to avoid this responsibility, he said. Conclusion Designing the rulebook is considered as a significant success as it is expected to enable all countries to implement the elements of the Paris Agreement in a manner could be measured, reported and verified. At the same time, the conference in coal-dependent Poland also represents a major failure to take steps to face the challenges. The most vulnerable developing countries like Bangladesh and small island countries made it an issue for consideration in the COP24 . They were also strongly supported by the civil society and children. They failed due to the US delegation along with Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwait. Finally, the four countries prevailed by simply welcoming the IPCC report, but not its contents. This was a major setback for both science and the most vulnerable developing countries. However, there were a number of good decisions on adaptation and inclusion of loss and damage in several tracks of the rulebook. Finally, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres stepped in to try to break a deadlock and an agreement was reached. The COP25 will be held in December 2019 in Santiago, Chile and one of the major items for decision-making will be on loss and damage. Before COP25, Mr. Guteres will convene a climate change summit in New York in September 2019 during the UN General Assembly, which will be a major opportunity for the countries to highlight their actions to tackle climate change. Bangladesh as also other nations vulnerable to climate change needed preparatory works to do before next September and December if they wish to yield good results. \</doc>

There is no option but to implement the Paris Agreement for limiting the global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius. For implementing the agreement, there is no option to finalize a Rulebook in the COP24 and facilitate launching actions from 2020. The draft of the Rulebook was formulated following the adoption of Paris Agreement. Some countries differ in opinion on different clauses of the agreement. Even then we are hopeful that this time in Poland, we will be able to finalize the Rulebook. Additional Secretary, Ministry of Forest and Environment Dr. S. M. Munjurul Hannan Khan said this in an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain. The rule for implementing the Paris Agreement could not be finalized yet following its adoption. There are talks that it may be finalized in COP24 ? Where does it stand now? The text for the Rulebook could be drafted through discussions and reviews at different levels. All countries agreed in some part of it, in some areas developing countries have meeting of minds but developed countries are opposing. You know that all countries have to have meeting of minds about the entire text. Bangladesh wants clear directives in the Rulebook about how adaptation, financing, technology transfer and capacity building would be implemented under the Paris Agreement. About financing, the developed countries must provide quality information. To clarify further, a country must say how much money they would commit for adaptation and how much for mitigation? How much would be allotted for vulnerable countries from this fund? How much other countries would also get? It must be known how this money would be disbursed? These must be included in the Rulebook in unambiguous terms. Among others, five issues of adaptation, mitigation, technology transfer, capacity building and financing must be clearly mentioned in the Rulebook. Bangladesh for protecting and preserving own national interest is carefully approaching on standalone basis and in a group of same category countries. We have given our considered opinion and supported the ones those protected Bangladesh interest, reading the above five important issues through lines. We have also given opinion on the rest of the text. Apart from our own opinion, we also provided opinion with the least developed countries (LDCs) and group 77 of China. We are optimistic that the Rulebook would be agreed and adopted in COP24 in Poland. In absence of it, implementation of Paris Agreement cannot be launched from 2020. Every country would finalize their own action plans and programs making required amendments and adjustments to own law and policy, following adoption of the Rulebook. Are you really hopeful about adopting the Rulebook in the COP24 ? Countries differ on many issues? Where does Bangladesh stand? If viewed from positive point view, we can say countries have come to general agreement on most of the issues. China, India and Africa object to NDC commitments. They believe NDC is imperative for developed nations. According to them, developed nations would invest for emissions control. They want assistance of developed nations to complement their own initiatives for controlling emissions. We want to develop a common Rulebook for NDC implementation. We are working on it. We think the NDC Rulebook will facilitate its implementation. But there must be special exemptions for the LDCs. The IPCC report suggests that even after taking all planned mitigation measures, the global temperature increase cannot be restricted below 1.5 degree Celsius in 2100. The report suggested intensifying the initiatives. Do you think the world is ready for these? Until now, the countries mostly responsible for global emissions were telling that the global temperature rise cannot be restricted below 2 degree Celsius. They used to say that the world neither have the technology nor the financial resources for this. But the IPCC through research has scientifically established that it is possible to limit the global warming below 1.5 degree Celsius. The world believes this report now. Now no one says that it is not possible. This background has now come into consideration and developed countries are also working along the line as the IPCC report has scientific basis. None of their information can be ruled out scientifically. I believe that the world is now ready for achieving the goal. Time has come to start the works. I believe works can be started in full swing after successful meeting of minds in COP24 . Huge investment is essential for global warming control. Developed countries committed to finance it. Is that finance coming? The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was created for controlling global warming. It was planned that by 2020 the developed countries together would contribute US$ 100 billion to the fund. But the situation is rather frustrating. So far commitment is made for US$ 10.6 billion and only US$ 1.6 billion has come to the fund. Political commitments are made but implementation is not there. But adoption of the Rulebook in COP24 will create pressure on the countries for releasing the committed fund to GCF. Bangladesh has made conditional commitment for 15% reduction of emission in its NDC. It was told that Bangladesh using its own resource would reduce it by 5% and would rely on international financing for reducing the other 10%. What is the status of international financing? Bangladesh as per commitment has already ensured financing for 5% emission reduction. Works are in progress in industries, power and transport sectors. But there is no good news about international financing. Bangladesh would also have access to GCF when GCF would get its pledged financing in 2020. What is the status of the commitments Bangladesh made for implementing the NDC with own finance? Are we on the right track? Bangladesh is not responsible for global emission, yet it is working on minimizing the impacts with its own resources. We pledged reducing emissions by 5% with own money and we are doing it all right. We can start working on the other 10% as soon as we get global financing. But the 5% emission reduction target with own resources that Bangladesh committed created opportunities in bargaining at global stage. The 5% emission reduction target committed in NDC with own money was in industries, power and transport sectors. Are we approaching towards achieving the sector-wise targets accordingly? A few projects are under implementation in industrial and power sectors. Work on implementation has started in the industrial sector upon formulation of the energy efficiency roadmap. Industry and power sectors have advanced appreciably along the pledge. Though the transportation sector lags a little behind, many mega infrastructure projects are now at different stages of implementation. Target will be significantly achieved when Metro Rail and Rapid Transit Projects will come into operation. Upon post-implementation evaluation of these projects, the NDC may consider expanding the scope. But before that the pledged foreign financing for mitigation and adaptation needs to be secured. Bangladesh is now endeavoring for achieving energy efficiency and energy conservation at every segment of energy and power value chain. What role the Ministry of Environment is playing in coordinating these works? Action plans for implementation of NDC are prepared after engagement with all the stakeholders. The relevant ministries and divisions are implanting the actions like SREDA is authorized with the renewable energy. Hence it cannot be said at all that there exist any lack of coordination as far as dealing matters of climate change. This time the team going to COP24 will have representatives from all concerned ministries. This will make Bangladesh role stronger in the negotiation. NGOs raised an allegation that the climate change fund is not being properly utilized. How do you react to this? Please note that the works are being done after taking due approvals of relevant authorities in every project. There is no scope of any fund release without doing work. Hence any claim for alleged misuse of fund in any climate project is irrelevant. Rather, there may be some irregularities in works done through the NGOs. The government does not monitor their works. In my opinion, the works on climate change being accomplished by the government and the NGOs should be centrally controlled. At COP22, Bangladesh pledged for 100% dependency on renewable energy by 2050. But the energy ministry now says that they are not aware of anything like that. What actually happened? No such commitment was made from the Ministry of Environment. Over the last 5 years, we have not said anywhere that Bangladesh would go for 100% renewables by 2050. But the most vulnerable countries talked about 100% renewables by 2050. But this was not a pledge or commitment. Bangladesh has to maintain its development growth. There is no way it can come out of fossil fuel use now. Still, Bangladesh is pursuing the low carbon development path. You are in the operation committee of Green Climate Fund. What type of financial assistance Bangladesh is getting from GCF? How prepared is Bangladesh for receiving the finance? Please note that I am not with the GCF. But Bangladesh has received fund from it in some projects. About US$ 85 million have been received for different projects. Some projects are expected to get some additional funds. Money from GCF comes in two different ways. One is Multilateral Implementing Entity (MIE) and the other is National Implementing Entity (NIE). Bangladesh has so far received two from NII. One was IDCOL and the other was PKSF. IDCOL would process for the government sector and PKSF for the NGOs. It is no longer required to go to MIE like the World Bank, UNDP or FAO any longer. The priority of Bangladesh now is preparing financing worthy projects and sending to the GCF for financing. I hope this approach would gather momentum in future. Bangladesh has to continue relying on coal, oil and gas for a considerably long period of time. Will that affect Bangladesh accessing the GCF? I do not think it will create any impediment for us. By using state of the art modern technology, we can minimize emissions. One of the major aspects of UNFCC is technology transfer. I hope the developed world would ensure transferring technology for assisting Bangladesh in achieving its development goal. The Ministry of Environment is the focal point for actions to be taken for reducing global warming. How much works you are doing in coordinated manner? The good side of us is that we have formed a committee with representatives from cross sectors, ministries, renowned scientists and reputed negotiators. We discuss every issue in this committee, we review here Bangladesh stands and prepare position papers of Bangladesh about what needs to be done in specific areas? We are going to global forum with these consensus documents. Bangladesh is continuously updating its situation of controlling global warming position and with the updated reports we are raising this situation in every forum either individually or in group. We are even leading the LDC forum with our well coordinated approach. Bangladesh could play appreciable role in the world forum due to its coordinated works. What is the key message of Bangladesh Position Paper for COP24 ? First, The Paris Rulebook must be approved and adopted this time. Second, we must get clear guidelines for financing, technology transfer and capacity development for carrying forward our planned missions towards achieving targets. We need to know these to advancing along our low carbon development path. As the most climate vulnerable country, Bangladesh must continue getting top priority attention for adaptation measures as usual. These 3-4 issues will be our key messages in COP24 . \</doc>

UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres has asked decision-makers to focus on four key things - a solid plan, stepping up climate action, more funding and smart investment in the future of the planet. During the UN COP24 Climate Change Conference grand opening in Katowice, Poland on Monday, he told over 150 world leaders gathered for climate action that 'we are in deep trouble.' The two-week 24th conference of the parties to the UN Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) technically started on Sunday, but Monday saw the high-level grand opening that also emphasised implementation of guidelines to build trust among nations. It marks the deadline for the 197 parties that signed the Convention to adopt guidelines for the implementation of the historic 2015 Paris Agreement, according to UN News. In the French capital, three years ago, countries collectively agreed to keep global temperature rises to no more than 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels, and if possible, to limit the rise to 1.5\'b0C. Now, in Poland, they have to agree on how they will achieve this collectively. 'We cannot fail in Katowice,' said UN chief Guterres. Kicking off the event, along with several other high-level representatives, he highlighted four key messages for the thousands of representatives of the world's nations, non-profit organisations, UN agencies, and private sector companies gathered in Katowice. The Secretary-General started by noting that climate change is already £ matter of life and death' for many people, nations and countries of the world, and that the science is telling us we need to move faster. 'We need concerted resource mobilisation and investment to successfully combat climate change,' the Secretary-General told the delegates attending the COP24 grand opening, noting that three quarters of the infrastructure needed by 2050 for climate action still remains to be built. 'All too often, climate action is seen as a burden,' said the UN secretary-General, as he explained that 'decisive climate action today is our chance to right our ship and set a course for a better future for all.' COP24 ), the German Embassy in Dhaka organised a 'climate breakfast' on Monday. At the framework of a Talanoa Dialogue, the six panelists, including Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) Chief Executive Chief Executive Syeda Rizwana Hasan, Dr Nahid Rezwana of Dhaka University, Dr Sultan Ahmed of Ministry of Environment and Forests, as well as nearly 40 invitees were given a voice to share their stories, ambitions and engagements regarding climate change. German Ambassador in Dhaka Peter Fahrenholtz stressed that the negative effects of climate change becoming perceptible for more and more people worldwide must immediately be taken seriously and must urgently be fought on a global level. The speakers highlighted the progress that Bangladesh has already achieved to counteract the negative consequences of climate change whereas the civil society repeatedly claimed that their communities would not yet sufficiently benefit from the efforts by government and industry, said the German Embassy in Dhaka. \</doc>

Dhaka, Sept. 12 -- The Bangkok climate talk culminated in a 300-page draft, a tome that highlights how much is left to do before the rulebook for the Paris Agreement on climate change can be adopted in the Polish city of Katowice later this year. Negotiators from 178 countries gathered in the Thai capital for a last chance ahead of 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to untangle the suite of guidelines that will steer the Paris Agreement toward effective implementation. With weeklong negotiations often progressing well into the night, several aspects of the rulebook did see an improvement in clarity, tired negotiators and stakeholders told Devex on Sunday. But other aspects, such as the vital issue of climate finance and details of nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, remain murky. Developed countries - led by the United States - took an aggressive stance on finance, avoiding conversations about how they would communicate future payouts to countries hit hard by rising temperatures. Rich nations skirted talks of the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund and a process to establish a new long-term finance goal in a move that ActionAid's Global Lead on Climate Change Harjeet Singh said threatens the accord entirely. "The Paris Agreement is on the brink," Singh said on Sunday. "Developed countries are going back on their word and refusing to agree clear rules governing climate finance. If they remain stuck in their positions and fail to loosen their purses, this treaty may collapse." Frustrated developing country and civil society actors noted that the European Union didn't step out of the U.S. shadow to speak up the way many of them expected. "The EU seemed to hide behind that strategy for tactical reasons, but we do hope that on these issues they will emerge as 'bridge-builders' in the run up to Katowice," said Yamide Dagnet, who tracks the U.N. climate process for the World Resources Institute. Stakeholders from developed and developing nations may have held different expectations, but finance will "obviously" be a key part of the Paris Agreement work program, Anna Broadhurst, lead adviser on climate change for the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, told Devex: "I think the finance negotiators have done what was expected of them this week, shifting gear [and] making solid progress on finance agenda items," she said. Negotiators moved ahead on the Adaptation Fund working document, Broadhurst added, and detailed technical exchange on the governance and institutional arrangements for the fund to serve the Paris Agreement. Negotiations on the treaty's technology framework also inched forward. The framework will provide guidance for enhanced action on technology development and transfer to support implementing the agreement. The parties agreed that the new draft text will be the basis of negotiation in Katowice - but unsurprisingly, financing for the framework remains a contentious issue, according to Singh. Iran, on behalf of the "Like-Minded Developing Countries" negotiation group during a mid-week press conference, cited persistent attempts by developed countries to erase differentiation or renegotiate the Paris Agreement during the talks. Perhaps the most frustrating outcome for all parties is the impasse on the text to determine national climate plans. Countries have been grappling with how to reflect the contributions and responsibilities of developed and developing countries given varied national contexts. As of Sunday, there was no agreement to progress text on guidance for NDCs in the context of mitigation. China's delegates advocated for different rules for developed and developing countries, while the U.S. remained firm in its strong opposition to a two-tier system. Despite slow progress, the length of the 304-page document borne of Bangkok's negotiations isn't an issue, according to Dagnet. The 20-page Paris Agreement began as 100, she said, and the "user manual" of the Paris accord, which will guide its implementation, is expected to be much longer. The compiled document hasn't yet been translated into a legally written negotiating text. Instead, parties in Bangkok have agreed to give a mandate to negotiation co-chairs, which will allow them to continue to work on new text proposals to tighten the document ahead of COP24 . Civil society organizations are also calling on the Polish presidency to lead diplomatic efforts ahead of Katowice and work toward a comprehensive COP24 package. The past week of tense negotiations could end up "leaving the heavy lifting for COP24 ," said Greenpeace East Asia Global Climate Political Advisor Taehyun Park. "A leadership deficit is the root cause of this slow pace and needs to be immediately addressed." He's looking to the upcoming California Global Climate Action Summit, New York U.N. Climate Week, and the series of closed meetings leading to COP24 to help cut through the contentious issues that stalled talks in Bangkok.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday urged the developed countries and world leaders to come forward with support for climate change adaptation and wider 'capacity building'. "We need support for climate change adaptation and wider 'capacity building' and also for technology development and transfer in areas like agriculture, public health and disaster management," she said. The Prime Minister was delivering her statement at the High-Level Leaders' Dialogue on Climate Change: Implementation of the Paris Agreement Towards COP24 and Beyond held at the UN Headquarters. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was present at the programme. Sheikh Hasina hoped that member states will utilise the opportunity in COP24 to have a more focused discussion on climate finance to put the world on track to meet pre-2020 ambition and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Mentioning that Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries, she said, 'Climate change threatens our life and livelihood of our 160 million people.' In Bangladesh, she said, they have mainstreamed climate actions and disaster risk reduction in the national plan. "We've investment of over 1 percent of our GDP to address the climate change impacts. Moreover, US$ 450 million has been allocated from our own resources for adaptation and mitigation purposes," she said. The Prime Minister said Bangladesh has also transformed its agriculture making it more resilient to the impacts of climate change. Hasina recalled that she announced in New York five years back that as a responsible member of the international community, Bangladesh would never exceed the average per capita emission of the developing world. "Our commitment to low-carbon, climate-resilient development is firm. We plan to move to 'Carbon budgeting' and resilient industrialisation. We wish to 'de-carbonise' our 'manufacturing pathways'," she said. Hasina said Bangladesh has installed around six million Solar Home Systems and provided two million Improved Cook Stoves among the poorest. She also said Bangladesh is developing stress-tolerant crop varieties to cope with climate change impacts. "In spite of our limitations, we allocated US$385 million to our own funds for adaptation and mitigation." \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 24 -- How can I disagree with my longstanding French negotiator friend Paul Watkinson when he says, "Katowice ... marks the moment where the Paris Agreement came of age: from now it runs its own affairs directly." True, the government delegates from 200 countries at 24th session of Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) to the UN Climate Convention (UNFCCC) at the Polish city of Katowice last week thrashed out the Rule Book to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement to address climate change. Paris Agreement set in place long-term goals and the mechanisms to achieve those leaving important details to be decided on how mechanisms should function in practice. Delegates in Katowice bridged some contentious divides in this regard. Parties agreed a set of new international rules and guidance including common guidelines for countries to report on their climate action in a more robust manner, starting from 2024. Developing countries do have some flexibility in their reporting and the review of those reports, and discretion is granted to Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). A common reporting and review framework might help improve transparency. Delegates agreed at Katowice to kick off a process in 2020 to set a new finance goal that goes beyond US$ 100 billion a year after 2025. Beginning from 2020, developed countries are also required to biennially report information on projected future finance "as available." Finance and support were key goals for developing countries like Bangladesh, and the Katowice package addresses these needs to some extent. As well as the ex-post and ex-ante reporting on finance, there are provisions to support adaptation (including the future arrangements for the adaptation fund) and for analysis of the needs of developing countries to implement the Convention and the Paris Agreement (a long-standing request of LDCs, SIDS and other developing countries). However, the guidance agreed in Katowice on how to account for funding to support climate action in developing countries is weak. What is more problematic is that commercial loans now can be counted as climate finance. For most vulnerable countries like Bangladesh what is important is that Katowice COP 24 agreed to take into account as appropriate efforts to address loss and damage as part of the five-yearly Global Stocktake of progress. There is also room for countries to reflect on this issue in their adaptation communication and transparency reporting. This is important for the most vulnerable countries like Bangladesh who are already experiencing climate impacts that are impossible to adapt to. Negotiators also agreed that investigative work of the Committee to promote compliance with the Paris Agreement can be triggered by the Committee itself, for instance when countries fail to communicate a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), or to submit mandatory reports on their climate action and support. Well, all elements of the Paris Rule Book couldn't be secured at Katowice. More substantive decision to ensure the environmental integrity of international carbon markets that held up the climate talks until the end was eventually punted to COP25 in Chile next year. There remains one major gap in the rules agreed in Katowice -- there is nothing yet in article 6 of the Paris Agreement that covers market and non-market approaches. We have to keep in mind that the Paris Rule Book is just a prerequisite for achieving the Paris Agreement's longer-term goals. As the recent Special IPCC Report on 1.50C temperature rise underscored, this will ultimately require many countries to substantially ramp up their climate ambitions. But COP 24 couldn't provide unequivocal assurances that major emitters are ready to take their responsibility in raising their ambitions. What was disturbing, in the almost two weeks of negotiations, four fossil fuel-producing nations refused to "welcome" the IPCC's very crucial report that rang the global alarm bell from hundreds of scientists; preferring instead to only "note" it. As a longtime climate negotiator I know that Paris Agreement has not been a strong one with full legal force but what we call in economics the second best. Saying that to truly keep even this weak Paris Agreement alive, countries will now need to submit strengthened NDCs and long-term climate strategies and to provide significantly enhanced support before the deadline of 2020. A special climate summit has also been called by UN secretary general in September 2019 where head of the states and governments could seize the opportunity to take a leap forward on stronger climate actions by pushing for a raised ambitions in terms of mitigation, adaptation and finance. Without urgent action to cut emissions, more than 1.6 billion in almost 1000 cities will face extreme heat. The One Planet Summit of French President Macron will also have a role to play, including by strengthening the participation of non-state actors and integrating the social dimension into our work. In October 2019, mayors and city leaders will gather in Copenhagen for the C40 Mayors' Summit to discuss the path toward a healthier, more sustainable future. There will be more such global events to call for taking urgent actions across the world. It's my earnest hope that Bangladesh and other LDCs led by new LDC Chair Nepal would prepare this 48-nation group for next two years with adequate homework. Bangladesh as a ground zero country in terms of adverse climate change without any fault of its own, should also require to change its narratives as a victim nation. It is the first country to prepare Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan in 2008 that was revised in 2009. Now it should be updated in a participatory manner so that it could be implemented without any delay. The formulation of National Adaptation Plan (NAP) should start immediately following the NAP Roadmap prepared by the group of experts including this scribe. Here also people's participation should be stressed. On behalf of LDCs, I have pushed for NAPs for LDCs at Copenhagen COP in 2009, then successfully included it at Cancun COP in 2010 as part of Cancun Adaptation Framework, and continued it in Durban in 2011, Doha in 2012 and Warsaw in 2013. Bangladesh also created Climate Trust Fund from own budgetary resources and Climate Resilient Fund with development partners support mainly from UK and few others. The need now is to raise the budgetary allocation.

The \' Katowice Climate Package\' , adopted in the 24th COP24 held in Poland in the first week of this month, for implementing the landmark Paris Agreement is expected to benefit people from all walks of life, especially the most vulnerable. The package is designed to operationalize the climate change regime contained in the Paris Agreement. Under the auspices of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat, it will promote international cooperation and encourage greater ambition, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Some termed it a robust, but some of the most vulnerable countries as well as the non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society groups found clear gaps in the package, particularly in market mechanism issues such as carbon markets, urging the global leaders to overcome the differences in the next conferences by 2020. Designing the rulebook is considered as a significant success as it is expected to enable all countries to implement the elements of the Paris Agreement in a manner could be measured, reported and verified. At the same time, the conference represents a major failure to take steps to face the challenges. The most vulnerable developing countries made it an issue for consideration. \</doc>

Representatives from global community on Wednesday demanded for urgent action by developed countries to keep global warming to 1.5 degree increase in temperature from pre-industrial times to avoid the most adverse impact of climate change. Global Climate Negotiation in Poland, civil society leaders from Most Vulnerable Countries (MVC) and Least Developed Countries (LDC) came up with the demand in the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( CoP24 ) at the Climate Conference Center in Poland. 'Paris Rule Book' (proposed modalities to implement the Paris Agreement) will contain MVCs interest addressing their vulnerability and survival strategies, they said. From Bangladesh Aminul Hoque of Equity BD who presented key demand at the conference said that 'Due to inaction of global leaders to climate change issues, global warming already reached more than 0.85 degree Celsius increase from pre-industrial times, which worsening the climate scenario, that's why the IPCC latest report made it clear: the world must come together now to take serious action to stop global warming.' He said 'MVCs are mostly affected. The impact deprives the most vulnerable groups from basic universal rights, particularly people living in coastal areas along with women and girls.' Dr Ainun Nishat, Delegate of Bangladesh government negotiation team, Sanjay Vashist, Coordinator of Climate Action Network of South Asia in India, Hemantha Withanage, Executive Director of Center for Climate Justice in Sri Lanka, Atle Solberg, Head of Coordination-Platform of Disaster Displacement-PDD in Geneva and Lena Barenn, Coordinator-Norwegian Refugee Council-NRC in Geneva were present at the conference. \</doc>

A midst the devastating storms in the Philippines, China and the USA, floods in Nigeria, India and record temperatures in many parts of the world, the United Nations body to address climate change impacts met in Bonn. The meeting addressed proposed recommendations for climate change displacement and undertook intense discussions on the scope of an important report on finance for loss and damage, amongst other issues. Civil society representatives present at the meeting were dismayed by a continued lack of progress due to blocking from rich countries on key issues. The Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM) is due to celebrate its fifth anniversary which lends itself to the question \' what has the WIM achieved in the last five years?\' As the upcoming climate summit ( COP24 ) will again be held in Poland, it is time for the country where the loss and damage mechanism began, to take responsibility for putting it back on track. The meeting dealt with the findings of a year-long process mandated in 2015 at Paris to identify ways to help people displaced by climate change - whether it be people forced to move by increasingly violent storms, as we see in the Philippines, extreme floods like in Nigeria or people forced to move longer term by extreme droughts. The Task Force on Displacement, composed of a number of experts from the field of displacement, compiled a set of recommendations addressing the UN climate process, governments, UN agencies and others. \</doc>

Bangladesh is endeavoring to get the promised financial support and technology from the developed countries those participated in the Paris Agreement. We are also seeking some additional support from them as a least developed country (LDC). As one of the most vulnerable country, we are talking about \' Loss and Damage\' which is one of the most important issues for Bangladesh at present. The Department of Environment (DoE) of Bangladesh is trying to constitute a committee for formulating a national mechanism for assessing the loss and damage. Assessing the loss and damages and estimating the extent of compensation is a great challenge for us. All the LDC members are claiming compensation for losses and damages without having any estimate for the actual loss in both economical and non-economical aspects. Moreover, the definition of loss and damage is yet to be agreed. Many questions arise in this matter like what should be the economic losses? What should be the non-economical losses? Whether the non-economic losses can be converted into economical losses? All the LDC members have to prepare the definitions. The process is going on. The government along with the non-government organizations and technical organizations are trying to prepare an internationally accepted loss and damage estimation methodology. So, organizations that will be participating in COP24 should draw attention to the international community about the guidelines, methodologies and the appropriate way of estimating loss and damage. Bangladesh in some cases has started working on risk transfer and financial mechanism. We are yet to know how the risk transfer or financial mechanism works or what will be the engagement of insurance companies? What will be the premium issue and other associated matters? On top of these, another important thing is creating evidences on loss and damages. The global community wants to see the evidences. The government\' s actions are at the initial stage for producing credible evidences. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Nov. 14 -- Speakers at a seminar on Tuesday urged the government to play an active role at the upcoming climate change conference to ensure the interests of most vulnerable countries. They also urged the government to play an effective role at CoP 24 (Conference of the Parties 24) to be held at Katowice in Poland in December. The speakers made the call at a seminar titled " CoP 24 Climate Conference: CSOs expectations from implementing Paris Agreement" organised by ten rights-based civil society organisations at the National Press Club. The discussants said the government should continue to put pressure on the developed countries to reduce carbon emissions and combat global warming. And Bangladesh, as a victim of global warming, should make a legal framework to deal with the climate change issue, they added. Qazi Kholiquzzaman, chairman of Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation, chaired the event while Hasan Mahmud, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry of environment and forest, was present as the chief guest.

The 24th event of climate change conference of parties ( COP24 ) begins at Katowice, Poland from December 2 with a commitment to protect the world. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is hosting the two-week conference when the global leaders will try to reach a consensus to adopt a Rulebook for implementing the Paris Agreement. A draft of the Rulebook was prepared in COP22 and COP23 with a view to approving in the COP24 . There are still some issues in which opinion differs, but all the stakeholders are optimistic about reaching a meeting of minds for approving and adopting the Rulebook. A senior representative of Bangladesh delegation informed the Energy and Power that it would not be possible to launch initiatives by different countries for implementing the Paris Agreement from 2020 through amending and adjusting laws and regulations unless the Rulebook is approved in 2018. Meanwhile, the progress of mobilizing the necessary fund, Green Climate Fund (GCF) of US$ 100 billion, to implement the agreement is so far being considered to be frustrating, which has aggravated further following the USA\' s pulling out of the agreement. The Paris Agreement was adopted in COP21 to replace the Kyoto Protocol (KP) -- a legally binding emission reduction commitment by the developed nations. The then number one emitter, USA, never ratified the KP and rendered it virtually ineffective despite the fact that the European Union lived up to its reduction commitment. The developing countries, including major emitters like China, India, Brazil and South Africa, were exempted. Finally, the Paris Agreement was adopted under which all countries pledged to comply with their submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to bring down the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius or well below 2 degrees C. The developed countries, which are expected to lead the process, will focus more on the review and transparency mechanisms to ensure compliance to the submitted NDCs by the developing countries. The countries have already submitted what they need to do for controlling the GHG emission, finalizing their respective NDC. The Rulebook would ensure the features of NDC and would prescribe the information and accounting process. A tracking framework for monitoring performance of achievement of NDC envisaged targets would also be embodied in the Rulebook. The provision of stocktaking of NDC after every five years will also be there. Monitoring of NDC implementation would start under a framework from 2023. A compliance mechanism would be finalized, approved and adopted. A committee would monitor the implementation. According to a provision, the developed countries would provide required financial supports to developing countries for contributing to limit the global warming. But a quantitative and qualitative report about modus operandi of this support requires providing in every two years of frequency. The Rulebook will have clear guidelines about the process of submitting the report. There are, however, doubts over the possibility of it getting approved in the COP24 . Efforts are going on for making the developed countries agreeing to this. Although the main effort is to formulate a common rule, major polluting countries among the developing ones like India, China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia are joining different camps while countries like USA, Canada and Australia are not interested about too many rules. They are also saying that though their per capita emission is higher, yet the total emissions by China, India are much greater. So these countries must be treated as polluters and rules must also include them for contributing financial support to other developing countries. But Bangladesh is in a common forum like the groups of least developed countries and climate vulnerable countries. Bangladesh is saying that though it lacks capacity, it is in favor of a common rule. Bangladesh wants countries like it must get some exemptions from the common rule. Environment expert Dr Mushfiqur Rahman said financing and transfer of technology are two essential requirements for successful implementation of the Paris Agreement. The GCF must have pledged US$ 100 billion by 2020. But till the end of 2018, the situation is frustrating. Moreover, US President Donald Trump immediately after assuming office has taken side with fossil fuel group through announcing his decision to move out of the Paris Agreement. Consequently, major polluting countries, especially those under European Union, have become reluctant in proving fund for emission control. On the other hand, the developing world continued relying on fossil fuels for maintaining momentum of their economic growth and development going. But these countries need financing and technology transfer for achieving energy efficiency in fuel use. Developing countries cannot control carbon emission if the developed countries do not provide the support. Environment experts at a recent seminar in Dhaka spoke about the role of Bangladesh delegation in COP24 COP24 is very important for the country to uphold its interest.  Our delegation should negotiate boldly to ensure easier and effective access to these support mechanisms, he added. Dr. Hasan Mahmud, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, alleged that the industrialized and developed countries have been neglecting the carbon emissions and that is why the temperature is rising alarmingly. He urged the Bangladesh delegation to raise voice for imposing a legally binding commitment against the biggest emitters to keep the global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius. Seminar chair Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman, chairman of Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF), said the success of climate negotiation outcome could be threatened as the politics behind the scene is stronger than the temperature goal.  We should boost our own financial capacity to face the challenges, he added. Dr. Ainun Nishat, Professor Emeritus of BRAC University, said the government should take the civil society's recommendations during policy implementation. He urged the government to raise its voice on the issues of capacity building at the COP24 . Bangladesh has already finalized its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce carbon emission. At the same time, the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources has finalized the NDC work plan for controlling emission. Bangladesh in its NDC committed to reduce emissions by 5% until 2030 using its own resources despite having no obligation for it. Subject to availability of global support, the emission could be reduced up to 15%. For implementation of the action plan, three priority sectors -- power, transport and industry -have been finalized. Global financial support has not been committed yet. But Bangladesh has kept the momentum going for reducing the emission using its own finance. The carbon footprint of Bangladesh in the context of global GHG emission is negligible. It is even less than 0.35%. But Bangladesh is among the most climate vulnerable countries. The country, despite having its limitations, is working with commitments to contribute to reduce global warming to 1.5 degree or well below 2 degree Celsius by 2100. According to different estimates, the country lost at least 0.5-1% of GDP due to adverse impacts of climate change over the past 40 years. In financial terms, this loss is over US$ 12 billion. The global average per capita carbon emission is 4.5 tonnes while it is only 0.5 tonnes for Bangladesh. These are 16.5 tonnes in USA, 7.5 tonnes in China and 1.7 tonnes in India. Consequently, as per the historic Paris Climate Conference Agreement, Bangladesh has no obligation for reducing emissions. The country invested huge amount of money in the mitigation measures over the last few decades. The country will have to undertake massive industrialization initiative for achieving the national goal of becoming mid-income country by 2021 and developed economy by 2041. The services sector would also advance. According to Department of Environment (DOE), Power, Transport and Industry sectors would contribute 69% of future GHG emissions and would grow to 264% by 2030. The present annual carbon emission is 64 million tonnes. In 2030, it may grow to 234 million tonnes. Bangladesh in its NDC document mentioned that with its own investment, this can be reduced by 5% or 12 million tonnes by 2030. If pledged international assistance is available, the reduction can be 15% meaning 36 million tonnes. The national action plan has focused on emission reduction from power, transport and industry sectors through increasing efficiency and better management. Energy and environment analyst Professor Dr Ijaz Hossain, who is the Head of Chemical Engineering Department of BUET and was involved in formulation of NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) and NAP (National Action Plan), informed the EP that there is a plan for reducing emissions by 18% from power, 24% from transport and 10% from industrial sector through investing own money. This would reduce overall emissions by 5%. But availability of pledged international technological and financial assistance would make it possible to reduce the emissions by three times. The government is working on an action plan with an investment of US$ 27 billion for a period of 2011-2030. The main investment is taking place in super critical and ultra-super critical technology of coal-fired thermal power generation. A decision has also been taken for an additional investment of US$ 16.5 billion for the application of ultra-super critical technology instead of sub-critical technology. The works of at least two 1,320 MW each power plants have advanced considerably. These two plants would come into operation between the years 2019 and 2021. Besides, other investments would be made on renewable energy generation. The NDC does not include any plan for reducing emissions in industrial sector. The government has announced investing US$ 2.65 billion for reducing emissions from road transport sector and US$ 2.70 billion for reducing emissions from mass transit project. Experts appreciated the plans and initiatives for low carbon development, but expressed concern over the implementation issue as the government has so far failed to implement the plans everywhere - power, transport and industry sectors. Of course, Bangladesh is at its preliminary stage only. If the plan with own investment can be implemented, more than 5% targeted emissions reduction would be possible by 2030. Power Sector The present installed capacity of power, including 2,800 MW of captive capacity, is 17,340 MW. Other than 2,500 isolated chars and villages, 100% population of Bangladesh would come under the power coverage by 2019. According to the government plan, the installed capacity would be 24,000 MW in 2021, 40,000 MW in 2030 and 60,000 MW in 2041. Captive power plants are the most fuel-inefficient ones. These are only 30% efficient. Emission is also the highest in this case. The efficiency of power plants connected to Bangladesh power grid (34%) is not also high enough in the world context. However, gas turbines having 58% efficiency have already been added in the system. At least two such power plants are operating at this level of efficiency. The government has planned to improve the average efficiency to 50% for all plants by 2030. According to the power generation plan finalized by Power Division in January 2018, the net generation capacity projected for 2030 is 55,199 MW. Of this, gas/LNG-based power plants capacity would be 22,247 MW and all these would be using updated modern technology. Some 5,726 MW would come from diesel and furnace oil. Most of these would be engine-based generation. Coal-based power generation would be 20,978 MW and all these would be either super critical or ultra super critical technology based. Some 3,836 MW would be imported from regional countries. It is not yet sure how much would come from hydro power plants. Nuclear power would contribute 2,232 MW and this would be 100% carbon neutral. Only one subcritical technology using coal-based low-efficiency power plants emits 1,200 grams of carbon for every kWh it generates. Emission would be reduced to 700-800 gm when super critical and ultra super critical plants come into operation. Generation from liquid fuel is on the rise. For these plants, the emission is 800 gm per unit. This is equivalent to a high technology using coal power plant. Considering the 34% efficiency of the present gas-based plants, the emission is 550 grams. Higher technology application would bring down emission to 350-400 grams. Sources at Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) said that by 2041 the existing gas turbine peaking power plants would be replaced by 200-250 MW capacity combined cycle power plants. By 2041, leaving 1% of the liquid fuel-based power plants, all other plants would be phased out. The power plants will start reducing the emission effectively from 2030 and by 2041 further reduction would be possible. Waste Heat Recovery Plan The government is working on a plan for waste heat recovery. A feasibility study is going to be conducted to see whether the recovered waste heat of grid power plants can be used for industries. On the other hand, use of recovered heat from captive power plants in industries has started. Many industries are now making efficient use of fuel adopting cogeneration and tri-generation methods. Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) is considering to making the provision mandatory for captive power generation. Some export processing zones (EPZs) in the country have own generation plants. The possibility of selling this recovered waste heat to steam-using industries is being considered. It would be made mandatory for all the 100 new Special Economic Zones (SEZs) now at different stages of implementation. Experts say successful implementation of the plan would bring great success in emission reduction. Energy Efficiency Other Than Industries Bangladesh is heading towards achieving major success in lighting-load reduction. The government has created the momentum during 2009-2014 term when in two days only it could replace 20 million incandescent bulbs all over the country with free CFL bulbs. Use of LED bulbs as a follow up is making wonder in reducing the lighting load. Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) expects the trend may help reduce the lighting load by 60% by 2021. Bangladesh Standard and Testing Institute (BSTI) started working on leveling and standardizing all appliances. Works are in progress for fans, refrigerators, air conditioners and motors. Energy rating regulation of SREDA is at its final stage. It expects that within the next few years star labeling could be made mandatory after ensuring standardization. Energy ministry has requested the finance ministry to adjust duty and tax rates for encouraging use of fuel-efficient appliances. It is expected that by 2021 the use of energy-efficient home appliances may also be ensured. It will also make great contribution to reducing carbon emission. Energy Efficiency Roadmap Renewable Energy The draft of the new power system master plan (PSMP 2016) provided for achieving 40,000 MW power generation capacity by 2030. The government is not following that target, however. But even now, the renewable energy generation target remains at 10% meaning 2,000MW by 2020. The government is working on a plan for generating 2,896 MW of renewable power. Experts observe it would not be achieved though the government is optimistic about it. Renewable energy capacity would now be 505 MW, including 230MW of hydropower. Solar contributes 271 MW and wind energy is merely 3 MW. The government plan states about 1,470 MW of generation from grid-connected solar by 2020. Some 1,153 MW is the target for wind power. Around 30 MW would come from biomass and 7 MW from biogas. Around 4.6 million families could be served by solar home systems (SHSs) as non-grid supply. This is considered as a milestone achievement and earned global accolades. Many countries are following the commercial model of Bangladesh. By 2020, it is expected to bring 5.2 million families under SHSs. The generation capacity would grow to 218 MW. But the program is almost stalled now for countrywide grid coverage. Using loans from Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL), 11 solar mini grids are now in operation in the country. The capacity is 2.19 MW. There are plans for another 61 mini grids. Besides, the government has major plan for grid connected solar power generation. Several contracts have already been concluded for about 400 MW of grid-connected solar. But till now only grid-connected solar is of 3MW. Experts are extremely concerned about success of grid-connected solar. Wind power is now generating only 3 MW now. For achieving the target, 1,150 MW more power needs to be generated from wind. Dr Ijaz Hossain finds no major possibility from wind in Bangladesh. Some contracts for wind power generation have already fallen flat. Wind mapping has recently been completed. Irrigation is very important in an agriculture-dominant country. Around 1.4 million diesel-run irrigation pumps are in operation. The government has plans for converting all of these into solar ones. More than 1,000 solar pumps have already been installed with the financial assistance of IDCOL. Work is advancing for setting up of 50,000 solar irrigation pumps by 2025. Industry and Low Carbon Growth Competition in the world market and rise in fuel price internally has induced industrialists adopting the option of efficiency for remaining competitive. SREDA under the energy efficiency roadmap has also started working. They are expecting that 31% power and energy conservation can be achieved in the industry sector by 2030 through ensuring efficiency. While drawing attention, Siddique Zobair of SREDA told the EP that multi-dimensional initiatives have been planned for achieving efficiency in industry sector. Energy Auditing is one of these. It is almost ready to be launched. Within a year or two, annual or bi-annual energy auditing for industries would be made mandatory. Large Industries would require taking actions according to findings of audit reports for improving and ensuring efficiency. It may not be made mandatory for medium and small industries. But they would be given assistance under this program for increasing efficiency. The works for making industry sector energy-efficient needs sizable investment. A fund of US$100 million has been created with JICA assistance for this. IDCOL and BIFFL have started giving loans to industries from this fund. Initiative has also been taken for setting up solar panels on the rooftops of large industries for helping them achieving energy efficiency. A net-metering policy is now at its final stage by SREDA for grid access of rooftop solar. When it starts in one year, 50 MW power would be available from rooftop solar. The price per unit of power for industries is now Tk 10. Rooftop solar power can be supplied at Tk 9.0. Introduction of the net-metering system would let industrialists exchanging grid and rooftop solar power as and when they need. Bills would be adjusted considering the power exchanged from and to the grid. It will act as financial relief of the industries and help them getting greener. Prof Ijaz thought provision for engaging energy manager in each industry should be made mandatory. Bangladesh has just started its journey on the highway of energy efficiency. Works must be better coordinated. Transport Sector Bangladesh is lagging far behind in terms of transport sector achieving low carbon development. The NDC and NAP would clarify how emissions can be reduced through increasing efficiency in the transport sector as soon as possible. There are plans for constructing elevated express highway and Mass Rapid Transit in Dhaka. But actually the transport speed all over the country is reducing day by day for worsening traffic gridlocks. The gridlocks have extended to intercity highways from the cities. Infrastructure development is getting delayed. The government has a plan for transferring 20% passengers load from road to railway. A huge investment has been made in rail system development. The year 2030 is 12 years away. But a considerable doubt has been there if Bangladesh can at all achieve the target. Conclusion Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its recent report mentioned that it might be possible to restrict global warming below 2 degree Celsius or even 1.5 degree in the next few years. But global warming may increase by 2.7-3.0 degrees in the following decades. Countries need to step up their mission for restricting the warming for achieving the GHG emissions control as pledged in the Paris Agreement. Global scenario of NDC and honoring pledges of developed countries for providing financial support to the developing countries in combatting emissions is very frustrating. Against the pledged US$ 100 billion fund for GCF by 2020, the commitment so far stands at only US$ 10.6 billion and fund transferred is only US$ 41.6 billion, creating frustration among the countries.

Bangladesh, Dec. 5 -- Nations facing imminent environmental disaster on Monday called on rich polluters to help them back from the brink, as the UN warned the world's plan to avoid climate catastrophe was "way off course". From glaciers melting in Nepal to the rising seas threatening to engulf small island states, the world is already experiencing the damage lying in wait if global warming runs unchecked. Nearly 200 nations gathered in Poland Monday for the start of the COP24 summit, where they must agree on a universal rulebook to make good on the promises they made in the 2015 Paris climate deal. "Nepal is a country comprised of mountains and plains," president Bidhya Devi Bhandari told delegates. "We have been bearing the brunt of disproportionate impact of climate change despite being a low carbon-emitting country." The Paris agreement vowed to limit global temperature rises to under two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and to the safer cap of 1.5C if at all possible. For this, richer nations must provide funding--$100 billion per year by 2020 -- to steer developing countries towards greener energy while drastically drawing down their own emissions. But developing nations have complained that richer states-responsible for the vast majority of historic fossil fuel use-aren't doing enough to help them adapt to our warming planet. "We feel as if we have been penalised for the mistakes we never made," said Bhandari. "It is incumbent on the international community to ensure that justice is done." Trust in the Paris process has been hit by US President Donald Trump's decision to renege on his country's commitment, and there are fears the political will to act is waning as negotiations drag on. Not a single G20 nation sent a top-level representative to the COP on Monday. With just one degree Celsius of warming so far, Earth is already being subjected to raging forest fires, flooding and superstorms made worse by rising seas. A string of UN reports have sounded the alarm: levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are the highest in 3.0 million years and the last four years were the four hottest in history. In October a team of more than 90 independent scientists said mankind must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by half within the next 12 years to avoid heat rises that could tear at the fabric of society. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned nations that their plan to chart a route away from runaway global warming was "way off course".

Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) on Thursday sought transparency and accountability from both ends in managing climate financing and renewed its demand for fulfilling the pledge of economic assistance made by developed countries under the 'Copenhagen Pact-2009'. TIB Executive Director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said the deficit of Green Climate Fund (GCF) has created a profitable business scope for different international investment agencies which he termed unethical and deviation from commitment. He made the remarks at a press briefing held at Midas Centre in the city. Dr Iftekhar urged the government to skillfully negotiate the issues of fund for developing countries, including Bangladesh in the forthcoming 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which is also known as COP-24 conference to take place in Katowice, Poland from December 3-14. The TIB Executive Director also said though Bangladesh is expected to work effectively merging with other six countries receiving the money, negotiators from Bangladesh's end should understand the underlying competition and act accordingly. In a written statement, Senior Programme Manager of TIB Jakir Hossain Khan said Bangladesh along with seven countries were assured of receiving financial aids from GCF up to US$ 100 billion every year till 2025 to adapt to climate change and fight with its hazards, of which only US$ 7 billion have been financed against project demands worth US$ 12 billion. As there is no existence of a roadmap right now for releasing the approved funds to specific countries, GCF board has only provided project money of US$ 1.4 billion which has already raised questions about their effectiveness, he added. Khan lauded the government's actions including allocation of money for Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) while expressed concerns about its decreasing amount and corruptions. TIB presented a set of proposals to the signatory countries of Paris Pact-2015 for the coming COP-24 conference which included a transparent structure for climate funding for both developing and developed countries; formulation of a timely roadmap for fund release. \</doc>

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called for putting the world on the track of Paris Agreement to meet the long term goals of addressing the climate disasters. She hoped that UN members would utilize the opportunity in COP 24 , slated for December this year in Poland, to have a more focused discussion on climate finance to meet pre-2020 ambition and long term goals of Paris Agreement. The PM was addressing a high level dialogue of the leaders on Climate Change Implementation of the Paris Agreement-towards COP24 and beyond at UN Headquarters recently. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres convened the dialogue ahead of COP 24 . Hasina said Bangladesh needed support for climate change adaptation and wider  capacity building and also for developing technology and transfer in areas like agriculture, public health, disaster management. Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries as life and livelihood of its 160 million people is under threat of extreme climate events, she added. \</doc>

Limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society, the IPCC said in a new assessment. With clear benefits to people and natural ecosystems, limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C compared to 2\'b0C could go hand in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said recently. The special report on global warming of 1.5\'b0C was approved by the IPCC in Incheon, Republic of Korea. It will be a key scientific input into the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December when governments would review the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change.  With more than 6,000 scientific references cited and the dedicated contribution of thousands of expert and government reviewers worldwide, this important report testifies to the breadth and policy relevance of the IPCC, said Hoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC. Ninety-one authors and review editors from 40 countries prepared the IPCC report in response to an invitation from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) when it adopted the Paris Agreement in 2015. The report\' s full name is Global Warming of 1.5\'b0C, an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.  One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1\'b0C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes, said Panmao Zhai, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I. The report highlights a number of climate impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C compared to 2\'b0C, or more. For instance, by 2100, global sea level rise would be 10 cm lower with global warming of 1.5\'b0C compared with 2\'b0C. The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century with global warming of 1.5\'b0C, compared with at least once per decade with 2\'b0C. Coral reefs would decline by 70-90 percent with global warming of 1.5\'b0C, whereas virtually all (> 99 percent) would be lost with 2\'b0C.  Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5\'b0C or higher increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems, said Hans-Otto Portner, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II. Limiting global warming would also give people and ecosystems more room to adapt and remain below relevant risk thresholds, added Portner. The report also examines pathways available to limit warming to 1.5\'b0C, what it would take to achieve them and what the consequences could be.  The good news is that some of the kinds of actions that would be needed to limit global warming to 1.5\'b0C are already underway around the world, but they would need to accelerate, said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, Co-Chair of Working Group I. The report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C would require  rapid and far-reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching \' net zero\' around 2050. This means that any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing CO2 from the air.  Limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes, said Jim Skea, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III. Allowing the global temperature to temporarily exceed or \' overshoot\' 1.5\'b0C would mean a greater reliance on techniques that remove CO2 from the air to return global temperature to below 1.5\'b0C by 2100. The effectiveness of such techniques are unproven at large scale and some may carry significant risks for sustainable development, the report notes.  Limiting global warming to 1.5\'b0C compared with 2\'b0C would reduce challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health and well-being, making it easier to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, said Priyardarshi Shukla, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III. The decisions we make today are critical in ensuring a safe and sustainable world for everyone, both now and in the future, said Debra Roberts, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II.  This report gives policymakers and practitioners the information they need to make decisions that tackle climate change while considering local context and people\' s needs. The next few years are probably the most important in our history, she said. The IPCC is the leading world body for assessing the science related to climate change, its impacts and potential future risks, and possible response options. The report was prepared under the scientific leadership of all three IPCC working groups. Working Group I assesses the physical science basis of climate change; Working Group II addresses impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; and Working Group III deals with the mitigation of climate change. The Paris Agreement adopted by 195 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2015 included the aim of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change by  holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels. As part of the decision to adopt the Paris Agreement, the IPCC was invited to produce, in 2018, a Special Report on global warming of 1.5\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. Reactions of LDCs to IPCC 1.5\'b0C Special Report "Limiting global temperature increases to 1.5\'b0C means significantly decreased levels of food insecurity, water shortages, destruction of infrastructure, and displacement from sea level rise and other impacts. To the lives and livelihoods of billions, that half a degree is everything." "Governments must increase climate action now and submit more ambitious plans for the future. This includes increasing the level of support to developing countries to enable them to develop and lift their people out of poverty without going down a traditional, unsustainable development pathway." On the issue of loss and damage, Mr. Endalew said the report confirms that loss and damage resulting from climate change will only worsen with further warming with much greater losses at 2\'b0C than at 1.5\'b0C. It is particularly vulnerable countries like the LDCs that are worst affected by the devastating impacts of climate change and bear the greatest cost from the damage it causes, despite contributing the least to the problem. This injustice must be addressed by the international community through the provision of support for dealing with loss and damage. On the implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement that are due at COP24 in December 2018, he said: "The IPCC report has made even clearer the need for the Paris Rulebook to properly reflect the breadth of action required by all countries to achieve the Agreement's 1.5\'b0C goal. Countries must deliver a robust Rulebook that will ensure adequate action is taken to cut emissions, adapt to climate change and address loss and damage, and that support is provided to enable poorer countries to do the same." What Civil Society Groups Say Civil society groups welcomed the IPCC\' s latest scientific assessment on global warming which calls for full decarbonisation latest by 2050. This must serve as a key input for the Talanoa Dialogue at COP24 and influence a political outcome committing to increased NDCs by 2020. Science clearly shows our future is incompatible with fossil fuels. With this stark evidence at hand, they said recently that the governments have no excuse but to put climate action at the front and centre of their national agendas. The unequivocal message from this report, based on more than 6,000 independent research papers, is that every half a degree of warming matters. Limiting warming to 1.5\'b0C is necessary, possible and urgent. It is the only option for a prosperous, just and safe future, especially for those most vulnerable at the frontlines of impacts. The report points to a radical shift to decarbonisation by 2050, but preferably earlier by 2040 given rising impacts even at one-degree Celsius warming. This assessment must spur the rapid switch to renewables across all sectors in the next decade driven by advances already underway in the real economy. The political will to heed the science and lead this transformational change towards 100% renewables will determine which side of history today\' s leaders will stand on. This IPCC report must be a concrete scientific input to get a decision from the Talanoa Dialogue at COP24  The IPCC report makes it clear: the world must come together now to take serious action to stop global warming. Developing countries are already disproportionately affected by climate change - it deprives the most vulnerable groups, particularly women and girls, from basic universal rights. CARE calls on governments, in particular, from developed countries and emerging economies, to accelerate climate action to reduce emissions now, not in 10 years. Ignoring the necessities for action that the IPCC report spells out is unacceptable, said Caroline Kende-Robb, Secretary General, CARE International.  Every tenth of a degree of warming is a choice between life or death. We\' re already witnessing the beginnings of massive displacement and a shocking rise in hunger, with women living in poverty suffering the most. It only gets worse from here, said Raijeli Nicole, Regional Director for Oxfam in the Pacific.  Limiting global warming is hard, but achievable. The sobering reality however is that even 1.5 degrees is too hot. Every fraction of a degree matters. We must cut emissions to zero and draw down carbon from the atmosphere. This report emphasizes this needs to happen now - not in 10, 20 or 30 years - but right now, said Fiona Armstrong, Founder and Executive Director, Climate and Health Alliance - Australia (CAHA) The IPCC has warned in all its reports that climate change will lead to adverse impacts on natural and human systems. IPCC Special Report  Global Warming of 1.5\'b0C gives strong insights why the 1.5\'b0C inspirational target of the Paris Agreement should be taken very seriously; as climate threshold concludes that the risks for human well-being and livelihoods, ecosystem, food and water security, which are already serious today, will be critically higher at 1.5\'b0C, and projected for further increase with every level of additional emission. The fossil fuel age has to end: that\' s the message of the report. To have any chance of avoiding the chaos, droughts and rising tides of 1.5 degrees or more of global warming, we must massively and speedily transform the society to kick our fossil fuel addiction. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 26 -- International migration from climate change-affected areas in Bangladesh is far below than that of the internal migration, according to a new study. It said only 4.30 per cent of the respondents from different climate change-affected areas migrated internationally while 95.70 per cent accounted for internal migration. Due to lack of access to liquid money and services from the government agencies, the climate-affected people cannot plan to go abroad, according to the findings of the study shared at a national consultation in the city's CIRDAP auditorium on Monday. Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Program (OKUP) conducted the study titled 'Climate Change and Migration Dynamics in Khulna and Bagerhat districts in Bangladesh' with support from HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation Bangladesh during the six months from June to December. Akib Anwar, project manager of OKUP, presented the findings at the programme. The outflow of workers going abroad from the climate-affected areas is much lower as they cannot arrange the migration cost and they also do not get necessary services from the relevant government offices. Mr Anwar said people from most of the surveyed areas are deprived of necessary migration loan facilities. Probashi Kallyan Bank has only one branch in Khulna. So, majority of the people in surveyed 14 unions like Kapilmuni, Raruli, Koyra Sadar and Morrelganj Sadar were not getting access to the bank's services, he added. A total of 490 households were surveyed under the study. However, the research showed that Dhaka saw most of the internal migration followed by Khulna, Chattogram, Gopalganj, Feni, Jessore, Barishal and Bagerhat. Ahmed Munirus Saleheen, additional secretary at the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment, said climate change became a reality for Bangladesh. So, they would give priority to the overseas job seekers from the climate change-affected areas, he added. OKUP Chairman Shalirul Islam said the government should address the huge internal migration taking place due to the climate change. In last 30 years, Bangladesh had been hit by more than 100 tropical cyclones and 60 flash floods. The coastal zones of Bangladesh are especially susceptible to climate change-srelated hazards, according to the OKUP study paper. Rights activists said on Monday Bangladesh needed to build climate resilience, as the recently held CoP-24 negotiation hardly yielded any positive outcome for the most vulnerable countries (MVCs). They also said the outcome of CoP-24 , held on December 01-14 in Poland, was frustrating and hardly incompatible with the Paris Agreement. The Civil Society Organisation (CSO) representatives expressed these opinions at a press conference, held at National Press Club in the capital. They also criticised the proposed 'Paris Rule Book', as it ignored interest of the MVCs. There is no specific decision and text regarding reducing global temperature up to 1.5 degree Celsius, financing, displacement, and loss and damage, which were the key points of demand of the MVCs. M Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, chief moderator of EquityBD, moderated the press conference, and Syed Aminul Hoque of the same organisation presented the keynote paper. Mr Aminul Hoque said, "The outcome of CoP-24 negotiation is frustrating, and there is hardly any particular text in the proposed 'Paris Rule Book' on financial commitment, technology and capacity building issues for the vulnerable countries." He also condemned the developed countries for backtracking from their commitment to provide these supports. The refusal of the developed countries to take the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report would seriously undermine the implementation of Paris Agreement. In fact, it would further aggravate the sufferings of the MVCs, he added. Mr Rezaul Karim opined that the country's leaders should be more serious about the environmental issues in future, and political parties should also state their position in this regard in their election manifesto.

Bangladesh, Nov. 26 -- Economic development requires energy. Energy powers the production process in the manufacturing industry, agriculture and services sector. It plays a crucial role in providing a better lifestyle for citizens. These imperatives have led countries to seek additional energy from hydrocarbons - coal, oil and natural gas. Such a dynamics has had a functional imperative in developed countries. At the same time, this equation has led to the general assumption that greater use of hydrocarbons and fossil fuels is contributing to heating of the atmosphere and subsequently leading to climate variability. This has led the world to seek alternatives through the creation and use of renewable energy - in the form of solar energy, bio-gas, bio-fuel and wind energy. This functional approach has gained momentum over the last two decades and a half. Agenda-21 that emerged from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 spurred the process. Bangladesh is one of the countries worst affected by global warming and as such has over the years has paid particular attention to this development. This has also underlined the need for relevant authorities to consider and attempt to undertake necessary measures for adaptation and mitigation. The civil society has been monitoring what the rest of the world is doing and suggesting how Bangladesh can play a more inter-active role within the paradigm of the evolving efforts envisioned in the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The urgency in this regard has grown because of the upcoming 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) that will be held in Katowice, Poland in the first two weeks of December this year. COP24 , according to environmentalists, is being considered as particularly important, because the concerned countries will expect to finalise the Rule Book for implementing the different Articles of the Paris Agreement. This will help efforts to measure, report and verify (MRV) each of the Articles of the Agreement. This aspect has led scientists to describe this meeting on factors related to Earth's biodiversity and impact of global warming as a pivotal meeting at a pivotal time. In this context, analysis will be undertaken to ascertain whether conservation of biodiversity as well as net forest loss has been properly ensured. SOLAR ENERGY: The Bangladesh government as well as all the relevant agencies have been attaching great importance not only to the above processes but also have taken pro-active steps to enhance our profile in the use of renewable energy in different forms throughout the country. This has been particularly true in the case of the rural regions. Solar power through the use of solar panels has now become part of the functional matrix in these areas. Solar panels are now being used in more than three million homes. This is facilitating students to continue their studies after evening. This is also helping families to watch television at different times and recharge mobile phones. We need to remember that there are nearly 100 million mobile phone users in rural areas. Lately, solar panels are being increasingly used for generating power for water pumps necessary for lifting underground water for the purpose of irrigation. Solar panels are also being used in villages to generate power to recharge conveyances that run on batteries. In addition there is growing awareness and use of bio-gas as bio-fuel in rural kitchens. These factors are contributing towards the country's socio-economic growth. It has persuaded the government to try and boost the use of solar power in the urban areas also. Measures are afoot to make contribution of solar energy more than 10 per cent of the total power generation capacity by 2021. The government has recently approved 19 on-grid solar power parks in the private sector. The Power Division has been helpful for completion of the necessary steps. However, they have pointed out that they and the private sector are facing one big challenge - acquiring land for solar power parks. A solar project with power generation capacity of 100 MW needs about 300 acres of land. Nevertheless, it is hoped that efficiency in generating solar power will increase in the future through new technological advances. WIND POWER: No discussion on use of renewable energy will be complete without reference to the potential use of wind power to generate energy. This is particularly true in the case of Bangladesh. A recent study carried out by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory has indicated that the coastal belt of Bangladesh holds wind power prospects. A comprehensive wind mapping exercise has demonstrated that the average wind flow in nine places is between 5.0 to 6.0 metres per second. This is good news for Bangladesh as, for commercial production, one needs wind speed of between 2.3 to 2.5 metres per second. A wind turbine consists of a tower, nacelle and rotor that carries the blades. The nacelle with the rotor is permanently aligned to face the wind. As with the wings of an aircraft, air flows past the blades. On the convex side it has to travel further, which creates low pressure; on the flat side of the blade, air does not have so far to travel, which causes the formation of high pressure. The rotor powers up and powers a generator, which produces electricity-similar to the bicycle dynamo principle. Electricity from onshore wind energy, according to German energy specialists, is nowadays one of the most affordable forms of renewable energy generation. The yields attainable in this respect, according to experts, however depend on - good energy sites, the impact of tower height and the size of rotors. Interestingly, it has also been revealed in the context of Norway, Sweden and Germany that doubling of the wind speed increases the energy contained in wind eight-fold. Another significant aspect is that with every meter of additional tower height, the yield increases by one per cent. The size of the rotors is also important. Apparently, according to German experts, doubling the rotor diameter, and consequently the usable area also increases the yield four times. Apparently, off-shore wind farms also offer great potential. This has been borne out through experiments and implementation in the North Sea near Sweden and Norway. The US study carried out on behalf of the Power Division has found that the coastal areas of Khulna, Barishal and Chattogram Divisions have more than 6.0 meters per second available wind speed at the 120 meter height - sufficient for generating electricity from wind turbines. It has also come out from the mapping survey that, for wind speeds of 5.75 to 7.75 m/s, there are more than 20,000 square kilometers of land with a gross wind potential of more than 30,000 MW. Some have termed this potential as unrealistic. However, economists and electrical engineers have observed that there is enough proven potential to suggest that with proper investment, Bangladesh can reach the 10 per cent renewable energy target by 2021. At present only three wind turbines with 3 MW capacities have been in operation for the last few years in coastal Kutubdia. However, because the centre point of the blades are only 18 meters above the ground, they are yet to run up to full capacity. The wind turbine in Feni, with the blades' centre point 50 meters above the ground has so far generated 588,334 kilowatt hours of electricity since resuming operations after repairs in April 2014. The Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) has formed a working committee. Steps are being undertaken to set up three towers to collect site-specific data in different coastal areas including Kuakata and Patuakhali. At the same time another Committee has been formed to conduct in-house feasibility study on the wind energy potential in Mongla and Chandpur based on the US report. It needs to be remembered that future steps in this regard will require public-private collaboration. We have to work together and try to gain from the experience of Germany, Canada, China and other countries from the Far East in this regard. We can then meet our goals by 2021.

Bangladesh, Dec. 13 -- At the ongoing COP24 : UN Climate Change Conference in Poland, countries like the USA, Saudi Arabia and Russia have refused to 'welcome' a landmark report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report recommended a deep cut in greenhouse gas emissions and a greater reliance on nuclear power, in order to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. To the disappointment of climate change negotiators at the summit, the three countries rather promoted the necessity of fossil fuels, unsettling hopes of rejuvenating the Paris climate pact. At the summit, Bangladesh and a number of other nations affected by climate change have called for formation of a guideline to implement the Paris Agreement, which was committed by 19 major economies except the US. Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a metropolitan area that is a lot warmer than the rural areas surrounding it. The heat is created by vehicle emissions, population density, greater number of buildings, blocked airways and lack of water bodies. On November 28, a workshop on "Mitigation Strategies for the Urban Microclimate of Dhaka Megacity to Reduce Adverse Climate Change Impacts" kicked off a year-long research project to be funded by the World Bank and conducted by Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS), Curtin University of Australia and Meteorology Department of Dhaka University. Through the project, researchers will monitor the temperature of roads, buildings and certain spots to identify critical areas and sort out mitigation and adaptation measures that can save the city before it affects the country. Speakers at the workshop had confirmed that the temperature in Dhaka is at least two to three degrees Celsius higher than rural areas of Bangladesh, attributing this to high-rise buildings, population density, increased use of air conditioners and wrong street orientation which is reducing evaporation. As a result, Dhaka is facing tell-tale UHI problems including enhanced survival rate of new vectors and germs. This is increasing occurrences of diseases like dengue, chikungunya, respiratory diseases and other infections. Alike human beings, animals and vegetation in UHIs are also badly affected. In order to address the problem, the present carbon emission rate needs to be cut down significantly. Speakers at the workshop also suggested proper implementation of the revised Detailed Area Plan (DAP) along with urban revitalisation and vegetation programme. They pointed out that reclamation of canals can prove to be beneficial in this regard as water flow can significantly control city temperature. It was hoped that the government can reclaim 42 out of the 52 canals of Dhaka. Civil society can raise the demand for reclamation of the canals. Concerned citizens of Dhaka can play their part towards saving their city by planting more trees thus making their own green zones in buildings and communities. In the global context, Bangladesh and other nations affected by climate change should continue to press larger economies towards implementing the Paris Agreement.

In number, the climate change conference would be 90 percent successful with regard to the Paris Rulebook. But only the technical issue or the Rulebook would not be enough as the climate change issue has become very important. Two reasons - market and transparency - would hinder achieving the target of limiting the global warming at 1.5 degree Celsius. Dr. Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), explained how the Katowice, Poland conference fell short of the expectation despite adopting the Paris Rulebook. In an exclusive interview with Energy and Power Editor Mollah Amzad Hossain, he also spoke about how the differences could be removed in the upcoming events. How would you evaluate the Paris Rulebook finally adopted in Katowice, Poland? Designing the rulebook was the main issue in the COP24 , aiming to establish different measurement reporting and verification (MRV) for implementation of different articles of the Paris Agreement like the issues of mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, financing and forestry. We have been successful in almost all the cases, barring one or two issues market and transparency that we had to postpone. In number, I would say we have been 90% successful with regard to the rulebook. However, I think, the climate change issue has become a very important issue in 2018, for which only the technical agreement or rulebook is not enough mainly because of the two reasons. First, the scientists showed clearly the dangers of limiting temperature at 1.5 degree Celsius in the IPCC special report. Apparently it seems that 0.5 degree difference from 2.0 degree target is not a very big deal. But it\' s not a small issue either. It\' s a big deal because at 2.0 degree the damages would be much higher than that of the 1.5 degree. Not only the poor countries, but also many rich countries would also be affected. So, it has become very important issue now to set the target at 1.5 degree. I think, it is difficult but possible to do. To achieve this target, dependence on fossil fuel should be reduced as soon as possible and convert those into 100% renewables. The deadline for doing this job is 2050. The companies having fossil fuel and the people having influence in the companies to control the governments includes US President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia. They are hesitating to accept the IPCC report, which has become a big concern as to whether we would accept the science or not. Some 193 countries want to accept the science and only these four countries rejected it. Finally, these four had made us all also to reject it. But I think it is a pyrrhic victory for them. If they had accepted it, it would have been adopted silently. The IPCC report has now become very important due to not accepting it. A huge hue and cry has been created attracting media attention due to not accepting the report while raising questions about what the report contains and why these few countries vented anger about it. So, in my view, they won the battle but lose the war. Now the report has been highly publicized globally which is a good thing. So, in that sense it was a victory. The second issue where we need to do a lot of works is to raise the level of ambition in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to face the climate change impacts as described in the IPCC report. We, around 100 vulnerable LDCs, Islands and Africans, have not been able to do it. The emission targets in the NDCs could have been kept even more in the early stages. Few countries have done it like the European Union that did much better, but could not be done it collectively. There is a big challenge in the COP process is decision making by consensus. If any one country raise objection, consensus cannot be reached. As these four countries raised objection in the COP24 , consensus could not be reached and finally we had to accept their demand. The decision making by consensus has reached its limit, it is not effective anymore. So, we now have to move forward with what is known as coalition of the willing. Those who want to avoid it, let them go. And, there is a way of doing this. The present UN Secretary General gave importance on it. Now it is in his court. He is calling a climate summit in New York in September 2019. That is his summit and he can do whatever he wants. The important issue here is that the country which is not interested in it can avoid it. Later, we could go back to consensus mood in the COP25. The main target is that we will remain in the consensus mood in the COP and, at the same time, we will move our job forward so that others cannot restrict our action-oriented works. The cost of renewable is not paying for the sun or for the wind it is paying for the technology to convert sun or wind energy to usable energy and storage technology. So, the cost of these three technologies is going down every day as we improve the technology. So, in time they will be cheaper then all fossil fuel. They are already cheaper than coal, they will than become cheaper than Petroleum, they will than become cheaper than natural gas and at that point nobody should invest in fossils anymore because it will not make any sense. The other important characteristic of the technology is that there is only capital cost upfront to buy it but after that it\' s just running and running for decades and you don\' t have to pay. So, once we have installed capacity of renewables, then effectively that become almost free over time once you amortize the cost of the capital. What do you think about the role Bangladesh played in the global negotiation at the COP24 ? I think the people who represent Bangladesh both from the government and private sector played an excellent role and the representatives from other countries respect us and heard us attentively. However, some criticisms come mainly from false sense of expectation. We did not go to bring something for Bangladesh. We are fighting for solution to a global problem. We are a poor and venerable country and, therefore, we have very little leverage. Within that leverage our voice is listened whether they pay heed to us, it\' s a different issue. Whatever we have to say, we do that. What do you think about the possible success of ensuring US$ 100 billion annually from 2020? It is an important issue because the rich countries did not meet their commitments in the past. Right now the amount is around $ 10 billion. Many expressed doubt about how the amount would be increased to that level or whether it would come at all. It is a very special problem. But, I think, we should look to our own capacity of whatever the funds are available. Climate financing is very different from development financing. In the climate change arena, the paradigm is deferent the polluters are paying the venerable countries which are the victim of pollution. The money is not being given to particular countries, but it is on a competitive basis. So, we have to learn to compete and give good projects that are genuine climate change related projects, not just development projects. So, we are learning, but not there yet. This is an opportunity for Bangladesh to improve the capacity as rapidly as possible to be better to accessing the climate finance. We are beginning to make some breakthrough particularly in green climate fund. But we have to learn how to play the game faster. The analogy I use, the development finance is like a game of soccer. So, just because we know how to play soccer does not mean we know how to play cricket. Climate finance is like the cricket, it\' s a complicated game. Recently the civil society organizations viewed that Bangladesh\' s interests have not been addressed in the Paris Rulebook. What do you say? This is a misunderstanding as the process is not for Bangladesh. So, judging the process by what is happened for Bangladesh does not make any sense. Bangladesh is one of the vulnerable countries. It requires give and take \- you have to give something to get something. So, from everybody\' s point of view, it\' s unsatisfactory. China and India are among the three top polluter countries, but they are not indexed. What role the two countries should play in limiting the warming target at 1.5 degree Celsius? I think the mindsets of both the countries have changed a lot \- earlier they stood against the rich countries arguing that they first polluted the environment. Now they have changed the mindsets and now taking the responsibilities of reducing the emission as well as going for renewable. They now consider that it would be good for their countries too. Delhi and Beijing are the most polluted city in the world. So there are co-benefit of going green and investing in renewable at the national level for India and China. So, both the countries are now becoming leader in the post fossil fuel renewable energy world. They are investing heavily in both solar and wind, also in electric vehicle. China is the biggest investor in renewable world and India is another one going that direction. So, the tide is turning in terms of investing in renewable. We have not even touched wind yet. So, if we start and learn it overtime, the wind potential is very much significant in Bangladesh, especially in coastal areas, and now it is the cheapest technology anywhere of the world, especially the new technology of wind turbines in offshore. Bangladesh has started working on ensuring efficient use of energy under a roadmap with a special priority to industrial sector. It is estimated that 20 percent energy could be saved by 2021. How do you evaluate this initiative? There is a lot of scope to improve efficiency in the use of energy in the industrial and commercial sector of Bangladesh if we can introduce a good lending instrument like the one IDCOL brought in, contributing a lot to make the solar home system successful. Similar type of lending mechanism would also work in improving efficiency if there is technical support too. The country\' s fossil-fuel dependence will remain 80 percent in accordance with the power sector plan up to 2041. What do you suggest to come out of the situation? I think, Bangladesh should think more about the long-term plan because short-term projections are made based on present situation. But we could leapfrog in case of long-term planning like the case of telephone. If we had done business as usual projections with landlines, then Bangladesh would have got coverage in 100 years. But now we have got 100% coverage through mobile phones. So energy sector has that potential for leapfrogging and we have to be alert about opportunities to leapfrog. We are projecting as if nothing will change, but the things will change. The biggest change that I see happening is that coal is going to become dominant. Anybody investing in coal is making a bad investment for the long term. It might look good in the short term. Coal is the past, not the future. Other fossil fuels have different characteristics and longevity based on economic situation of the country whether you are importing or you have the national resources. In my personal opinion, coal definitely is now reaching the point where it is not a good investment. What do you expect about the environment or climate change from the new government of Bangladesh? I think Bangladesh has the possibility to become a global player in cases of SDGs or Paris Agreement in the next 12 years to 2030. If we can invest in hydropower projects in Nepal and Bhutan and bring it to the country, all the BBIN countries would be benefited. Bangladesh will be the biggest beneficiary, but every country will be the beneficiary. We have even got the agreement on paper with the partners, but in practice we have not been able to move it forward. If we can implement it in next 10 years, it will make a great change. As I work with the LDCs and climate change, I can say they are looking to Bangladesh to be a leader for them. Because one of the aspirations is that all the LDCs is to graduate from being a LDC. Nobody wants to be a LDC forever. Bangladesh is on the path to graduation. We should not forget our comrades in the LDC group. We should extend the hand of friendship and cooperation to help them graduate. We can become the helper of others as we are no longer just a beggar. So, this will be a significant change of Bangladesh in global position. Bangladesh will be recognized as a leader, we will be recognized as somebody to learn form and this is a big opportunity for us. I think new government will take this seriously. \</doc>

For the ninth year running, ministers met at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue for an informal exchange of views on issues relating to international climate diplomacy. In preparation for the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the UNFCCC, ministers discussed enhancing climate action, strengthening international cooperation and shaping a just transition. Taking place from 18-19 June 2018, the Petersberg Climate Dialogue saw 35 ministers travel to Berlin, Germany, upon invitation of Svenja Schulze, Germany\' s Federal Minister of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, HenrykKowalczyk, Poland\' s Minister of Environment, and the incoming COP 24 President Michal Kurtyka. The Dialogue gathered ministers, country representatives and other high-level attendees, including UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa and the Co-Chairs of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SBs), taking place immediately prior to the second Ministerial on Climate Action (MoCA) which convened in Brussels, Belgium, from 2021 June 2018. The meeting produced a CoChairs\' conclusions document, providing a summary of the discussions that took place over the two days. \</doc>

Displacement Solutions published a ground-breaking report on "climate displacement in Bangladesh. This 36-page report comprehensively examines the scope and causes of climate displacement across Bangladesh. Drawing on extensive fieldwork, the report highlights that climate displacement is not just a phenomenon to be addressed at some point in the future, it is a crisis that is unfolding across Bangladesh now. Sea-level rise and tropical cyclones in coastal areas, as well as flooding and riverbank erosion in mainland areas, are already resulting in the loss of homes, land and property and leading to mass displacement. Further, all of the natural hazards that are causing displacement are expected to increase in both frequency and intensity as a result of climate change - almost inevitably leading to the displacement of many millions more across Bangladesh. This report comprehensively examines current and future causes of climate displacement in Bangladesh. The report also examines existing and proposed Government and civil society policies and programmes intended to provide solutions to climate displacement. The report highlights a number of protection gaps in the response of both the Government of Bangladesh and the international community to the plight of climate displaced persons. The report emphasizes that rights-based solutions, in particular, housing, land and property rights solutions must be utilised as the basis for solving this crisis. The report concludes by proposing a number of concrete recommendations that could be utilized to provide solutions to climate displacement." The situation in Bangladesh reveals that the problem of climate displacement is a present. one signaling future uncertainties. The government of Bangladesh and that of other poor countries have been urged upon to take heed of the climate displacement nightmare unfolding to add to humanitarian crisis. All national governments have been directed to make best use of the funds that may be placed at their disposals. Local bureaucracies and other implementing agencies must be sensitized to make best use of the fund keeping an arm's length from fuzzy governance. The effects of climate change may cause large-scale human displacement.. The global project intervention t must address the problem of climate change displacement. The focus of th global project intervention is contained in a proposal for a convention for climate change displaced persons (CCDPs). The convention would establish an international regime for the provision of pre-emptive, adaptive assistance to those likely to be displaced by the devastation caused by climate change. The green climate fund is intended to help climate vulnerable countries to fight out global warming. Launched at a UN climate conference at Durban, in December 2011 the green fund is to 'channel up Dollar 100 billion a year by 2020 in aid of poor, vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change and cut emissions. Earmarking funds from the recently agreed green climate fund(GCF) of the Durban climate meet (2011) has happened to be 'one concrete means by which the international community could ensure that the displaced people in Bangladesh receives their fair share of the funds required to deal with the consequence of climate change' The United Nations Climate Change Conference The Chief US negotiator Todd Stern said: 'Obviously the package is not going to solve climate change by itself, but I think it is a big step forward.' 'In a key area, the agreement set up a 'Green Climate Fund' to administer assistance to poor nations, which many experts say are already suffering more floods and drought as temperatures steadily mount'. 'The green climate fund is intended to raise and disburse dollar 100 a year by 2020 to protect poor nations against climate impacts and assist them with low carbon development.' Worst victims in Bangladesh are expected to get formal support from major players in the climate negotiations Bangladesh, which tops a Global Climate Risk Index published during the Copenhagen talks, strongly backs an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, as the only existing binding instrument on emission cuts, rather than creation of an entirely new climate deal. Bangladesh is also urging rich nations to contribute at least US$100 billion for a global fund to help poor nations adapt to climate change. Britain, meanwhile, is the first country to contribute 75 million pounds for creation of Bangladesh's own multi-donor trust fund for climate change adaptation. The small island states have threatened to boycott the conference. These states including African union have been organized into three alliances each expressing common views about limiting temperature to not more than one degree Celsius. They demanded compensation package for the victims. Human rights activists in various countries demanded climate justice and fair deal, heavy compensation package even immigration of the climate displaced people from poor and vulnerable countries. The situation in Bangladesh reveals that the problem of climate displacement is a present one signaling future uncertainties. The government of Bangladesh and that of other poor countries have been urged upon to take heed of the climate displacement nightmare unfolding to add to humanitarian crisis. Bangladesh is a country badly affected by natural calamities caused by climate change. Flood is an annual affair. Tornado with tidal surge wreck havoc in coastal areas rendering much shelter less. The islanders have had nightmarish experiences about Aila and Sidre and mahasen that recently hit South and Eastern Bangladesh. The situation in Bangladesh reveals that the problem of climate displacement is a present one signaling future uncertainties. The government of Bangladesh and that of other poor countries have been urged upon to take heed of the climate displacement nightmare unfolding to add to humanitarian crisis. All national governments have been directed to make best use of the funds that may be placed at their disposals. Local bureaucracies as implementing agencies must be sensitized to make best use of the fund keeping an arm's length from fuzzy governance.

Europe can decarbonise its economy, while still creating jobs and growth, as long as its member states increase investments in energy research and renewable energy technology.  We need climate-positive solutions to reach the Paris Agreement. European leadership is critical if we are to preserve our planet and ecosystems, says Nils Rokke, the Chairman of the Board of the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) and EVP Sustainability, SINTEF, at COP 24 in Poland.  The best way to realize the necessary solutions is to link national funding to EU programs, spend existing research funding more wisely and ensure that the public and private sector partner. This will incentivise and accelerate climatefriendly and market-worthy businesses and ideas. Representing more than 50,000 researchers in Europe, Rokke calls for quickly bringing pilot projects to market, and that we should be optimistic for the necessary change.  There are technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage that need a full-scale demonstration plant to make it a reality. Pioneering projects like this absolutely rely on support from government and research institutions. We need more solutions that are sustainable, effective and realistic by 2030, says Rokke. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 24 -- Following the nearly two week-long UN Climate Change Conference COP24 held at Katowice, Poland on December 02-15, prospects of any significant progress in coming up with the 2015 Paris Agreement "rulebook" do not seem very bright although some deliberations took place on the issue. Though the loggerheads between different developed nations and developing ones had frustrated many environmentalists during the conference, a number of positive developments had also shone light at the end of the tunnel. One such initiative is the ActNow.Bot, a social media chatbot launched on December 03 by Sir David Attenborough during the conference. A chatbot is a computer programme designed to simulate conversation with human users over the internet. ActNow.Bot uses the Facebook messenger platform to speak with users based anywhere across the world, about the ways through which they can take personal action that will contribute in the global fight against climate change. If any user opens the chatbot, it takes him or her to a chatbox where the user is given the following message, "you have the power to tackle climate change. Small changes can make a big difference if we all work together. The United Nations has identified 10 key actions that you can take in your daily life and record here. Our collective actions from around the globe will be presented to world leaders at the UN Climate Summit in September 2019." The 10 key actions that the user can select from include 'Meat free meals', 'Lights off', 'Drive Less', 'Energy-saving lightbulbs', 'Refill and reuse', '5-minute showers', 'Local produce', 'Build your own bag', 'Unplug' and 'Recycle'. Under each action, there are two options: 'Act Now' and 'Tell me more'. The second option provides users with a two-to-three-line brief about the action. For example, the brief for 'Meat free meals' says: "Meat production and distribution has a detrimental impact on greenhouse gas emissions. We need to start shifting towards more plant-based diets." When a user clicks on 'Act Now', it registers the personal commitment by the user to carry out the said action. While launching the bot, Attenborough had said that the chatbot will help "people to discover simple everyday actions that they can take, because they recognise that they too must play their part" against climate change. Till date, the bot has registered 60,000 actions by users from across the world. Once the action is completed by the user in real life, he or she can register it as 'complete' by clicking on a similar option in the bot. Facebook messenger as the platform for this chatbot is a phenomenal selection as it had around 1.3 billion active users as of September 2017. The number is expected to reach 2.48 billion by end of 2021. At this time, the campaign is available to users in English, Spanish and French. In order to make the bot more successful by reaching more users, the developers can include other languages like Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sinhalese, Swahili and more; especially the languages of those countries that are most affected by climate change. Similar initiatives where the power of social media and the internet can be harnessed to increase global public awareness about pressing issues and how to tackle them should be forthcoming. After all, a significant portion of social media users is the youth, who will be inheriting this earth along with its problems in the near future.

The levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the main driver of climate change, have hit a new record high, the UN said recently, warning that the time to act was running out. Ahead of the COP 24 climate summit in Poland next month, top United Nations officials are again trying to raise the pressure on governments to meet the pledge of limiting warming to the less than two degrees Celsius, enshrined in the 2015 Paris accord. "Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth," the head of the World Meteorological Organization PetteriTaalas said in a statement. "The window of opportunity for action is almost closed." In an open letter to all states ahead of COP24 , UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned of cataclysmic consequences if the world does not reverse course. "Entire nations, ecosystems, peoples and ways of life could simply cease to exist," she said, citing evidence that nations are not on track to meet the commitments made in Paris. US President Donald Trump, who pulled his government out of the Paris agreement, again recently appeared to cast doubt on. \</doc>

Bangladesh is the seventh most affected country in the world due to 'extreme weather events' over the last 20 years from 1998 -2017, says a new global report. The other top nine affected countries are Puerto Rico (1), Honduras (2), Myanmar (3), Haiti (4), the Philippines (5), Nicaragua (6), Pakistan (8), Vietnam (9) and Dominica (10), according to Global Climate Risk Index 2019 released in Poland on Wednesday. Of the 10 most affected countries and territories (1998-2017), eight were developing countries in the low-income or lower-middle income country group, one was classified as an upper-middle income country (Dominica) and one an advanced economy generating high income (Puerto Rico). Bangladesh's climate risk ranking is 9th in 2017 against 13th position in 2016. The report says massive rainfalls have led to floods across Nepal, Bangladesh and India, which affected more than 40 million people. Some 1 200 people lost their lives in these three countries and millions were displaced throughout the region. The floods spread across the foothills of the Himalayas and brought landslides leaving tens of thousands of houses and vast areas of farmland and roads destroyed. Nepal experienced flashfloods and landslides in August across the southern border, amounting to US$ 600 million in damages. Nearly 250 people were killed by collapsed buildings or drowning in regions of India, Nepal and Bangladesh. 950, 000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the floods. Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka and Dominica were at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2017. Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar were the countries most affected by extreme weather events. Altogether, more than 526 000 people died as a direct result of more than 11 500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around US$ 3.47 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities). Storms and their direct implications - precipitation, floods and landslides - were one major cause of damage in 2017. Of the ten most affected countries in 2017, four were hit by tropical cyclones. Recent science has found a clear link between climate change and record-breaking precipitation of 2017's hurricanes. It also suggests that the number of severe tropical cyclones will increase with every tenth of a degree in global average temperature rise. In many cases, single exceptional disasters have such a strong impact that the countries and territories concerned are also ranked high in the long-term index. Over the last few years another category of countries has been gaining relevance - countries like Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. The Climate Summit in Katowice should adopt the 'rulebook' needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal and adaptation communication guidelines, said the report. Furthermore, COP24 must increase efforts to properly address loss and damage, which appears as a cross-cutting issue referenced throughout various negotiation streams, with significant risk of being omitted from final negotiation text, reads the report. The risks of future climate-related losses and damages are far too severe to simply function as a negotiation chip. The Global Climate Risk Index 2019 analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.). The most recent data available - for 2017 and from 1998 to 2017 - were taken into account. The countries and territories affected most in 2017 were Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka as well as Dominica. For the period from 1998 to 2017 Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar rank highest. This year's 14th edition of the analysis reconfirms earlier results of the Climate Risk Index: less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialised countries. Regarding future climate change, the Climate Risk Index may serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change. \</doc>

Dhaka, Jan. 20 -- 2018 was a big year for climate change. The release of the groundbreaking IPCC report last October sent jolts throughout policy circles and civil society, confronting us with the latest scientific information on the widespread impacts to the planet if we failed to drastically cut CO2 emissions. And the European Commission committed to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, a major step forward and a first on the global level. Public concern of the climate situation grew throughout 2018, as Europe's summer temperatures broke records, and wildfires ravaged California. The fall and winter months followed with climate marches taking place across Europe, gathering tens of thousands of citizens demanding loud and clear much stronger, quicker, climate ambition. This growing public momentum was palpable at last month's COP. Embodying this impetus, 15-year old Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg memorably called out the passivity of global leaders, warning them that: "Change is coming", whether they are part of it or not. Another 2018 trend that gives some reason for optimism has been the greater involvement of the private sector, with several companies and private sector coalitions taking active steps to reduce their carbon footprint. Danish shipping industry giant Maersk for example committed last month to having carbon neutral vessels by 2030. Over 500 companies, including Ikea and Unilever, have committed to align their greenhouse gas emissions with the Paris Agreement targets. These commitments have been helped by the decreasing costs of solar and wind, and other renewables technologies. And from a policy perspective the year culminated in the release of the European Commission's long-term climate plan in November, which laid out several scenarios to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The European Commission will unveil its long-awaited strategy for a "climate-neutral Europe" later on Wednesday (28 November), in an effort to show EU countries how to stick to the goals of the Paris Agreement. The commitment of achieving net-zero emissions was a first for climate action within the global community. The strategy rightfully espoused the massive benefits of reaching this target, ranging from the euro 170bn estimated savings in health cost, to the euro 2-3 trillion which could be saved in fossil fuel imports. While this policy impetus in Brussels did not translate into greater ambition from the global community at last month's UN Climate Change Conference COP24 , seeds of hope were nevertheless planted to make 2019 a potentially good year in the fight against climate change. But to make 2019 a successful climate year, EU member states will have to take on board the lessons learned in 2018. While there is a growing recognition of the need for climate action, last year taught us that for a sustainable long-term energy transition to be effective, the roadmap to get there needs to be inclusive and citizen-driven. The 'gilets jaunes' movement that has been rocking France for the last couple of months has reminded us that policy actions need to be supported by a continuous conversation with citizens, and a regular evaluation of the possible effects of said policy on the different sections of society. This will be particularly important in light of the necessary phase-out of coal power, which will affect mining communities across Europe. Protests against high fuel prices in France have propelled climate policy to the forefront of the political debate, just days before Poland hosts the UN's annual conference on climate change, with a focus on the "just transition" to low-carbon energy. The year 2019 will provide member states with important opportunities for such citizen-inclusive climate action and "just transition". Over the course of 2019, member states will be finalising their final national energy and climate plans (NECPs), but they also need in parallel to produce their national long-term strategy. Both should align with the EU's long-term climate strategy target of net-zero emissions by 2050. In this process, it is required of national governments to "ensure that the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in and to be consulted on the long term climate plan and the short-term preparation of the integrated national energy and climate plans".

Dhaka, Dec. 24 -- Agan Soyan Hassan and her six children lost everything, including their home and livestock as flood waters engulfed their village of Ranranle in south-east Ethiopia. Wading through water for four grueling hours, they reached higher ground with a mere plastic sheet for shelter. To feed her family, Hassan and her children had to depend on relatives and neighbors for their survival. This family is not the only one to have suffered such a fate. Climate variability and extremes are pushing millions of people into severe food insecurity. This year, the world has again watched extreme weather tear apart communities across the globe. These impacts used to be viewed as a threat to future generations. No longer. Climate change is super-charging droughts, heat waves, floods, and wildfires that are destroying lives, property, and livelihoods. Crucially for those of us working in development and humanitarian aid, climate change is piling stresses on small-scale agriculture, serving to exacerbate hunger around the world. The latest report on the global state of food security finds that hunger is on the rise, with the number of undernourished people increasing to nearly 821 million in 2017, returning to levels from a decade ago. Alongside conflict and economic slowdown, the report attributes this rise to extreme climate events. The frequency of these events has been rising and will continue to do so as global warming continues. The number of extreme weather events has more than doubled since the early 1990s, with an average of 213 occurring each year in the past decade. Those most vulnerable to climate-related hazards are the world's 2.5 billion small-scale farmers, herders, fishers, and forest-dependent communities. They often lack the resources to rebound from extreme events that can cause a total loss of livelihood assets, while also facing more insidious challenges: gradually changing and more erratic weather patterns that reduce crop yields, increase the risk of harvest failure and food price swings, and make it more difficult for people to meet their food needs for the entire year. Each degree of warming matters. In October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its landmark report on the impacts of 1.5 degree Celsius of warming, as opposed to the 2 degree Celsius limit that forms the basis of the Paris climate agreement. It is unequivocal. The IPCC report finds that "overall, food security is expected to be reduced at 2degC of global warming compared to 1.5degC, owing to projected impacts of climate change and extreme weather on yields, crop nutrient content, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture and land use." Harvests of maize and wheat will be lower with temperature increases between 1 degree Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius, as well. For example, global maize production is projected to fall by 10 percent with a warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius, and 15 percent with a warming of 2.0 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages. Two degrees of temperature rise could push an additional 189 million people into food insecurity. Four degrees warmer could increase that number to 1.8 billion. As humanitarians, our efforts need to focus on the protection of the most vulnerable. Even if we were to stop producing greenhouse gas emissions tomorrow, the inertia in the climate system guarantees that we remain burdened with decades of negative impacts. We need to help governments and vulnerable communities prepare for less predictable weather and more frequent extreme events while strengthening the resilience of those most at risk. In parallel to strengthening our ability to absorb unavoidable shocks through humanitarian assistance, we need to capitalize on our skills in risk monitoring and early warning to act before people are plunged into a food crisis. We can provide information to governments, farmers and vulnerable communities that allow them to plan ahead, reduce crop losses and use a better understanding of the climate system to inform policies, planning and investment decisions. Building on this, we can ensure that complementary structures and mechanisms are available to cover the most catastrophic risks - such as weather-index insurance, forecast-based financing, and shock-responsive social protection systems. Climate change will, without a doubt, continue to place additional pressures on global food security and development. We can and must apply our humanitarian principles, skill sets, and experience to protect the world's most vulnerable from its impacts. What humanitarian actors require on this journey are predictable, long-term investments that can accompany our humanitarian programs with a complementary effort in risk reduction, risk transfer, and forecast-based early action. Without such a twin-track approach, there is little chance that the world can achieve zero hunger by 2030. Echoing the words of Sir David Attenborough from his recent address at COP24 , we are facing "our greatest threat in thousands of years." Climate change is no longer a vague future concern. For many communities from the Americas to Africa to Asia, it is already a grim reality. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa stressed the importance of a successful outcome from the 21st meeting of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Board, outlining the effects that the meeting will have on the outcome of the UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018. Espinosa made the statement ahead of the Board meeting, which convened from 17-20 October 2018, in Manama, Bahrain. Recalling her tenure as President of the 16th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 16) to the UNFCCC, in Cancun, Mexico, during which the GCF was established, she highlighted GCF\' s critical role in helping developing countries shift to low-emission and climate-resilient pathways. Proper financing can help advance the SDGs by addressing such issues as poverty, migration and equality. Espinosa explained that the climate regime is entering  one of its most crucial and defining periods, as COP 24 is expected to finalize implementation guidelines for the Paris Agreement on climate change. She said the GCF Board meeting will affect negotiations on the Paris Agreement work program (PAWA), stressing that a successful meeting will send a  clear and unmistakable message of trust to developing countries so they can have confidence in the finance process. She said proper financing also can help advance the SDGs by addressing such issues as poverty, migration and equality, and added that climate finance is not only about money, but also about helping those impacted by climate change, reducing their suffering and saving lives. The Executive Secretary highlighted three challenges facing the GCF. First, she said existing policy gaps must be addressed, including the lack of a regulatory framework enabling a proper assessment of projects so that projects can be prioritized for funding. Second, she cautioned that implementation of approved GCF projects is too slow. She explained that, as of April 2018, only 26 of the 76 approved projects were being implemented, and only US$158 million had been disbursed, which represents 13% of the total value of projects under implementation and 4% of total GCF funding. Third, she said the GCF must  learn from its experience and anticipate future requirements by assessing whether its policies have resulted in the desired outcomes, and to what extent they are aligned with the scale and pace required for successful implementation of the Paris Agreement. \</doc>

India showed huge courage to accept bold commitment to address the problem of climate change, probably beyond its means. India\' s INDC include reduction in the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree-cover by 2030. India\' s INDC also builds on its goal of installing 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power capacity (100GW from solar alone) by 2022 by setting a new target to increase its share of non-fossil-based power capacity from 30 percent today to about 40 percent by 2030 (with the help of international support). But even before the Paris Agreement, India adopted the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission which is an initiative of the government of India with active participation of the state governments to promote solar power in order to address the issues of climate change and energy security. The mission is one of several such initiatives that are part of the National Action Plan on Climate Change. The mission was launched by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on 11 January 2010 with a target of 20GW of generation capacity by 2022 which was later increased to 100 GW of generation capacity by the NarendraModi government in 2015. Given this, increasing the share of non-fossil fuel from 30 percent today to 40 percent by 2030 does not seem to be ambitious. But nobody is complaining as the 2022 target is extremely ambitious, given that the world\' s entire installed solar power capacity was 181 GW in 2014. India increased its solar power generation capacity by nearly 5 times from 2,650 MW on 26 May 2014 to 12,288.83 MW on 31 March 2017. The country added 5,525.98 MW in the year 2016-17 alone, the highest of any year. While the 100GW is a high target by any standard, the achievement of 201617 has raised the hope that the target is achievable. The Indian target of 100GW of solar installed capacity in 2022 may not be achieved, but what India has achieved was unimaginable even a couple of years ago. Solar power generation cost in India is now competitive with cost of coal-based power generation. In terms of cost of generation, at Rs 2.44 (without storage), solar power is now competing with coal-based power and many stakeholders feel that days of coal-based power are numbered. This is a transformative change as even a few years back nobody could imagine that solar power will be able to compete with coal in near future. But this success can also bring with it some challenges. India is already surplus in electricity which is predominantly coal-based. However, creation of solar capacity would also mean that it will still need coal-based power to deal with its peak-demand that occurs at night when solar power is not available. This is likely as solar capacity is going up but no progress is seen in creation of storage capacity. Once capacity is created, solar power capacity can be offered at very low cost if the market is competitive as the variable cost of solar power generation is very low.Solar operates at a nominal cost as no fuel cost is involved and maintenance cost is the only operational cost. To boost electricity demand as well as reducing emission intensity of the transport sector and reduce local pollution, India is emphasising on electric mobility. While this will not reduce emission intensity of the transportation as long as the electric grid remains coal dependent, it will make the transport sector ready for emission reduction as and when the grid is able to reduce its coal dependence. While it is not very clear as to how the demand peak will be impacted due to adoption of electric vehicles, in the absence of public charging facilities, charging load may also peak at night, at least in the short run. This might make India\' s peak demand even higher, which in the absence of storage capacity will make India\' s grid management particularly difficult. Much before India could think of a major initiative for solar power, it was wind power that generated the renewable energy hope in India. The Indian wind energy sector has an installed capacity of 32,380.18 MW (as on March 31, 2017). Currently, India is a major player in the global wind energy market, and it is ranked 5th in the world, in terms of installed capacity. The government has set a target of 60MW generation capacity by 2022. Considering the past achievements, reaching this target seems to be easier than reaching the solar target. Moreover, the levelized tariff of wind power reached a record low of 2.43 (3.7\£2 US) per kWh (without any direct or indirect subsidies) during auctions for wind projects in December 2017. Even a few months back, there was a feeling that wind power may not be able to compete with solar power, and hence, might take a backseat in India\' s quest for renewable energy. But this has given a new hope that wind power is here to stay. Overall, the achievements in wind power may be considered to have made transformative impacts. While wind power does not regularity in variability in the sense that air will flow necessarily more at night or something like that, further adoption of wind power will add to variability. While coal has been providing the base load of the power sector in India, in the changed scenario, the base load might have come from renewable and coalbased power might require adjusting to the situation. But a huge disruption in the power market of India can be expected. Since the variable cost of solar and wind power is low, they might undercut price when the supply is more which is expected to be in day time. So if the neighboring countries are prepared to buy power from India during day time, they can buy at substantial discount. Undoubtedly, what they buy might partly come from coal power but it will also encourage India to investment more in renewable which might make the regional power mix less emission intensive. The high cost of the storage system, mostly to be a battery-based setup, would raise the solar electricity cost to the consumer say to Rs 10 per kwh. In such a case, coal-fired power plants will be more competitive with the green-energy. This will push India's coal-plant electricity to compete with solar during the off-peak period in the day, say, at Re 1.But as the night sets in, it would raise prices to as high as Rs 10, as solar without storage would no longer be in competition, or with storage system be offered at around Rs 10. Comparatively, coal-fired power plants cost is Rs 2 and above and it faces rising coal prices as well as environmental issues. India's coal-fired plants also lack the flexibility of shutting during the off-peak period.They are old and designed to operate 24/7, which compels the operators to run at full capacity and compete on prices in marketplace. While some flexibilization has already taken place, building a coal-fired plant with flexibility to shut and restart will take a long time, and it is an option not in line with the Indian governments green energy and enhancing environment programs. Solar electricity exports to neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, where gas fired plants have the flexibility of shutting down during off-peak period and restarting during the peak demand.Bangladesh could take Indian solar electricity at prices much lower than their gas-fired generation cost as it continues to face gas shortage and its volatile prices.Pakistan, also facing a huge shortage of electricity, is another export market. Another way of managing such mismatch in demand and supply as India is facing could be pump storage hydropower. As of now, hydropower plays an important role in energy cooperation, particularly in the context of IndiaBhutan energy cooperation. There is also huge potential for energy cooperation between India and Nepal based on hydropower. However, in the changed scenario, India might not have much appetite for hydropower coming from the neighboring countries during day time. However, if it comes at night, India might be willing to pay a premium. Hence, it would be important for Nepal and Bhutan to take note of this, and it will be highly profitable for them if they plan the upcoming hydropower plants as pump storage plants so that they would be able to provide more at night and less during day time. India is also taking a lead in taking the promotion of solar energy further globally through the International Solar Alliance. The alliance is a treaty-based inter-governmental organization that has been joined by 121 countries. Most of these countries are sunshine countries, which lie either completely or partly between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Countries that do not fall within this geographical region can also join the alliance and enjoy all benefits as other members, with the exception of voting rights. The primary objective of the alliance is to work for efficient harnessing of solar energy. This initiative was first proposed by Indian Prime Minister in a speech in November 2015, and was also launched by the Indian Prime Minister at the India Africa Summit, and a meeting of member countries ahead of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in November 2015. The framework agreement of the Alliance opened for signatures in Marrakech, Morocco in November 2016. More than half of the 121 have already signed the framework agreement and nearly half of them also ratified it. The Alliance is a testimony to the fact that developing countries are committed to fighting climate change with utmost sincerity. The entire Latin America and Caribbean region countries fall within the geographical boundary and hence can join the Alliance. Many of them have already joined it. The headquarters of the Alliance being located in India, this initiative provides an excelled platform for closer cooperation between India and South Asian countries that have good solar power potential. Irrespective of all other measures to deal with demand-supply gap in the power sector in India, the importance of energy storage is only going to increase. Emphasis on electric mobility will further add to the demand for storage in India. Bangladesh has significant capability in this sector. Hence, if it can move towards adoption of latest technologies in the field, it can benefit hugely from the potential surge of batteries in India. Overall, the surge in renewable generation in India has great potential to promote energy cooperation, increase interdependence among the countries, creation of more renewable capacity in the region and reduce overall emission in the South Asian region and hence can create win-win situation for all. \</doc>

Dhaka, Dec. 18 -- How will our children and grandchildren, looking back on this period in history, judge our response to climate change, the defining challenge of our time? Will they consider us ignorant of the threat despite all the evidence or just technologically ill-equipped to meet it? Or will they look back from a future where our economy has been transformed and the climate stabilised, and instead express bafflement that our political institutions and representatives were so unequal to the task at hand? To us, as climate scientists, it is baffling and frustrating that after decades of warnings, growing evidence, and concrete proposals for addressing greenhouse gas emissions, government policy still lags far behind what is necessary to avert potentially catastrophic global warming. In October, the landmark 1.5degC report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - which we both contributed to - summarised everything the scientific community knows about how climate change is affecting our world. Warming beyond 1.5C will unleash a frightening set of consequences and only a global transformation, beginning now, will avoid it, according to the latest report from scientists at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But even as the report was being read and digested, the real world impacts of climate change were impossible to ignore. Europe battled with the aftermath of a summer of intense heatwaves that caused massive crop failures and deadly wildfires across the continent. Scientists found the heatwaves were made at least twice as likely in some places by climate change. On the other side of the world, China, too, was scorched by heat this summer and battered by flooding. Such extreme weather events will only become more common, with parts of the country potentially becoming uninhabitable by the end of the century, as well as facing hundreds of billions of dollars of costs from flooding well before then. Once rare extreme events like the 2017 record heatwaves in central and eastern China are now one-in-five-year events due to climate change. The IPCC 1.5degC report made it clear that in the fight against climate change, every fraction of a degree matters. A world that is 2degC warmer is very, very different to a 1.5degC world. It would see more violent heatwaves and extreme weather events, worse droughts and more sea level rise. Fortunately, we not only have the knowledge but we also have the means to meet the challenge. The IPCC's 1.5degC report was clear that the solutions to hold global temperatures to this level do exist. There is no doubt that the scale, ambition and speed of the emissions reductions necessary are challenging. But there is also no doubt that we have the technological answers - at hand, at scale and, in many cases, at comparable costs to their carbon-intensive equivalents. Just last week the global shipping company Maersk made an ambitious leap to side itself with ambitious technology and declare that it will be carbon neutral by 2030. Their bold move should serve as an example to our political leaders. The challenge is not so much one of technological difficulties, but of will. There is clearly growing public concern about the implications of a changing climate - a recent survey found that large majorities of people in Europe and China are concerned or alarmed about climate change. We know that millions of people are already channelling this concern into action in their own lives, but it is also clear that governments and decision-makers must step up. They should be leading the way and inspire further action from businesses, investors, cities and regions. Particularly striking is the emergence of the 'Generation Anthropocene', with many young people eager to dedicate their skills to deploy solutions now. At the ongoing COP24 climate conference in Poland, one of the strongest voices holding governments into account has been 15-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who previously made headlines by going on school strike to protest against climate inaction. The climate talks in Poland present an opportunity for the EU and China to come together to provide global leadership on this crucial question. We welcome the vision presented by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, for the bloc to cut its emissions to net-zero by 2050. This should represent the minimum ambition for all countries, including China. Indeed, a similar target from the Chinese government would be extremely beneficial to the country's transitioning economy. First, it would provide an additional imperative to reform the economy into something more modern and sustainable. Second, it would be a tool to help realise the government's grand concept of 'ecological civilisation', which aims to increase quality of life and restore a better balance between human needs and natural resources. And, lastly, a more ambitious climate target for the country would result in $534 billion in health savings in 2030, nearly 60% more than if China met its existing pledges under the Paris Agreement, according to MIT. Importantly, the IPCC 1.5degC report describes how an ethical, fair and just transition to a low-carbon economy can be achieved: by paying specific attention to those most vulnerable to climate change and to climate policies, including those facing energy poverty and workers in carbon intensive sectors. The scientific, economic and social arguments for aggressive action on climate change are powerful. It is now incumbent on our political leaders to turn the advice we in the scientific community have been providing them into the concrete action the public is demanding. We are at a fork in the road as our governments mull what action to take, and as our children and grandchildren watch on, willing us to take the right path.

Dhaka, Nov. 25 -- Global negotiations seeking to implement the Paris agreement have been captured by corporate interests and are being undermined by powerful forces that benefit from exacerbating climate change, according to a report released ahead of the second meeting of parties to the Paris agreement. The report, co-authored by Corporate Accountability, uncovers a litany of ways in which fossil fuel companies have gained high-level access to negotiations and manipulated outcomes. It also questions the role of the world's biggest polluters in sponsoring the meetings in return for access to high-level events. The global partnership Climate Transparency, found 82% of energy in these countries still being provided by coal, oil and gas, a factor which has relied on an increase of about 50% in subsidies over the past 10 years to compete with increasingly cheap wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. The G20 nations spent $147bn (&#38;#163;114bn) on subsidies in 2016, although they pledged to phase them out more than 10 years ago. Governments have said they will change, but on current commitments the world is on course for a 3.2C rise in average global temperatures, more than double the lower Paris threshold of 1.5C, which scientists have said represents the last chance to save coral reefs, the Arctic ecosystem and the wellbeing of hundreds of millions of people at risk of increased drought, flooding and forest fires. The gap is still very big, said Jan Burck, one of the authors of the report. The G20 is not moving fast enough. Britain has made the fastest transition, with a 7.7% decline in the use of fossil fuels between 2012 and 2015, but the report warned that this could stall in the years ahead because the government had cut support for feed-in tariffs, energy efficiency and zero-carbon homes. The authors said political pressures in the G20 countries, with more subsidies for fossil fuels, were working against effective climate action. There is a huge fight by the fossil fuel industry against cheap renewables. The old economy is well organised and they have put huge lobbying pressure on governments to spend tax money to subsidise the old world, Burck said. These political pressures are likely to intensify as governments are called upon to extend emissions cuts to the transport and agriculture sectors. The report said G20 emissions needed to start declining in the next two years and halve by 2030 if the world were to avoid more than 1.5C of warming, though not one country in the group had set a credible target to do this. Climate action is way off course in all but one of the world's 20 biggest economies, according to a report that shows politicians are paying more heed to the fossil fuel industry than to advice from scientists Among the G20 nations 15 reported a rise in emissions last year, according to the most comprehensive stock-take to date of progress towards the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Comparing the goals and policies of different countries, the paper found that only India was on course to stay below the upper limit set by the Paris agreement of 2C, While the worst offenders Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey would take the world beyond 4C China, the world's biggest emitter, stabilised its releases of carbon for a couple of years by reducing dependency on coal, but this positive trend slipped last year. Indonesia, Brazil and Argentina have promised to cut deforestation but the destruction rate of forests shows no sign of reversing. Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, said: Global emissions need to peak in 2020. The Brown-to-Green report provides us with an independent stock-take on where we stand now. This is valuable information for countries when they declare their contribution in 2020 The UN climate talks in Katowice, Poland, in December the COP24 conference will start a two-year process for governments to deliver on their commitments to reduce emissions. Although there are national leaders hostile to tackling climate change, such as in the US and Brazil, there is still hope they will be open to taking their share of the responsibility. The tragedy of the commons is a situation in which individual actors using a shared-resource system act in their own seeming self-interest and deplete the resource as a result. For example, consider a small fishery with a dozen fisherman each catching as many fish as he can. Soon the resource becomes over fished and every fisherman suffers the consequences. Only if they all agree to limit their catches to sustainable levels can the fishery remain a long-term stable resource for all of the fishermen. We're in the same situation with climate change. Every country can act in its own short-term self-interest and continue burning lots of seemingly cheap fossil fuels; the long-term result in that scenario would be a catastrophic destabilization of the global climate on which we all rely. Or every country can agree to take steps like increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards that cumulatively will slow global warming and avoid the worst climate change impacts. Of course, being a short-sighted nationalist, Donald Trump is the only world leader to reject the Paris climate agreement. His administration is similarly making short-sighted arguments that coincidentally serve the best interests of the fossil fuel industry, while in this case producing the equivalent carbon emissions of adding 9 million more cars on the road. At least the Trump administration doesn't deny basic climate science in this report, but worse yet, they've taken the nihilistic viewpoint that we're screwed and nothing we do matters. Like the other stages, this is simply another form of climate denial meant to protect fossil fuel industry profits at everyone else's peril. Mobilizing climate finance from private sources will be key to addressing significant investment needs for both adaptation and mitigation. Public finance will continue to play a significant role, they write. Other means to achieve the goals of Paris outlined in the plan are to increase joint efforts to promote energy efficiency, scale up renewable energy, phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies and to align financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Finally, G20 leaders expressed their support for the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and encouraged the further engagement of cities, regions, companies, investors and a multitude of non-state actors to support governments in implementing the Paris Agreement. And they encouraged these actors to register their actions through the NAZCA platform of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The UN talks in Bonn, Germany failed to set a stage for developing an  operating manual that would help implement the landmark Paris Climate Agreement as parties are yet to converge on a range of key issues. The stage still may be far from ready for the big show adoption of the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP). To move the negotiations closer to the package deal to be adopted in Poland in December 2018, the parties after two weeks of talks have been compelled to decide holding an emergency session ahead of the climate summit. Just as the  Talanoas invited participants to consider global efforts to address climate change through guiding questions, the Dialogue\' s three central questions\- Where are we?@ Where do we want to go?@ How do we get there?@\- are also useful for understanding the progress achieved in Bonn and what remains to be resolved on the road to Katowice. Where are we?@ Parties\' task in Bonn was to move openended discussions on key elements of the PAWP closer to draft negotiating text. Delegates picked up where they had left off in December 2017, resuming discussion of long and often unwieldy  informal notes prepared by co-facilitators across the different agenda items. Given the PAWP\' s complexity and parties\' desire not to remove or consolidate any elements from the notes at this stage, many considered the Executive Secretary\' s assessment of a  satisfactory outcome in Bonn a fair evaluation. But while parties may leave Bonn satisfied, their decision to allocate additional time for negotiation in Bangkok in September illustrates an underlying sense of urgency. Veteran negotiators believe parties will need to emerge from Bangkok with a draft negotiating text if they are to remain on track for adoption of a package in Katowice. Part of the challenge in moving the work on the PAWP forward is the need for fair progress across its many components. Throughout the opening plenaries parties echoed calls to deliver a  balanced and comprehensive package to COP 24 , but views differed on what this actually means in practice. For developing countries, who fear that mitigation has taken precedence over adaptation and finance,  no item left behind emerged as a common refrain. Developed countries, conversely, argued that more technically complex issues, such as the transparency framework, naturally require more time, with the Environmental Integrity Group warning against pursuing a  mechanical parity between clauses. In addition to needing to strike a balance between parties\' differing priorities, negotiators in Bangkok will also need to find a balance between technical detail and room for political maneuvering across items. The interlinked nature of PAWP items represents another challenge. Developing guidelines for NDCs, adaptation communication, transparency, and the global stocktake requires not just close attention to detail on each item, but also careful consideration of how they relate to one another. Timing becomes tricky as parties work in parallel negotiations; some are hesitant to flesh out detail on one item when they are unsure how related elements will take shape. In Bonn, the APA Co-Chairs made efforts to address these interlinkages, convening several Heads of Delegation meetings and a  pilot joint consultation on adaptation communication and the enhanced transparency framework to consider the bigger picture. The mandate for a joint reflections note by the Chairs of the APA, SBI, and SBSTA in advance of the additional session in Bangkok also provides parties with an opportunity to enhance their understanding of the interlinkages among the PAWP elements, and how to move them forward. These dynamics are heightened by a collective awareness that any package adopted in Katowice will be the last one for the foreseeable future. Parties fear that elements left out of the package could be sidelined in the operationalization of the Agreement, and that this could be the last significant opportunity to elevate concerns such as loss and damage and assurance that finance will flow in the future. Where Do We Want to Go?@ While the contributions of non-party stakeholders in the Talanoa Dialogue were welcomed by many, a key challenge for the Fijian and Polish Presidencies is to build a cohesive message about the state of progress out of this  orchestra of 700 stories. While highlighting key messages in their reportbacks, the rapporteurs were careful to emphasize they were not seeking to capture  consensus from the stories. Such an exercise would arguably be impossible, and perhaps even undesirable, as the richness of experience on display speaks to the many-faceted realities of climate change and its impacts, and the ways these new realities are being addressed worldwide. The Bonn Talanoa Dialogue also characterized a diversity of visions that the PAWP must take on board. In the interest of reaching global consensus, and buoyed by the political momentum of COP 21, parties meeting in Paris in 2015  papered over profound differences on such issues as mitigation, adaptation, differentiation, predictability of finance, technology, and loss and damage. The 2018 deadline for adoption of the PAWP requires parties to revisit these differences to find a  landing ground where the Agreement\' s overarching principles are translated into detailed guidance acceptable to all. Still, finding that  middle ground is no easy feat. One observer noted the Bonn Conference may have represented  the most difficult stage of negotiations on the PAWP, given countries\' desire to keep all options on the table even as the contours of a possible compromise should begin to emerge. However, the format and atmosphere of the Talanoa Dialogue may offer inspiration. Many welcomed the Dialogue\' s informal and non-adversarial configuration, which allowed participants to engage with each other  not as negotiators, but as human beings. With its focus on values such as  mutual trust, and  loyalty to the planet, the conversation provided an opportunity, at a critical moment, to reorient countries towards the bigger picture on which nearly all agree: the need to achieve the vision set out in the Paris Agreement. How Do We Get There?@ But how can this vision be achieved?@ During the Bonn Climate Change Conference, it became clear that certain issues would benefit from further technical consideration, with calls for the APA to dedicate more time to deliberations on adaptation communications, finance-related issues, and transparency when it reconvenes in Bangkok. With the prospect of complex discussions ahead, many welcomed the mandate to the APA Co-Chairs to prepare additional  tools to facilitate countries\' work, including proposals to streamline the informal notes developed in Bonn and examples of how parties could progress towards the development of negotiating text. In some cases, progress in the negotiations may require issues to be addressed at a higher political level. As at COP 23, finance emerged as a  possible make-or-break political issue for any package deal in Katowice. Developing countries, led by the African Group, continued to push for modalities to enhance clarity on developed countries\' biennial indicative (ex-ante) communications of climate finance under Agreement Article 9.5; as well as more clarity regarding support provided and mobilized (ex-post) under Article 9.7 of the Agreement. Developed countries insisted modalities for Article 9.5 are  out of the question given their electoral and budget cycles. Sensitivities around this issue were heightened by a perception among many developing countries that developed countries are not on track to deliver on their commitment to mobilize US$100 billion by 2020. They insist that the trust necessary to move forward with PAWP cannot be realized until finance commitments are delivered. The scope of, and information to be included in, NDCs may also require engagement that goes beyond the technical. Although a  navigation tool agreed to in Bonn will help countries navigate the informal note that emerged from APA 1-4, the 180-page note remains on the table as countries grapple with the question of how to preserve these plans\' nationally determined nature, while ensuring a sufficient level of credibility and comparability to maintain trust in the Paris Agreement\' s bottom-up  pledge and review system, and build the necessary confidence to do more in subsequent NDCs. In Katowice, progress on mitigation, in particular, may need to take into account the importance many developing countries attach to ensuring comparable progress on adaptation and finance. High-level engagement is also critical for moving the Talanoa Dialogue forward to its  political phase, which commences at COP 24 . Leaving Bonn, however, there were calls from parties and non-party stakeholders alike for more clarity on what this phase will look like, and how it can help enhance global ambition on climate action and scaled-up NDCs. Meanwhile, many stakeholders are also placing stock in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\' s Special Report on 1.5 C warming as an objective science-based input that will highlight the urgency of increased action. As one delegation highlighted, this impetus will be critical since this is the last opportunity for the international community to assess progress on climate action before the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement takes place in 2023. Who Leads on the Road to Katowice?@ Leaving Bonn, it is increasingly clear where we are, where we want to go, and how we achieve success at COP 24 . And yet, as Katowice approaches, some parties could be heard speculating on an additional question: who will take the lead to help deliver a credible and balanced PAWP package, and the enhanced NDCs that the Talanoa Dialogue foresees?@ Past agreements in Kyoto, Cancun, Durban, and Paris benefited from clear leadership from key countries, such as the US, the EU, China, and coalitions like AOSIS and the LDCs, combined with a willingness to build alliances across traditional divides. A reconfiguration of the multilateral landscape since Paris leaves some questioning who will step up and assume leadership in Katowice. As delegates look ahead to their next stop in Bangkok, some hope the Talanoa Dialogue, with its emphasis on forging a shared and inclusive vision for climate action, will inspire key parties to  finish what was started in Paris. \</doc>

Bangladesh, Dec. 19 -- As representatives from more than 100 countries debated climate change in the COP24 - the 24th UN climate change conference - held in Katowice, Poland, the outcome could only be divisive. In the past, collective consensus by major economic powers - US, the European Union (EU), Japan and China - fuelled success. Now the planned withdrawal of the US from the Paris Accord resulted in a hollow consensus, supported by big-oil opposition. Like the recent G20 Summit, which welcomed trade but did not reject protectionism that undermines trade, Katowice agreed on a "compromise," which welcomed the alarming climate UN (IPCC) report, but not its actual findings. The price could be the virtual extinction of small island states as seas rise, followed by soaring costs of climate change in emerging and developing economies. Katowice's "administrative" compromise virtually ensures that the extreme urgency required by the "rule book," which would allow countries to implement the Paris Agreement, will be ignored. PLANNED TRUMP EXIT FROM PARIS ACCORD: Risks have escalated since June 01, 2017, when President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement - an international pact intended to reduce the effects of climate change by maintaining global temperatures "well below 2dC above pre-industrial levels." The Accord was negotiated by almost 200 parties and adopted by consensus in December 2015. Based on the UN convention on climate change, it focuses on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in 2020. However, Trump calls the pact a "bad deal" for the US and sees the withdrawal as a key piece of the "America First" stance. The White House began to pave the exit path in March 2017, when Trump signed an executive order to start the formal process of repealing President Obama's climate agenda. The withdrawal split the White House, the Congress, and the nation. A few powerful lobbying groups, energy giants and billionaires effectively hijacked the fight against climate-change, which most Americans and US cities support. More recently, the White House ignored a new government report, which concluded that, in the absence of significant steps to subdue global warming, US economy will take severe hits and cause the death of thousands of Americans by 2100. It is within the US president's constitutional authority to withdraw from the Paris deal without first receiving congressional or senatorial approval. But legal questions linger as to how the Trump White House can execute the withdrawal and what role the US can play in future international climate meetings. THE ROLE OF CHINA, EMERGING AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES: Since the early 2010s, it has often been said that China is the "world's greatest polluter." That's true but only in aggregate terms. By default, big nations pollute more than small ones. Moreover, emerging economies that are still industrialising generate relatively more pollution than advanced nations, which industrialised over a century ago. The simple fact remains that, on per capita basis, the US and major European economies remain the greatest polluters by far, however. According to research, China contributes barely 10-12 per cent of human influence on climate change. That figure has remained fairly steady over the industrial period. It is lower than might be expected for the world's largest aggregate emitter. As the major advanced economies, including the US and Europe, have been emitting far longer, their net contribution on climate change remains relatively far higher. Climate change is not just cumulative but accumulative. If the US exit will materialise, global climate risks will intensify dramatically, particularly in emerging and developing economies. THE 10 COUNTRIES MOST AFFECTED BY CLIMATE RISK: Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar ranked highest among the countries that have been most affected by climate change. Less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialised countries. Yet, even, high income countries feel climate impacts more clearly than ever before. Regarding future climate change, the new Global Climate Risk Index can serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change. The 10 countries most affected in the past two decades feature mainly poorer economies in Asia (Myanmar, Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam and Thailand) and Americas (Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua and Guatemala) (Figure). Annual averages, 1998-2017: Climate Risk Index 2019, GermanWatch; Difference Group The Index measures long-term global risk as a function of death toll, deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, absolute losses in US$ millions, losses per unit GDP (gross domestic product) in percentage and total number of climate events from 1998 to 2017. In this regard, there are differences among the most affected countries. In the case of Puerto Rico, the top rank was driven by a very high death toll and costly economic losses, but the number of events was low relative to other countries. In Myanmar, the high death toll explains the score. In Dominica, Puerto Rico and Haiti, the losses per unit GDP drove high rankings. In international comparison, the Philippines death toll has been relatively high in the past two decades, while its economic losses were among the highest. But it is the number of total events in the Philippines (over 300) that was the highest among the top-10 countries. Only Vietnam and Bangladesh come close, but even they had just two-thirds of the climate events in the Philippines. And in the top-ranking Puerto Rico and Honduras, total events were less than a 10th and 5th of those in the Philippines. TOWARD ACCELERATED CLIMATE CHANGE: Since the 1980s typhoons that strike East and Southeast Asia have intensified by 12-15 per cent, with the proportion of storms of categories 4 and 5 having doubled, even tripled. Under increasing greenhouse gas forcing, the projected ocean surface warming pattern suggests that typhoons striking Asia will intensify further. Ironically, global climate change will penalize particularly those economies where living standards remain low and that are most vulnerable to collateral damage. The more poor economies will lose lives, the more that will bespeak about the effective indifference of advanced nations toward real human rights. Timing matters. Under the agreement, the earliest date of the US withdrawal is November 2020 - the last month of the Trump presidency, in the absence of a prior impeachment. That's when Americans have to decide whether they really prefer energy profits, at the expense of future generations in the US and elsewhere. Furthermore, time is running out. According to estimates, current climate policies virtually ensure that the increase in global temperatures is on pace for somewhere around 3.3 degrees Celsius. That does not bode well for the future.

Bangladesh, Dec. 14 -- Amid repeated predictions about the disastrous impact of the global climate change came yet another prophecy of doom. The dreadful warning of David Attenborough, the British naturalist, 92, at the opening of the ongoing (December 03-14) climate summit, or COP24 , in Poland appears to be the most horrifying of those uttered in the last couple of decades. He was point blank in his words. The nonagenarian climate observer has said, "Collapse of our civilisations and extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon, if no urgent action is taken against global warming." Attenborough blamed humans for the disaster of 'global scale', our greatest threat in thousands of years. Given the unabated aggravation of the world climate by human imprudence, the experienced naturalist had little scope for toning down his forecast's ominous air. Climatologists have already found the greenhouse gas emission set to hit a level which the Earth experienced 3 (three) million years ago. During that time the seas rose by 10 metres. In the 21st century, humans have been fated to a terrible goal. Since the erratic behaviour of the global climate is now nakedly visible worldwide, they are aware of what awaits them in the near future. Regardless of their socio-economic status, nations are feeling the heat in their typical ways. The island-based or 'low-lying' nations like Fiji, Nauru, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or Maldives etc are bracing for devastating sea-level rises. They are increasingly being made to turn to the richer polluting nations for compensating funds, euphemistically called the 'climate fund'. These industrialised countries are unequivocally blamed for all environmental pollutions that have led to the present threatening form of the global climate. The prominent of these environment-hostile acts include greenhouse gas emission, which has been occurring mostly in some countries over the decades. This widespread injustice making the poorer nations --- geologically located in a vulnerable state, helplessly meet their doom, witnessed the creation of a climate fund in 2015. The venue was Paris. The French capital that year hosted one of the largest and the most critical climate meet in the 21st century. Heads of state and government and representatives of different countries and environmental activists participated in the conference. A major outcome of the meet came in the form of the rich nations' pledge to mitigate the worries and sufferings of the climatically vulnerable countries. The modus operandi of the way out was not daunting. Finance emerged as the dominant issue. Almost all of the rich nations agreed to put in their contributions to the fund. This 'historic' step came up as a new lease of life of sorts for the climate-victim nations. Following days of deliberations, the financial pool came into being visibly on assurance of the affluent nations. Three years into the event, the ambitious mission is veritably in limbo. Foot-dragging and offering one or another ruse, as well as blunt refusal, dominates the scene. The climate summit in Poland, in a sense, is being held to ensure that the rich nations that participated in the Paris event do not renege on their lofty pledges. But the signs are grim. In the run-up to the Poland summit, US President Donald Trump has flatly denied the existence of any climate abnormalities in his country or elsewhere in the world. In the meantime, super-storms, heat waves, droughts and deadly floods continue to ravage the world, the US and the mainland Europe not spared. However, as has been seen in the recent past, the less advanced nations in South, Southeast Asia and the Pacific emerge as the worst victims. The commotion and misgivings which have created a fraught situation prior to the Poland meet are not abrupt. They have been long in the making. In the climate treaty signed at the Paris conference in 2015 the ceiling for global temperature rise was fixed at below 2-degree Celsius. The capping, however, was described by scientists as some goal that risked spiralling out of human grasp inviting calamities in a row. The likelihood depended on the extent of wisdom on the part of humans in handling the global warming factors. That mankind had performed miserably in the test became clear in the startling finding of a research made public recently. As the scientists have predicted, emission of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning is feared to rise 2.7 per cent in 2018. Last year carbon pollution increased by 1.6 per cent. The scientists have aptly echoed the warning of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres who a few days earlier had sounded an alarm by saying the present world was on "way off course" in facing the climate crisis. In their recent study, scientists portrayed the present world as "completely off course" in the fight against climate-spawned disasters. The worldwide rise in CO2 emission puts the goals spelled out in the 2015 Paris Agreement in jeopardy, a scientist involved with the research says. The initial uproar over climate change began to make rounds among the experts level in the 1970s. In those days, the nature-spurred phenomenon remained generally limited to global warming, the sea level rise, polar ice and Himalayan glacial melting etc. Upon in-depth studies, those were followed by other climate-change fallout. Those chiefly included ozone depletion, displacement of sea-level rise victims, floods and droughts. As decades wear on, climate change occupies a wider focus in the environment-related summits and conferences, the most notable of them being the event marking the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in Japan in 1997. This was an international treaty setting mandatory limits on the industrialised nations on emission of greenhouse gases. To a lot of people, the Polish climate conference might appear to be another addition to the largely non-binding agreements now in force. Many doubt its efficacy in stemming the ferocity of the full-scale strike of a climate catastrophe. But despite a few chauvinistic and arrogant governments' stance, the global efforts to avert an apocalyptic event are set to get going. As part of these initiatives, the World Bank has promised $200 billion in 2021-25 climate funds. The onslaughts of climate change have long started being felt worldwide. The spectre of sea level rise has already prompted poorer and vulnerable nations to go on for arranging climate funds. As a flipside, proper utilisation of the fund money and keeping it free of the clutches of vested interests are emerging as added national imperatives for the eligible countries. No matter how ritualistically the Polish conference draws to a close, it will at least remind the nations of the global-scale calamities haunting mankind. Moreover, without conferences like it, today's consumerist societies cannot be expected to sensitise themselves to the imminent climate-induced doom. It's a truth few people with the virtue of prudence can afford to keep aside. The crux is that climate disasters stare mankind in the face. There is little time for rhetoric, tall promises and pseudo-serious negotiations --- or being in the role of a sitting duck. As a heroic and disaster-resilient nation, Bangladesh might be the last nation to remain idle and keep enduring the assaults of climate change.

Bangladesh, Dec. 4 -- The levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are regarded as the main driver of climate change, have hit a new high. A warning from the United Nations (UN) on November 22, 2018 said that the time to act was running out fast. The top UN officials are trying to ring the alarm bells, ahead of the COP 24 climate summit in Poland this month. Governments from across the world are expected to join the summit to pledge efforts through which warming can be limited to less than two degrees celsius. The two degrees celsius limit was enshrined in the 2015 Paris accord. As per the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed. The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the United Nations weather agency's annual flagship report that has been tracking the content of dangerous gases in the atmosphere since 1750, covered data for 2017 this year. The report put the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere at 405.5 parts per million (ppm). That is up from 403.3 ppm in 2016 and 400.1 ppm in 2015. The last time the earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago, when the temperature was warmer by 2 to 3 degrees celsius. Researchers have reliable estimates of C02 concentrations rates going back 800,000 years using air bubbles preserved in ice in Greenland and Antarctica. But by studying fossilised material, the WMO also has rough CO2 estimates going back up to five million years. In addition to CO2, the UN agency also highlighted rising levels of methane, nitrous oxide and another powerful ozone depleting gas known as CFC-11 (Chlorofluorocarbon - 11). Emissions are the main factors that determine the amount of greenhouse gas levels. But concentration rates are a measure of what remains after a series of complex interactions between atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere and the oceans. Roughly 25 per cent of all emissions are currently absorbed by the oceans and biosphere-a term that accounts for all ecosystems on Earth. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that in order to keep warming below 1.5 degrees celsius, net CO2 emissions must be at net zero level. This means that the amount of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere must equal the amount being removed. This can be done either through natural absorption or technological innovation. WMO noted that CO2 remains in the atmosphere and oceans for hundreds of years. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere. Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million (ppm) of greenhouse gases. As per the United Nations, 17 of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001. And the cost of climate related disasters in 2017 topped US $500 billion (439 billion Euros). It is urgent now to tame the pace of climate change at the earliest. It remains to be seen if these warning signs will be enough to move the world leaders towards taking definitive actions against climate change by cutting down on carbon dioxide emissions. Sarwar Md. Saifullah Khaled is a retired Professor of Economics, BCS General Education Cadre.

Bangladesh has said the international community must support the vulnerable developing countries to climate change with financial resources and appropriate technologies in support of their adaptation efforts. 'The big emitters must go for rapid mitigation of GHGs, and the pledges to mobilize US$ 100 billion annually by 2020 and an ambitious replenishment for the Green Climate Fund in 2019 must be materialized,' said State Minister for Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam on Friday in New York. He made the call at the high-level meeting on "Protection of the Global Climate for Present and Future Generations of Humankind in the Context of the Economic, Social and Environmental Dimensions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Trusteeship Council, at UNHQs. Shahriar said Bangladesh is of the firm view that climate change and sustainable development are interlinked and addressing climate change should be at the heart of the international development discourse. 'We must redouble our efforts for sustainable development. Simultaneously, the decisions of the Cop 24 , namely Paris Rulebook, must be adhered to by all the stakeholders,' he said. Bangladesh is one of the 10 most climate vulnerable countries in the world and the impacts of climate change will put severe stress on Bangladesh's limited land. The State Minister said they look forward to the September Climate Summit to having more focused actions particularly on climate finance and climate justice which are essential for meeting the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. He mentioned the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is contingent upon their success in halting global climate change and reduce disaster risks. 'It is high time that we renew our efforts to implement the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework to their true letter and spirit,' said the State Minister. Shahriar said rapid meltdown of the glaciers will dry up our rivers which are basically the catchments of the Himalayan glaciers. 'This will impact the fertility of our land leading to desertification.' He said climate change and sea level rise induced salinity and other disasters are harming our rice and other crop production significantly. Just 1-degree centigrade increase of global temperature and further sea level rise will result into inundation of a large area of Bangladesh and thus displacement of 40 million people by the end of this century, he said adding that 2 percent of GDP is regularly lost due to natural calamities and environmental degradation. Hence, the State Minister said, climate change poses an existential threat to over 160 million people in Bangladesh, although it had hardly contributed to the deterioration of the environment. 'Our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reiterated her Government's commitment to the Paris Agreement at different international fora with the utterance that, Bangladesh will never exceed the average per capita emission of the developing world,' he said. Tackling climate change is directly linked with sustainable development and resilience building. In line with this perspective, he said, Bangladesh is carrying forward its efforts for sustainable development with specific plans for 'Carbon budgeting', 'de-carbonization of manufacturing pathways' and low-carbon industrialization. 'Considering multidimensional vulnerabilities posed by climate change and disasters, our Government has recently adopted Delta Plan 2100, which will provide Bangladesh with the sustainable development pathway for the next 100 years.' The State Minister said Bangladesh is committed to implement its Nationally Determined Contributions in the framework of the Paris Agreement. 'We have mainstreamed climate actions and disaster management in our national planning and sustainable development strategy. Over 1 percent of our GDP is being used to combat climate change,' he said. The State Minister said Bangladesh is at a critical juncture of its development when it is on the path of graduation from the LDC category. 'In addition to all the challenges we are facing because of climate change, we have been hosting 1.1 million Rohingyas forcibly displaced from the neighbouring Myanmar," he said. He also said, 'This phenomenon is not only impacting our land and environment severely but also our development and adaptation efforts.' \</doc>

The government plans to review the country\' s electricity generation policy to promote more renewable energy following the UN Climate Change Conference pledge to provide green climate fund to developing countries including Bangladesh to tackle the climate change affect. The government has set a target to generate about 2,000 megawatts (MW) or 10 percent of the country\' s total electricity supply from the renewable energy resources by 2020.  But, the government should review the power system master plan considering the change over scenario in global perspective, said State Minister for Power and Energy Nasrul Hamid. He said that the government didn\' t require any capacity payment for generating electricity from renewable resources although it faced major challenges for setting up such plants. But it should now focus more on renewable power plants following pledges from developed countries in the recently concluded COP24 UN Climate Change Conference 2018 in Katowice, Poland. \</doc>

Greenpeace protestors recently scaled a massive chimney at Poland's Belchatow coal-fired power plant as one of Europe's largest polluters gears up to host the COP24 global climate summit. "We want to draw the world's attention to the fact that climate change is real, that human tragedies are taking place before our eyes and that action is urgent," Greenpeace Poland activist KatarzynaGuzek said. The activists were prepared to remain on the tower "for some time",Guzek said but refused to go into detail. \</doc>

The Bangkok Climate Change Conference concluded with negotiators making limited progress on advancing the Paris Agreement Work Program (PAWP), the guidelines required to operationalize the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which are expected to be adopted at the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland from 3-14 December 2018. The Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA), the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) all met from 4-9 September in Bangkok, Thailand. At the close of the meeting, according to a press release, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Epsinosa characterized the progress as  uneven. Delegates ended talks with an agreement to hand over technical discussions to a panel of experts, who will continue to meet before the COP 24 kicks off in Katowice, Poland, at the start of December. Patricia Espinosa, the UN's climate change secretary, told reporters progress had been made in Bangkok "on most issues" but that "no issues have been fully resolved yet". The issue of climate finance was "very difficult and politically sensitive," she added. Civil society organizations acknowledge that while there has been progress on the negotiating text for the Paris Rulebook, it has been uneven. Substantive issues on finance and differentiation, among others, still hang in the balance, according to a release issued in Bangkok immediately after ending the climate talks. To reach an ambitious deal in Katowice, which includes a strong rulebook, finance and stronger commitments to ambition, political leaders must talk to each in the next few months to infuse trust into climate discussions. Many lamented the slow pace of work, and underscored the need to provide assurances on finance, said a UNFCCC release. Other contentious issues relate to: differentiation between developed and developing countries, including under guidance for nationally determined contributions (NDCs); and the ways in which actions are regularly and transparently communicated. The APA, SBI and SBSTA also agreed on a way to advance work intersessionally, including preparation by the presiding officers of a joint reflections note addressing progress made in Bangkok, and identifying ways forward, including textual proposals, to help advance Parties\' deliberations towards the PAWP. The note will address all PAWP items to ensure their balanced and coordinated consideration, and will be circulated by mid-October to inform political discussions scheduled for the pre-COP meeting, convening from 24-27 October in Krakow, Poland. During a joint APA, SBI and SBSTA closing plenary, Egypt, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), stressed the need to move forward on finance and other means of implementation. Australia, for the Umbrella Group, highlighted negotiations on NDC guidance in the context of mitigation, arguing that a bifurcated approach  has no basis in the Paris Agreement. Iran, for the Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries (LMDCs), lamented developed countries\'  repeated attempts to renegotiate the Paris Agreement by  erasing differentiation in negotiations on compliance, the transparency framework and NDCs in the context of mitigation. Maldives, for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), emphasized the need for a COP decision on the Talanoa Dialogue, and said an  omnibus decision on the PAWP would risk holding back progress on some agenda items. Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, urged progress towards a consolidated text to produce an omnibus decision in Katowice. South Africa, for Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC), emphasized that transparency arrangements must not replace existing reporting requirements with a weaker system. Indonesia stressed the importance of recognizing Parties\' diverse national circumstances, capacities and capabilities in the PAWP. Indigenous Peoples stressed that the implementation guidelines must reflect a rights-based approach. Youth non-governmental organizations (NGOs) called for inclusion of civil society in the GST and for Paris Agreement Article 6 (market and non-market approaches) to be guided by the principles of equity and environmental integrity. Negotiations on nearly 20 substantive agenda items took place throughout the week, including on issues related to: mitigation; adaptation; finance; transparency; the global stocktake (GST); response measures; market and non-market approaches; compliance with, and implementation of, the Paris Agreement; and possible additional PAWP items, including matters related to the Adaptation Fund and loss and damage. The \' Bangkok outcome\' captures progress made across these issues in a 307-page  PAWP compilation, and mandates the presiding officers to undertake intersessional work to help advance Parties\' deliberations towards the PAWP. "The planet\' s alarm bells are ringing; just this year we\' ve endured deadly heat waves and floods, devastating wildfires, and record high temperatures. Unfortunately, climate negotiations are still taking baby steps when they should be sprinting towards solutions, said Tracy Carty, Climate Policy Lead, Oxfam.  The Paris Agreement is on the brink. Developed countries are going back on their word and refusing to agree clear rules governing climate finance. If they remain stuck in their positions and fail to loosen their purse strings, this treaty may collapse, said Harjeet Singh, Global Lead on Climate, ActionAid International. Developing countries rounded on the United States (US) and its allies at the emergency climate talks, accusing the world's richest nations of stalling a deal aimed at preventing runaway global warming, according to a report. The talks foundered over the key issue of how efforts to limit climate change are funded and how contributions are reported. Delegates representing some of Earth's poorest and smallest nations said on the final day of the summit that the US and other Western economies had failed to live up to their green spending commitments.  The U.S. has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement but still negotiates as if it is a Party, weakening international cooperation by not contributing to finance and technology transfer to developing countries, said Meena Raman, legal advisor at Third World Network.  After contributing the most to cause the climate crisis, the U.S. now expects developing countries to clean up the mess with no help whatsoever. This Just Do It Yourself attitude risks infecting the entire process and will hinder the much needed implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Chair of the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Group, Gebru Jember Endalew, said: "There remains an immense amount of work to be done and only five negotiating days in Katowice before the Paris Agreement rulebook needs to be delivered. The effectiveness of the Paris Agreement depends on the delivery of a robust set of implementation guidelines. Nearly 300 pages of text need to be refined so that textual negotiations can begin on day one in Katowice." \</doc>

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) and the UNFCCC have announced the first global conference on synergies between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The conference - convening in Copenhagen, Denmark, in March 2019 - will be one of several events on climate and sustainable development taking place in 2019. DESA announced the 2019 multi-stakeholder conference at the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the UNFCCC, which is underway in Katowice, Poland, from 2-14 December 2018. The conference will aim to deliver a set of concrete recommendations for strengthening the interlinkages between the SDGs and climate action, and focus on promoting action around both agendas. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa reflected that  climate change and the SDGs are really one integral agenda. By working together, she said, DESA and the UNFCCC  are setting an example of the way the different entities can join forces. Climate change and the SDGs are really one integral agenda. \</doc>

Dhaka, Oct. 5 -- Bangladesh's participation in this year's General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGA), including the fringe events that take place in and around the high level General Debate, was of particular importance in light of the year that had lapsed since the outbreak of the Rohingya refugee crisis - perhaps the most intense of a number of such crises driven by war and inhumanity around the world today, that are playing havoc with the world order and fuelling the rise of populist hard right movements in a number of Western polities. In 2017, the Rohingya crisis in its latest and most intense iteration (it has been ongoing for nearly four decades now, what C.R. Abrar has described as a "slowburn genocide") was still too early and too little was understood about it for world leaders to take a resolute stand one way or the other. Indeed, even historically we would find that the plight of the Rohingya has received very little international attention, part of what drove Amnesty International to once christen them "the world's most persecuted people". The inadequate attention it has received at the UN's annual shindig in the past merely reflected this gap in the world's consciousness. This time however was a different story, with nearly the full scale of the horror that was inflicted upon the hapless Rohingya by the Myanmar army under the guise of a cleanup operation against extremist elements that commenced in August 2017, having emerged - and gone viral - in full view of the world over the course of the past one year. Witness the plethora of leaders and celebrities who have visited the refugee camps scattered across Cox's Bazaar mostly throughout 2018, as if in a hurry to make up for the history of neglect. World media too has not missed the opportunity for putting all the misery - the salt among all the ingredients that make up the news on a daily basis - on display, while advocacy groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have also tackled the issue with a gusto not seen before over the past one year. All of this meant an unprecedented groundswell of interest around the Rohingya issue as world leaders started gathering in the Turtle Bay area of New York that hosts the UN premises. Prior to this year's meeting, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for Myanmar to be held accountable for "one of the world's worst humanitarian and human rights crises" following the publication of a UN investigation into alleged atrocities against the Rohingya. The report recommended that the country's military leadership be prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Rakhine State last year, where around 700,000 Rohingya were forced to flee their homes. US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley called for strong and immediate action against the Myanmar leadership, while Chinese ambassador Wu Haitao urged a softer approach based on "constructive assistance". As a result one of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's first engagements upon arrival in New York saw her placing three recommendations to solve the protracted Rohingya crisis from its root, at a high-level side event on the 'Global Compact on Refugees: A Model for Greater Solidarity and Cooperation' held at the UN headquarters with the secretary-general in the chair. In 2016 the UN refugee agency began developing a new framework for responding to large movements of refugees. The Global Compact on Refugees was delivered to the UN general assembly through this event. Thick end of a crisis The prime minister's first recommendation was to abolish discriminatory laws, policies and practices by Myanmar against Rohingyas. Her second recommendation was that Myanmar must create conducive environment by building trust and guaranteeing protection, rights and pathway to citizenship for all Rohingyas. If needed, create a 'safe zone' inside Myanmar to protect all civilians. The third recommendation was to prevent atrocious crimes against Rohingyas in Myanmar by bringing accountability and justice, particularly in light of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding Mission of the UN Human Rights Council. "In Bangladesh, now we're faced with the largest forced movement of over 1.1 million traumatised Rohingya sat the shortest time. They've been forcibly displaced from their homes in Rakhine State of Myanmar where they had been living for centuries," she told her audience. The prime minister went on saying, "While we're providing them with basic necessities, the magnitude of the problem has posed serious challenges for us. We've allocated over 6,000 acres of land." Hasina, however, said the diversion of human and other resources for Rohingyas has taken a toll on the environment, economy and society. She mentioned that the international partners, especially the UN agencies, have been helping the Rohingyas. "Regrettably, the current UN joint response plan of 2018 which requires USD 950 million has remained severely underfunded with only 33 percent funding secured. Humanitarian and development support of the international community for the Rohingyas and other affected communities must be predictable and in the spirit of international responsibility sharing," the PM said. Hasina reiterated that the Rohingya crisis originated in Myanmar and the solution has to be found there."As a responsible government, we've opened our border and provided shelter to the forcibly displaced Rohingyas. By doing so, we've not only saved lives, but also stabilised the entire region by containing the crisis within our border." She said Bangladesh would like to see the Rohingyas returning to the homes in safety, security and dignity."Pending their return, we are trying to address their basic needs." Given the scarcity of land and other socio-cultural and environmental impacts, Hasina said they were going to relocate them to a newly developed island, Bhashan Char, where they will have better living conditions and livelihood opportunities. In the absence of any policy of local integration in Bangladesh, she said, Rohingyas need to secure their future in their own country Myanmar. The prime minister urged international community to help Bangladesh achieve that. Hasina said the 'Compact on Refugees' was up for adoption at a time when the world is faced with swelling refugee crisis. Innocent people from the various conflict-torn countries are leaving their homes for safety and security while many countries like Bangladesh are giving them shelter, protection and hope. She mentioned that most of these refugee-hosting countries are developing countries with their own set of challenges. "Yet, they respond to the call of humanity." The world must recognize their contributions and help those countries shoulder the burden. The world leaders must come forward with political will and commitment, she added. The prime minister said the world must not forget that every refugee desires a safe return to his or her homeland. The displaced people from Myanmar have to return to their homes in safety, security and dignity. "Safe and sustainable return to the country of origin is particularly important to resolve protracted refugee crisis. Greater attention needs to be paid to remove the root causes that drive people refugee, and those root causes lie in the countries of origin," she said. The prime minister said the realisation of the Compact should exhibit stronger commitment towards addressing those root causes; rather than focusing on response to an emerging situation only. The Global Compact on refugees was conceived in September 2016, when the UN General Assembly adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, which is "a set of commitments to enhance the protection of refugees and migrants." The New York Declaration called upon the UNHCR to create a "global compact on refugees" to be presented in the 2018 annual report to the UN General Assembly. The Compact aims to strengthen cooperation between UN member states in responding to large movements of refugees. It consists of the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, which are the key elements for a thorough response to any large movement of refugees. The Global Compact will also provide a blueprint to "ensure refugees have better access to health, education and livelihood opportunities." When one nation is confronted with a large movement of refugees, the global compact aims to alleviate that burden so that a country does not become overwhelmed. There should be systems in place so governments can share responsibility in a crisis, which is based on the rationale that the members of the international community work better together, than alone. The compact is expected to be endorsed by the General Assembly before the end of 2018. On the same day, September 24, UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian co-hosted a High-Level Event on the Rohingya Crisis. Ministers from Burma/Myanmar and Bangladesh were joined by high level attendees from Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, Turkey and the US. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener and UN Development Programme Administrator Achim Steiner also participated. The Co-Chairs (France and the UK) agreed that the plight of the Rohingya was one of the largest refugee crises in recent history and one of the most pressing human rights and humanitarian crises facing the international community today. They noted with deep concern the conclusions of the report of the UN Fact-Finding Mission, which allege the Burmese military's responsibility for serious human rights violations, possibly amounting to crimes against humanity and which conclude that there is sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Burmese army so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine state. France and the UK noted that over the past year the Burmese government had taken some steps to address the crisis, including the signing of the MoU between Burma/Myanmar and UNDP and UNHCR and the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry (CoI). The Co-Chairs acknowledged the ruling of the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber that the Court may exercise jurisdiction over the alleged deportation of the Rohingya people from Myanmar to Bangladesh as well as over the alleged crime against humanity. They recalled their support to the efforts of the Human Rights Council to implement the conclusions of the Fact-Finding mission and to push for accountability, including through an independent Mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and violations of international law committed in Burma/Myanmar. The meeting also called for the immediate release of the two Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Ooo as well as for the respect for their fundamental rights. They also thanked the government and people of Bangladesh for hosting more than a million refugees. They encouraged the international community to continue and intensify support for the refugees and Bangladeshi host communities, including through increasing financial support to the UN Joint Response Plan. At the UNGA Hall Before delivering her speech at the General Debate, the prime minister also took part in the high-level "Leaders' Dialogue on Climate Change: Implementation of the Paris Agreement Towards COP24 and Beyond" held at the UN Headquarters, where she urged the developed countries and world leaders to come forward with support for climate change adaptation and wider 'capacity building'. "We need support for climate change adaptation and wider 'capacity building' and also for technology development and transfer in areas like agriculture, public health and disaster management," she said. At the General Debate, the prime minister demanded immediate and effective implementation of the agreement signed between Myanmar and the UN on the solution of the Rohingya crisis. "We also wish to see immediate and effective implementation of the agreement concluded between Myanmar and the UN," she said while delivering her address at the General Debate of the 73rd UN General Assembly on September 28. She delivered her speech in Bangla as in previous years. She said Bangladesh was appalled by what it has seen in UN reports about atrocities against the Rohingyas who have now taken shelter in Bangladesh, which are tantamount to genocide and crimes against humanity. "We expect the international community, particularly the UN, to give due importance to the atrocities and injustice suffered by the Rohingya population in Myanmar," she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh can neither ignore nor remain silent about the plight of the Rohingya, their 'fellow human beings'. "I, therefore, presented a five-point proposal at the UN General Assembly last year with a view to finding a durable and peaceful solution to the sufferings of the forcibly displaced and hapless Rohingya. We're disappointed that despite our earnest efforts, we haven't been able to begin Rohingya repatriation in a permanent and sustainable manner," she said. Mentioning that Myanmar is one of Bangladesh's neighbours, she said from the outset, it has been trying to find a peaceful solution to the Rohingya crisis through bilateral consultations. "So far, three bilateral arrangements have been concluded between Bangladesh and Myanmar for Rohingya repatriation," she said, adding that despite their verbal commitment to take back the Rohingya, in reality, the Myanmar authorities are yet to accept them back. Hasina said the 1.1 million Rohingyas (700,000 nin the latest exodus, to go with 400,000 since 1978) hosted in Bangladesh are living in an uncertain situation. To the best of its ability, Bangladesh has made arrangements for their food, clothing, healthcare, child-care and security, she said. She noted how many countries and organisations, including the UN, the Commonwealth, and the OIC, have shown solidarity with the Rohingyas and extended support and assistance for them. The prime minister said Bangladesh has started working on a new housing facility with all arrangements for their education, healthcare and other needs so that they are able to live in a good and healthy condition. She called upon international organisations to join hands with Bangladesh in this initiative. She said the Myanmar situation repeatedly reminds her of the genocide committed by the Pakistan occupation forces against Bangalis in 1971 - thereby opening the door to a possible future campaign to have those atrocities recognised as genocide. Talking about terrorism, she said Bangladesh stands firm against terrorism and all organised crimes. "We shall not allow our territory to be used for any terrorist acts against or any activity detrimental to the interest of our neighbours. Our 'zero tolerance' policy in countering terrorism will continue undiminished," she said. Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh has commenced its journey toward the status of a developing country from an LDC. In the backdrop of Bangladesh's current economic growth, she said, there are now immense and large-scale business opportunities in Bangladesh. She also mentioned that Bangladesh remains committed to implementing the Paris Agreement and is spending over 1 percent of its GDP in addressing climate change impacts. "We're also promoting climate-resilient agriculture. Initiatives have been taken to increase tree coverage from 22 percent to 24 percent in the next five years," she said. She said Bangladesh was shocked by the continued violation of the rights of the brotherly people of Palestine. "This must come to an end. As the Chair of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers, we shall continue to work with the international community for resolution of the Palestine question." Sheikh Hasina said there are three elements that play the most critical part in advancing human civilization -- peace, humanity and development. "For the well-being of human societies, we must continue to strive for humanity. Our main objective must be to serve people and ensure their well-being. It is humanity and goodwill that would take us forward on the pathway to sustainable development." Noting that Bangladesh once was known to the world as the land plagued by disasters, floods, droughts and hunger, she said it has done wonders in maintaining international peace, managing disasters, empowering women and consolidating development gains. "Bangladesh has now surpassed its neighbours in South Asia on a number of indicators." "But our journey has not reached its end. Our journey will continue till the day we can build a Bangladesh free of hunger, poverty, illiteracy and exploitation,'' the prime minister concluded, on a suitable note of optimism and hope to inspire all people.

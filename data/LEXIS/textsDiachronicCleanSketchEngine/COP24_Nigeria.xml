At the negotiations at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) in Poland, Corporate Europe Observatory and Corporate Accountability have released a new infographic that exposes what they describe as 'green fa\'e7ade' by the conference' sponsors. Just days before the conference began in Katowice, the COP Presidency announced that a number of the meeting's corporate sponsors would be from the coal, gas and fossil fuel financing industries. A statement released by Climate Justice groups including Corporate Accountability and Friends of the Earth International warned that the fossil fuel industry's overbearing presence through trade and other groups was undermining the talks and promoting false solutions to the climate crisis. The infographics noted that the slogan for the climate talks - Black to Green effectively captures the fact that Big Polluter sponsors have wrapped themselves in green branding while their core business digs up and burns coal, oil and gas, which is incompatible with the Paris Agreement and a liveable planet. Sriram Madhusoodanan, deputy campaigns director at Corporate Accountability said: 'The fact that the negotiations charged with solving the global climate crisis are being bankrolled by Big Coal is absolutely unacceptable. Big Polluter sponsors like JSW are not only able to use sponsorship to greenwash their images, but also sponsorship will likely buy them access to the talks themselves - a massive conflict of interest. It's like a gun control policy meeting being paid for by the National Rifle Association. Or public health talks bankrolled by Big Tobacco. Such sponsorship raises serious questions about what access and influence sponsorship buys and could risk calling into question the legitimacy of these talks before they even begin. Big Polluters have no place bankrolling or participating in the UN climate talks. Period. It is precisely for this reason that a global movement has issued the People's Demands and specifically called for governments to protect the talks from Big Polluter interference.' Akinbode Oluwafemi of the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria said: 'The fact that the corporate sponsors of the talks are from the same polluting industry responsible for the climate crisis, leaves room for doubt on the directions the talks will go. The People's Demands are explicit on the need to exclude Big Polluters from the discussions. No other way will lead to pro-people outcomes.' The infographics list eight companies that are sponsoring the COP24 . They are Tauron Polska Energia S.A - Poland's second biggest electricity generator and supplier from coal and gas, JSW - one of the largest tar producers in Europe, Polska Grupa Energetyczna - the largest energy sector company, and PZU - the lead insurer of the Polish coal sector. Others are PKO Bank - one of the largest fossil fuels financier, PGNiG - leading gas corporation. Grupa LOTOS S.A - which is into extraction and processing of crude oil, and PKN Orden - the largest oil conglomerate and petrol retailer in Poland. \</doc>

The International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation (INBAR) has tipped bamboo as having huge potential to mitigate climate change. United Nations ' Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland, where the organisation promoted the use of bamboo and rattan as existing solutions to climate change, environmental degradation and poverty, said natural climate solutions can deliver over 35 per cent of cost-effective carbon dioxide mitigation needed by 2030, but that they are a critically overlooked part of most climate change discussions. 'There are over 30 million hectares of bamboo spread across the world - this plant is truly a source of 'green gold' for developing countries, and we are urging everyone at COP24 to 'think bamboo; in their climate action plans,' Friederich said. Referring to the product as 'the forgotten climate solution', he disclosed that bamboo acts as a sustainable, low-carbon alternative to timber, PVC, aluminium and concrete. Fast growing and quick to mature, bamboo can be used to make an increasing number of heavy-duty materials such as pipes, scaffolding and housing. 'Bamboo plants and products can also store more carbon than certain species of tree: new research shows they can sequester up to 630 tonnes of carbon per hectare,' Friederich notes, adding that bamboo renewable energy is being used to reduce deforestation across parts of Asia and Africa. \</doc>

The world must scale up the response to climate change, particularly in agricultural sectors, the Deputy Director-General of Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Maria Helena Semedo told delegates at a high-level side-event of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. According to the deputy chief of the UN agency who spoke on Thursday, ''it will require investing in multi-sectoral policy design, implementation capacity, people, data, innovations as well as leadership, especially for women''. At the special event, focusing on Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger, Semedo warned of the increased global hunger levels, driven largely by the impacts of climate change, conflicts, and economic slowdown, noting that "our efforts to end hunger will become more challenging if warming reaches two degrees Celsius". However, "achieving Zero Hunger is still possible," she stressed, adding that in order to succeed it is essential "to define transformative actions that will reshape our food systems, sustainably and equitably for all." At a COP 24 "Climate-Smart" Agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps to transform agricultural systems to ensure food security and support rural development in a changing climate. The aim of the publication is to provide the best FAO-led examples of how CSA is not a "one-size-fits-all" approach that can be universally applied but, rather, involves different elements embedded in local contexts. Semedo also spoke at the joint UN side event on SDG15: Life on Land at COP24 earlier this week. Noting that currently the land use sector is responsible for almost a quarter of global GHG emissions, Semedo underlined that it also has great potential to store vast quantities of carbon in soils, forests and wetlands. "We can make significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by adopting smarter, integrated farming systems, by protecting and managing forests and by shifting to approaches that use natural resources sustainably and efficiently," Semedo said. "This way, the land use sector can change from being part of the climate problem to becoming part of the solution and deliver up to 30 percent of the climate mitigation needed by 2030," she added. Semedo also highlighted the vital role of partnerships, innovations and technology in scaling up joint efforts to better manage forests and land. At the event, FAO and US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched a new open-access tool Collect Earth Online (CEO) allowing anyone to track land-use and landscape changes anywhere in the world. It will enable countries to strengthen measuring, monitoring and reporting capacities on forests and land use. At the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, FAO supports countries to ensure that the linkages are made between climate change adaptation, mitigation, agriculture, and food security for enhanced climate action HYPERLINK http://imgs.syndigate.info/632/1802/51/154487606472.jpg?resize=696%2C392&ssl=1 http://imgs.syndigate.info/632/1802/51/154487606472.jpg?resize=696%2C392&ssl=1 climate change \</doc>

!-- Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General -- Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General By Kazeem Ugbodaga Exposure to air pollution causes seven million deaths worldwide every year and costs an estimated US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally, World Health Organisation, WHO said on Friday. According to WHO, in the 15 countries that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4% of their GDP, as actions to meet the Paris goals would cost around 1% of global GDP. The body said meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could save about a million lives a year worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone. The latest estimates from leading experts also indicate that the value of health gains from climate action would be approximately double the cost of mitigation policies at global level, and the benefit-to-cost ratio is even higher in countries such as China and India. A WHO report launched on Friday at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland highlights why health considerations are critical to the advancement of climate action and outlines key recommendations for policy makers. "The Paris Agreement is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. "The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health. It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter and will undermine decades of progress in global health. We can't afford to delay action any further. " The same human activities that are destabilizing the Earth's climate also contribute directly to poor health. The main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution. "The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high, that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself," says Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. "When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost." Switching to low-carbon energy sources will not only improve air quality but provide additional opportunities for immediate health benefits. For example, introducing active transport options such as cycling will help increase physical activity that can help prevent diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. WHO's COP-24 Special Report: health and climate change provides recommendations for governments on how to maximize the health benefits of tackling climate change and avoid the worst health impacts of this global challenge. It describes how countries around the world are now taking action to protect lives from the impacts of climate change ndash but that the scale of support remains woefully inadequate, particularly for the small island developing states, and least developed countries. Only approximately 0. 5% of multilateral climate funds dispersed for climate change adaptation have been allocated to health projects. Pacific Island countries contribute 0. 03% of greenhouse gas emissions, but they are among the most profoundly affected by its impacts. For the Pacific Island countries, urgent action to address climate change including the outcome of COP24 this week is crucial to the health of their people and their very existence. "We now have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to protect health from climate change ndash from more resilient and sustainable healthcare facilities, to improved warning systems for extreme weather and infectious disease outbreaks. But the lack of investment is leaving the most vulnerable behind," said Dr Joy St John, Assistant Director-General for Climate and Other Determinants of Health. The report calls for countries to account for health in all cost-benefit analyses of climate change mitigation. It also recommends that countries use fiscal incentives such as carbon pricing and energy subsidies to incentivize sectors to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. It further encourages Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to remove existing barriers to supporting climate-resilient health systems. \</doc>

The Department of Climate Change of the Federal Ministry of Environment has made known its preparations for the upcoming 24th session of the Conference of Parties, COP 24 , to the UNFCCC holding this December in Katowice, Poland. On December 3-14, 2018, Poland will host the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In a memo presented at the recent National Council on Environment in Akure, Ondo State, the Department informed the Council that it had set up a Planning Committee; and hosted the first meeting of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change (ICCC) towards the Conference. The department said it had commenced online registration for delegates, facilitated an online National Talanoa Dialogue survey to generate positions to inform participation at the Conference; and developed a National Delegation handbook for the conference. The department has also engaged a COP24 facilitating consultant to assist in the planning and arrangements for side events. Planning the second meeting of the ICCC, and training for the negotiators were underway, the department informed council. A note by the Director of the department, Dr Peter Tarfa states: 'Recognising the consequences and adverse impact of climate change on Nigeria, the country joined the global community to adopt treaties meant to tackle climate change. Nigeria became a Party to the UNFCCC in 1992 and ratified the Convention in 1994, it also became a Party to the Kyoto Protocol in 2004. Nigeria ratified the Paris Agreement (PA) in March 2017, which was approved by the UNFCCC on May 16, 2017 and entered into force on 15th June 2017.' Due to the importance attached to the issues of climate change and global warming, and in view of the enormity of activities required for the implementation of the climate change treaties to which Nigeria is a party, the Federal Government of Nigeria established the Department of Climate Change in the Federal Ministry of Environment to serve as the vehicle for driving National Climate Action efforts. \</doc>

PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has observed that no country can confront climate change alone and has, therefore, urged member countries to rededicate themselves to the task of rebuilding and restoring a healthy environment for future generations. In an address to the opening session of United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 A statement issued by Garba Shehu Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity), said Buhari cited the receding Lake Chad, noting that the effects of climate change are felt more on the vulnerable communities who lacked the capacity and technology to properly address such challenges. He said: ''Obviously, no country can confront the phenomenon alone. In this regard, Nigeria believes in joint and cooperative efforts to tackle the problem. ''We urge that efforts to address the challenges of climate change be pursued within multilateral frameworks. 'Concerted efforts should be made to strengthen sub-regional and regional organisations, to serve as hubs for Climate Action and partnership.'' Speaking specifically on Lake Chad, the President reaffirmed that Nigeria remains committed to saving the Lake, which is a source of livelihood to 40 million people, from extinction. He said Nigeria would build on the success of an International Conference held earlier in February this year in Abuja to create additional awareness globally on the serious environmental and security challenges facing the Lake Chad region. The President told COP 24 Summit, attended by world leaders and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, that a consensus was reached at the Abuja Conference that an inter-basin water transfer from the Congo Basin remains the most sustainable option available to resuscitate and safeguard this precious water body that was once the 6th largest freshwater Lake in the world. On behalf of the Member Countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the President thanked the Italian Government for donating 1.5 million Euros towards completion of the feasibility studies on the proposed inter-basin water transfer project. ''I once again call on the international community to support this worthy project, for the benefit of nearly 40 million people that depend on the Lake for their livelihood, and to guarantee future security of the region. ''I would like to reiterate Nigeria's commitment to constructively supporting multilateral action aimed at addressing climate change. ''We must rededicate ourselves to the task of rebuilding and restoring the healthy environment we inherited for future generations,'' he said. President Buhari also used the occasion to highlight what Nigeria had done and is doing on climate change after the adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015. ''We in Nigeria have commenced the implementation of our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ''In the next 15 years, we aim to achieve 20% emissions reduction below Business as Usual (BAU) and 45% emissions reduction with the support of our international partners by 2030. ''Our efforts include the review and introduction of new responsive Legislation/policies, strengthening institutional and manpower capacities, and encouraging a gradual transition to low carbon economy. ''Nigeria has also recently ratified the Doha Amendment and will soon deposit the instrument for ratification,'' he said. The President pledged that Nigeria will continue to pursue industrialization and economic development, with sound environmental management and best practices. He added that Nigeria has unlocked the potential of its sovereign green bond to galvanise private capital to finance environmentally sustainable projects. ''In support of our NDC aspiration, we have embraced the issuance of the green bond as an innovative and alternative source of funding projects that would reduce emissions and provide robust climate infrastructure like renewable energy, low carbon transport, water infrastructure and sustainable agriculture that our country needs,'' he said. Furthermore, the President told the summit Nigeria believes that technology can be a powerful solution for simultaneously addressing climate change and advancing development, stressing the need for developed countries to accelerate the finance for research and development, in addition to promoting access to climate-friendly technologies. ''In addition, there is the need to raise global climate action in the pre-2020 period, in terms of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. ''For us in Nigeria, we are promoting technologies and practices such as sustainable land management, climate resilient agriculture, water efficiency and clean energy. ''We have also developed insurance-based initiatives to deal with loss and damage, as well as adaptation to internally acceptable practices,'' he said. The President commended the Government and People of Poland for hosting the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the ''beautiful city of Katowice.'' At the formal opening of COP24 , President Andrzej Duda of Poland had told delegates that the conference is taking place on the exact location where a coal mine was once operated, adding that Katowice is now one of the greenest cities in Poland. \</doc>

''In the next 15 years, we aim to achieve 20% emissions reduction below Business as Usual (BAU) and 45% emissions reduction with the support of our international partners by 2030. ''Our efforts include the review and introduction of new responsive Legislation/policies, strengthening institutional and manpower capacities, and encouraging gradual transition to low carbon economy. ''Nigeria has also recently ratified the Doha Amendment and will soon deposit the instrument for ratification,'' he said ''In support of our NDC aspiration, we have embraced the issuance of green bond as an innovative and alternative source of funding projects that would reduce emissions and provide robust climate infrastructure like renewable energy, low carbon transport, water infrastructure and sustainable agriculture that our country needs,'' he said. Furthermore, the President told the summit Nigeria believes that technology can be a powerful solution for simultaneously addressing climate change and advancing development, stressing the need for developed countries to accelerate the finance for research and development, in addition to promoting access to climate-friendly technologies. ''In addition, there is the need to raise global climate action in the pre-2020 period, in terms of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. ''For us in Nigeria, we are promoting technologies and practices such as sustainable land management, climate resilient agriculture, water efficiency and clean energy. ''We have also developed insurance-based initiatives to deal with loss and damage, as well as adaptation to internally acceptable practices,'' he said. The President commended the Government and People of Poland for hosting the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the ''beautiful city of Katowice.'' At the formal opening of COP24 , President Andrzej Duda of Poland had told delegates that the conference is taking place on the exact location where a coal mine was once operated, adding that Katowice is now one of the greenest cities in Poland. \</doc>

If climate change and global warning continue unabated, then Africa's future does not look bright. Experts warn that participants at the COP24 conference in Poland have to deliver on previous pledges. 'We are the most vulnerable, we are the least responsible but we will suffer the most,' Seyni Nafo, spokesman of the African delegation at the World Climate Conference summed up in an interview with Deutsche Welle. The African continent is already experiencing the effects of climate change. In many places drought, torrential rainfall or flooding are regular occurrences. The damage done amounts to five and 10 percent of individual countries' Gross Domestic Product.(GDP) 'The person on the street does not see the impact of what is decided at the COP meetings. But people are seeing the real impact of global warming every day,' said Nigerian environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey. Pledges must be fulfilled The worst is still to come, the UN warns. In 2020 up to 250 million people could be affected by serious water shortages as a result of rising temperatures. If the rise exceeds two degrees Celcius, half the population of Africa could be affected by malnutrition. 'Climate change has the potential to destroy our development,' Nafo warns. The hope is that the COP24 conference in Poland can be a launchpad for meaningful action. Delegates from all over the world have converged on the city of Katowice. For James Murombedzi, a climate expert with the UN Economic Commission for Africa, this is the most important climate conference so far. The goal is to reach agreement on a detailed set of rules that would implement the decisions taken at the Paris conference of 2015. Global warming, it was agreed, should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celcius. This can only succeed if emissions of greenhouse gases cease entirely from 2050 onwards - and they must be drastically reduced in the years leading up to that deadline. However, experts agree that measures taken so far by the international community fall far short of that goal. Mandatory measures are needed, they say. Funds to adapt to climate change High on the agenda of the African delegation is also a second pledge made in Paris, namely that poor countries would receive financial help to enable them to adapt to climate change. Starting in 2020 rich industrial nations are expected to pay an annual amount of 100 billion US dollars. Here, too, no concrete commitments have been made. For negotiator SeyniNafo, it is vital to ensure that the funds agreed are made available. For some experts, the sum of 100 billion dollars is not enough. Africa is dependent on agriculture and measures must be taken to ensure climate damage is kept to a minimum. More investment in irrigation systems is needed, says UN expert Murombedzi. For Nnimmo Bassey, this is not a question of charity or benevolence but of justice. 'The planet is burning' Can these goals really be achieved? The US has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, although, as SeyniNafo puts it: 'Climate change is a common problem and we can only find a common solution.' He adds optimistically: 'We see great interest in many countries in salvaging the multilateral process, in salvaging the outcome of Paris.' There is no guarantee of success for COP24 . Fighting climate change means changing the way economic systems function and changing the lifestyle of entire societies, particularly where consumer behavior and mobility are concerned, says Murombedzi. 'Especially in the highly developed countries, there appears to be not enough political will to take on necessary costs.' Nnimmo Bassey is also skeptical about the chances of COP24 marking a new beginning. 'I hope the delegates, both ministers and technocrats, will actually begin to talk from their hearts and not just from political considerations. If that is not done, it will be just another COP and it will be like fiddling while the planet burns.' \</doc>

From December 3rd to 14th, the world will have its eyes set on Katowice. The 24th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) will take place in this southern Polish city. Green Climate Fund (GCF) subsidies, carbon-trading mechanisms, precise deadlines setting 196 delegations will work towards "the practical achievement of the Paris climate agreement," signed in 2015 during the COP21. As laudable as these goals may be, one significant stake risks going by unreported; the one related to the excessive amounts of mining resources needed to achieve the energy transition. Electric cars, windmills, solar panels, cities and intelligent networks All these "green" and digital technologies share the specificity of being highly metal consuming. They devour basic metals such as iron, copper or zinc, as well "rare metals", as they are less abundant. Cobalt, tungsten, Rare Earth elements, tantalum, vanadium, indium, or gallium are sought after for their great optical, catalytic or magnetic properties. These "small metals" are the lesser-known base of digital and green tech, presented as environment-friendly. We already consume over two billion tonnes of mineral resources each year  roughly equivalent to 500 Eiffel Towers per day. Given these new needs, the German agency for mineral resources predicts that the demand for metals such as germanium could double by 2035, that needs for dysprosium and tantalum could quadruple and cobalt demand could multiply by 24. In 2017, a World Bank report estimated that lithium extraction could, on the medium term, grow by 1,000 percent due to demand for batteries. The energy transition is a metallic one. And yet, the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate doesn't say a word about the environmental, economic and geopolitical challenges surrounding this new dependence. Terms such as "metals," "minerals" or "raw materials" aren't even mentioned. Will we avoid this fatal mistake in Katowice? The question is all the more crucial given that the environmental impact of rare metals' extraction and refining contradict the litany of incantatory statements on the coming of a greener world. In Chile, the Democratic Republic of Congo or even Kazakhstan, copper, cobalt and chrome extraction and refining go hand in hand with ecosystems' pollution and massive sanitary consequences. China has paid a very hefty price. We visited the mining areas of the southern Jiangxi province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. We can testify about the paradox of green energies. So-called clean technologies require metals which extraction is particularly damaging. Likewise for "renewable" energies: they do not work without non-renewable ones. As for digital technologies meant to dematerialize our lifestyles, they benefit from phenomenal amounts of solid materials. Which ones among the 30 heads of State expected in Katowice know about this darker side of green energies? In the West, the question was concealed from the beginning of the 1990s. At the time, many States closed their mines and refining factories, deemed as too polluting, while less industrialized countries would take on this burden to catch up with their industrial delay. In other words, the Westerners have delocalized green technologies' pollution, and these political choices have led the world to a duality between the dirty ones and those allegedly clean. The parenthesis of the "happy globalization," in which every resource is available, everywhere and at any cost, shuts down progressively. The "markets' invisible hand" is insufficient to smooth the new tensions around rare metals' supply. We expect the first mineral resource shortages to happen long before petroleum ones! A question arises, incongruous yet essential: Could we fail the achievement of the energy transition, not due to a lack of agreement on either GCF or carbon finance in Katowice, on December 14th, but because we will lack minerals and energies to industrialize them? The COP24 To achieve the energy transition would implicate to rethink our economic models, which are too focused on the short-term benefits and a religious chase for lower costs. The deployment of an economy based on functionality that gets most of its profits not from its products but from its related-services is an inspiring possibility. The question of the frugality of our consumption habits is key, because without adequate resource management, as the World Bank reminded, "a future based on green technologies [ ] could ruin [ ] the Sustainable Development Goals". To sum up, Western states will have to question themselves about the necessary reopening of the very mines they closed a few decades ago, in the name of an ecological ideal. "Responsible mining," as suggested by some European governments, seems like a sound policy. That action path would be better than the irresponsible mining policy currently prevailing in countries with less respect for the environment and would depollute the production cycle of green technologies. Besides, the COP24 organizers claim that they work on an "inclusive and fair transition" These words can be only coherent if the most industrialized countries agree to share the mining industry burden with poorer countries that endure nowadays the damaging side effects of a greener world. With these action plans, the COP24 negotiators would move away from the "soil-less" approach of the energy transition that has prevailed so far. History would remember they were among the firsts to mitigate the dangerous side effects of our quest for a more livable planet  dangers as significant as those we aimed to solve, of which we have yet to realize the entire scope.

!-- Africa needs to prepare and speak with one voice when it goes to COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, in December, Kenya's Environment and Forestry Minister, Keriako Tobiko said Wednesday at the opening of the Seventh Climate Change and Development in Africa (CCDA ndash VII) conference in Nairobi. -- Kenyaa Minister Africa needs to prepare and speak with one voice when it goes to COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, in December, Kenya's Environment and Forestry Minister, Keriako Tobiko said Wednesday at the opening of the Seventh Climate Change and Development in Africa (CCDA ndash VII) conference in Nairobi. Speaking on behalf of President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Minister said climate change was a matter of life and death for Africa, hence the need for its leaders to speak with a strong unified voice and be heard whenparticipating in multilateral climate negotiations and other global issues. "We have all experienced the devastating and unprecedented impacts of climate change on our peoples' lives and livelihoods as well as our national economies. Africa is the most vulnerable continent despite contributing only about 4% to global greenhouse gas emissions but when we go to argue our case we speak in tongues and come back with no deal," he said. "We need to make sure that we have a unified voice as we proceed to COP24 . We should showcase our own solutions to climate change solutions that are developed and customized to fit our own situation. " He said given Africa's shared ecosystems and that natural resources know no boundaries, it was essential that we continue to speak in one voice to safeguard the basis of our development and seek transformative solutions'. Mr. Tobiko said the theme of this year's forum, "Policies and actions for effective implementation of the Paris Agreement for resilient economies in Africa", reflects Africa's collective engagement and commitment to strengthen climate change actions in the context of its development priorities. Climate change threats, he said, however present opportunities for innovative and green investments for Africa. "This is why implementation of the Paris Agreement remains a priority for the continent in order to adapt to the inevitability of climate variability and change. It is however important to emphasize that achieving the goals of the Agreement require committed leadership from state and non-state actors," the Minister said. Commenting on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Global Warming of 1.50C special report and its impacts in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty', Mr. Tobiko said limiting global warming to 1.50C would require rapid, far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. "Operationalisation implies that adequate and predictable resources be mobilised and made available to support adaptation and mitigation action in Africa and other developing world," he said, adding it was important that discussions and outcome of CCDA-VII contribute to build momentum towards the upcoming COP 24 and implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Local communities, women and the youth, he said, should be engaged in Africa's efforts to combat the vagaries of climate change. Mr. Tobiko shared with participants Kenya's priority climate actions and how its devolved governments were helping fight climate change. "There are numerous practical and innovative solutions at community, sub-national, national and international level that we should never ignore in Africa. Climate change affects all of us but it affects doubly the most vulnerable members of our communities so we should always engage them because they also have the knowledge and solutions," he said. The Minister said as part of efforts to tap into opportunities in biodiversity, Kenya will be hosting its first Sustainable Blue Economy Conference between the 26th and 28th November 2018 to promote sustainable investments in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers. The meeting has attracted over 700 participants from member States, climate researchers, academia, civil society organizations, private sector, youth, women and local government leaders, among others. \</doc>

President Muhammadu Buhari left Abuja on Saturday for Poland to attend the 24th session of the Climate Change Conference known as the Parties ( COP24 ). COP24 , under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), would hold from December 2-4, 2018 in the Polish city of Katowice.. The COP24 Summit, taking place at the International Conference Centre (MCK) and the adjacent Spodek Arena in Katowice, is being convened under the Presidency of Poland. According to the organisers, the conference is expected to finalise the rules for implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change under the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) - the rule book for implementation. During the Leaders' Summit at COP24 , President Buhari will deliver a national statement highlighting Nigeria's commitment to addressing climate change by implementing the goals set out in its National Determined Contributions, Adesina said. The president would also use the occasion to accentuate Nigeria's willingness to work with international partners to reverse the negative effects of climate change in Africa and the world over. He said President Buhari would be expecting that developed nations scale up their emission reduction activities in order to limit the increase in average global temperatures to well below 2 degrees centigrade between now and 2020. The Leaders' Summit is expected to adopt a ''Declaration on Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia,'' - named after the region of Poland where this year's climate conference is taking place, he said. As a member of the Committee of the African Heads of State on Climate Change - a group of 10 African countries that meets and takes positions concerning issues of climate change on behalf of the continent - Nigeria has been at the forefront of advancing policies and initiatives. It is aimed at addressing significant challenges occasioned by climate change such as reviving the Lake Chad, halting and reversing desertification, flooding, ocean surge and oil spillage. President Buhari will continue to champion these pressing issues at COP24 in Katowice, among others, as well as reiterate Nigeria's position on the need for African countries to access financial resources, especially the Green Climate Fund to draw up climate change adaptation policies and actions for implementation. The Nigerian delegation will also showcase the policy measures and actions of the Federal Government at ensuring environmental sustainability and effectively combating climate change through several side events within the Nigerian pavilion. While in Poland, President Buhari will hold an interactive session with the Nigerian community in that country. The Nigerian leader is also scheduled to hold bilateral meetings with the President of Poland Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. The President was accompanied by Governors Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu, Yahaya Bello of Kogi and Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger.

!-- Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General. -- Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said it will "not only be immoral, but suicidal", should the world body fail to agree on climate change action. Guterres said this on Wednesday at the ongoing 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) in Poland. He challenged the more than 100 government leaders gathered in Katowice to find consensus and "finish the job", noting the roadblocks continuing at the ( COP24 ) climate change conference over how to implement the historic 2015 Paris Agreement. "In my opening statement to this conference one week ago. I warned that climate change is running faster than we are and that Katowice must ndash in no uncertain terms ndash be a success, as a necessary platform to reverse this trend," Guterres said. Since Dec. 2, the conference has brought together thousands of climate action decision-makers, advocates and activists, with one key objective ndash to adopt global guidelines for the 197 parties of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The 197 parties of the 2015 Paris Agreement committed to limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Centigrade ndash and as close as possible to 1. 5 degrees Centigrade ndash above pre-industrial levels. With only three days left at the conference for the negotiations, the UN chief regretted that "despite progress in the negotiating texts, much remains to be done". COP24 proposed a text to act as a "new basis for negotiations". "Key political issues remain unresolved. This is not surprising ndash we recognise the complexity of this work. But we are running out of time," Guterres warned, referring to the alarmingspecial report on global warming issued in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He told the delegations, which are locked in negotiations, that "over the last 10 days, many of you have worked long, hard hours and I want to acknowledge your efforts. But we need to accelerate those efforts to reach consensus if we want to follow-up on the commitments made in Paris. " He called on negotiators to boost their ambition, with regards to "predictable and accessible financial flows for the economic transition towards a low-emission and climate-resilient world". Guterres reminded the audience that developed countries had a financial obligation to support the efforts of developing countries, as established by the UN Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC), under which the Paris Agreement falls, and which was signed in 1992. "It's very difficult to explain to those suffering from the effects of climate change that we have not managed to find predictable support for the actions that must be taken," he remarked. He hailed various financial announcements made since the beginning of COP24 , including by the World Bank, multilateral development banks, and the private sector but urged developed nations to "scale up their contributions to jointly mobilise $100 billion annually by 2020", as laid out in 2015 in Paris. "Countries have different realities, different capacities and different circumstances," he noted, explaining that "we must find a formula that balances the responsibilities of all countries" and that is "fair and effective for all". The UN chief said there was the know-how, as well as "incredible momentum from all segments of society" adding that "what we need, is the political will to move forward". "I understand that none of this is easy. This means sacrifices, but it will benefit us all collectively", he challenged the conference to overcome national preferences and work together to "finish the job" with raised ambition "on all fronts". Guterres stressed: "To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal. \</doc>

Water experts, policy makers, government representatives, United Nations' agencies, donors and non-governmental organisations (NGO) kicked off the celebration of the seventh edition of the Africa Water Week in Libreville, Gabon on Monday, October 29, 2018, calling on African governments to reflect on achievements made towards providing clean water and sanitation services. The week-long event is convened by the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) in collaboration with UKaid supported project for unlocking the potential of Ground Water for the Poor (UpGro), USAID, Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the Global Water Partnership (GWP) and the International Water Management Institute. According to Prof Makame Mbarawa, the AMCOW President and the Minister for Water and Irrigation for Tanzania, the event is a call to action and positions Africa to creatively think, act and win. 'This is an opportunity to share lessons and good practices in water security management, to share lessons and good practices on enhancing water and sanitation resilience to climate change,' he said in a statement. One of the objectives is also to create an opportunity to contribute to developing strategies on raising adequate and sustainable financing of water and sanitation agendas. The 7th Africa Water Week brings together over 1,000 participants from governments, regional institutions, international partners, the private sector, the scientific community, civil society, and the media, particularly from Africa Gabonese Minister for Water and Energy, Patrick Eyogo Edzang, lauded Prof Mbarawa's statement, saying that accomplishing water security is imperative to safeguarding sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water to maintaining livelihoods, human wellbeing, and socio-economic development. The Africa Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture, Sacko Eyogo Leonel Correa, urged all African governments to include more water sanitation and hygiene projects in their National Determined Contributions (NDC) to unlock more climate-related financing mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund, Adaptation Fund, AfDB Climate related Funds, and a host of other sources of funding. Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) is a term used under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that all countries that signed the UNFCCC were asked to publish in the lead-up to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Once the agreement is ratified, the INDCs automatically changes to NDCs. 'I also want to congratulate AMCOW on the launch of the 2018-2010 strategy and, therefore, I call upon our ministers to take action, and they should not keep this important document on their shelves,' said Correa, calling on development partners to help in implementation of the tool. \</doc>

A group, 350.org, has welcomed the call by Pope Francis for 'citizens' pressure groups' to take action ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit taking place in San Francisco, USA on 12-14 September, to ensure it provides 'suitable responses' to the climate crisis. Also in his speech, speaking ahead of the COP24 Summit to be held in Katowice, Poland, in December, the Pope said £ll governments should strive to honour the commitments made in Paris, in order to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis.' 350 is an environment pressure group and a co-organiser of the global Rise for Climate mobilisation. According to 350, 'the global Rise for Climate mobilisation taking place on and around 8 September aims to demonstrate how the tide has turned in the race against climate change, showcase climate action taking place around the world, and inspire deeper commitments from each other and from national governments.' The Pope had spoken earlier this month on the final day of a climate change summit hosted by the Vatican that aims to put his landmark environmental encyclical 'Laudato Si' into action. The Pope had said, 'The COP24 Summit, to be held in Katowice, Poland, in December, could prove a milestone on the path set out by the 2015 Paris Agreement. We all know that much still needs to be done to implement that Agreement. All governments should strive to honour the commitments made in Paris, in order to avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. 'Along with states, local authorities, civil society, and economic and religious institutions can promote the culture and practice of an integral ecology. I trust that events such as the Global Climate Action Summit, to be held from 12-14 September in San Francisco, will provide suitable responses, with the support of citizens' pressure groups worldwide.' \</doc>

19 December 2018, Sweetcrude, Abidjan, C\'f4te d'Ivoire \- - The curtain has fallen on COP24 , this year's global climate summit held in Katowice, Poland where the African Development Bank assumed its role as primary champion of African interests and a steadfast supporter of African negotiators. Negotiations continued throughout the weekend to reach agreement on specific parts of the 'rulebook' to be applied from 2020 by the 197 signatories of the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming to 2\'b0;C-1.5\'b0;C relative to pre-industrial levels. Intense negotiations, modest progress, determined African negotiators For two years, the 50 African countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement focused on the need to construct a specific, transparent framework for climate finance. African negotiators \- including the AGN, supported by the Bank \- have also been negotiating to have developed countries, largely responsible for global warming, to implement their commitments. Developed countries are required to help developing countries conduct their ecological transition in line with the Paris Agreement made in December 2015. In addition to its role as purveyor of knowledge, experience and expertise, the AfDB organised 50 panel discussions and conferences at its Pavilion, which bubbled with a wealth of views shared by 30 experts who led discussions across the subject of climate change in all its dimensions: water and sanitation, agriculture and forestry, transport and urban development. The gender dimension, the role of civil society and the private sector, meteorology and related technologies, renewable energy and the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions, were other topics discussed. COP24 activity with Africa Day, organized in collaboration with the African Union, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and NEPAD. And it closed its Pavilion's doors on the last day of the Summit with an equally symbolic event \- a debate that brought together young leaders from the continent and elsewhere, journalists, experts and activists, all actors in the fight against climate change. The Bank is more resolved than ever to continue its work to combat climate change in Africa and its advocacy work to defend the continent's interests. "We see women who are losing their livelihoods; we see hungry children; we see communities reduced to dust by tornadoes and hurricanes. That's what motivates us, that drives us, that makes us redouble our efforts to work to reduce the adverse effects of climate change on our communities," said Anthony Nyong, Director of the Bank's Climate Change and Green Growth Department at COP24 . Because the urgency is right there the final decision of the COP 'insists on the urgency of greater ambition', but it does not lay down any time span and this does not bode well for developing countries in general or for African countries in particular, since they are among the most affected in the world by climate change. So, COP25, to be held in Chile, is already in our diaries. For the African Development Bank, the 'fight' continues and the Bank is determined to stay on the front line \- always defending the interests of its 54 Member States and their people.

Download logo Hundreds of thousands of people in sub-Saharan Africa will get access to electricity for the first time thanks to an extra \£3100 million of funding from the UK government announced at COP24 in Poland. The new investment triples funds for the Renewable Energy Performance Platform (REPP), to support up to 40 more renewable energy projects over the next five years. The new funding could unlock an extra \£3156 million of private finance into renewable energy markets in Africa by 2023. Developers of small-scale solar, wind, hydro and geothermal projects will be supported to harness each country's natural resources, and the electricity generated is expected to provide 2.4 million people a year with new or improved access to clean energy. Power produced from new projects funded is expected to save around three million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime, compared with fossil fuel generation \- the equivalent to the emissions from burning 21,000 railway cars of coal or from 800,000 cars in a year. Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said: This \£3100 million will help communities harness the power of their natural resources to provide hundreds of thousands of people with electricity for the first time. Building these clean, reliable sources of energy will also create thousands of quality jobs in these growing green economies." The new investment is in addition to \£348 million previously committed to the REPP. The programme is already supporting 18 renewable energy projects in a range of countries from Tanzania to Burundi. These projects, featuring solar, wind, biomass, hydro and geothermal technologies, are expected to provide new or improved access for more than 4.5 million people over the project lifetimes, creating 8,000 jobs during development and operation. Expected results from some of the 18 projects already receiving support from REPP are: hydropower from the Nzoia River in Kenya, providing 290,000 people with energy and creating 330 jobs mini grids in Nigeria which will provide 72 rural villages with pay-as-you-go clean, reliable energy, creating 2,500 jobs during construction and 430 when it's up and running biomass plants in Ebolowa and Edea, Cameroon, providing enough clean energy for 520,000 people in a rural area creating 460 jobs solar power to provide electricity for 87,600 people and business in Burundi, creating 300 part-time jobs and 50-full times posts a hydropower plant creating enough power for more than 90,000 people for the first time in a remote part of Tanzania, creating 80 jobs in total The funding is part of the UK's commitment to invest \£35.8 billion in international climate finance by 2020 to encourage ambitious action from other governments, the private sector and communities in the global effort to tackle climate change. To date, UK climate finance has: supported 47 million people cope with the effects of climate change provided 17 million people with improved access to clean energy At COP24 \£315.6 million to help countries vulnerable to climate change have a voice in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations \£3771,000 to help developing countries take part in COP24 an additional \£345 million to the 'Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions' (NAMA) Facility, co-founded by the UK, to help reduce emissions within an economic sector an additional \£31 million for the Global Innovation Lab, which helps innovative climate finance proposals move more quickly to implementation and attract funding Distributed by APO Group on behalf of British High Commission Abuja.

He said the document represented an advancement of the earlier sub-national FREL developed under the United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-REDD) programme and submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) after a successful technical assessment. Buhari had during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris, France, committed to 20 percent a conditional and 45 percent unconditional emission reductions which is the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to global emissions reduction. The minister noted that about 17 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions were said to be from deforestation and forest degradation with a large percentage believed to be from developing countries. He stressed that the 3.7 percent deforestation rate in the country was alarming and "must be put in checks." Hassan said the national FREL came in handy for the country "to gauge its performance not only in implementing REDD+ but also in meeting its commitment to the NDC." Speaking at the validation workshop on the draft FREL for Nigerian Government, he said FREL provided the baseline to demonstrate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions or otherwise by implementing countries. He said the organisation had offered technical assistance in data collection on key pillars of FREL, including forest carbon inventory to estimate the emission factors and land use mapping, change detection and accuracy assessment using Remote Sensing/GIS tools for Activity Data (AD) estimation. Represented at the occasion by Dr. John Fonweban, the FAO country representative added that estimates of the EF and AD had been used in the calculations of potential emissions in the past 10 years in Nigeria as well as documented in the draft FREL report. Nonetheless, the minister, who was represented by Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Environment, Mr. Leon Lawrence Alibo, noted that the country had made steady progress as a result of the additional financial support received from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) of the World Bank which had enabled the expansion of readiness implementation to two additional states namely Ondo and Nasarawa, in addition to Cross River State where pilot activities were undertaken with the support from FAO, UNDP and UNEP. He said: "What we are witnessing today is the result of the FCPF financial grant which is being partly applied through the Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA) signed between Nigerian Government and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) to undertake the REDD readiness in two additional states with respect to monitoring, reporting and verification as well as to develop the National FREL as an upscale of the sub-national FREL recently submitted UNFCCC. According to him, "Climate change is a global phenomenon with dire consequences on all of us without an exception unless efforts are doubled to curtail the trend. "And I am optimistic that sooner than later, within the context of the international climate negotiations of the UNFCCC, Nigeria would begin to benefit from the potentially emerging performance-based system from REDD+." \</doc>

As leaders gather in California this week for the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS2018), UN Climate Change is presenting a revamped version of its Climate Action Portal, featuring the accelerated action underway by cities, regions, companies and investors to achieve the collective goals of the Paris Agreement. The preview coincides with what has been dubbed 'the biggest moment for climate action since the Paris Agreement,' to highlight progress being made around the five GCAS 'challenge areas': Healthy Energy Systems, Inclusive Economic Growth, Land and Ocean Stewardship, Sustainable Communities and Transformative Investments. Key commitments in these five areas will be presented at the end of the Global Climate Action Summit today, and by the New York Climate Week in a fortnight, UN Climate Change will have uploaded all the actions under each of these five areas to the area, effectively serving as the legacy tool for the Summit. The energy and momentum emerging from GCAS2018 can help set the stage for the next steps in the international climate change process, starting with the UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice this December ( COP24 ). Originally called the 'NAZCA Portal' - named after the ancient lines in Peru and launched by the Peruvian Government back in 2014 - the Climate Action portal was subsequently enshrined in the text of the Paris Agreement as the official portal to showcase the contributions of the so-called 'non-Party stakeholders'. The new design and improved usability of the website - centered around an interactive map - offers an improved visualization of the overall data and enhanced aggregation of climate action based on constituencies and sectors. The update also represents a unique collaboration between UN Climate Change and its core data partners who have been working tirelessly to harvest and consolidate the climate commitments and actions of non-Party stakeholders (cities, regions, businesses and investors): CDP, Carbonn Climate Registry, Climate Initiative Bonds, Cooperative Initiative Platform, Global Covenant of Mayors, Investors on Climate Change, The Climate Group, and UN Global Compac Recent studies have underscored the vital role that these actors are playing to reduce global emissions and, in doing so, to create unstoppable momentum towards the Secretary-General's 2019 Climate Summit. Specifically, some studies suggest that by 2030, global greenhouse gas emissions could be lowered by as much as 1.5 to 2.2 gigatons (CO2e) every year if the commitments from nearly 6,000 cities, states, regions and over 2,000 companies are fully implemented. The portal will therefore serve a critical function by capturing the breadth and depth of this action from the 'real world' economy, gradually incorporating new data over the coming months from more than 12,000 stakeholders, and capturing many more commitments going forward. This can encourage governments to raise ambition as they prepare for COP24 in Poland in December of this year and for the next round of climate action plans under the Paris Agreement in 2020. \</doc>

Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed that his administration will not rest until the remaining Chibok girls still in Boko Haram's captivity since April 2014 are safely released. In a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said Buhari restated his commitment in Katowice, Poland, at a bilateral meeting with Swiss President Alain Berset, on the margins of the UN Climate Change Conference, COP24 . President Buhari and his Swiss counterpart discussed joint strategies to ensure the safe return of the girls, building on the past successes of securing the release of some of the Chibok girls and other abducted persons in the North Eastern part of Nigeria. He also welcomed the Swiss President's commitment to continue providing humanitarian assistance to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nigeria and to ensure the safe release of the abducted school girls.

In separate bilateral meetings with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda and the Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, President Buhari commended the country for a successful outing at the opening of the COP24 meeting in Katowice. He told his Polish counterpart that Nigeria was facing serious climate change challenges, particularly the receding Lake Chad, which is a source of livelihood to some 40 million people living in the region. "Nigeria is totally committed to global efforts to mitigate and adapt to effects of climate change," President Buhari told the Polish leader, whose country is the president of COP24 . "We have a vibrant and active young population and our government is doing so much on the Nigerian economy, including diversifying to non-oil sectors. "We welcome increased cooperation with Poland and will encourage investments in other sectors of the economy like solid minerals and information technology," he said. Morawiecki told President Buhari that traditionally 96 per cent of oil imports to Poland come from Saudi Arabia and Russia, adding "but now we are looking at importing oil from Nigeria." The Prime Minister noted as the fastest growing economy in the European Union, Poland has identified Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa, as three top investment destinations in Africa. "We want the hub of our investment destination to be in Nigeria," the Polish Prime Minister told President Buhari, welcoming the pledge by the Nigerian leader to immediately put in place a framework to encourage more Polish investments in Nigeria. In his bilateral meeting with his Austrian counterpart, Alexander Van der Bellen, the duo focused on the challenges of Lake Chad and what was required to recharge it. Noting that the Lake faced the two challenges of technology and financing, President Buhari told the Austrian leader that enormous financial resources and technology were required to transfer water to Lake Chad from the Congo Basin. Van der Bellen, who indicated his country's interest to cooperate with Nigeria on recharging the Lake Chad, talked about climate change challenges in Austria including drought, glaciers melting, among others.

For the fourth year in a row, Solutions&Co brings together 20 major economic newspapers from around the world to explore and highlight concrete solutions in the fight against climate change. In 2015, nations around the world sent a strong message by signing the Paris Agreement at COP21. And yet the battle against climate change is far from over. The signatory countries have not yet committed to concrete measures. Enumerating them is a goal of COP24 , taking place December 3-14 in Katowice, Poland. Despite these steps, it would be a mistake to think that governments alone will be able to stem global warming. The latest report by scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is absolutely clear: to limit our impact on the climate, we must all commit to "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society." For companies, setting out to achieve these goals has become a moral duty requiring swift action. It is also a great opportunity for them to rethink their business models and place in society. In the United States, many in the private sector understand the stakes and are stepping up to lead the climate battle after the US administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The commitment of former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who promotes low-carbon financial innovation in the Wall Street capital markets, is just one example. In recent years, companies around the world have combined profit-making with respect for the environment. Some are supported by local governments, while others are struggling against all odds. But they must go even further. They must become the spearhead of the ecological big bang, accelerating and scaling up concrete solutions to bend the curve of greenhouse gas emissions. To limit the devastating consequences of climate change and ensure sustainable living conditions for the planet's different species \- including human beings \- we must reduce our CO2 emissions from 2010 levels by 45 percent ahead of 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In other words, every gram of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere will have to be offset by environmentally friendly practices. The mission is not impossible, according to the IPCC scientists. Some of the measures necessary for us to stay below a 1.5\'b0C increase are already underway, but it is vital to scale up and accelerate their implementation. Amplifying the impact of already effective technological solutions is a first step. But companies have yet another challenge \- to create value and jobs without overconsumption. As the World Bank points out, a green technology future that improperly manages natural resources, especially rare metals, could be at odds with Sustainable Development Goals. <figure><figcaption>Christian de Boisredon, Founder of Sparknews</figcaption></figure> That is why Ventures Africa joins Sparknews and 19 other major business newspapers around the world on December 3, during COP24 , for the media project Solutions&Co, exploring solutions that reconcile ecology and economy. Replicating these solutions on a large scale can help us meet the goals that scientists have set in order to limit the impacts of climate change. You \- readers, citizens, leaders, investors, consumers \- can help to spread and magnify the effects of these solutions, so that tomorrow's economy becomes a truly sustainable one.

PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari yesterday visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum in O?wi?cim, Poland, where he paid tribute to Holocaust victims. After an hour and 10 minutes guided tour of the Museum devoted to the memory of the victims, who died at both camps during World War II, President Buhari penned a hand-written tribute in the visitor's book, quoting Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar': 'The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones'. The President, according to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, also laid a wreath at Block 11 of the museum, known as the 'Death block.' Here, according to an epitaph in the Block: 'Male and female prisoners from all parts of the camp complex were held in this building following brutal interrogations, they were in most cases sentenced to death by shooting.' Before leaving the museum, which includes the Nazi concentration camps Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau, Buhari fielded questions from State House correspondents traveling with him He described those fanning embers of discord in Nigeria as 'illiterates and ignorant'. The President is on Day Four of his visit to Poland, where he had attended the opening of the UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice, delivered his national address at the 12-day meeting of COP24 , met with several world leaders and visited the impressive Nigerian pavilion at the climate summit. The President had earlier attended a town-hall meeting with Nigerians in Poland, a day after his arrival in the country. \</doc>

ROYAL Dutch Shell caved into growing investor pressure over climate change on Monday with plans to set short-term targets for reducing its carbon footprint. BP and Total have already set short-term targets, but Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden had previously resisted setting hard goals, saying it would be 'foolhardy'' to expose Shell to legal challenges. Shareholders had criticised Shell for 2017 setting long-term £mbitions'' to halve its emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050, which lacked binding targets for implementation. Shell, which did not specify any targets on Monday, plans to link these targets and other measures to its executive remuneration policy. The revised remuneration policy will be put to shareholders for approval at its annual meeting in 2020. 'We are taking important steps toward turning our Net Carbon Footprint ambition into reality by setting shorter-term targets,' Ben van Beurden said in a statement. The move comes as governments meet in Poland for a conference hosted by the United Nations COP24 which will set out a 'rule book'' to implement a 2015 climate accord. The Paris agreement set goals to phase out fossil fuel use this century, shift toward cleaner energies and help limit a rise in temperatures. Shell signed a joint statement with a group of 310 investors with more than 32 trillion dollars of assets under management, dubbed Climate Action 100+, outlining the targets and review process. 'When it comes to meeting the demands of the Paris Agreement on climate change, we believe it is necessary to strengthen partnerships between investors and their investee companies to accelerate progress toward reaching such an ambitious common goal,' Peter Ferket, Chief Investment Officer of Robeco said in the joint statement. \</doc>

<figure><figcaption>Solar plant in Morocco.</figcaption></figure> Solar projects stretching across the Sahel region are expected to connect 250m people with electricity by tapping into the region's abundant solar resource 09 December 2018, Sweetcrude, Abidjan, Ivory Coast  The details of the "Desert to Power Initiative" have been outlined as part of the Paris Agreement climate change talks at COP24 in Katowice, Poland this week. Energy poverty in Africa is estimated to cost the continent 2-4 % GDP annually, according to the African Development Bank (AfDB) ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org www.AfDB.org ), which is leading the project. The Initiative aims to develop and provide 10 GW of solar energy by 2025 and supply 250 million people with green electricity including in some of the world's poorest countries. At least 90 million people will be connected to electricity for the first time, lifting them out of energy poverty. Currently, 64% of the Sahel's population \- covering Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea \- lives without electricity, a major barrier to development, with consequences for education, health, and business. By harnessing the exceptional solar resource in the region, AfDB and its partners hope to transform the region. Magdalena J. Seol in the AfDB's Desert to Power Initiative said: "Energy is the foundation of human living \- our entire system depends on it. For Africa right now, providing and securing sustainable energy is in the backbone of its economic growth." "A lack of energy remains as a significant impediment to Africa's economic and social development." The project will provide many benefits to local people, said Ms. Seol: It will improve the affordability of electricity for low-income households and enable people to transition away from unsafe and hazardous energy sources, such as kerosene, which carries health risks. Construction of the project will also create jobs and help attract private sector involvement in renewable energy in the region. Many women-led businesses currently face bigger barriers than men-led enterprises to accessing grid electricity \- so the project has the potential to increase female participation in economic activities and decision-making processes. The project has been launched in collaboration with the Green Climate Fund, a global pot of money created by the 194 countries who are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to support developing countries adapt to and mitigate climate change. The program is designed to combine private sector capital with blended finance. "If you look at the countries that this initiative supports, they're the ones who are very much affected by the climate change and carbon emissions from other parts of the world," said Ms. Seol. "Given this, the investments will have a greater effect in these regions, which have a greater demand and market opportunity in the energy sector." "Women are usually disproportionately negatively affected by energy access issues. Providing a secure and sustainable electricity creates a positive impact on gender issue as well." The African continent holds 15% of the world's population, yet is poised to shoulder nearly 50% of the estimated global climate change adaptation costs, according to the Bank. These costs are expected to cut across health, water supply, agriculture, and forestry, despite the continent's minimal contribution to global emissions. However, the International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that Africa's renewable energy potential could put it at the forefront of green energy production globally. It is estimated to have an almost unlimited potential of solar capacity (10 TW), abundant hydro (350 GW), wind (110 GW), and geothermal energy sources (15 GW) \- and a potential overall renewable energy capacity of 310 GW by 2030. Other renewables projects in Africa include The Ouarzazate solar complex in Morocco, which is one of the largest concentrated solar plants in the world. It has produced over 814 GWh of clean energy since 2016 and last year, the solar plant prevented 217,000 tons of CO2 being emitted. Until recently, Morocco sourced 95% of its energy needs from external sources In South Africa, the Bank and its partner, the Climate Investment Fund, have helped fund the Sere Wind Farm \- 46 turbines supplying 100 MW to the national power grid and expected to save 6 million tonnes of greenhouse gases over its 20-years expected lifespan. It is supplying 124,000 homes. COP24 is the 24th conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This year countries are preparing to implement the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the world's global warming to no more than 2C.

There are signs that Electric Vehicles (EVs) pose a bleak future for the fossil fuel market: Volvo, a Swedish vehicle manufacturer, has committed to fit every car it produces by 2019 with electric or hybrid engines and BMW plans to mass-produce EVs by 2020, offering 12 models by 2025. A recent report published by the World Economic Forum entitled 'Electric Vehicles for Smarter Cities: The Future of Energy and Mobility', also indicated that Renault plans to produce 20 electrified models by 2022 while Volkswagen will invest up to $84 billion in battery and EV technology to electrify all 300 of its models by 2030. If these transitional commitments to electric vehicles by manufacturers are not sufficient threats to the fossil fuel market, especially in Nigeria where the economy relies heavily on foreign exchange earnings from oil, commitments from countries to transit to other sources of energy from fossil fuel should rattle any doubter. The World Economic Forum also revealed in its report that Norway, the Netherlands, France, Germany, UK, China and India have all made announcements indicating their intentions to eventually ban the production and sale of cars that run on fossil fuels. Cities including Athens, Madrid, Mexico City, Paris and Stuttgart have announced plans to ban diesel cars by 2030 or earlier. China has also set a timeline of capping its carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, and has indicated it plans to ban the production and sale of fossil fuel cars in the near future. Increased electrification of mobility coupled with more renewables in the energy generation mix have become a crucial part of the solution. These time-based commitments from vehicle manufacturers and countries to edge out fossil fuels from vehicles across the world are all fallout of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) agreement in Paris, where many countries and cities announced goals to eventually ban internal combustion engines. The European Commission also released the Clean Mobility Package in November 2017 to set new CO2 emission standards and guidance for cleaner mobility. Interestingly, even the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which Nigeria is a member, is not unaware of the threat posed by electric cars to fossil fuels in the near future. Last year, OPEC published its World Oil Outlook 2040 and noted the increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), the tightening of fuel emissions standards and the desulphurization in the road transportation, marine and aviation sectors. The report from the World Economic Forum observed that electric vehicles are proliferating globally at a rapid pace due to decarbonization policies and improving EV costs and performance for customers. However, the forum is worried that the current trajectories, with an emphasis on vehicles for personal-use and non-integrated strategies for the deployment of charging stations, could limit the benefits that can be generated by electrification of transport. These developments not only pose danger to Nigeria's oil-driven economy, but also may likely catch Nigerians unawares in terms of early adoption of electric vehicles. However, the Nigerian government is not completely unaware of the impending disruptive danger fossil vehicles pose on both the economy and transportation. The National Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC) is at the verge of developing a national policy on electronic vehicles. In an interview with Daily Trust, Director-General of NADDC, Mr. Jelani Aliyu, said Nigeria will have to begin to look at how the country will introduce and support the electric car technology in terms of being able to produce those vehicles. 'A number of the companies that are interested in Nigeria already have electric vehicle programmes in place or they are looking at going into it. We will have to work closely with them to provide these vehicles in Nigeria,' he said. Nigeria's auto policy meant to reduce importation of used vehicles is still in limbo and implementation of the policy has remained unclear. It remains unclear whether or not Nigerian roads support the use of electric cars but what is certain is that the government is not even discussing changing infrastructure for electric cars. At a recent parley with journalists in Abuja, the NADDC boss said electric cars are less complex than cars that run on fossil fuels. On the economic end, Nigeria is preparing for a post fossil fuel era in terms of other sources of foreign exchange earnings. For instance, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has drafted the 'Zero Oil' plan which aims at replacing oil as the major national foreign exchange earner. The NEPC boss, Olusegun Awolowo, said the plan projects that earnings from non-oil exports will jump to $8 billion by 2019 and further leap to $25 billion by 2025. Awolowo also revealed that the plan aimed at diversifying the country's export base from exporting raw commodities to value added products, increase participation of SMEs in export trade by 50 per cent, achieve $706 million in non-oil export to the West Africa sub-region and create 1.5 million new jobs in the SME sector by 2020. The World Economic Forum report recommends that policy-makers will have to advocate for the convergence of local energy, urban and mobility patterns in regards to electrification strategies. 'They should also ensure that city, national and regional policies support and reinforce each other. The energy sector will have to accelerate the path towards a cleaner, more digitalized and decentralized system, yet one that is more connected and customer centric,' the report stated. The report states that the mobility players will have to consider the opportunities created by new uses and services associated with electric vehicles as decentralized energy resources. \</doc>

Delegates attending the Africa Climate Week holding March 18-22 in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, have been told to be wary of false solutions to the climate change phenomenon that fossil fuels industry trade associations promote to open Africa to the highest bidder. Climate justice groups fear that with the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) funding the talks and the discussions narrowed down to carbon trading and offsets, real solutions that communities on the frontline of the climate crisis advocate may be shoved aside. Regional and international level discussions on climate change have hitherto been hijacked by fossil fuels industry-backed trade groups like IETA that exploit the introduction of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement or market-based mechanisms to interfere and capture talks. At COP23 in Bonn an IETA board member led talks and was part of a country delegation. Dirty energy companies, mostly involved in coal mining were sponsors of the COP24 in Poland, and maximised the opportunity to burnish their image. The Africa Climate Week will focus on how engagement between State and non-State actors can be further strengthened in the key sectors for Africa including the role of future carbon markets to achieve enhanced climate action, towards the goals of sustainable development. Civil society groups insist that the funding of climate talks by fossil fuels industry-aligned groups interfere in the arrival at meaningful solutions and create a conflict of interest within governments and the UN system, thereby stalling progress in tackling climate change. Philip Jakpor of the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) said: 'The array of fossil fuel industry-aligned groups attending the Africa Climate Week leaves little hope for the African continent which carries the heavy burden of climate change. The impacted peoples on the continent have said time and again that the global fight against climate change rests primarily on non-market mechanisms and not commodification of the environment' LabramMusah of the Vision for Alternative Development (VALD) said: 'Except African delegates stand up for their people and advance actions needed to address the climate chaos, Big Polluters and their allies will inject dangerous propositions in the Climate Week talks to set the stage for them to dictate the outcomes of COP25' The groups urged African delegates to stand with impacted peoples on the African continent and across the world that recommend the following to confront the climate change crisis: keeping fossil fuels in the ground; rejection of false solutions that are displacing real, people-first solutions to the climate crisis; advance real solutions that are just, feasible and essential; honour climate finance obligations to developing countries; and end corporate interference in and capture of the climate talks. \</doc>

PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari yesterday called on African leaders to support processes that will ensure stronger political institutions across the continent. Only strong political institutions, he said, would guarantee stability, peace and economic progress. He spoke while receiving Letters of Credence from the Ambassador of the Republic of Guinea, Siaka Cissoko, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Buhari, in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said political reforms in African countries could only be sustainable when they reflect the will of the people and work towards improving their lives. 'I congratulate your President for the progress he is making politically and economically in Guinea. Nigeria will be most willing to render support for your forthcoming elections, where it is needed,' he said. 'I believe we are cooperating well at the sub-regional and continental level for political stability. And I hope your country plans to develop its mineral resources in partnership with its neighbours. Nigeria already has lots of experience in gas exploration and pipeline construction, and we can support your government,' he added. The Ambassador, in his remarks, noted that President Alfa Conde is in full solidarity with President Buhari, who had been championing reforms in ECOWAS and the African Union (AU). 'My President, your brother, has mandated me to convey his greetings and similarly mandated me to strengthen the bilateral relations by pooling resources together for the development of our countries,' he said. Also receiving Letters of Credence from the High Commissioner of the Republic of Kenya to Nigeria, Dr. Wilfred Gisuka Machage, Buhari said he was happy with the political maturity that trailed the conclusion of the elections in the country. 'I have written him formally to congratulate him for winning the elections. I am happy he has settled down to work,' the President noted. Machage assured the President that he would pursue the details of discussions and agreements between both countries, especially on promotion of agriculture. Also yesterday, Buhari congratulated the Ambassador of Poland to Nigeria, Joanna Magdalena Tarnawska, while receiving her Letters of Credence. He urged her to work towards improving the close ties between both countries. The President, who visited Poland in December, said he was delighted with the outcome of COP24 in Katowice and recounted his visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, in Oswiecim, Poland. The Ambassador of Poland noted that she would prioritise on improving relations, particularly on trade and commerce and defence and security. 'Mr. President, I am wishing you and the entire country peaceful elections, prosperity and stability,' she added. \</doc>

The World Bank Group has made several announcements to scale up support for both climate adaptation and mitigation in Africa, during the third One Planet Summit. According to a statement obtained from the website of the Bank, that was signed by its Interim President, Kristalina Georgieva, the summit was being convened by President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, President the France President, Emmanuel Macron, Interim President of the World Bank Group, Kristalina Georgieva, and Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed. The statement also noted that the World Bank Group was stepping up its climate support for Africa, "with continued strong support for IDA, the fund of the Bank for the world's poorest countries, this will provide $22.5 billion for Africa for climate adaptation and mitigation for the five years from 2021-2025." Georgieva, in the statement further noted that the support doubles the commitment to climate-related projects over the last five years, stating that the funding was part of the bank 2025 targets to step up climate action, launched in December 2018 during the UN's COP24 in Poland. According to Georgieva in the statement, "People across Africa are already experiencing the growing impacts of climate change. This region is particularly vulnerable to increasing floods, droughts and destructive storms. We have to do more and do it faster, or millions of people could be plunged into poverty. "That's why the World Bank is providing more money to build resilience and help communities cope with the effects of climate change in Africa. "It will help African countries manage the risks of a changing climate while unlocking new investment opportunities. IFC and MIGA, the Group's private sector arms, will also continue to ambitiously grow their climate activities in Africa. "Recognising that a number of countries in Africa are among the most vulnerable to global climate shocks and stresses, and in line with these new climate financing commitments and future direction of our Africa Climate Business Plan, more than half of the $22.5bn financing will be devoted to supporting adaptation and resilience in Africa. This will amount to about $12-$12.5 billion over five years from 2021-2025. "This year the World Bank will provide the government of Ethiopia with a results-based support program for adaptation and resilience, the largest done by the World Bank ever in Africa. The new operation, which is currently under preparation, will provide $500 million for results in improved watershed management and land administration systems. "People across Africa are already experiencing the growing impacts of climate change. This region is particularly vulnerable to increasing floods, droughts and destructive storms. We have to do more and do it faster, or millions of people could be plunged into poverty. That's why the World Bank is providing more money to build resilience and help communities cope with the effects of climate change in Africa." \</doc>

!-- Tropical drone aeria -- Tropical drone aeria On World Oceans Day, Fijian President Jioji Konrote on Friday stressed the importance of preserving the ocean for the world. The president also noted that Fijis leadership on the preservation of the worlds oceans is one of the most important tasks the nation has ever undertaken. The World Oceans Day is not only an opportunity to highlight the importance of the struggle to protect and preserve the oceans. It is also a celebration of the millions of men, women and children around the world who have committed themselves to making a difference in this struggle, Konrote said on the World Oceans Day. The president said that he is determined to persuade the nations of the world to take much more decisive actions to save the oceans. I know many of you have been directly involved in our global campaign for action on oceans, whether it was the UN World Oceans Conference in New York a year ago or the Oceans Pathway launched at COP23 that we will continue to co-chair with Sweden until 2020. And many of the same people have also been spearheading our fight for climate action across a broad front through Fijis Presidency of COP23, including the Talanoa Dialogue that is a cornerstone of that effort, he said. According to him, this is evidence in itself of the inextricable link between climate change and the health of our oceans. It is a simultaneous battle on two fronts. And whether you are part of Fijis national effort or our collective Pacific effort, you are all foot soldiers and standard bearers in this struggle, he added. In July, Pacific leaders will gather in Suva for the Climate Action Pacific Partnership Event and a Pacific Talanoa Dialogue as a prelude to the Talanoa Dialogue. Fiji will preside over with Poland at COP24 in December. While stressing that it will all be about raising ambition in the climate struggle, he appealed to the leaders of all the Pacific nations to join Fiji in Suva to set an example for the whole world of building a consensus for more ambition. The president urged Fijians to conserve and preserve marine areas, such as the 250 traditional tabu sites protected by the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Areas Network. His message on the World Oceans Day 2018 was oriented around conservation and preservation and of ambitious climate action. In a related development, Meg Taylor, secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, also urged the Pacific Islanders to make a pledge for healthier oceans. We share one ocean, we benefit from it immensely, from food on our tables to our economies as forum members, and I believe we should feel some sense of responsibility for its well-being. The Ocean is our home and will be key for our childrens and young peoples future, Taylor noted. \</doc>

The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, has identified sentiment, speculation and rumours as major determinants of developments in the global oil market. In his presentation at the Ninth IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks in Saudi Arabia, OPEC's Secretary-General, Dr. Mohammad Barkindo stated: "Unfortunately, the oil market can often be subjected to forces which are not grounded in fact, especially at times of disconnect between prices and market fundamentals. Sentiment, speculation and even rumours have been known to drive the market. The situation can be further complicated by computerised or automated trading, with algorithms, Big Data and AI playing important roles. "Energy outlooks are an antidote for this post-factual age. Indeed, our common currency, as it were, is fact-based data. Our industry is currently under siege from multiple fronts. Yet, some of these comments have tended to mischaracterise our objectives and misrepresent market realities. "A classic example of this is the persistent notion that oil is on the verge of demise. According to this belief, renewables are about to completely replace hydrocarbons and those who seek to discuss the nuances of this idea are downplaying the climate challenge." He said: "At OPEC, we are acutely conscious of the challenge of climate change. Our member countries continue to take appropriate policies, implement programmes and projects to tackle the challenges of climate change. COP24 in Katowice, OPEC reiterated that it remains fully engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement. Indeed, some of our member countries heavily invest in alternative sources of energy. For example, Saudi Arabia plans to generate some 59 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from solar and wind by 2030, and eventually produce upward of 200 GW from renewable sources." He said: "However, this is not a race to renewables alone; it's a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, OPEC emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency and its great enabler, technological innovation. "Given how our industry can be mischaracterised, the need for dialogue is all the greater. Consider the Ancient Greek roots of the word: 'dia' meaning through and 'logos' meaning reason or speech. And reasoned discussion, based on factual analysis, is crucial in this age of £lternative facts.' "Dialogue fosters transparency, which is another priority for our organisation. OPEC truly is an 'open book.' All our publications and data are available online, accessible via digital Apps to the general public free of charge. "Dialogue and transparency are indispensable to the multilateral system. OPEC will always align with the values at the heart of the multilateral system and affirms absolute conformity between its activities and principles, and the ideals of the UN. We are an intergovernmental organisation which has been registered at the UN Secretariat since 6 November 1962." He added: "These noble principles manifest themselves in the historic new chapter heralded in the oil industry through the 'Declaration of Cooperation' process. A win-win situation has developed and made a substantial contribution to the synchronous global economic growth seen in 2017-18. "Intensive discussions on further institutionalizing our cooperation are currently underway, as we finalize the draft 'Charter of Cooperation.' Given the achievements to date, it is no wonder that all parties are enthusiastic to further cement our cooperation through a collaborative approach. Looking forward, there can be no doubt that with the GCEF, IEF, IEA and OPEC working together, guided by reason, supported by facts, we can continue to meaningfully contribute to the industry and the global economy." \</doc>

Download logo Plans for the high-level segment at Africa Climate Week in Accra's International Convention Center are now taking shape. On the morning of Wednesday, 20 March, the week will be formally opened by the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo; Ghanaian actress and television personality, Joselyn Dumas; and COP24 President Micha Kurtyka. This curtain-raising ceremony will introduce a series of discussions throughout the course of the day that will feature prominent leaders, seeking to unlock barriers around enhanced national climate ambition, as well as issues relating to carbon pricing and markets. A new in-depth program, detailing Wednesday's activities and also the sessions for the remainder of the week, has now been published here. To date, the event has attracted upwards of 1,500 registrations  far surpassing previous attendance figures and hinting at the renewed significance of the Climate Weeks in relation to driving regional action to implement the Paris Agreement. The Climate Week will attract Ministers, policymakers, and non-Party stakeholders from businesses, community initiatives, financial institutions, and city municipalities across the African continent. To support these record participation numbers, United Nations Volunteers today put out a call for energetic people to facilitate the delivery of the Climate Week. Full details of the tasks involved, as well as information on how to apply, can be found here. The Accra event will act as a focal point for actors to showcase groundbreaking solutions to climate change. For example, a Pitch Hub and Knowledge Corner \- located in the heart of the Convention Center \- will provide a stage for specialists from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), climate change initiatives, and civil society organizations to share ideas with attendees. Meanwhile, the youth will enjoy a strong presence at the Climate Week \- leading on a number of side events to highlight youth-led initiatives, and will also convene a climate march to coincide with Wednesday's high-level segment. Africa is being severely impacted by climate change. From floods in the Lake Victoria basin to drought in Somalia, to environmental degradation in the Sahel region, climate change is a particular threat to continued economic growth and to livelihoods of vulnerable populations across the continent. However, while Africa is one of the lowest contributors to global emissions, it is leading the way by mitigating and adapting to climate impacts through climate action initiatives \- examples of which will be displayed at the conference center. The upcoming Africa Climate Week in Accra is the first 'Regional Climate Week' to be hosted this year which will be followed by the Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia-Pacific Climate Weeks. Collectively, these Climate Weeks will serve as critical stepping stones in the lead-up to the UN Secretary-General's Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019. Africa Climate Week is being co-convened by UN Climate Change, UN Environment, the West African Development Bank, UN Development Programme, World Bank Group, African Development Bank Group, and International Renewable Energy Agency, in collaboration with Climate Technology Centre & Network, UN Food and Agriculture, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, West African Alliance, Adaptation Fund and Climate and Clean Air Coalition. Other participating organizations include UN Global Climate Action, IRENA, UN Global Compact, WBCSD, ICLEI, Climate Resilience Network, CDP, SLOCAT, Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy, UN-Habitat, Nature4Climate, ICC, Global ABC, CIFOR, UCLG Africa, CIAT-CCAFS, ECREEE, and UN Volunteers.

The United Nations Conference on Trade And Development (UNCTAD) and the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, a Swiss civic group established by Bertrand Piccard's Solar Impulse Foundation are joining forces to promote renewable energy in Africa. UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant and Piccard have already signed a formal agreement during the 2018 United Nations climate change negotiations, the 24th Conference of the Parties ( COP24 ), currently taking place in Katowice, Poland, December 2- 14. "UNCTAD guides developing countries, including least developed countries (LDCs) such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, toward energy policies that support productive and sustainable economic activity. But we also aspire to connect governments looking for new solutions to the innovators that are working on them'', Durant said. "With this agreement, UNCTAD and the World Alliance will work together to introduce concrete solutions to Africa in support of Sustainable Development Goal 7 on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all." Piccard said: "Clean energies and technologies are able to provide social wealth, peace and stability to developing countries. The Solar Impulse Foundation and the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development are going to prove it through a collaboration that will bring profitable and clean solutions, to help with environmentally friendly growth, to the regions who need it the most." UNCTAD's Least Developed Countries Report 2017 found that more than 40% of businesses operating in these countries are held back by inadequate, unreliable and unaffordable electricity. On average, they suffered ten power outages per month, each lasting around five hours, costing them 7% of the value of their sales. More than 60% of the population in LDCs on average lacks access to electricity. Moreover, LDCs as a group have around just 8% of the capacity of other developing economies to generate electricity for each person, and barely 2% of that of wealthier nations. "There can be little economic activity and few development prospects, with such an absence of electricity," Ms. Durant said. "No entrepreneur, no multinational, no digital infrastructure, no start-up can properly function without it." Ms. Durant and Mr. Piccard also pledged to hold a joint workshop to link selected innovators with concrete solutions to an audience of African diplomatic representatives at the United Nations office in Geneva, Switzerland. UNCTAD is the United Nations body that supports developing countries to access the benefits of a globalized economy more fairly and effectively. Based in Geneva, UNCTAD provides analysis, facilitates consensus-building, and offers technical assistance to developing countries so that they can use trade, investment, finance, and technology as vehicles for inclusive and sustainable development. The World Alliance for Efficient Solutions, established by the Solar Impulse Foundation, assesses solutions submitted by its members and, with the help of independent technical and financial experts, selects promising ones to be presented to governments, businesses and institutions to encourage them to adopt more ambitious environmental targets and energy policies. Psychiatrist and aviator Bertrand Piccard was the first person to fly non-stop around the world in a balloon and was the pilot of Solar Impulse, a solar-powered aircraft that circumnavigated the globe in 2016. He is a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador.

!-- Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General. -- FILE PHOTO: Climate Change UN Secretary-General Antoacutenio Guterres has warned that the world is in "deep trouble'' due to climate change. Guterres gave the warning at the 24th Conference of Parties ( COP24 ) Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland on Monday. He told parties to the UN Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC) that the world could not afford to waste any more time before taking action on climate change. The 197 countries collectively agreed to keep global temperature rises to no more than two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels, and if possible, to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees centigrade. "Now in Poland, they have to agree on how they will achieve this collectively, we cannot fail in Katowice," the UN chief said. He highlighted four key messages for the thousands of representatives of the world's nations, non-profit organisations, UN agencies, and private sector companies gathered in Katowice. According to Guterres, climate change is already a matter of life and death for many people, nations and countries of the world, as the science is telling us we need to move faster. "Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption. "Last year, I visited Barbuda and Dominica, which were devastated by hurricanes. The destruction and suffering I saw was heartbreaking," he said, noting "these emergencies are preventable. "If we fail, the Arctic and Antarctic will continue to melt, corals will bleach and then die, the oceans will rise, more people will die from air pollution, water scarcity will plague a significant proportion of humanity, and the cost of disasters will skyrocket", he warned. He insisted on the need to operationalise the Paris Agreement and reminded Member States that 2018 is the deadline that they set for themselves to finalise the guidelines for implementation. "We need a unifying implementation vision that sets out clear rules, inspires action and promotes raised ambition, based on the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances. "We achieved success in Paris because negotiators were working toward a common goal," and called for urgent collaboration to "ensure that the bonds of trust established in Paris will endure''. "We need concerted resource mobilisation and investment to successfully combat climate change, we must start today building the tomorrow we want.'' In 2015, a total of 18 high-income nations committed to providing 100 billion dollars annually by 2020, to lower-income nations to support their climate action. Guterres urged developed nations to deliver on this commitment while urging the Member States "to swiftly implement the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund. It is an investment in a safer, less costly future". \</doc>

Plans for UN Environment's 'Last Game at the North Pole' were taken to the next level at the COP24 Climate conference in Katowice, with world class athletes pledging to join the historic ice hockey match played against the backdrop of disappearing ice in the Arctic, and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) signing on as an official partner. The Last Game - UN Environment's flagship project to stimulate climate action through sports, to be held in April 2019 - is spearheaded by UN Environment Patron for Polar Regions Viacheslav ('Slava') Fetisov and has received the backing, among others, of UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres, Pope Francis and Prince Albert II of Monaco. Beyond its institutional backing, the International Ice Hockey Federation will provide support on the ground - or rather, on the ice. Its President, Ren\'e9 Fasel, has volunteered to be the referee of this unique awareness-raising undertaking. The event is now an officially-recognized international ice hockey game, supported by the IIHF. Mr Fasel, who as a Swiss national further symbolises the Last Game's neutrality, will oversee the match, which will see two teams featuring celebrities from different sports disciplines face each other at the North Pole. 'The IIHF is honoured to be involved with this initiative to combat one of the most serious challenges facing the modern world. Climate change will impact everyone in the coming years, we have to take a more responsible role as stewards of our environment and look for new and innovative ways to raise awareness on this pressing issue', said Ren\'e9 Fasel. The way in which sport can trigger global citizen climate action has echoed strongly throughout the Climate Conference in Katowice. Slava Fetisov presented the Last Game through a series of events and in numerous bilateral meetings aimed at triggering additional support for the project. The discussion on how to ensure that the Last Game can create the biggest positive impact involved ministers from the Arctic and other countries, heads of relevant UN organizations but also the International Olympic Committee, of which IIHF is a member. In the meantime, the International Paralympic Committee became an official partner for the project and will also have its player on the ice floe - the Canadian sledge hockey World Championship gold medallist Derek Whitson. Iceland will furthermore be sending the world's fittest woman (2011-2012) and cross-fit professional athlete Annie Thorisdottir to take part in The Last Game. 'In all my meetings in my first global climate conference, I was thrilled to see how big the potential of The Last Game is. The enthusiasm of everyone I spoke to in Katowice - politicians, UN officials, ordinary delegates, media or civil society - about the contribution that the initiative can bring to raise awareness on climate change convinces me that this is exactly the action we now need to undertake,' said Slava Fetisov when leaving the conference. As one of Earth's most fragile ecosystems, the Arctic is disproportionally affected by climate change and warming at twice the average rate of the rest of the planet. The Last Game intends to boost climate action by individuals and organizations around the world, through the powerful voice of sports. \</doc>

President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday expressed concern over global crises, saying that those fanning the embers of crises are ignorants and illiterates. In an apparent reference to the communal crises and killings in Cross Rivers State and other parts of Nigeria, said illiteracy and ignorance propel people to format crises. The President stated this after taking a guided tour of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, a former Nazi concentration camp in Poland, on Tuesday. The President had visited the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, in Oswiecim, Poland, where he paid tribute to Holocaust victims. After an hour and 10 minutes guided tour of the Museum, devoted to the memory of the victims who died at both camps during World War II, President Buhari penned a hand-written tribute in the visitor's book, quoting Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar'. 'The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones'. Also speaking on the crises back home in Nigeria, President Buhari said those who fan the embers of crises do so because they are ignorants and illiterates The President called on Nigerians to eschew bitterness, in a separate statement where he called for calm The President's guided tour of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, took him to places where many of the victims, who were mainly Jews, were killed using gas chambers specially designed by the Germans The President was informed that the Museum in modern day Poland , is now devoted to the memory of the victims who died during World War II. The Polish government has also encourage research into Holocaust , using facilities and historical materials discovered after the World War 11, which are well protected inside the Museum. The President also laid a wreath at Block 11 of the museum, known as the ''Death block.'' Here, according to an epitaph in the Block: 'Male and female prisoners from all parts of the camp complex where held in this building following brutal interrogations, they were in most cases sentenced to death by shooting.' Later and shortly before leaving the Museum, which includes the Nazi concentration camps Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau, President Buhari, fielding questions from State House Correspondents traveling with him, described those fanning embers of discord in Nigeria as 'illiterates and ignorant.' President Muhammadu Buhari had earlier expressed concern over reports of violence in fourcommunities in Biase Local Government Area of Cross River State resulting in loss of lives, injuries and displacement of villagers. Buhari called for calm and restoration of peace in the affected communities bordering Abia State, and urged the people of the areas to allow law and order to prevail. 'Our communities must be ready to live together in peace since no development can take place in an atmosphere of recurring violence,' President Buhari, who commended the State Government for the steps taken so far towards bringing peace to the areas, also lauded the State Police Command for speedily mobilizing its personnel to the affected communities to contain the crisis. He urged all stakeholders to cooperate and ensure that lasting peace returned to the affected areas. The President had also attended the opening of the UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice, delivered his national address at the 12-day meeting of COP24 , met with several world leaders and visited the impressive Nigerian pavilion at the climate summit, and conducted a town -hall meeting with Nigerians in Poland, a day after his arrival in the country. \</doc>

"He visited me when l was convalescing. It is really me, l assure you. I will soon celebrate my 76th birthday and l'm still going strong. I only get harassed by my grandchildren; they are getting too many," the President joked. President Buhari who expressed happiness at the report by the Nigerian Ambassador to Poland, Eric Adagogo Bell-Gam, also told the audience that his administration had degraded Boko Haram who used to control about 17 local governments but now only adopt hit and run method in their attacks on innocent citizens. "This is because they understand the terrain better. It is not easy financing the war against terror." The president, while lamenting the state of infrastructure in the country, regretted that they were nothing to write home when he took over power, adding: "But now, we have been fighting that." On the state of the economy, the president said Nigeria had virtually stopped the importation of food, especially rice. "I'm trying to save a lot of money, l only go out when it is necessary. My priority is to secure Nigeria." Responding to question on the falling standard of education across the country, he said he was always upset seeing little children carrying plates begging for food. "I am always upset when l see little children taking bowls about begging for food. They are being denied education. Educated people are removed from ethnicity and religious politics, which is a major problem we are having in our country," he said. READ ALSO:\~Don't politicise religion in Nigeria \</doc>

Director General of the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESRA), Dr Lawrence Anukam, has said that recent statistics from the Centre for Management Development, has revealed that an estimated 60 million Nigerians spent about N1.6 trillion on generators annually. Anukam, who made this disclosure at a press briefing on the implementation of the National Generator Emission Control Programme (NGECP) in Abuja, stated that atmospheric pollution is gradually becoming a serious menace in Nigerian cities. He said that the menace was becoming dangerous in the metropolitan areas, where the use of power generating sets have become an alternative to the power supply. He stated that WHO Report in the year 2016, holds that ambient air pollution was responsible for 4.2 million deaths worldwide, while it is estimated to cause 16 per cent of the lung cancer for deaths, 25 per cent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 17 per cent of ischemic heart disease and stroke and 26 per cent of respiratory infection deaths. However he said, the wide range and indiscriminate use of these generators for both domestic and industrial power supply and the quantum of harmful pollutant such as Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Carbon monoxide (CO), and partially unburnt hydrocarbons emitted have contributed greatly to the poor air quality which negatively affects the environment and human health. He said: 'Many cities around the world, particularly in developing countries like Nigeria, are experiencing rapid growth; yet in the absence of adequate environmental policy and action, this growth is occurring at considerable, and often increasing economic and social costs. 'The increase in pollution and economic development has escalated the proliferation of industries, use of motor vehicles and the use of generators as alternative energy sources has led to the prevalent. Worldwide air pollution situation which poses a serious environmental threat globally.' The NESRA boss added: 'NESRA in its duties, has the responsibility to enforce compliance with provisions of international agreements; one of such agreement is the United Nations Frame Work Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which led to the adoption of the 2015 Paris Agreement. 'Under the agreement, each countries submitted an emission reduction proposal known as the Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC's), at the conference, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari pledged that Nigeria would reduce its greenhouse emissions by 20% conditionally and 45% unconditionally. 'He reiterated the commitment in subsequent COPS and even at COP24 in Poland this year. As part of Nationally determined contribution (NDC) strategies, is considering 30% of energy efficiency in industries, homes, businesses vehicles and renewable energy. 'The commitment strives to build a climate resilient society across the diverse terrain of Nigeria. It involves measures being considered in setting standards for appliances, generators, buildings and climate smart agriculture.' Anukam further explained that the NGCP, is a strategy aimed at cutting down emission of pollutants from generators (stationary source). He said that the programme is being implemented under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) and will involve periodic testing of generators for toxic emissions. He stated: 'Considering the urgency of the Federal government to see that the implementation of this programme begins, it has become pertinent to give serious consideration to the timeframe and the proposal kick-off date of January 2019 for the full implementation of the programme. 'To ensure that the NGECP becomes a reality, NESREA cannot do it alone, therefore, we are calling on all our respective stakeholders and the general public to join hands with NESREA and make it a reality.' \</doc>

President Muhammadu Buhari reacted for the first time on Sunday to rumours that he is not the real Person elected by Nigerians but a look-alike double from Sudan, known as Jubril. He declared: ''It's real me, I assure you. I will soon celebrate my 76th birthday and I will still go strong.'' President Muhammadu Buhari was speaking in Krakow, Poland, when he met Nigerians living in the country. For sometime, the fake news industry claimed that the Nigerian President is an impostor. The issue was raised by one of the Nigerians. But an unruffled Buhari reaffirmed his authentic identity. ''A lot of people hoped that I died during my ill health. Some even reached out to the Vice President to consider them to be his deputy because they assumed I was dead. That embarrassed him a lot and of course, he visited me when I was in London convalescing... It's real me; I assure you,'' he declared. The Nigerian leader said he was looking forward to celebrating his 76th birthday on December 17 and jocularly added: ''If I am getting harassed by anyone, it is my grandchildren, who are getting too many.'' The President used the occasion to reiterate that his government will continue to maintain focus and deliver on the three focal points of his campaign in 2015: security, economy and the fight against corruption. ''Those in the North East will tell you that in spite of the recent setbacks, there is a difference between the time we came and before. ''We are not doing badly on security, economy and agriculture. We have virtually stopped the importation of food especially rice and we are saving a lot of money. ''We now have food security and that has come with fiscal security because a lot of young educated people have not regretted going back to the farms and earning a respectable living. ''I am afraid, this is not receiving good publicity... but a lot of people in the rural areas are enjoying the benefits of our interventions in agriculture,'' he said. President Buhari, who is in Poland to attend the UN Climate Change Conference, COP24 reaffirmed that no territory of Nigeria is under the control of Boko Haram terrorists, calling on Nigerians to remain vigilant and supportive of Federal Government's efforts to ensure the security of lives and property in the country. While acknowledging that it has not been easy financing the security sector in the country, the President said the Nigerian Armed Forces were equal to the task. The President noted that it was regrettable that herdsmen and farmers clashes in the country have been politicised, assuring that the Nigerian government will continue to prioritise security because that is what many investors consider first before investing in the country. On the fight against corruption, he said all recovered stolen assets will be sold and the proceeds returned to the treasury for the benefit of Nigerians. On women representation in his government, the President told the meeting: ''I have plans for all Nigerians. I am not a male chauvinist. If I'm a chauvinist will I give the Finance Ministry to women?'' In his remarks, the Ambassador of Nigeria to Poland, Mr Eric Adagogo Bell-Gam praised Nigerians living in the country for being worthy ambassadors of the country. Among those who met President Buhari were Mr Larry Ugwu, an Artist and Curator, who has lived in Poland for 40 years and has contributed immensely to promoting Nigerian cultural heritage in the Polish society; Anthony Egwuatu, a Gynaecologist, who has lived in the country for 30 years and Mr Olomofe Larry, a human rights activist, who has fought for justice for fellow Nigerians in the host country, among several others.

Download logo The World Bank Group today made several announcements to scale up support for both climate adaptation and mitigation in Africa during the third One Planet Summit. The summit is being convened by President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Interim President of the World Bank Group, Kristalina Georgieva, and Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed. The World Bank Group is stepping up its climate support for Africa. With continued strong support for IDA, our fund for the world's poorest countries, this will provide $22.5 billion for Africa for climate adaptation and mitigation for the five years from 2021-2025. This more than doubles the commitment to climate-related projects over the last five years. The funding is part of the Bank Group's 2025 Targets to Step Up Climate Action, launched in December 2018 during the UN's COP24 in Poland. It will help African countries manage the risks of a changing climate while unlocking new investment opportunities. IFC and MIGA, the Group's private sector arms, will also continue to ambitiously grow their climate activities in Africa. Recognizing that a number of countries in Africa are among the most vulnerable to global climate shocks and stresses, and in line with these new climate financing commitments and future direction of our Africa Climate Business Plan, more than half of the $22.5bn financing will be devoted to supporting adaptation and resilience in Africa. This will amount to about $12-$12.5 billion over five years from 2021-2025. This year, for example, the World Bank will provide the government of Ethiopia with a results-based support program for adaptation and resilience, the largest done by the World Bank ever in Africa. The new operation, which is currently under preparation, will provide $500 million for results in improved watershed management and land administration systems. "People across Africa are already experiencing the growing impacts of climate change. This region is particularly vulnerable to increasing floods, droughts and destructive storms," said Interim President of the World Bank Group, Kristalina Georgieva. "We have to do more and do it faster, or millions of people could be plunged into poverty. That's why the World Bank is providing more money to build resilience and help communities cope with the effects of climate change in Africa." In addition, the World Bank, will carry out intensive Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) engagements with Rwanda and Kenya, under the framework of the NDC Partnership, and with generous support from Germany's BMZ. The engagements will help accelerate the implementation of, and raise the level of ambition for, their NDCs by supporting systematic mainstreaming and institutionalization of climate adaptation and mitigation across and within key development sectors and governance levels. The World Bank \- as trustee of the Carbon Initiative for Development (Ci-Dev) trust fund \- and Kenya Tea Development Agency Power Company Ltd. (KTDA Power) signed an Emission Reductions Purchase Agreement (ERPA). The contract purchases carbon credits from small hydropower plants, providing power to 350,000 smallholder tea farmers and 39 of their regional tea factories in Kenya. The new ERPA brings the Ci-Dev portfolio to more than $73 million in implementation. IFC syndicated a loan for KTDA, and the carbon revenues from Ci-Dev helped increase the project's debt service coverage ratio and improved the bankability of the project. KTDA is a long-standing private sector partner of IFC. In addition to the hydropower project, IFC invested in a Mombasa warehouse project and supported KTDA with various advisory activities such as financial literacy training for farmers, soil testing for productivity improvement and as development of a wood sourcing strategy among others. IFC was also named Green Bond Development Bank of 2018 at this year's Green Bond Pioneer Awards. IFC was awarded this premier recognition for its global leadership, best practice, and innovation in green finance for products such as the inaugural Forests Bond in Kenya, which was a first-of-its kind solution to build capital markets infrastructure to catalyze funding into forest protection.

That is the message from African delegates as the world prepares to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change in Katowice, Poland, this week. Research shows that when women are involved in decision making, agreements on the environment are more likely to be ratified and projects around natural resources, such as water, are more likely to succeed. If given access to education and finance, African women can contribute to finding technological solutions and driving the continent's renewable energy industry too. "When you empower women in the context of climate change you empower a family, a community and a country," says Dana Elhassan, senior gender expert at the African Development Bank ( HYPERLINK http://www.AfDB.org www.AfDB.org ), which allocates international funds to development projects. "You cannot solve a problem with half the team. A lot of the unpaid work that women do, such as collecting firewood and water, and caring for the family, are massively affected by climate change \- so we have to make sure adaptation initiatives address their needs, vulnerabilities and potential." Women as agents of change Studies show that when women are part of decision making, ratification of multilateral agreements on the environment are more likely, adds Mafalda Duarte, head of the $8.3 billion Climate Investment Fund, one of the largest climate financing instruments in the world. There is also strong evidence that women play a vital role in dealing with disasters by mobilising communities \- something that will become increasingly important as climate change advances, she says. "Discourse is quite tilted to considering women as victims of climate change \- but we are agents of change and if we are perceived as such this will make a big difference," says Ms Duarte. "Our empowerment represents greatly under-utilised opportunities to build our economies and tackle climate change." When women are empowered \- given access to finance, assets and decision making \- there are big impacts across sectors, she adds. "Renewable energy is traditionally seen as a male sector but if you are deliberate in giving access to women, they become entrepreneurs and help us push forward that agenda," says Ms Duarte. Women can drive business and technology solutions When women are empowered equally to men there is a massive leap forward in economic gains: a recent McKinsey study found that if women were participating economically as much as men, they would be adding 28 trillion dollars to global GDP by 2025. In Africa, lack of access to finance has resulted in an estimated $42 billion financing gap for women entrepreneurs across business value chains. Yet unlocking African women's ingenuity and giving them access to finance could generate technological advancements that help deal with climate change, believes the African Development Bank. As mobile phone technology has proven, Africa is capable of leapfrogging into an era of digitisation, which minimises risks and cuts costs of doing business. African women have shown potential to compete in this digital work-space \- Mfarm, AppsTech, JuaKali, Nandimobile, Hehe Ltd, Obami, DotNxt, are only a few of the women-led tech startups in Africa listed by Forbes. "If we women are given the right platforms, we will achieve the change we wish to see in the world," says Ms Duarte. Unlocking investment in African women holds incredible return and transformational impact potential. Women form the backbone of African economies, accounting for a majority of small- and medium-sized businesses and dominating the agriculture sector as primary producers and food processors, COP24 is the 24th conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This year countries are preparing to implement the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the world's global warming to no more than 2C.

''A lot of people hoped that I died during my ill health. Some even reached out to the Vice President to consider them to be his deputy because they assumed I was dead. That embarrassed him a lot and of course, he visited me when I was in London convalescing It's real me; I assure you,'' he declared. The Nigerian leader said he was looking forward to celebrating his 76th birthday on December 17 and jocularly added: ''If I am getting harassed by anyone, it is my grandchildren, who are getting too many.'' The President used the occasion to reiterate that his government will continue to maintain focus and deliver on the three focal points of his campaign in 2015: security, economy and the fight against corruption. ''Those in the North East will tell you that in spite of the recent setbacks, there is a difference between the time we came and before. ''We are not doing badly on security, economy and agriculture. We have virtually stopped the importation of food especially rice and we are saving a lot of money. ''We now have food security and that has come with fiscal security because a lot of young educated people have not regretted going back to the farms and earning a respectable living. ''I am afraid, this is not receiving good publicity but a lot of people in the rural areas are enjoying the benefits of our interventions in agriculture,'' he said. President Buhari, who is in Poland to attend the UN Climate Change Conference, COP24 reaffirmed that no territory of Nigeria is under the control of Boko Haram terrorists, calling on Nigerians to remain vigilant and supportive of Federal Government's efforts to ensure the security of lives and property in the country. While acknowledging that it has not been easy financing the security sector in the country, the President said the Nigerian Armed Forces were equal to the task. The President noted that it was regrettable that herdsmen and farmers clashes in the country have been politicised, assuring that the Nigerian government will continue to prioritise security because that is what many investors consider first before investing in the country. On the fight against corruption, he said all recovered stolen assets will be sold and the proceeds returned to the treasury for the benefit of Nigerians. On women representation in his government, the President told the meeting: ''I have plans for all Nigerians. I am not a male chauvinist. If I'm a chauvinist will I give the Finance Ministry to women?'' In his remarks, the Ambassador of Nigeria to Poland, Mr Eric Adagogo Bell-Gam praised Nigerians living in the country for being worthy ambassadors of the country. Among those who met President Buhari were Mr Larry Ugwu, an Artist and Curator, who has lived in Poland for 40 years and has contributed immensely to promoting Nigerian cultural heritage in the Polish society; Anthony Egwuatu, a Gynaecologist, who has lived in the country for 30 years and Mr Olomofe Larry, a human rights activist, who has fought for justice for fellow Nigerians in the host country, among several others. The event was put together and anchored by Hon. Abike Dabiri, Senior Special Assistant to the President, Diaspora. \</doc>

Download logo Africa Climate Week in Accra, Ghana, got firmly underway this morning with the commencement of the high-level segment at the capital's Convention Center. Speaking at the Opening Ceremony  President of the Republic of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo; Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation; Prof. Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng; Mayor of Accra, Mohammed Adjei Sowah, COP24 President, Micha Kurtyka and UN Climate Change Deputy Executive Secretary, Ovais Sarmad \- affirmed the need to foster cooperation from all countries and non-Party stakeholders globally to meet the 1.5C temperature goal inked in the Paris Agreement. The event takes place in the shadows of Cyclone Idai, which has hit Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, affecting more than 2 million people \- a stark reminder of the moral imperative to act on climate change, which experts say is exacerbating such storms. Delegates attending the Climate Week \- who number close to 3,000 \- observed a one-minute silence for the victims of the catastrophe, which continues to devastate coastlines along Southern Africa. Media, policymakers and private sector representatives huddled into the Main Hall to welcome the President of the Republic of Ghana who said that, against the backdrop of the disastrous cyclone, Africa Climate Week must "provide more practical solutions to channel financial means towards national climate ambition." The International Finance Corporation has already put a figure on the investment opportunity of financing these solutions, estimating that the NDCs of 21 emerging market economies alone represents $23 trillion by 2030. The President \- who is both the host of the event and an Ambassador for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \- also used his keynote speech to underscore how "climate change is the biggest threat to the attainment of the whole development agenda." This critical interlinkage between the climate and development agendas was a recurring theme throughout the course of Wednesday's high-level activities \- and echoed by many pan-African Ministers \- but it was perhaps best expressed by the Mayor of Accra and C40 Vice-Chair, Mohammed Adjei Sowah, who said: "I am committing our city to a plan in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and, simultaneously, in line with the SDGs." Acting as Master of Ceremonies during the Opening, Joselyn Dumas \- a Ghanaian TV Host and Philanthropist \- asked assembled speakers and guests to be mindful of future generations when considering their responsibilities to the environment: "When we neglect our environment, let us remember that we are denying many children the opportunity to a healthy, bright and happy future. Every child deserves a safe space to learn, play, grow and thrive." However, the overriding message being heard at this Regional Climate Week, is that this 'bright and happy future' will be largely compromised without the proper financing, which also needs to be de-risked to encourage flows of finance to the 54 African nations. There are some positive signals: the World Bank last week announced $22.5 billion over 2021-2025 in climate support in Africa \- a commitment which acted as a precursor to their co-hosting of a 'Carbon Pricing Day' on the margins of the Africa Climate Week, highlighting how innovative policies and programs can mobilize climate investments, drive social benefits, and reduce carbon pollutions But as the Director of the UNEP DTU Partnership, John Christensen, pointed out during his closing remarks before the lunchbreak, "to attract private sector investments towards climate action projects, we need clear plans and clear ambition." What this means is that, with the right enabling frameworks in place, public finance can be used more strategically to attract private sector players and scale-up clean energy investment. This reality-check was softened somewhat with the launch of the Mohammed VI Prize for Climate and Sustainable Development \- timed between the two main plenary events \- which Deputy Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, Ovais Sarmad, stated is a clear example of how "African leadership will benefit the whole world, leaving no one behind, in particular, the most vulnerable." Africa Climate Week will conclude on Friday afternoon, where its outcomes will be presented to the Special Envoy for UN Climate Action Summit, Luis Alfonso de Alba, as critical input to the Secretary-General's event on 23 September. Africa Climate Week is the first of three annual regional climate events this year \- the latter two being the Latin America & Caribbean Climate Week and the Asia Pacific Climate Week \- information around each of these events will be released shortly. The Africa Climate Week is being orchestrated by a number of core partners, including World Bank Group, African Development Bank, West African Development Bank, CTCN, UNEP, UNEP DTU Partnership, UNDP, IETA, Marrakech Partnership and UN Climate Change. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). \</doc>

The Anglo-Dutch oil and gas super major, Shell, is out of the woods, so says the Managing Director of the big oil's subsidiary in Nigeria, Osagie Okunbor. Though he did not any detail, Okunbor simply said, ''Shell Petroleum Development Company is already out of the woods through the hard work of her staff.'' He spoke during their end of year party and 60th anniversary in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. At the event, Governor Nyesom Wike used the occasion to call on international oil majors to locate their headquarters in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's main oil region where they are operating. Governor Wike said that it was unfair that oil majors drill oil in the Niger Delta, only to pay taxes in other states, adding, ''you find this region comfortable to drill oil and generate revenue which sustains the entire country. But when it comes to the location of your headquarters, very many excuses emerge. ''Those who talk about insecurity in the Niger Delta forget that they are secure enough to work on oil fields in different communities. ''This level of injustice is not good for any country. I hear that majority of your workers receive their salaries in Lagos and Abuja, with their taxes deducted at those locations. ''We want you to return to our states and energise our communities with your presence. I am interested in the revenue that will accrue to this state and other Niger Delta states by the presence of your headquarters. ''If this oil was in the North or in the West, would the headquarters of the oil majors be located in the Niger Delta? Certainly, not'', Governor Wike said. On next year's general elections, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governor urged oil workers to participate in the process to ensure the emergence of quality leaders who will rescue the country. He accordingly commended the staff of Shell for keeping the company afloat despite the undisclosed numerous operational challenges the company was said to have faced. Okunbor had earlier commended Governor Wike for his commitment to creating the right operational environment in the state and also thanked him for working with stakeholders to ensure that one of their major facilities closed for one year was opened through peaceful means. Shell is one of the world's largest polluters and has a long track record of obstructing climate policymaking. In 2013, the giant oil corporation was found guilty of environmental crimes in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's polluted oil region. ''We have a message for Shell and companies that pretend the solution to the climate catastrophe doesn't demand the end of fossil fuels. To the Shell executives who got rich from the suffering of the Ogoni people and communities living on the frontlines of dirty energy and climate change impacts we say: You are the last gasp of a system on the way out. You are on the wrong side of history. We will not rest until you stop extracting fossil fuels and pay for the damage you have caused.'' \- Sara Shaw, Friends of the Earth International ''In the Niger Delta we have endured 60 years of gross oil pollution, gas flares and human rights abuses. Today the world has 12 years to right the wrongs. Shell and their cohorts must be kicked out of the COP and held to account.'' \- Nnimmo Bassey, Health of Mother Earth Foundation. Communities directly impacted by the abusive practices of the oil major spoke out as fossil-fuel trade association IETA hosted representatives from the Big Polluter for an event at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's 24th conference of the parties ( COP24 ). <figure><figcaption>Photo: R-L: Gov.

Governments have adopted a robust set of guidelines for implementing the landmark 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. This, according to negotiators, should lead to a new era of global climate action that would begin under the Paris climate change agreement. The implementation of the agreement will benefit people from all walks of life, especially the most vulnerable. The agreed 'Katowice Climate Package' is designed to operationalise the climate change regime contained in the Paris Agreement. Under the auspices of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat, it will promote international cooperation and encourage greater ambition. The guidelines will promote trust among nations that all countries are playing their part in addressing the challenge of climate change. With 197 Parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has near universal membership and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement. The main aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep a global average temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The ultimate objective of all agreements under the UNFCCC is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development. The President of COP24 , Mr. Michal Kurtyka of Poland, said: "All nations have worked tirelessly. All nations showed their commitment. All nations can leave Katowice with a sense of pride, knowing that their efforts have paid off. The guidelines contained in the Katowice Climate Package provide the basis for implementing the agreement as of 2020". The Katowice package includes guidelines that will operationalize the transparency framework. It sets out how countries will provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that describe their domestic climate actions. This information includes mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries. The package also includes guidelines that relate to: \'b7 The process for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow-on from the current target of mobilizing USD 100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries \'b7 How to conduct the Global Stocktake of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023 \'b7 How to assess progress on the development and transfer of technology The UN's Climate Chief, Ms. Patricia Espinosa said: "This is an excellent achievement! The multilateral system has delivered a solid result. This is a roadmap for the international community to decisively address climate change". "The guidelines that delegations have been working on day and night are balanced and clearly reflect how responsibilities are distributed amongst the world's nations", she said. "They incorporate the fact that countries have different capabilities and economic and social realities at home, while providing the foundation for ever increasing ambition", she added. The agreed guidelines mean that countries can now establish the national systems that are needed for implementing the Paris Agreement as of 2020. The same will be done at the international level. Functioning together, these systems will ensure that nations can act in an atmosphere of trust and assess progress of their climate actions. "While some details will need to be finalised and improved over time, the system is to the largest part place", Ms. Espinosa said. The main issues still to be resolved concern the use of cooperative approaches, as well as the sustainable development mechanism, as contained in the Paris Agreement's article 6. These would allow countries to meet a part of their domestic mitigation goals through the use of so-called "market mechanisms". Market mechanisms provide flexible instruments for reducing the costs of cutting emissions, such as carbon markets. Here, the Paris Agreement recognizes the need for global rules to safeguard the integrity of all countries' efforts. These global rules are important to ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. In this way, progress towards the emission limitation goals of the Paris Agreement can be accurately measured. "From the beginning of the COP, it very quickly became clear that this was one area that still required much work and that the details to operationalize this part of the Paris Agreement had not yet been sufficiently explored", explained Ms. Espinosa. "After many rich exchanges and constructive discussions, the greatest majority of countries were willing to agree and include the guidelines to operationalize the market mechanisms in the overall package", she said. "Unfortunately, in the end, the differences could not be overcome". Because of this, countries have agreed to finalise the details for market mechanisms in the coming year in view of adopting them at the next UN Climate Change Conference (COP25). \</doc>

THE United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference ( COP24 ) kicked off yesterday in Katowice, Poland, with a conclusion by President Muhammadu Buhari that no nation can confront climate change alone. He urged UN-member countries to rededicate themselves to the task of rebuilding and restoring a healthy environment for future generations. His call came as the World Bank announced plans to double its investments in the fight against climate change. It announced $200 billion to tackle the menace. In his welcoming remarks, Poland's President Andrzej Duda told delegates that the location where a coal mine was once operated was specifically picked for the conference. He said Katowice had become one of the greenest cities in Poland. Addressing other world leaders at the opening, President Buhari warned that the challenges of climate change, including rising temperatures, desertification, floods, low agricultural yields and drying up of water bodies, were enormous and evident to all. He spoke in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. Citing the receding Lake Chad, the President noted that the effects of climate change were felt more on vulnerable communities, which lacked the capacity and technology to address such challenges. He said: 'Obviously, no country can confront the phenomenon alone. In this regard, Nigeria believes in joint and cooperative efforts to tackle the problem. ''We urge that efforts to address the challenges of climate change be pursued within multilateral frameworks. Concerted efforts should be made to strengthen sub-regional and regional organisations, to serve as hubs for Climate Action and partnership.'' Speaking on Lake Chad, the President reaffirmed that Nigeria was committed to saving the Lake, which is a source of livelihood to 40 million people. He said Nigeria would build on the success of an International Conference held in February in Abuja to create additional awareness globally on the serious environmental and security challenges facing the Lake Chad region. The President told the audience, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, that a consensus was reached at the Abuja Conference that an inter-basin water transfer from the Congo Basin remained the most sustainable option available to resuscitate and safeguard this precious water body that was once the sixth largest fresh water Lake in the world. On behalf of the member countries of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC), President Buhari thanked the Italian government for donating 1.5 million Euros towards completion of the feasibility studies on the proposed inter-basin water transfer project. He said: 'I once again call on the international community to support this worthy project, for the benefit of nearly 40 million people that depend on the Lake for their livelihood, and to guarantee future security of the region. ''I would like to reiterate Nigeria's commitment to constructively supporting multilateral action aimed at addressing climate change. 'We must rededicate ourselves to the task of rebuilding and restoring the healthy environment we inherited for future generations.' Buhari used the occasion to highlight what Nigeria had done and doing on climate change after adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015. He said: 'We in Nigeria have commenced the implementation of our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 'In the next 15 years, we aim to achieve 20 per cent emissions reduction below Business as Usual (BAU) and 45 per cent emissions reduction with the support of our international partners by 2030. ''Our efforts include the review and introduction of new responsive legislation/policies, strengthening institutional and manpower capacities, and encouraging gradual transition to low carbon economy. ''Nigeria has also recently ratified the Doha Amendment and will soon deposit the instrument for ratification.'' The President pledged that Nigeria would continue to pursue industrialisation and economic development, with sound environmental management and best practices. According to him, Nigeria has unlocked the potential of its sovereign green bond to galvanise private capital to finance environmentally sustainable projects. ''In support of our NDC aspiration, we have embraced the issuance of green bond as an innovative and alternative source of funding projects that would reduce emissions and provide robust climate infrastructure like renewable energy, low carbon transport, water infrastructure and sustainable agriculture that our country needs,'' he said. He restated Nigeria's belief that technology could be a powerful solution for simultaneously addressing climate change and advancing development, stressing the need for developed countries to accelerate the finance for research and development, in addition to promoting access to climate-friendly technologies. He said: ''In addition, there is the need to raise global climate action in the pre-2020 period, in terms of mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. ''For us in Nigeria, we are promoting technologies and practices, such as sustainable land management, climate resilient agriculture, water efficiency and clean energy. ''We have also developed insurance-based initiatives to deal with loss and damage, as well as adaptation to internally acceptable practices.'' \</doc>

Facing a world where trust \- trust in national institutions, trust among states and trust in the rules-based global order \- is at a breaking point, Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres set the stage for the 73rd general debate of the United Nations with a call to rebuild solidarity, repair broken trust and reinvigorate the spirit of multi-lateralism. "As guardians of the common good, we also have a duty to promote and support a reformed, reinvigorated and strengthened multilateral system," said the Secretary-General, addressing the annual gathering of world leaders at UN Headquarters on Tuesday. "We need commitment to a rules-based order, with the United Nations at its centre and with the different institutions and treaties that bring the Charter to life  There is no way forward but collective, common-sense action for the common good." Guterres' annual opening message, which draws from his yearly report on the work of the Organization, also highlighted the persisting challenges facing the people and the planet, including the seemingly unending conflicts in Syria and Yemen, the suffering of the Rohingya people and the threat of terrorism, non-proliferation and the use of chemical weapons. He also drew attention to increasing inequality and the "discrimination and demagoguery" faced by migrants and refugees, in the context of clearly insufficient international cooperation, as well as cautioned against widening inequalities, tensions over trade and pressures on human rights around the world. "It is our common duty to reverse these trends and resolve these challenges. We need to move ahead based on facts, not fear \- on reason, not illusion. Prevention must be at the centre of all we do," stressed Guterres. "This session of the General Assembly is a real opportunity for progress." 'Two epochal challenges' In his speech, Guterres made particular reference to climate change and the risks associated with advances in technology, referring to these two problems as "epochal challenges." Noting scientific evidence that the planet is getting hotter, increasing concentration of carbon dioxide, Guterres underscored: "Climate change is moving faster than we are \- and its speed has provoked a sonic boom SOS across our world." "If we do not change course in the next two years, we risk runaway climate change  We need greater ambition and a greater sense of urgency," he said. Underscoring the need to ensure full implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Guterres urged world leaders to make maximum use of upcoming such as the Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or COP24 , in Poland in December to strengthen global resolve against the threat. He also announced that he will convene a Climate Summit next September, to bring together countries and cities, as well as political, business and civil society leaders, "to focus on the heart of the problem." "There are many mutually beneficial solutions for digital challenges. We need urgently to find the way to apply them," he said, calling on the global community to use the United Nations as a platform to draw attention to the risks and benefits of technological advances and to nurture a digital future that is safe and beneficial for all 'Winds of hope' "Despite the chaos and confusion in our world, I see winds of hope blowing around the globe," said Guterres, noting the recent signing of the historic peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, the start of the peace process between Djibouti and Eritrea, and other positive developments elsewhere. The approval of a compact on refugees and another on migration also represent signs of hope, he said, highlighting also the promise offered by the world's young people, gender equality gaining ground and growing awareness of discrimination and violence against women and girls. He also stressed that the UN must lead the way in pursuit of gender equality. "For the first time in United Nations history, there is full parity in our Senior Management Group and among Resident Coordinators leading country teams around the world. We are firmly committed to equality and empowerment everywhere," said the Secretary-General. In conclusion, Guterres recalled the words of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in which Annan said that the world shares a common destiny and that everyone can master it only if they face it together \- that is why we have the United Nations. "Our future rests on solidarity," said Guterres, calling on everyone to help repair the broken trust. "We must reinvigorate our multilateral project. And we must uphold dignity for one and for all."Source: UN News Service \</doc>

The feud between Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and his Deputy, Elder Simon Achuba, took a new twist recently following the withdrawal of all the security aides of Achuba allegedly on the orders of the governor's ADC. There has been a strained relationship between the governor and his deputy for quite some time, and perhaps the withdrawal of the deputy governor's security details would be the last straw that broke the camel's back. The APC governorship candidate in the election, Prince Abubakar Audu, was already coasting home to victory when he suddenly died, prompting the nomination of Alhaji Yahaya Bello as his replacement. Bello was nominated because he had emerged second during the primary earlier conducted by the APC. He was subsequently declared winner of the election by INEC after the earlier election 'inconclusive'. However, the running mate to the late governorship candidate, James Abiodun Faleke, refused to accept the deputy governorship position, insisting that he ought to have been declared winner of the election having run on a joint ticket with the late Audu. After series of consultations, horse-trading and political maneouvering, a deputy governor eventually emerged in the person of Simon Achuba, who hails from Ibaji Local Government Area. He was sworn in at the Government House, Lokoja, on Tuesday, February 10, 2016, by the state Chief Judge, Justice Nasiru Ajanah. However, not too long into the 'political honeymoon', some cracks and cold war began to manifest between the governor and the deputy. It all started with reports of alleged sidelining of Achuba in the running of affairs of the state. Those close to Achuba said Bello seemed to have more confidence in his Chief of Staff, Edward Onoja, and as such, delegated more responsibilities to him than to his deputy. The governor, on many occasions, described Onoja as his 'twin brother', apparently an open declaration of his confidence and trust in his chief of staff. Political watchers are of the view that the deputy governor's office has been less active or largely 'redundant' for a greater part of the administration. Perhaps, one of the earliest signs of the existence of a crack between the governor and his deputy was when the former (Bello) travelled out of the country for about two weeks to seek medical attention sometime in November, 2016. There were indications that the governor did not hand over power to his deputy before travelling out, thus sparking concerns of existence of a crack in their relationship. Another scenario was when the governor went on a trip to Poland in December, 2018, alongside President Muhammadu Buhari, for the United Nations ( UN ) Conference on Climate Change . The governor handed over power to the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole, to hold forte as acting governor. The development created an uproar from some stakeholders, but within 24 hours, a circular granting the deputy governor a two-month leave was released. Dramatic enough, the deputy governor was said to have applied for and was granted a two-month annual leave almost the same period the governor was away from the country. Analysts, however, observed that the development was an indication that all might not be well between the governor and his deputy. They said it was unusual for a deputy governor to have proceeded on leave at the same time as the governor. According to them, for a deputy governor to have gone on such a 'long break' at the peak of campaigns for the general elections was an indication that things were falling apart. The deputy governor was never visible in most of the APC meetings and campaigns held across the state in the build up to the general elections. He was also observed to be conspicuously missing in most of the important public functions held at the government house for quite some time. Achuba and the Chief of Staff, Onoja, were recently embroiled in a war of words over allegations that the deputy governor collected a kickback from a contractor to sabotage the construction of a road project to Ibaji, the country home of the deputy governor. The deputy governor has since denied the allegation and has asked for a retraction and public apology from Mr. Onoja. Achuba's ordeal, it was learnt must have heightened following his alleged secret hobnobbing with the opposition PDP. The deputy governor was particularly accused of having secretly visited the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, who is the Director General of the Atiku Presidential Campaign Organisation, at his official residence in Abuja in November, 2018. Many had expected that Achuba would return to the PDP where he hitherto belonged, but he has chosen to stay put in the APC against all odds. The face off became public after Achuba addressed a press conference last weekend where he opened up on some of the predicaments he had been battling. Achuba, at the press conference, raised alarm that his life and those of his family members were in danger following the withdrawal of his security details. According to him, he was set to go to his village at Iyano in Ibaji for the 'postponed' elections when all his security aides were withdrawn. He alleged that the ADC to the governor had summoned all his security details to the government house on February 15, 2019, for a briefing and kept them in detention without any explanation. 'As I am speaking, my life is in danger because I cannot understand why my security personnel can be withdrawn on the eve of elections. As a member of the APC, I don't know what level of division or misunderstanding that can lead to that. 'My advice is that security agents should not succumb to individuals' political interests,' he said. Achuba called on the Inspector General of Police to prevail on the Kogi State Commissioner of Police to restore his security details to him. Although the security details of the deputy governor have been fully restored, there are still indications that the feud is far from being over. The deputy governor, while speaking on some of his predicaments, said electricity and water supply to his official residence had been cut off for months. Besides, he also raised concerns that his travelling and other allowances had not been paid for months. He said he had informed the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and other top APC stalwarts about his unpaid allowances but that nothing positive had been done. When asked why the deputy governor's security details were withdrawn, the Director General on Media and Publicity to the Governor, Kingsley Fanwo, said, 'It is not the responsibility of the governor to give security, even to himself. The security heads do. So the governor is not responsible for posting security to the deputy governor. So if his claims are true, kindly get in touch with the security agencies to give explanation.' When asked why the governor had reportedly sidelined his deputy in the scheme of things, Fanwo said, 'He (Bello) didn't cut him off from the affairs of the state. He remains the deputy governor of the state, and as long as he remains in office, he takes part in the affairs of the state.' \</doc>

Communities directly impacted by the abusive practices of the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas super major, Shell, have spoke out as fossil-fuel trade association IETA hosted representatives from the Big Polluter for an event at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's 24th conference of the parties ( COP24 ).

In the Niger Delta we have endured 60 years of gross oil pollution, gas flares and human rights abuses. Today the world has 12 years to right the wrongs. Shell and their cohorts must be kicked out of the COP and held to account.'' \- Nnimmo Bassey, Health of Mother Earth Foundation ''This is so transparent \- everything we've been saying about the role the market mechanisms are playing, is possible to see right here. It is a false solution. A loophole for dirty energy corporations to continuing polluting, through offset mechs these corporations are continuing to pollute and devastate environmental justice communities ''Second thing is that the majority of forests that are offset are on indigenous lands \- in this form REDD+ and other kinds of offset mechanisms are fueling land grabs and massive violations of human rights in the global south. We must reject their presence and influence here.'' \- Alberto Saldamando, Indigenous Environmental Network and It Takes Roots delegation ''This is precisely why the UNFCCC needs a conflict-of-interest policy. The only thing Shell Oil should be contributing at these talks is a commitment to remunerate countries for the devastation its decades of climate deception and carbon extraction have caused. Instead, it's using every tool at its disposal to convince governments here to advance its dangerous schemes. Shell is savvier in advocating its agenda, to be certain, than the Trump Administration in its oxymoronic sideshow for "clean fossil fuels." But its intention is similar: To greenwash and otherwise obfuscate its role in writing a Paris roadmap written by and for the world's biggest polluters. But media, negotiators, and civil society won't be duped: The growing movement  represented by the People's Demands for Climate Justice  calling to keep fossil fuels in the ground and kick Big Polluters like Shell out of climate policy is determined to ensure the Paris Rulebook advances true climate justice.'' \- Sriram Madhusoodanan, Corporate Accountability ''For decades, Shell has violated human rights and devastated communities around the globe. It's done this while wrecking the climate and doing everything it can to lock in decades' more extraction of dirty fossil fuels and profits for its executives. Canada should be ashamed for lending credibility to today's panel and legitimising Shell's presence at the UN. It's time for governments to reject false solutions like Shell's Sky Scenario, kick Shell out of the climate talks, and stand with the frontline communities most impacted by Shell's greed.''- Collin Rees, Oil Change International ''Shell is a big-time polluter playing saint at the COP. Their track record of environmental degradation and human rights abuses have continued to affect communities in the Niger Delta with differentiated impacts on women and vulnerable groups. Having Shell organising a side event at this COP to promote false solutions is not only a slap on our faces and impacted communities in the frontline, it is a sacrilege on Mother Earth. If we must make progress with the climate talks, Shell should be kicked out of COP. We demand Climate Justice for ALL.'' \- Rita Uwaka, Friends of the Earth Nigeria ''Number one: We must kick Big Polluters out of the talks. Big Polluters are writing the script behind the scene and this side event is evidence. We need to kick them out of the COP process.'' \- Godwin Ojo, Environmental Rights Action. Earlier on Tuesday, the People's Demands, a set of six calls to governments, were delivered to the UNFCCC Executive Secretariat. Over three hundred organizations from over 129 countries support the demands, which include a call for an end to corporate capture. Countries have failed to make substantive progress at this year's talks, and corporate capture of the climate negotiations has become a contentious issue. This year, the conference is bankrolled by some of the largest oil, coal, and gas corporations in the European Union, which raises questions about the level of access and influence fossil fuel corporations have at the talks.

President Muhammadu Buhari has returned to Abuja after attending the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP24 ) in Katowice, Poland. President Buhari, who left Abuja on Saturday for Poland to attend the 24th session of the Climate Change Conference known as ( COP24 ), had been on his way back. Mr. Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, said in a statement on Friday that COP24 , under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), would hold from December 2-4, 2018 in the Polish city of Katowice. Participants finalised the rules for implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change under the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) - the rule book for implementation. President Buhari delivered a statement that highlighted Nigeria's commitment to addressing climate change by implementing the goals set out in its National Determined Contributions. He also stated Nigeria's readiness to work with international partners to reverse the negative effects of climate change in Africa and the world over. \</doc>

IN December, the world will convene in Katowice, Poland for the 24th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP) to discuss climate change, commitments to reduce emissions to 1.5 degrees below pre-industrial levels, to further the Talanoa dialogue, and to finalise on the Paris rulebook and implementation. This meeting will bring together government leaders, industry practitioners from the private sector, and non-profit players. One thing this anticipated COP seems to do is foist a deja vu of COP 19, the UNFCCC Conference of Parties held in 2013 in the same country, Poland, in its capital Warsaw, a country which at the same time was playing host to the global coal summit. Poland has been listed as one of the EU's most inefficient economies, with its carbon dioxide emissions per capita above the EU's average emissions. In fact around 90 percent of the country's electricity is derived from burning coal. According to a Greenpeace recent report, the coal-powered plants are responsible for almost 5,400 deaths a year and the massive Belchatow coal-powered station in Poland is the single largest polluter in the entire EU. COP 19 was not particularly successful, as we did not seeany major progress on the Loss and Damage agenda, which was meant to be the one of the highlights of the summit. On the contrary, in the last few weeks before the COP in Warsaw, members of the Polish government in several official statements clearly stressed the role and the importance of continued coal use for the Polish economy and its competitiveness. Poland is also known for blocking any more ambitious climate policy instruments in the EU. Most alarming was the fact that the sponsors of the climate talks in Warsaw were big polluters; coal and crude oil companies, whose interests indeed came to fore at the negotiations. One would have hoped that after the summit in Warsaw in 2013, the country will adopt a more progressive approach, cut down on the use of coal and make for a climate-friendly economy, yet the coal capital still continues to be that- a coal capital. It makes one wonder why for the second time in five years, they have offered to host the COP. Indeed the agenda pushed at the COP 19, and at the coal summit that held concurrently during the second week of the COP in Poland was that of clean coal technologies and the future of Poland's coal. Clearly, the coal capitalwas bringing everyone to its country to convince them that they would not drop their coal, but would try to make it clean. The question on everyone's mind remains the same as what it was in 2013- what happens at the COP in Poland? The presidency of the COP 24 has been announced- Polish minister of Energy of a country where energy is dominated by the coal industry. Michal Kurtyka will be taking up the most critical role since the Paris Agreement in 2015 and will be playing a huge part in the furtherance of the Paris rulebook. What remains unspoken here is whether the politics and power play of coal and his role within the Polish government will determine his disposition during the talks, as the climate politics of Poland is at the lower end of ambition. It is even more disturbing because the role of the presidency is critical; as critical, if not even more than the seat of the climate talks because the President steers the conferences and brokers deals when there are deadlocks. At COP 19 President, then Poland's environment minister got fired because fracking was not happening fast enough. In other words, he was not pushing the country's agenda fast enough. We await to see what will happen in December in the Silesian city of Katowice. The hosting of the COP 24 climate talks by Poland is akin to an unrepentant sinner playing priest, taking confessions of sinners from behind the confessional, and offering reprieve for their sins. Apart from it being antithetical that a coal-powered city is hosting the climate talks, it is simply the case of a house divided against itself, and usually such cannot stand. Either the country will take the hit from this negotiations or the negotiations will. Yet, some have argued that the climate summit happening in Poland might just be a harbinger of good things, as it may mean that the coal-powered country is ready to truly commit to curbing emissions and driving a climate-friendly economy. We cannot forget too early, however, that the Polish government has continued to iterate that it will continue to depend on coal as its major source of energy. Understandably, it is not an easy process to shift from the mainstay of a country's economy, as it will affect jobs, energy supply and the economy in general, yet the demand is for countries like Poland to make conscious efforts towards reducing gradually their fossil fuel emissions by finding more low carbon and renewable energy options and giving them pre-eminence in the energy mix. More especially because coal is a much dirtier fuel than other fossil fuels, and apart from the environmental hazards, it places heavy demands on water resources, causes grave health hazards and emits more greenhouse gases than any other fuel. As the COP approaches, the apprehension of a conference that will be marred by conflict of interest and a coal agenda is palpable. However, optimism says to anticipate a better outcome in Katowice than Warsaw. Whatever the case, it might be too early at this stage to tell. \</doc>

As representatives from more than 100 countries debated climate change in the COP24 - the 24th UN climate change conference - held in Katowice, Poland, the outcome could only be divisive. In the past, collective consensus by major economic powers - U.S., the EU, Japan and China - fueled success. Now the planned withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Accord resulted in a hollow consensus, supported by big-oil opposition. Like the recent G20 Summit, which welcomed trade but did not reject protectionism that undermines trade, Katowice agreed on a 'compromise,' which welcomed the alarming climate UN (IPCC) report, but not its actual findings. The price could be the virtual extinction of small island states as seas rise, followed by soaring costs of climate change in emerging and developing economies. Katowice's £dministrative' compromise virtually ensures that the extreme urgency required by the 'rule book,' which would allow countries to implement the Paris Agreement, will be ignored. The planned Trump exit from Paris Accord Risks have escalated since June 1 2017, when President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement - an international pact intended to reduce the effects of climate change by maintaining global temperatures 'well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels.' The Accord was negotiated by almost 200 parties and adopted by consensus in December 2015. Based on the UN convention on climate change, it focuses on greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in 2020. However, Trump calls the pact a 'bad deal' for the U.S. and sees the withdrawal as a key piece of the 'America First' stance. The White House began to pave the exit path in March 2017, when Trump signed an executive order to start the formal process of repealing President Obama's climate agenda. The withdrawal split the White House, the Congress, and the nation. A few powerful lobbying groups, energy giants and billionaires effectively hijacked the fight against climate-change, which most Americans and U.S. cities support. More recently, the White House ignored a new government report, which concluded that, in the absence of significant steps to subdue global warming, U.S. economy will take severe hits and cause the death of thousands of Americans by 2100. It is within the U.S. president's constitutional authority to withdraw from the Paris deal without first receiving congressional or senatorial approval. But legal questions linger as to how the Trump White House can execute the withdrawal and what role the U.S. can play in future international climate meetings. The role of China, emerging and developing economies Since the early 2010s, it has often been said that China is the 'world's greatest polluter.' That's true but only in aggregate terms. By default, big nations pollute more than small ones. Moreover, emerging economies that are still industrializing generate relatively more pollution than advanced nations, which industrialized over a century ago. The simple fact remains that, on per capita basis, the U.S. and major European economies remain the greatest polluters by far, however. According to research, China contributes barely 10-12% of human influence on climate change. That figure has remained fairly steady over the industrial period. It is lower than might be expected for the world's largest aggregate emitter. As the major advanced economies, including the U.S. and Europe, have been emitting far longer, their net contribution on climate change remains relatively far higher. Climate change is not just cumulative but accumulative. If the U.S. exit will materialize, global climate risks will intensify dramatically, particularly in emerging and developing economies. The 10 countries most affected by climate risk Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar ranked highest among the countries that have been most affected by climate change. Less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialized countries. Yet, even, high income countries feel climate impacts more clearly than ever before. Regarding future climate change, the new Global Climate Risk Index can serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change. The 10 countries most affected in the past two decades feature mainly poorer economies in Asia (Myanmar, Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Vietnam and Thailand) and Americas (Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua and Guatemala). The Index measures long-term global risk as a function of death toll, deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, absolute losses in US$ millions, losses per unit GDP in percentage and total number of climate events from 1998 to 2017. In this regard, there are differences among the most affected countries. In the case of Puerto Rico, the top rank was driven by a very high death toll and costly economic losses, but the number of events was low relative to other countries. In Myanmar, the high death toll explains the score. In Dominica, Puerto Rico and Haiti, the losses per unit GDP drove high rankings. In international comparison, the Philippines death toll has been relatively high in the past two decades, while its economic losses were among the highest. But it is the number of total events in the Philippines (over 300) that was the highest among the top-10 countries. Only Vietnam and Bangladesh come close, but even they had just two-thirds of the climate events in the Philippines. And in the top-ranking Puerto Rico and Honduras, total events were less than a 10th and 5th of those in the Philippines. Toward accelerated climate change Since the 1980s typhoons that strike East and Southeast Asia have intensified by 12-15%, with the proportion of storms of categories 4 and 5 having doubled, even tripled. Under increasing greenhouse gas forcing, the projected ocean surface warming pattern suggests that typhoons striking Asia will intensify further. Ironically, global climate change will penalize particularly those economies where living standards remain low and that are most vulnerable to collateral damage. The more poor economies will lose lives, the more that will bespeak about the effective indifference of advanced nations toward real human rights. Timing matters. Under the agreement, the earliest date of the U.S. withdrawal is November 2020 - the last month of the Trump presidency, in the absence of a prior impeachment. That's when Americans have to decide whether they really prefer energy profits, at the expense of future generations in the U.S. and elsewhere. Furthermore, time is running out. According to estimates, current climate policies virtually ensure that the increase in global temperatures is on pace for somewhere around 3.3 degrees Celsius. That does not bode well for the future. \</doc>

Children's crusades do not necessarily end well. During the years of armed missions to the Holy Land, when Jerusalem meant something to the sacredly inclined in Europe, children were encouraged to take to the rough and dangerous road as it wound its way towards Palestine. In 1212, a boy of 12 is said to have begun preaching at Saint-Denis in France. God had supposedly taken some time to communicate a pressing wish: Christian children were to head to the Holy Land and liberate it from the Infidel. How they would do so was not clear. They subsequently starved, suffered deprivation, were killed and enslaved on route to their destination. The modern student movement against climate change stresses another Jerusalem, that there will be nothing to salvage if nothing is done now. We are all, in short, for the chop if climate change is not arrested. As an Oakland high-schooler by the name of Bruke told Wired, "My GPA isn't going to matter if I'm dead." And much else besides. To such movements can also be added other acts of striking in peaceful protest. Tens of thousands of US students did so in 2018 swathed in the grief and despair of gun shootings, the most immediate being the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The National School Walkout of March 14 and the March for Our Lives ten days later had a biting clarity of purpose: students and staff were entitled to feel secure in the teaching and learning environment. The movement was characterised by much eloquence wreathed in anger and tears, not least of all Emma Gonzalez, who chided those political representatives "who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been ever done to prevent this". Criticism of such movements emphasises helplessness and delusion; they are children and so are vulnerable, idiotic and irrelevant. They are to be taught and have nothing to teach the adult world. Leave it to the big boys and girls to stuff up matters. The critics, often estranged from the very political processes they have been complicit in corrupting, see embryos in need of a constructive voice, expressed constructively without inconvenience, not coherent agents keen to affect change. There is, as Kari Marie Norgaard observed in 2012, a lag between the accumulating evidence of doom on the one hand, and the absence of public urgency, even interest, in response. "Although not inherently unproblematic," surmised Norgaard, "local efforts may provide a key for breaking through climate avoidance from the ground up." The global climate change strike movement by children, blown and swept along by the efforts of Swedish student Greta Thunberg, have suggested the possible short-circuiting of this dilemma: to combat the global by being stridently engaged in the local. (Such statements can become feeble mantras but do operate to galvanise interest.) For Thunberg, the issue of change is unavoidable. In her COP24 Climate Change Conference speech in December, the plucky youth did not believe that begging world leaders "to care for our future" would make much of a difference. "They have ignored us in the past and they will ignore us again." What mattered was letting "them know that change is coming whether they like it or not." Protests were registered on March 15 across 2,052 venues in 123 countries. There were 50 in Australia; and protests in every state in the United States. Often forgotten in these movements is the role played by children themselves in the organisational side of things, often clear, fathomable and inherently coherent. In the United States were such figures as 12-year-old Haven Coleman of Denver, Colorado, Alexandria Villasenor of New York City, and 16-year-old Israr Hirsi of Minnesota. Squirrel scholars suggest that these actions represented a "transformation" at play. Associate lecturer Blanche Verlie claimed that her research revealed how "young people's sense of self, identity, and existence is being fundamentally altered by climate change." It can be tempting to read too much into matters, to see flowers grow in fields initially thought barren. But there is little doubting climate change as a catalyst of active and noisy encouragement amongst youth, one akin to the anti-war movements of the Vietnam War period. There has been much finger wagging against the children from, for instance, politicians who just cannot understand how a striking student could ever get employment. How dare they take time off learning in a classroom while taking to the classroom of the streets? The spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May, for instance, argued that such protests increased "teachers' workloads" and wasted lesson time. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, in contrast, signalled his preference for the marchers and strikers: "Climate change is the greatest threat that we all face but it is the school kids of today whose futures are most on the line." In Australia, New South Wales Education Minister Rob Stokes preferred to brandish the rod of punitive action: both students and teachers would be punished for participating in the March 15 rally. By all means, find your "voice", suggested the threatening minister, but avoid doing so during school hours. For such scolding types, climate change and injustice have strict timetables and schedules, to be dealt with in good, extra-curricular time. Australian Resources Minister Matt Canavan's views on the youth climate action movement are childishly simple and representative, suggesting that Thunberg is correct in her harsh assessment. Recorded in November last year, the minister sees education as an instrumental affair. "The best thing you'll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue. Because that's what your future life will look like [ ] not actually taking charge of your life and getting a real job." Forget the environment's durability; drill it, excavate it, mine it, drain it and burn it to a cinder. Australia, and the world, do not need environmentally conscious citizens, merely automata consuming and feeding the commodity markets. For the likes of Canavan, it is too late. For the children, the battle to change the beastly status quo is urgent, pressing and inevitable. Dr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

THE Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Dr Usani Uguru Usani has disclosed that the preparation of the Document: 'Niger Delta Region Climate Change Programme and Action Plan' was necessitated by the need to address the social and economic development of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The Minister who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, Alhaji Aminu Aliyu Bisalla made the remark at the side event of Cop 24 at the Climate Change Conference, Katowice, Poland 2018. Dr Usani said that the pace and effects of climate change in the Niger Delta are increasing and unless the trend is reversed, human as well as physical ecologies are bound to be seriously impacted as it is being presently observed in many of the communities in the Niger Delta region. The Minister disclosed that the document which was launched in Calabar Cross River State, Nigeria, last month investigates and reports on the effects of Climate Change in the Niger Delta region, national and available state policies for addressing Climate Change and their relationship with the Niger Delta. According to the Honourable Minister, the essence of the document was to guide the Niger Delta region and other stakeholders on the implementation of collective measures to address climate change impacts and causes through adaptation, mitigation and other measures. Dr Usani disclosed that some of the climate change programmes and projects in the document for poverty alleviation and sustainable livelihood include:restoration of depleted habitats and sustainable management of biological resources in the Niger, climate change resilience and vulnerability mapping, flood control and management and early warning systems, erosion control projects, shore protection, land reclamation, ecosystem reclamation among others. He said that the set of programmes and action plan provide an integrated, harmonised, and multisectoral framework for responding and combating climate change in the Niger Delta through comprehensive adaptation, mitigation and other measures. The Minister's representatives thereafter presented the document 'Niger Delta Region Climate Change Programme and Action Plan' to the international community. Stakeholders, development partners, donor agencies and other interested organisations in the Niger Delta region development are invited to key into the climate change action plan. In his remarks at the event, Senator Foster Ogola, the Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment commended the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs for the document and called for international intervention in the development of the Niger Delta region in view of its contribution to Nigeria's economy. Senator Ogola also disclosed that the 8th National Assembly would pass the Gas Flaring Bill before the expiration of its tenure to address the issue of gas flaring in the Niger Delta region. Mr Al-Hamndou Dorsouma, the Division Manager Climate Change, African Development Bank also applauded the ministry for the document, adding that it was a step further in addressing the effects of climate in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. He advised that the document is reviewed after the 2018 Conference on Climate Change. Mr Dorsouma also assured that the African Development Bank would assist Nigeria in its climate change programme. \</doc>

The Government of Mauritius and the European Union held a High Level Policy Dialogue on Climate Change to discuss how to bring their partnership in climate change to the next level. Participants from various ministries, the private sector and the civil society attended the event. The European Union also announced a new support of EUR 3 million to strengthen research and innovation capacities in agriculture to face the challenges of climate change. According to Marjaana Sall, Ambassador of the European Union to the Republic of Mauritius: \- "I am proud that the first ever High Level Policy Dialogue on Climate Change with the Government of Mauritius is taking place today. The European Union is a strong supporter of multilateralism, and as such, we remain committed, with our Member States, to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. We believe that there is an unprecedented urgency to step up global efforts to halt and reverse climate change, in particular for Small Island States like Mauritius. As a concrete result of our dialogue, we have jointly agreed on a Management Framework that will allow us to step up our cooperation on climate change and to monitor progress in the fight against climate change. It will be a continuous exercise." She added: -" I take this opportunity to announce our new support to the Government of Mauritius for an amount of 120 million rupees to boost innovation in agriculture to be more resilient to the effects of climate change." Stakeholders from several ministries dealing with climate change issues, the private sector and Non-Government Organisations involved with climate change mitigation and adaptation participated in the High Level Policy Dialogue on climate change. The Dialogue was cochaired by the Minister of Social Security, Reform Institutions, Environment and Sustainable Development and the EU Ambassador, in the presence of the French Ambassador and the British High Commissioner. The Dialogue provides a structured platform to discuss on key climate-related policy issues in the framework of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that Mauritius presented in Paris in 2015. It is also an occasion to discuss how the European Union, including its Member States, can further assist Government in meeting its mitigation and adaptation commitments. This is a continuous dialogue, to monitor progress and see how the EU and Mauritius can work together. The EU and Mauritius have agreed on a Joint Management Framework on Climate Change which is focused on six objectives that will be jointly monitored: To comply with Nationally Determined Contribution target to mitigate climate change, subject to support from International sources To improve coastal zone resilience To implement an effective national disaster risk reduction strategy To enhance resilience against high intensity rainfall events To increase native forest cover to enhance the climate resilience of natural ecosystems (including mangroves). The High Level Policy Dialogue takes place less than one week after the COP 24 . It illustrates the commitment of both Mauritius and the European Union to join forces to address climate change and meet their commitments made in Paris 3 years ago. The Policy Dialogue follows the EU-Mauritius Political Dialogue, when it was agreed to hold a dedicated policy dialogue on climate change. Since March 2018, the European Union with its resident member states and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development have held a series of technical meetings with various ministries to identify possible objectives to be included in a Joint Framework.

ON 30th April, 2018, the Intersessionals- a climate preparatory session done earlier in the year ahead of the main United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP), kicked off in Bonn, Germany and ended on the 10th of May 2018. While the meeting is a United Nations meeting, the issues discussed concern every local community, every family, every individual. The purpose of the meeting was to prepare the ground on salient issues ahead of the COP 24 negotiations to be held in Katowice, Poland in December. While many issues were discussed at the meeting, certain items have caused a lot of buzz because of how important they are to the success of the negotiations, one of which is the proposal for a Conflict of Interest (COI) policy. The issue of Conflict of Interest simply refers to the presence of fossil fuel industries at the negotiation table, either by themselves or through Business and Industry NGO's (BINGOs) representing their interests, and how they use that to negatively influence and stall the climate talks. This has been a recurring concern since the COP 22 in Marrakech. Repeatedly, this part of the conversation in the negotiations is pushed further to the coming year. In the lead up to the COP 23 last year, Corporate Accountability International (CAI), an international think tank, reported the involvement of about 250 BINGOs admitted to the climate talks, and they often use their presence to weaken the climate talks rather than to strengthen it. It is even more worrying, because, Conflict of Interest, the main issue for discussion during the first week of the Intersessionals was deliberately omitted in the draft of the conclusion from the meeting, not even acknowledging the fact that it was discussed. Clearly, the influence of Big Polluters on this fundamental issue is a lot, and just like the discussions were abandoned in May last year in Bonn, there has been another deadlock again one year later. Throughout the Conflict of Interest deliberations last week, various delegations called for a Conflict of Interest policy document, and as always, the push for it was intense with Ecuador, Cuba, Small Island States and the Africa group for it, while the USA, EU, Canada, Norway and Australia was against. CAI has suggested a stringent and transparent process to determine who or what organisation gets admitted into the climate negotiations by ensuring that they are motivated by public rather than private interests. A key question to tackle though, is how to properly determine private or public interest at that stage, as some of those interests are revealed subtly upon admittance to the negotiations, and are even done through NGO's who do not necessarily bear on the surface, any connection to the fossil industries. There have been arguments, especially from fossil interests that preventing business interests from participating in the climate talks will be counter-productive, apart from stifling their possibility of contributing to the Paris commitments, it raises issues of freedom of speech as the outcome of the negotiations affects their businesses and business practices greatly. There is also the danger too, of excluding legitimate interests in a bid to keep out the fossil backers. Importantly too, a take-away from Bonn this year is that we must concern ourselves with how the Big Polluters are influencing and affecting policy locally, especially in oil producing economies like ours, and how they are influencing the climate talks from bottom up, determining which side of the mouth countries are speaking from and what position certain Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) take, because they are funding them. We must acknowledge the influence the private sector has on government and government business, and even on the nonprofit space. A shortcoming of the Paris Agreement is that while it encourages the role of the private sector in tackling climate change, it fails to take into account its lobbying efforts.

It is essential too, to constantly keep at the front-burner of the conversation, the fact that these polluters should stop polluting, pay and clean up for the pollution they have done and to make the transition to low carbon energy. This is why they must be kept involved, yet to such a minimal extent that they have little influence over the negotiations and policies like the Conflict of Interest policy because like Pascoe Sabido from the Corporate Europe Observatory said, 'those polluting should not be writing environmental policies.' \</doc>

Caleb Adebayo On April 30, 2018, the Intersessionals- a climate preparatory session done earlier in the year ahead of the main United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of Parties (COP)- kicked off in Bonn, Germany and ended on the May 10, 2018. While the meeting is a United Nations meeting, the issues discussed concern every local community, every family and every individual. The purpose of the meeting was to prepare the ground on salient issues ahead of the COP 24 negotiations to be held in Katowice, Poland, in December. While many issues were discussed at the meeting, certain items have caused a lot of buzz because of how important they are to the success of the negotiations, one of which is the proposal for a Conflict of Interest (COI) policy. The issue of conflict of interest simply refers to the presence of fossil fuel industries at the negotiation table, either by themselves or through Business and Industry NGO's (BINGOs) representing their interests, and how they use that to negatively influence and stall the climate talks. This has been a recurring concern since the COP 22 in Marrakech. Repeatedly, this part of the conversation in the negotiations is pushed further to the coming year. In the lead up to the COP 23 last year, Corporate Accountability International (CAI), an international think tank, reported the involvement of about 250 BINGOs admitted to the climate talks and they often use their presence to weaken the climate talks rather than to strengthen it. It is even more worrying because Conflict of Interest, the main issue for discussion during the first week of the Intersessionals was deliberately omitted in the draft of the conclusion from the meeting, not even acknowledging the fact that it was discussed. Cleary, the influence of Big Polluters on this fundamental issue is a lot, and just like the discussions were abandoned in May last year in Bonn, there has been another deadlock again one year later. Throughout the conflict of interest deliberations last week, various delegations called for a Conflict of Interest policy document, and as always, the push for it was intense with Ecuador, Cuba, Small Island States and the Africa group, while the USA, EU, Canada, Norway and Australia was against. CAI has suggested a stringent and transparent process to determine who or what organization gets admitted into the climate negotiations by ensuring that they are motivated by public rather than private interests. A key question to tackle though, is how to properly determine private or public interest at that stage, as some of those interests are revealed subtly upon admittance to the negotiations, and are even done through NGO's who do not necessarily bear on the surface any connection to the fossil industries. There have been arguments, especially from fossil interests that preventing business interests from participating in the climate talks will be counter-productive, as apart from stifling their possibility of contributing to the Paris commitments, it raises issues of freedom of speech as the outcome of the negotiations affects their businesses and business practices greatly. There is also the danger too of excluding legitimate interests in a bid to keep out the fossil backers. Importantly too, a take-away from Bonn this year is that we must concern ourselves with how the big polluters are influencing and affecting policy locally, especially in oil producing economies like ours and how they are influencing the climate talks from bottom up, determining which side of the mouth countries are speaking from and what position certain Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) take because they are funding them.

World leaders on Monday in Katowice, Poland renewed calls for action to deal with the impending fall out of climate change and swift implementation of the 2015 Paris Climate Change agreement. The Bank announced that it was doubling its current 5 year investments to around $200billion to boast adaptation and resilience, recognizing climate change impacts on lives and livelihoods, especially in world's poorest countries. But the World Bank, in response to demands for increased funding to tackle climate change, announced that it was setting aside the sum of 200b USD in an action parked program for climate change adaptations over the next one year Kristalina Georgieva, the Chief Executive Officer of the World Bank, who announced the donation, said the fund is to help weak countries undertake climate change actions for adaptation. ' The climate change is an existential threat to world's poorest and most vulnerable. The new targets demonstrate how seriously we are taking this issue , investing and mobilizing $200 billion over five years to compact climate change' The Bank said the fund is made up of approximately $100 billion in direct finance from he World Bank and approximately$100 billion of combined direct finance from the International Finance Corporation IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, as well as Private Capital mobilization by the World Bank group The call is coming on the heels of the leaders observations that the zeal with which the 2015 Paris agreement for a sustainable global action against climate change, has weakened This is also coming against the backdrop of revelation by the World Meteorological Organization, that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with the top four in the past four years. The Secretary General of the United Nation's Organization, Antonio Guterres in his welcome speech, said recent special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that warming could reach 1.5 degrees as soon as 2030, with devastating impacts. ' The latest UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report tells us that the current Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement will lead to global warming of about 3 degrees by the end of the century.' There was also revelations that concentration of carbon dioxide is the highest now, than it had been in the last 3 million years. The 2015 Paris agreement was aimed at raising Increased transparency for the action to mitigate against global climate change even as the leaders observed that Global green house gas emission is rising again The United Nation's Secretary General, Ant\'f3nio Guterres, minced no words in sounding the warning with his observations that the world was indeed in trouble and called for urgent actions to tackle climate change. ' We are in trouble. We are in deep trouble with climate change' Guterres said. The concern expressed by the world leaders emanates from the fears that the climate change is running faster than the world is acting ' We must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late' Breaking heat, increased fire outbreaks, desertification, melting glaciers and other forms of unpredictable weather conditions are seen as danger signals calling for urgent action to mitigate the challenge. According to Guterres ' It is hard to overstate the urgency of our situation, as for many people, regions and even countries this is already a matter of life and death.' He noted that the world was not yet doing enough 'even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world' ' nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption' The leaders called for a deep and just solution to the climate change frame work, aimed at removing the planet from a great danger. The Katowice dialogue is expected to hopefully lead to a new sets of agreements on how to operationalize the Paris agreement in a more realistic and firm manner. Guterres in his message, listed four areas of concentrations that should guide actions such as , science demands a significantly more ambitious response, the Paris Agreement provides the framework for action, so we must operationalize it, we have a collective responsibility to invest in averting global climate chaos, to consolidate the financial commitments made in Paris and to assist the most vulnerable communities and nations and four, climate action offers a compelling path to transform our world for the better. For him ' even though the 'IPCC's Special Report tells us that we still have time to limit temperature rise, that time is running out.' He noted that Paris success was achieved because negotiators were working towards a common goal, and urged the Katowice summit 'to maintain the same spirit of urgent collaboration here in Katowice with a dynamic Polish leadership in the negotiations.' 'Katowice must ensure that the bonds of trust established in Paris will endure. 'Incredible opportunity exists if we embrace a low-carbon future and unleash the power of the Paris Agreement. 'But we must start today building the tomorrow we want.' The Katowice Climate Change Conference is the 24th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 24 ) to the UNFCCC, the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) and the third part of the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 1-3). The conference also include the 49th sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), and the seventh part of the first session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris Agreement (APA 1-7). The conference will amongst other things help to finalize the rules for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change under the Paris Agreement work programme (PAWP, as well as a number of high-level events, mandated events, action events and roundtables. \</doc>

Africa's richest man, Aliko Dangote, chair of Dangote Group, worth $14.1 billion according to Forbes as at March, 2018, is set to float the world largest single-train oil refinery in Lagos, which would also include a petrochemical and urea fertilizer plant. He also has large investments up to hundreds of millions of dollars in the Nigerian coal industry; a major financier of the coal plant in Kogi and the reviving coal plant in Enugu. His cement factories across Nigeria are also powered by coal. While these projects bring about enormous economic benefits, the Nigerian government, the billionaire investor and various stakeholders seem to have turned a blind eye to the environmental effects of investing in these dirty fuels as well as the emission reduction commitments under the Paris agreement to which Nigeria is a signatory. President Muhammadu Buhari, in September 2016 while addressing one of the Side Events of the 71st Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA71) enthused 'My signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has demonstrated Nigeria's commitment to a global effort to reverse the effects of the negative trend.'In December last year, at the One Planet Summit, President Buhari again stated that 'Government is actively promoting technologies and practices such as sustainable land management, climate resilient agriculture, water efficiency, clean energy, and skills for reducing greenhouse gas emissions among others.' These statements clearly show continuing support for emission reduction and combating climate change, but are in stark contradistinction to the fossil fuel projects happening on a large scale in the country. The refinery project by Aliko Dangote, a project estimated to cost somewhere between $12 billion to $18 billion is one of such projects, set to encourage and scale fossil fuel dependency for decades to come, while the coal projects are also contributing inch by inch to our increasing carbon profile. In a business conference in October, 2016, the billionaire admitted with regards to his cement companies that ' All our cement plants have been converted to coal' and that they would use 12, 000 metric tonnes of coal per day. These developments are worrying, as they have increasingly negative effects on the environment and enhance the spate of climate change, which in turn is negatively affecting our agriculture, food security, health and economy. Apart from the effects on climate change, there are the adverse effects of fossil fuels on the immediate life of the communities; their livelihood, water, atmosphere and health. According to Greenpeace UK, globally, coal is the greatest climate threat we face. The Climate Reality project points out that while coal is one of the cheapest forms of energy, it is the dirtiest, and the one that contributes most to greenhouse gases. In a comparative study done by Elsevier, it was also discovered that coal has a high rate of related health hazards from the point of mining to preparation, transporting, waste storage and combustion. Crude oil closely follows behind, its havoc rap sheet already popular in Nigeria, especially in the Niger Delta. The story of the Okobo people in Kogi State where coal mining is done will immediately bring tears to one's eyes. Okobo is a small town in the Enjema district of Ankpa local government in Kogi state where coal mining is done in Nigeria. The only stream in the community is polluted with the presence of heavy metals and the air is contaminated with carbon and coal particles. A Global Rights Nigeria report reveals that children and women, especially pregnant women are plagued with various illnesses and the death toll is on the rise. This suffering is what would be extended to the communities in Enugu where the coal power plant wants to be revived. A 'Coal Kills' report estimates that coal accounts for over 800, 000 premature deaths every year around the world, and many million more serious and minor illnesses. The burning of coal in this community emits serious hazardous wastes that pollutes their water bodies, contaminate crops and release toxins into the atmosphere, thus damaging cardiovascular and nervous systems, increasing their risk of respiratory and heart diseases. It also releases a lot of hydrocarbons, especially methane and carbon dioxide that contribute to climate change, which in turn affects the health and livelihood of the people. The Niger Delta communities are no strangers to negative effects of oil exploration and production, as it has repeatedly taken its toll on their environment, health, water and livelihood. According to the Journal of Scientific Research and Reports, there is an average of about 700 oil spills in the Niger Delta annually. The oil industry has also damaged the environment through the oil spills, gas flares and release of effluents and smog from refineries. Rivers State still continues to suffer from the black soot which has lasted since early 2017 as a result of the activities of refineries, among others, putting over six million people in danger of cancer and respiratory problems, according to experts, as well as releasing hydrocarbons into the atmosphere. With the realities of fossil fuel effects staring her in the face, should Nigeria then be encouraging investment in coal and oil, or in renewable energy forms that falls in stride with its international climate change commitments, and which are healthier and safer for the communities? No doubt, oil continues to provide most of the country's revenue and foreign exchange earnings, and coal is a cheap way to industrialise, yet if Nigeria continues big billionaire investments in dirty energy, where then lies the fate of her sustainable development? Ahead of the 24thConference of Parties ( COP 24 ) later this year, Nigeria has to come to a firm decision on whether it wants to follow through with its commitments under the Paris Agreement, and if it does, then certainly it cannot keep investing or encouraging investments in fossil fuels. \</doc>

Behavior acculturated to ancestral norms, originally necessitated by occupation, is the focus of a new study in China with interesting ramifications for climate change. In general, farming requires more stable relationships than, say, herding with the constant movement of animals. Now the authors have taken farming a step further: They observed that northerners were three times more likely than southerners to push an obstructing chair in a Starbucks out of the way; southerners eased themselves around in order not to inconvenience whosoever had placed the chairs. The behaviors were true to type as northerners are considered brash and aggressive, while southerners are conflict averse and deferential. The authors ascribe the behavior to ancestral occupation. Wheat is farmed in the north, and such dry-land farming is more individualized than rice farming in the south. The latter requires complex irrigation systems for paddies and forces cooperation and coordination among multiple families. The interdependence also means it is crucial not to offend anyone. This ancestral culture prevailed despite the fact that most descendants were no longer farmers. The question of which people change their environment and who change themselves is an important one at a time when the world has to face the existential challenge of climate change. In the last couple of years we have seen a cooperative Europe facing a quintessential maverick, as in Donald Trump. Mr. Trump lives in his own world ignoring the mounting research and irrefragable evidence for climate change with its human fingerprint that can no longer be disputed. Worse still are the consequences and the inevitable danger of conflict fueled by resource needs. Thus the melting of Arctic ice has made possible new sea pathways, opening up oil and gas exploration, and pitting Russia, the U.S., Canada and other Arctic countries against each other. China is now in virtual control of solar panel manufacture through a heavily subsidized industry against which producers in other countries are unable to compete. The U.S. imposed tariffs in 2017 and India might follow suit. As electric car use increases, the demand for the rare minerals necessary for their batteries has begun to soar. Unfortunately the Congo with its incessant tribal wars is by far the largest producer of cobalt. Nickel has varied sources including Indonesia and the Philippines although the largest reserves are in Australia, Brazil and Russia. Chile has the highest reserves of Lithium followed by China, while Australia is the top current producer. The scramble for these resources is underway and producer countries have begun to guard their reserves through tariffs and controls. Perhaps the most fraught issue is that of sharing water. For millennia one country has relied on the Nile. The annual flooding in ancient Egypt brought new alluvial soil yielding rich harvests. Even now more than 95 percent of the country's mostly farmer population lives on the river's banks in an area approximately 5 percent of Egypt's land mass. That whole way of life could be in jeopardy depending on how quickly Ethiopia chooses to fill a huge reservoir behind a vast damn it is constructing. China shares the Mekong with six other countries and is the only one not a member of the Mekong River Commission. The problem is upstream dams and delicate negotiations for the equitable treatment of downstream farmers and fishermen. Then there are India and Pakistan, perennial enemies, now nuclear supercharged. They share the Indus and some of its tributaries. Thanks to the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, they have never fought a water war although there have been others. Now India is planning upstream dams. The situation can only worsen if the sources in the Himalayas diminish with global warming. How should humans respond to these environmental challenges? Should diffuse bodies deal with associated problems, and/or should there be a world environment court as a last resort against individualistic mavericks? The Montreal Protocol, dating back to 1987, protected the depleting ozone layer through the control of substances, chlorine and bromine, causing the problem. The culprits hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were to be phased out and replaced by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The latter lacking chlorine are safe in this regard. Governor Jerry Brown is independently hosting the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco (Sept. 12-14) next month to "put the globe back on track to prevent dangerous climate change and realize the historic Paris Agreement." Then there is the New York Declaration on Forests (2014) which pledges to halve the rate of deforestation by 2020 and to end it by 2030. It resulted from dialogue among governments, corporations and civil society following the UN Secretary-General's Climate Summit in New York. Meanwhile, China produces 20 percent of emissions and it will need to address the consequences of its Belt and Road Initiative. However, an agreement between China and the US, the two largest polluters, could open the intriguing possibility of the US returning to the Paris accord. Such diffuse bodies dealing with the myriad problems emanating from climate change and the evident cooperation of different actors relegate an out-of-sync Trump into a discordant minority. While the US remains a hugely important party responsible for 18 percent of global emissions, a hopeful sign is that other politicians in the country are clearly not following President Trump's lead. These ad hoc arrangements might work for the present. But what of the future? What of environmental degradation leading eventually to mass migrations, even wars for scarce resources? We have the benefit of Europe's experience with large numbers of refugees from America's wars in Libya, the Middle East and Afghanistan; the welcome mat has been gradually rolled back. How effectively will the UN Security Council counter environmental wars, particularly those involving China or other countries with veto power ? That all such questions need to be addressed and soon is a no-brainer, and COP 24 (Dec 3-14, 2018) could be an appropriate venue to begin the discourse.

This year's annual conference of the Parties to the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is currently taking place in Katowice, Poland. It opened on December 2nd and will run until the 14th. There are about 22,000 delegates from 200 countries at the conference, including President Muhammadu Buhari who joined other world leaders for the high-level meeting on December 2 and 3. As an aside, the choice of Katowice by the Polish hosts of the conference is a deliberate one, aimed at bringing home the lessons of the devastation caused by climate to the global environment. Katowice is the coal mining and steel making stronghold of the country. Coal powers 80 per cent of Poland's electricity, on account of which Katowice is the 36th of Europe's 50 most polluted cities. Smog, manifesting air pollution can get so bad that it would sometimes be difficult to breathe. It's perhaps on account to avoid the air that many delegations chose to stay in Krak\'f3w, a distance of 80.4 km (someone hour-drive) from Katowice, for their residency while attending the conference. Beyond this, there is everything positive to say about infrastructure in both cities, much of it put in place during the communist era, attesting to claims that in some ways, communism did work for the people. Tagged ' COP24 The Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015. The global action plan set out in Paris is to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\'b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5\'b0C. The agreement came into effect on 4th November 2016 and has since been signed by nearly 200 counties including Nigeria. Signatories also include the United States, Australia and Argentina, three countries that are now reversing their acceptance of the terms of the agreement. In the specific case of Donald Trump's America, he doesn't even believe that global warming has a connection with carbon emissions, a sin visited on the world by rich, industrial nations led by America. This year's climate conference came at a time of growing concern about the deteriorating global climate situation. It has been determined that in carbon dioxide levels, the year 2017 was the highest they have been in 3-5 million years. According to the National Agency for Space Administration, NASA, 2017 was the second-hottest year globally since 1880; the Arctic was warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth in 2017 and sea levels are rising at the fastest recorded rate in 2,000 years. As enunciated by President Buhari in his speech at Katowice, the consequences of this are seen in the rising global temperatures, erratic rainfall, sandstorms, desertification, floods, cold waves, low agricultural yields and drying up of water bodies. 'It is no surprise that the effects are felt more on the vulnerable communities that lack the capacity and technology to properly address such challenges,' he said. In that speech, President Buhari made it clear that we in Africa contributed little, if any to the climate change menace but were suffering its consequences. He graphically cited the case of the Lake Chad, down from 25,000 square kilometres to 2,500 sq. km, ten per cent only of its established size and with that, jeopardizing the livelihoods of 40 million inhabitants of the basin found in Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon. The consequences of these on the ecosystems are extreme poverty, the displacement of people, and support for banditry and terrorism. In calling for international support to recharge Lake Chad with waters from the Congo Basin in Central Africa, President Buhari made clear that Nigeria remains committed to saving the Lake from possible extinction. In the search for solutions, he revealed that an International Conference held earlier in February this year in Abuja has helped in creating additional awareness globally on the serious environmental and security challenges facing the Lake Chad region. Furthermore, he said, 'A consensus was reached at the said Conference to the effect that an inter-basin water transfer from the Congo Basin remains the most sustainable option available to resuscitate and safeguard this precious water body that was once the 6th largest freshwater Lake in the world.' The President also did his duty of projecting Nigeria as a responsible nation-state, playing by international rules, taking upon herself the ambitious 'Nationally Determined Contributions' targeted to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions up to 20 per cent by 2030 and, given international support, by 45 per cent in 20 years. It is clear that the Nigerian leader has cast himself in the role of an activist and global environmental champion to the admiration of many including Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General. His support for the Paris Agreement is unmistakable, partly on account of his view of it as a vehicle for the remission of past ills visited on the environment that led to the consequences of climate change imposed on Nigeria and other African countries. He sees the risks to our farmers who are involved in frequent deadly attacks against each other with herders; he is concerned about rising oceans that threaten our communities along the thousands of kilometres of coastline; he knows first-hand, the damage from the desert encroachment, forcing millions of our citizens into climate migration. His determination to make a difference is driven by a strong sense of mission, to do something about the dangers now or confront a bigger calamity in the years to come. He has an interesting narrative from the Magazine, National Geographic he read about 40 years back, in which a report was made of a research by a UK scholar around 1925 warning as at that time that Lake Chad needed an infusion of waters from the Congo Basin or else it would dry up. Because nothing was done to forestall this, Lake Chad is today 10 per cent of its original size and, receding even more. For him, therefore, the adoption 'of a strong Paris work programme, with clear provisions on all key issues including transparency, finance, mitigation and adaptation,' is a key priority as it is for the European Union and other countries. When it comes to the assumption of responsibility for the work that needs to be done and who pays for it, President Buhari as do many other activist-leaders, hold the view that since the developed countries have been the major polluters over the years, and they are not in any way denying that they should assume a greater role in fighting global warming. One of these ways includes the Green Climate Fund established by the Paris Agreement into which they would make an annual payment of USD 100 billion to help lift up the less developed countries suffering the consequences of climate change. President Buhari said African countries must draw from this fund for the restoration efforts to make the needed impact. For us in Nigeria however, the President made it clear that we are not resting on our oars, waiting for manna to fall from heaven, but rather promoting technologies and practices such as sustainable land management, climate resilient agriculture, water efficiency and clean energy. 'We have also developed insurance-based initiatives to deal with losses and damage, as well as adaptation to internally acceptable practices,' he told the UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice. Some of the specifics in this regard include the determined efforts to end gas flaring in the Niger Delta, ahead of the stated schedule; provision of solar power up to 13,000 megawatts; efficient energy through mass transit and reduction of cars and the improvement of the electricity grid system. The President also mentioned the successful take-off in the Nigerian Stock Exchange of the green climate bonds to help us fund renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions. The Nigerian Government, President Buhari also announced, has specifically developed Sectoral Implementation Plans (SIPs) in five priority sectors namely: Oil and Gas; Agriculture and Land Use; Transport; Industry; Energy and Power. These steps as choreographed by President Buhari had the effect of presenting Nigeria as a nation acting responsibly within the global community. If every country would do their part in a responsible way as we are doing, the world would have been saved, in 2017 alone, of disasters triggered by weather and climate-related hazards to the cost of US$320 billion. The UN says these economic losses will increase and will have a bigger impact on the lives and livelihoods of the poorest and most vulnerable, and that by the year 2030, climate impacts could push an additional 100 million people into poverty. The statistics also show that by 2050, as many as 143 million people could become climate migrants in just three regions (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America), with individuals, families and even whole communities forced to seek more viable and less vulnerable places to live. Beyond his very engaging participation in the conference, the President used his presence in Poland to advance the country's international relations by holding separate bilateral meetings with the President and Prime Minister of Poland, both of whom talked about their investment plans for Nigeria; the President of Austria who expressed a strong support for the recharging of Lake Chad; the Prime Minister of the Netherlands with whom the Nigerian leader discussed matters of investment, the reform of our livestock and farm agriculture; and the President of Switzerland whose country had done so much, and is expected to do more in helping us to secure the release of the remaining Chibok girls and other hostages seized by Boko Haram. As he did in every country he visited, President Buhari met the Nigerian community who asked so many questions including the one on his alleged cloning, a question he considered laughable and dismissed as incredible. In a mark of international statesmanship, President Buhari ended his engagements in Poland with a visit to Auschwitz, described as the largest concentration camp established by the Nazi regime in pursuit of the 'Final Solution.' One million, three hundred thousand (1.3m) people, 90 per cent of them Jews were exterminated mostly in gas chambers by the Nazi occupiers during World War II. His visit has been marked as a gesture to the global and domestic audiences. In solemnity, President Buhari entered some of the detention camps, the execution wall and walked through the remaining gas chamber still standing in the camps.

Perhaps, now more than ever before, the world needs the guiding principles at the heart of the Atlantic Council: international cooperation; innovative thinking; fact-based policy making; the generation of bold ideas and the multitude of benefits that come from reaffirming historical alliances. Let me stress that OPEC shares these values. Our encouragement of international cooperation and support of the multilateral system are 'front and centre' of everything our Organization stands for and the actions we take. Given our common values and shared interests, I welcome the opportunity to share perspectives with you today and encourage exploring all other possibilities for further strengthening relations between our two organizations. Next month, OPEC celebrates a very special and historically significant occasion. We will commemorate the 60-year anniversary of the First Arab Petroleum Congress, which took place in Cairo, Egypt. On the margins of this event, two kindred spirits, Venezuela's Juan Pablo P\'e9rez Alfonzo and Saudi Arabia's Abdullah al-Tariki who had originally met as students in the US, sat down with representatives from Iran, Kuwait and Iraq, at the Maadi Yacht Club in Cairo. There the 'Gentlemen's Agreement' of Maadi was forged, which encouraged the signatories' governments to establish a formal consultation commission as a means of countering the arbitrary decisions of oil companies and sought to secure better concession terms for oil producing countries. It was what I might term a first 'crossroads moment' for our Organization. The unstoppable momentum generated in Cairo would eventually culminate in the foundation of OPEC in Baghdad on 14 September 1960 by the five founding fathers of our Organization: Abdullah al-Tariki; Perez Alfonzo; Fuad Rouhani of Iran; Dr. Tala£t al-Shaibani of Iraq; and Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait. It was perhaps no coincidence that a US citizen, the legendary energy reporter, Wanda Jablonski, also played an important role in bringing these five founders together, helping bring about the initial consultations in Cairo. I think this, alongside the fact that Alfonso and al-Tariki first met in the US, is symbolic of the crucial, interactive role that OPEC and the oil industry in the US would have over the subsequent six decades. I also believe it represents how our fortunes are closely intertwined. OPEC has a vested interest in sustained US economic growth and prosperity. We are friends of the US. Equally, I feel that the US stands to benefit when OPEC prospers. OPEC's Statute and mission is to help achieve a sustainable stability in the oil market; and this is not stability for stability's sake: this is because we are cognizant of the diverse range of economic and social benefits that came from sustainable oil market stability. When we succeed in our mission, this benefits both US producers and consumers. One of the clearest examples of the interconnected nature of our fortunes was during the last global energy market downturn, what some call the 'Great Bust' of 2014-2016. This downturn was as devastating for OPEC Member Countries as it was for US producers, especially tight oil producers. I would like to commend the author Bethany McClean, who vividly described the impact of the bust on the US industry in her book, 'Saudi America'. The consequences of the downturn were various: the rig count in the US fell from 1,920 rigs in late-2014 to a low of 480 in early-2016. This is a huge drop of around 75%! By mid-2016, US oil production had declined by a staggering 1 mb/d. Two hundred companies would declare bankruptcy in this country as a result of the bust, with huge corresponding negative multiplier effects on the economy. With shale companies looking to reduce expenditure, fracking equipment was idled and as IHS Markit research has shown, close to 60% of the fracking equipment in the US was inactive during 2016. OPEC Member Countries were not insulated. Revenues fell significantly and national and corporate budgets had to be readjusted. Foregone oil revenues were in the region of $1 trillion! At the global level the figures were also stark. Investments were choked-off, with exploration and production spending falling by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016, and only recovered by 8% in both 2017 and 2018. Additionally, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued. Moreover, according to the consulting firm Graves and Co, the global oil and gas industry shed almost half a million jobs. Of course, these factors rippled through the global economy. Millions of pensions were put at risk, especially in the US, as pension funds had invested in high yield debt, such as energy firms, and private equity firms that were heavily invested in shale companies. Given all these factors, it is small wonder that the British economic historian Adam Tooze has concluded: 'In 2015-16 the world dodged a third instalment of the global crisis.' It is far from hyperbole, then, when I say emphatically that our industry was resuscitated from its 'death bed' by the collective efforts of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners through the 'Declaration of Cooperation' process. As a result of our voluntary production adjustments, a long absent element of stability was reintroduced to the market. The 'Declaration of Cooperation' became an integral and responsible feature of the energy market. On the back of the stability generated by the 'Declaration of Cooperation', the US oil industry has been revived. From the depths of despondency and despair, we now have an industry that is thriving again. Last year, with production booming, the US became the largest oil producer in the world. At the end of last year it was at 11.85 mb/d, and now sits at over 12 mb/d. If you asked producers in the US shale basins whether they have benefitted from the actions taken through the 'Declaration of Cooperation', I am sure the answer would be a resounding 'yes'. I should also like to add here that without the US shale revolution in the first part of this decade the world would have witnessed major energy chaos. It underscores the importance of the US and OPEC to the global oil industry and the fact that we both have a strategic stake in global supply and demand levels. The past two years or so of the 'Declaration of Cooperation' and the recovery of the oil industry also came at the same time the global economy picked up too. This was apparent in the conclusions of the IMF in a publication entitled 'The Global Economic Recovery 10 years after the Financial Meltdown': 'After faltering at time over the past 10 years, the global economic recovery experienced a long awaited synchronized growth upswing in 2017-18.' Looking ahead, the world will need more oil from both OPEC and the US. According to OPEC's flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook, long term oil demand is expected to rise to 111.7 mb/d in 2040. There is no expectation for peak oil demand over the forecast period to 2040. The IEA, the EIA and OPEC share this consensus. To put this into an investment perspective, the required global oil sector investment to 2040 is estimated at $11 trillion. What all this emphasizes is that while the short-term focus remains on maintaining market balance and stability, it is also vital that we do not lose sight of the medium- and longer term outlook. All timeframes are inter-linked; what happens in the short-term will have knock-on impacts for the industry's prospects. Such timeframes and numbers highlight the fact that oil will continue to play a critical role in the energy transition. A clear exemplification of this is the petrochemical industry. Our Outlook, in line with other forecasting agencies, sees global population expanding to 9.2 billion by 2040. To support such growth and feed these additional mouths, there needs to be a high yield per acreage in the agricultural sector - this can only be achieved through nitrogenous fertilizers and other agricultural products that are produced through hydrocarbons. As Charlie Munger, the famous entrepreneur, thinker and collaborator with Warren Buffet, has concluded: 'hydrocarbons as chemical feed stock are probably irreplaceable.' Meeting this future demand challenge must of course be done in a sustainable manner, especially given one of the major issues of our time: climate change. At the most recent UN Climate Change Conference COP24 in Katowice, Poland, OPEC reiterated that it remains fully engaged and supportive of the 'Paris Agreement'. In some quarters, however, there is an evolving narrative that the oil industry is on the cusp of a demise. This is far from the truth. We need to challenge this misconception, particularly given the climate disclosure drive from the financial community, which is affecting the vital investments into our industry. It is perhaps a 'crossroads moment' for the oil industry. We need to reinvigorate the industry; highlight the great benefits that oil has brought to billions, and the future positive impact it can have on billions of others. We need to highlight, as eloquently put by Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA, at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, that carbon emissions from crude oil production by all IOC's constitute only 4% of emissions worldwide, and compared with other energy types, this proportion is relatively low. Moreover, as often noted by Bob Dudley, BP's CEO, we need to emphasize this is not a race to renewables alone; it is a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, OPEC emphasizes the importance of what sometimes is known as the 'fifth fuel' ? energy efficiency or as Dan Yergin called it in one of his masterpieces, 'The Quest', 'energy ingenuity', namely, applying greater intelligence to consumption, and being more clever about how energy is used. Of course, the great enabler of improvements in energy efficiency is technological innovation. We need to stress that the scale of the climate challenge means that no single energy source is a panacea; nor can the contribution of an entire industry or group of countries be overlooked. The oil industry possesses know-how and experience for reducing our environmental footprint: working practices and fuel efficiency standards have improved exponentially over the decades. Of course, more needs to be done. Nevertheless, the industry's capacity for technological innovation must be harnessed within this process. OPEC, the US oil industry, and the entire global oil industry, are part of the solutions to a sustainable energy future. At the end of last year, when analysts and commentators were looking to the year 2019, one word kept being repeated: uncertainty. Uncertainty related to heightened trade negotiations; the easing of monetary tightening by several central banks; geopolitical developments; the impact of sanctions; the continuing prevalence of populism - the list goes on. Yet in this world of uncertainty, I can assure that one thing is steadfast, unchanging and completely unwavering. And that is the resolve of the 'Declaration of Cooperation' partners to maintain a balanced oil market and achieve a sustainable stability, in the interests of both producers and consumers. Moreover, following the proven success of the 'Declaration of Cooperation', participating countries are organizing in 2019 a permanent intergovernmental platform for dialogue, under the Charter of Cooperation between Oil Producing Countries, a forum that will ensure constant conversation between countries about salient energy issues. We will persevere because it is the right thing to do. As one of the greatest sons of this country, John F Kennedy, said: we undertake our actions, 'not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone.' And as I have stressed throughout my remarks today, it is in the interests of both the US and OPEC to see a vibrant and flourishing oil industry in the decades ahead.

The Ministers pledged their support to efforts towards making global governance more representative with greater participation of emerging markets and developing countries in global decision making. The Ministers emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive world economy enabling all countries and peoples to share the benefits of globalization. They underlined their firm commitment to free trade, and the centrality of a rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, multilateral trading system as embodied in the WTO. They opposed the new wave of protectionism and the systematic impact of unilateral measures that are incompatible with WTO rules, and undermines global trade, and economic growth. In this regard, they reiterated that the WTO Dispute Settlement System is a cornerstone of the MTS as it is designed to enhance security and predictability in international trade. The Ministers reaffirmed their resolve to foster a global economic governance architecture that is more effective and reflective of current global economic landscape, increasing the voice and representation of emerging markets and developing economies. They reaffirmed their commitment to conclude the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula, by the 2019 Spring Meetings. They will continue to support the implementation of the World Bank Group Shareholding Review. The Ministers welcomed the institutional progress of the New Development Bank (NDB), including the upcoming establishment of the Americas Regional Office in S\'e3o Paulo, Brazil, which, alongside the Africa Regional Centre (ARC), will help the NDB consolidate its presence in those continents. The Ministers deplored the continued terrorist attacks, including in some BRICS countries. They condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever committed and by whomsoever. They urged concerted efforts to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis, and expressed their conviction that a comprehensive approach was necessary to ensure effective fight against terrorism. They recalled the responsibility of all States to prevent financing of terrorist networks and terrorist actions from their territories. The Ministers highly value the 3rd BRICS Counter-Terrorism Working Group Meeting held in Nelspruit on 19 and 20 April 2018. They called upon for an expedited adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the UN General Assembly. The Ministers expressed concern over the ongoing conflict and heightened tensions in the Middle-East region, especially with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian situation. The Ministers reiterate the need for renewed diplomatic efforts to achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid Principles, the Arab Peace Initiative and previous agreements between the parties through negotiations with a view to create an independent, viable, territorially contiguous Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel. The Ministers reiterated that the status of Jerusalem is one of the final status issues to be defined in the context of negotiations between Israel and Palestine. The Ministers reiterated their countries' support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). They commend the vital role it plays in providing health, education and other basic services for almost 5.3 million Palestinian refugees and underscored its relevance to bringing stability to the region and the need for ensuring a more adequate, sufficient, predictable and sustained funding for the Agency. The ongoing conflict in the Republic of Yemen is a further concern, having become a major humanitarian crisis. The Ministers urge all parties to fully respect international law to cease hostilities and to return to the UN brokered peace talks, leading to an inclusive Yemeni-led dialogue towards the achievement of a political solution to the conflict. The Ministers reaffirmed their support to process of 'Afghan-led, Afghan-owned' national reconciliation process. The Ministers expressed their concern over the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan particularly the increase in the number and intensity of terrorist-related attacks on the Afghan National Security Forces, the Government and civilians. The Ministers called on the international community to assist the government and the people of Afghanistan with stabilising the security situation in the country as well as for the return of dialogue with the objective of working towards the realisation of peace in the country and an inclusive political process. The Ministers also welcomed the Parliamentary elections which are scheduled to be held in October 2018 and the Presidential elections in 2019. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment for a political resolution of the conflict in Syria, through an inclusive "Syrian-led, Syrian-owned" political process which safeguards the state sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, in pursuance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015) and taking into account the result of the Congress of the Syrian National Dialogue in Sochi. They reiterated their support for the Geneva process and the mediation offered by the UN, as well as the Astana process, and stressed the complementarity between the two initiatives. They expressed their support to the efforts by Russia to advance the Syrian national dialogue. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful resolution in Syria. They expressed their opposition to measures that run contrary to the UN Charter and the authority of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and do not contribute to advancing the political process. They also highlighted the importance of unity in the fight against terrorist organizations in Syria in full observance of the relevant UNSC Resolutions. The Ministers reiterated their strong condemnation of the use of chemical \£d\£dweapons by any party, for any purpose and under any circumstances and renewed calls for comprehensive, objective, independent, and transparent investigations of all alleged incidents. The Ministers called for enhancing efforts to provide necessary humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people bearing in mind urgent reconstruction needs. The Ministers recalled the importance that all relevant parties of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear issue fully comply with their obligations and ensure full and effective implementation of the JCPOA to promote international and regional peace and security. The Ministers welcomed the recent developments to achieve the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and maintain peace and stability in North East Asia. The Ministers reaffirmed the commitment for peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation. The Ministers reaffirmed the importance of the elaboration under the UN auspices of rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States in ensuring security in the use of ICTs.

We note that ourmeeting takes place 100 years after the birth of Nelson Mandela and is an opportunity to build on his unique legacy.Multilateral cooperationWe recommit to working together to support multilateralism, democracy and the rules-based global order, in particular at the United Nations and global trade fora, to jointly promote development, security and human rights for all. South Africa's upcoming term as an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 2019-2020 presents an opportunity to enhance cooperation on peace and security. As part of our commitment to stronger global governance, we support the process of UN reform, including efforts on the comprehensive reform of the UN Security Council and the revitalisation of the work of the General Assembly. We agree that enhanced cooperation will be vital in multilateral fora addressing global challenges and crisis situations. We agree to coordinate positions, where feasible, in view of the upcoming G20 Summit in Argentina.We are determined to promote free, fair and inclusive trade and the rule-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) being at its core, and serving the interest of all its members. We are deeply concerned about the systemic impact of protectionist measures that are incompatible with WTO rules and that put the multilateral trading system at risk. We commit to work together to address the root causes of the challenges faced by the multilateral trading system through strengthening the WTO with the aim of improving its effectiveness and functioning as well as overcoming the present difficulties regarding the effective functioning of the Appellate Body of the dispute settlement mechanism.We also commit to engage in discussions at the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) on investor-state dispute settlement reform, while further engaging in discussions in other relevant fora on provisions in investment treaties especially on how to facilitate and promote more investment towards sustainable development.We welcome Iran's continued commitment to the full and effective implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as confirmed by the IAEA in thirteen reports, and in line with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We call on the remaining parties to the JCPOA to continue to honour their commitments under the Agreement. We recall that the JCPOA, which is working and delivering on its goal, is a key element of the global non-proliferation architecture and a significant diplomatic achievement endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council in its Resolution 2231. We stress the importance of the preservation and continued, full and effective implementation of all aspects of the JCPOA, which includes sanctions lifting and the consequences arising from it, in the interest of regional and international peace and security. We call upon Iran to play a constructive role in the region and to refrain from any activities which are inconsistent with UN Security Council Resolution 2231.We share concerns about the erosion of the global norm against the production, use and stockpiling of chemical weapons. We fully support the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in strengthening implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.We express our joint commitment to ensuring a successful outcome for COP 24 , including the Paris Agreement Work Programme and the mandated high level events, in pursuit of the objective of the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have taken note of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report, which unequivocally confirmed the negative impacts of climate change and indicated that global emission reductions in all sectors are crucial and that further action is needed in mitigation and adaptation, notably to reach the temperature goal as set out in the Paris Agreement.We commit to strengthening cooperation on migration, which requires a comprehensive international response, including to address the root causes of irregular migration. We note that safe, orderly and regular migration can contribute positively to growth and sustainable development in countries of origin, transit and destination. We take note of the discussions at the United Nations level on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees, which can contribute to strengthening the international response to migration flows and refugee situations.We agree to strengthen cooperation at the United Nations Human Rights Council and other multilateral fora and to continue to engage on human rights issues in the framework of the South Africa-European Union Structured Dialogue Forum on Human Rights, especially as regards the respect for, the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all universally recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms in multilateral fora, supporting the moratorium on death penalty as a first step towards its universal abolition, ensuring the full implementation of all human rights of all women and girls as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, empowering women and girls and achieving gender equality, eliminating all forms of gender-based violence, protecting the rights of the child, advancing the rights of people with disabilities, as well as preventing and punishing the crime of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity in compliance with the international human rights law and international humanitarian law. We confirm our commitment in particular to the full and effective implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the outcomes of their review conferences.We underline the importance of reinforcing global and regional natural resources governance, including tackling illegal exploitation, in order to promote sustainable development, especially in relation to minerals and wildlife. We will take forward our joint work in the Kimberley Process, as well as in the context of CITES, and in particular its 18th Conference of the Parties in May-June 2019. We agree to step up cooperation on ocean governance building on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and follow-up to the 2018 Our Ocean Conference.Bilateral CooperationOver the past years the EU and South Africa have deepened cooperation through twenty policy dialogues in areas such as climate change, natural resources, science and technology, research and innovation, employment, education and training including digital skills, health, energy, macro-economic policies, human rights and peace and security. We welcome the revival of the South Africa-EU Forum on Environment, Climate Change, Sustainable Development and Water. In this regard we agree to further cooperate in the areas identified in the Terms of Reference of the dialogue, which include bio-diversity, circular economy and water resources management issues among others, also involving our private sector operators.We acknowledge the strengthening of science and technology cooperation through new strategic focus areas of cooperation, including in the marine, bioeconomy and nanotechnology sectors, while opening-up to more innovation oriented activities. This has been facilitated through several scientific exchanges as well as the signing of the Bel\'e9m Statement on Atlantic Research and Innovation Cooperation; the joining of the International Bioeconomy Forum as well as through the upcoming signing of the Collaboration Arrangement with the Joint Research Centre. The area of research infrastructures remains a key area for continued cooperation. We look forward to stepping up collaboration in key areas such as open science, big data platforms, digital and Information and Communications Technology, as well as sectors linked to Industry 4.0. These are important for our joint efforts towards innovation as well as growing the necessary jobs and skills base. We welcome and support initiatives in the science and research domains that are of benefit to Africa, including the European Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership.We reaffirm our commitment to enhance cooperation towards addressing challenges of inequality and poverty, to achieving gender equality and our shared interest in fostering investments notably towards sustainable development, decent jobs, especially for young people and using a gender-sensitive approach. Our partnership should contribute to South Africa's socio-economic transformation agenda in support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union's Agenda 2063.Since South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994 and the signing of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) in 1999, the EU has supported comprehensive development assistance programmes with a total contribution to South Africa amounting to \€ 3 billion. We agree to work towards the consolidation of gains achieved and continue to support good governance and democracy, innovation, exchange of expertise and best practices. New strategies and tools for cooperation and the use of innovative instruments such as blending and guarantees will also be considered to diversify our cooperation and enhance its effectiveness. The EU and South Africa will, amongst others, explore the opportunities provided by the EU External Investment Plan under its three pillars.Recognizing the EU as a significant and long term investor in South Africa, we commit to exploring all of the opportunities for investment, technical assistance including project preparation, and the improvement of business and investment climates to promote sustainable development. Acknowledging South Africa's successful hosting of the Job Summit and Investment Conference in October 2018 that showcased new opportunities for investment in South Africa, as reflected in the Case for Investing in South Africa, and policy initiatives that are helping to create an investment-friendly environment, we agree to strengthen cooperation on investment in support of economic development, infrastructure, industrialisation, skills development, small business development and entrepreneurship in accordance with the priorities identified in South Africa's socio-economic agenda. We support the digital transformation of the economy in an inclusive manner by supporting digital innovation, digital infrastructure, the information society, and by fostering digital skills for all, in order to boost overall productivity, social inclusion, living standards and an efficient use of natural resources. We agree that attracting direct investment will contribute to support growth and fight against poverty, unemployment and inequality in South Africa. Therefore we are committed to enhancing bilateral investments by improving skills for employability, and by ensuring a conducive and value-based business environment, within transparent and predictable policy and regulatory frameworks, and with the aim to ensure accountability and competitive practices. To this end, we agree to establish, where appropriate, an ad hoc multi-stakeholder dialogue on investment, with the aim of deepening strategic cooperation in key sectors. We exchanged views on land reform and the Constitutional process in South Africa and how to maintain investor confidence, promote agricultural production, improve food security and reduce poverty, as key components of our partnership.We reiterate our commitment to respecting the WTO Agreements on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures and on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). In order to find mutually acceptable solutions to impediments to trade in agriculture, agri-food and manufactured goods, we agree to strengthen our dialogue and cooperation on TBT and SPS issues, including regionalization concerns of both the EU and South Africa. We welcome the conclusion and provisional implementation in 2016 of the EU-Southern African Development Community (SADC) \- Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which has created the foundation for a new and mutually beneficial economic relationship between the EU, South Africa and the other partners of the EU-SADC EPA. We underline the benefits of the full and effective implementation of the EU-SADC EPA, including with regard to expanded and enhanced protection of Geographical Indications (GIs) as provided for in the EU-SADC EPA. The implementation of the EU-SADC-EPA in line with the developmentorientated focus of the Agreement can make a significant contribution to reinforcing mutually beneficial and inclusive trade and to enhancing regional integration.We also commit to work towards a prompt resolution of trade impediments \- including the agriculture and agri-food sector \- affecting smooth trade flows, where relevant, bilaterally and/or with other ADC EPA Member States in the framework of the EU-SADC EPA.Regional cooperationWe confirm our commitment to a stronger and sustainable partnership between the African Union and the EU and agree to the full implementation of the outcomes of the 5th AU-EU Summit in 2017, and to continue to support and solidify the gains made by the African Union's Agenda 2063, its First Ten Year Implementation Plan and the various African Flagship Programmes. We welcome the new Africa-Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs as put forward by the European Commission.We confirm our common resolve to reform the future relationship between the EU and the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States.

The unforgettable moments collectively determined how the country fared in the year under review and probably may shape events in the New Year, 2019. Kunle Olafioye, Henry Okonkwo (Lagos), Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Fred Itua, and Godwin Tsa (Abuja) In the next 12 hours, the curtain of 2018 would be drawn at full length to usher in 2019. From the Executive to the Legislature and to the Judiciary, 2018 presented its challenges, hiccups and some good news. A look at the high points in the three arms of government in 2018 showed it all while Nigerians believe that a lot of works still need to be done. The Bill for parliamentary governmentThe Executive Presidency's year of mixed feelings As the year winds down, there are certain events that defined President Muhammadu Buhari's Presidency in 2018. The unforgettable moments came in their numbers, not one and not two. Collectively, they determined how the country fared in the year under review and probably may shape events in the New Year, 2019. Health issues Unlike in 2017, where the president once spent 154 days (May 7 to August 19, 2017) in London, undergoing medical treatment for an undisclosed ailment, this year was an exception. He went to London on April 9, nine days before the 25th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, also known as CHOGM 2018, to "enable him rest" before the commencement of the event on April 16 \- April 20, according to the presidency. Not too long after his return his visit to Washington DC to meet with President Donald Trump of the United States, in May he embarked on what his media handlers called "a four-day trip to the United Kingdom, to see his doctor." Buhari had also seen his doctor in London on his trip back from the US, over what the presidency called "technical stop-over for aircraft maintenance in London," disclosing that his doctor had asked for a meeting. Senate's refusal to confirm Magu as EFCC substantive chairman Another issue that characterized Buhari's Presidency in 2018 was the refusal of the Senate to confirm the acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, as the substantive chairman of the anti-graft agency. The Senate first rejected his confirmation in April 2017 and the second time in April 2018, citing his indictment by the Department of Security Service (DSS). Padded budget disagreement While signing the budget in July, Buhari said he was worried that up to 6,403 projects initiated by the lawmakers were smuggled into the budget. First, he alleged that they removed some priority projects of the Federal Government and replaced them with theirs. Secondly, he accused them of sabotaging the executive's effort of regularising the country's budget on a January-December financial year. Excess crude account crisis The year is ending with controversy trailing the depletion of the Excess Crude Account, which balance in November stood at about $2.319 billion to only $631 million within three weeks. Excess Crude Account is a special account established to warehouse excess revenues from the prevailing crude oil price at the international market. Income generated above the approved crude oil benchmark price in the annual budget is saved in the account. Withdrawal from the account is subject to the approval of the three tiers of government and the Executive Council of the Federation (FEC). It was not clear when the decision to draw from the account was taken and for what purpose. Skewed appointments Controversies also trailed Buhari's appointments since 2015, when he mounted the saddle as president. In the year under review, the controversy came to a head in October in the Senate, as the senators were divided along regional lines over the purported lopsidedness in the appointment of Service Chiefs by the president. The senators from the Southeast accused President Buhari of marginalising the zone. Also of serious concern was the allegation that the South-south and the Southeast zones were left out in board appointments into the EFCC and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Speculation of cabinet reshuffle During the year, a lot of media houses went to town with the report that President Buhari would reshuffle members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) in November. An online medium even reported that emergency FEC meeting primarily convened for approval for the 2019 Appropriation Bill, was meant to announce the re-jigging of the cabinet. Five ministers had left Buhari's cabinet from 2015 to date, the latest being the Minister of State for Environment, Ibrahim Jubril, who resigned to become the 13th Emir of Nasarawa. Others that resigned are Hajiya Amina Mohammed, on 24 February 2017. This followed her appointment at the United Nations as UN Deputy Secretary General. Kayode Fayemi, the governor of Ekiti State also resigned as the Minister of Solid Minerals Development on May 30, 2018 to pursue his political ambition. Kemi Adeosun resigned on September 14, as Minister of Finance, following the scandal that trailed her forged National Youth Service Commission (NYSC) exemption certificate to get into public office. Senator Aisha Alhassan also resigned as Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, hinging it on her disqualification in the screening for the 2019 Taraba State governorship contest by the APC National Working Committee. Declaration of June 12 as public holiday President Buhari hit the bull's eye with the directive that effective from 2019, Nigeria's Democracy Day, hitherto marked on every May 29 for the past 18 years, be shifted to June 12 in honour of the late Chief Moshood Abiola, who presumably won the annulled 1993 presidential election. The directive was given on June 6, few days before the 25th anniversary of the annulment. Apart from the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that saw the move as cheap political move to win the 2019 election, the recognition of June 12, went down well with even his critics, particularly the Abiola family, who also apologized for the role their late father played in Buhari's ouster as military Head of State. Faceoff with National Assembly leadership The face-off between the executive and the legislature came to a head when the leadership switched from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the opposition, the PDP. Indeed, this is the first time the ruling party is losing both leadership of National Assembly in the country. The Senate President, Bukola Saraki had dumped the APC for the PDP as he accused the party of witch-hunting him for undemocratic reasons. Two months after Saraki's defection, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, in September after several speculations finally dumped the APC for the PDP. Saraki doubles as the chairman of the National Assembly while Dogara is the deputy. With this development, three out of the four presiding officers of the National Assembly are now in PDP. Saraki, Dogara and Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu belong to one fold while the Deputy Speaker of the House, Hon. Sulaiman Lasun Yusuf, is now alone in the APC at the top leadership level. Since then, the National Assembly has drawn the battle line with the President, and at a time, they charged him to address threats to lives of the citizens and the country's democracy, threatening to initiate constitutional actions against him if he failed. The face-off came to a head with the booing of President Buhari, when was giving a speech at a joint session of the National Assembly while presenting the 2019 budget proposal of N8.83 trillion. The Jubril from Sudan brouhaha Some members of the Nigerian public actually believed that President Buhari had died during one of his medical trips to London and was replaced by a clone called Jubril from Sudan. On Sunday, December 2, 2018, he responded to the rumours during an interactive session with the Nigerian community in Krakow, Poland, where he attended the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties (# COP24 ) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (#UNFCCC). "A lot of people hoped that I died during my ill health. Those who spread the rumour are ignorant and irreligious", the president had declared. Buhari said he was not surprised by what the tale bearers were able to come up with, saying "one of the questions that came up today in my meeting with Nigerians in Poland was on the issue of whether I've been cloned or not. "The ignorant rumours are not surprising - when I was away on medical vacation last year a lot of people hoped I was dead." He assured his audience that he's going strong and he'll be around for a while, adding, "I can assure you all that this is the real me. Later this month I will celebrate my 76th birthday. And I'm still going strong!" His wife's disagreements Twice, the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, publicly disagreed with her husband's administration and the ruling party. In October 2016, during an interview with the BBC, she openly criticised the president, saying that she might not support his 2019 re-election bid. "The president does not know 45 out of 50, for example, of the people he appointed and I don't know them either, despite being his wife of 27 years. "Some people are sitting down in their homes folding their arms only for them to be called to come and head an agency or a ministerial position," she said. And on December 4, while speaking at a conference organized by Project 4+4 in Abuja she alleged that two powerful men were preventing Buhari's government from moving forward. She described them (the unarmed men) as retrogressive elements, who have become clogs in the wheels of development of the current administration. But in an interview with the Voice of America, Buhari dismissed the claims by his wife, saying that was her business. Buhari refuses to sign 2018 Electoral Act Amendment bill On December 7, he declined to sign the 2018 Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law for the fourth time and returned the bill to the National Assembly. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters, Senator Ita Enang, while previously returning the rejected bill explained, said that it was due to errors discovered by the president. The Senate experienced turbulent time in 2018, as there were incidents of Mace snatching, face-off with the executive, invasion, among others. The National Assembly, which in some climes, is referred to as a Parliament or a Congress, is the epicenter of democratic values. It is usually labeled as the symbol of democracy. Whenever there is any coup d'etat, the National Assembly is always the first casualty. While the Executive and Judiciary arms are permitted to function, the Legislature is usually proscribed. However, after years of military interregnum and the eventual return to democratic rule in 1999, Nigeria's National Assembly had functioned amid challenges. Within the period, Presidents of the Senate and Speakers of the House of Representatives have been removed over trumped up charges. Despite these repeated challenges, pundits believe that the Eight National Assembly is unique for a number of wrong reasons. They argued that the Senate, for instance, has become a retirement home for former governors, military administrators and ministers, who seldom place any serious premium on lawmaking. The Eight National Assembly, kicked off on a wrong footing, political observers have noted. They also hold a strong view that 2018 would go down in history as one of the most turbulent years in the annals of the Nigerian Parliament, where a number of 'firsts' happened. Budget padding The phrase budget padding was alien to many Nigerians until the Eight National Assembly came on stream. In 2016, few months after President Buhari presented his first budget to the National Assembly, the parliament was in a turmoil over alleged insertions of projects not originally captured in the proposal submitted to the lawmakers. The leadership of the National Assembly, especially the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, had a bitter battle with a former chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, Abdulmumin Jibrin. Although the Senate was insulated, its leadership was, however, fingered and accused of apportioning huge chunk of juicy projects to their constituencies. In 2017, the same scandal rocked the National Assembly and President Buhari returned the budget to the parliament. In 2018, the same trend resurfaced, when President Buhari again accused the National Assembly of inserting projects worth over N500 billion into the budget under the guise of constituency projects. Therefore, in the last three budget circles of the current Eight Assembly, it has been accused every year of padding the budget. Face-off with Executive The National Assembly, specifically the Senate, had a cocky take off. The two presiding officers, Bukola Saraki and Ike Ekweremadu, emerged against the wishes of the leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Presidency. As soon as the duo emerged, they were slammed with series of litigations. First, Saraki was dragged before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). He was accused of under-declaring his assets while he held sway as governor of Kwara State between 2003 and 2011. The case was finally resolved in 2018, when the Supreme Court discharged and acquitted Saraki. Saraki was still battling to stay afloat, when the Executive arm, through the office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, dragged him and Ekweremadu before an Abuja High Court. They were accused of forging the Senate Standing Rules, which they allegedly relied on to take their oath of office. The case was eventually withdrawn. In 2018, Saraki and Ekweremadu were again in the news for the wrong reasons. While Saraki was accused of sponsoring a deadly robbery attack in Offa, Kwara State, which claimed scores of lives, Ekweremadu on the other hand, was accused of not making a full disclosure of his assets. The two issues are still pending. Within the period, the Senate lamented over the refusal of government appointees to appear before it. Specifically, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr Ibrahim Idris, repeatedly refused to appear before the Senate, despite a valid court ruling. Other appointees like ministers and heads of boards and agencies, refused to appear before the Senate or its relevant committees. Bills Some of the signature bills of the National Assembly were vetoed by President Buhari in 2018. The Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) was rejected by the president, despite years of efforts. In four successive intervals, the president vetoed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. The Senate within the period accused the Executive of selective implementation of the budget, especially constituency projects. It also decried the non-implementation of their resolutions. Invasion of the Senate In April 2018, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege made history, when he allegedly led armed thugs into the Senate Chamber while plenary was going on and snatched the Mace. The armed hoodlums, who accompanied Omo-Agege into the chamber, made away with the Mace, despite the presence of over 250 security personnel in the National Assembly. Till date, none of the suspects arrested have been prosecuted by the Federal Government. The report of a preliminary investigation by the police was never made public. Many political actors believe that the invasion was the climax of months of face-off between the two arms. Siege to the National Assembly In August 2018, barely one week after the National Assembly embarked on its annual break, operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS), laid siege to the National Assembly. The siege occurred at the peak of a plot to unseat the President of the Senate, Saraki, who was making moves to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) then. Lawmakers, who got wind of the planned siege, besieged the NASS complex as early as 7:00a.m, but were barred by hood-wearing operatives from accessing the place. It took the intervention of some ebullient members of the House of Representatives to break the siege to make their way to the building. For several days, senators and members of the House of Representatives, kept vigils in the building to prevent any emergency sitting and impeachment of the presiding officers of the two chambers. Few weeks after the siege, Saraki announced his defection vide a letter addressed to the leadership of APC and a press statement he personally signed. Jeering and cheering of President Buhari The climate of 2018, was on Wednesday, December 19, when at the presentation of the N8.83 trillion 2019 budget proposal, lawmakers predominantly from the PDP, heckled the president while those from the APC cheered, but their cheer couldn't match the jeers from their opposition counterparts. Lawmakers speak Lawmakers have been reacting to the developments in the National Assembly in 2018, especially the recent heckling of the president. Senators and members of the House of Representatives, who spoke to Sunday Sun, traded blames. Senators Godswill Akpabio, Matthew Urhoghide, Clifford Ordia, Adamu Abdullahi, Gbenga Ashafa, among others, spoke along party lines. Akpabio who recently defected to the APC, put the blame on Saraki and Dogara. He called on the duo to resign since they were no longer in control of the National Assembly. "Even when they tried, we had the upper hand during the budget presentation. Our party members cheered up the president more than the way PDP people jeered him. I think they should all resign their positions," Akpabio said. Urhoghide on his part said that the jeers and cheers were unnecessary. He, however, noted that the cheers by members of the APC led to jeers from their PDP counterparts, arguing that it could have been avoided. "It is expected. We are going into an election year and what happened was expected. Many of us didn't hear what the president said throughout because the noise was too loud. We tried to listen, but they drowned the whole place," he said. For Abdullahi, Saraki and Dogara masterminded the embarrassment. He said that since their attempt to override the veto of the president failed, they decided to embarrass him during the budget presentation. "Those people will go to jail after the 2019 general elections. They masterminded this whole thing to embarrass the president and I am happy that they didn't succeed. We had the upper hand in the end. This is very shameful, I must say," he said. Ashafa, said the protest was unexpected, adding that despite the brawl, the points made by the president were noted. He said that for the first time, the president budgeted over N2 trillion for debt servicing even as he hailed his other developmental projects. The chairman, House Committee on Media and Publicity, Abdukrasak Namdas described what played out in the House of Representatives as democracy in action. Namdas told journalists in Abuja that the most important thing was that the president was able to lay the 2019 Appropriation Bill before the National Assembly. The Deputy Minority Leader, Chukwuka Onyema, said that the 2019 Appropriation Bill is not different from previous budgets presented by President Buhari, since he assumed office in 2015. The lawmaker stated that since the inception of the present administration, the government has performed woefully in the implementation of the budget, noting that like the ones before it the 2018 budget may soon be followed by excuses for non-performance. According to him, the dismal implementation of the budget since 2015 betrays the All Progressives Congress (APC) led federal government as insensitive to the plight of Nigerians, who are longing for economic development. The JudiciaryIt's bumpy year The 2018 legal year commenced with growing concerns on how to resolve the backlog of high-profile criminal cases littering the courts across the country, which started over 10 years ago. Beyond  the the backlog of criminal cases, the judiciary during the year under review was faced with the problem of how to redeem its integrity, which has suffered terribly due to the disreputable acts of some judges in connivance with some members of the bar. Indeed, the judiciary was characterised by justice to the highest bidder, hasty judgment against the poor, personal inefficiency, slow judicial process, tolerance of unwarranted petitions and injunctions. These and more are the blemishes of the Nigerian judiciary in 2018. Era of protracted trial of cases In the past, it was a common trend that the arrest and arraignment of politically exposed persons usually generate frenzy in the media, but soon after that the defendants, through their lawyers, would raise preliminary objections, challenging the competence of the charges and the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the cases. The judge would rule, dismissing such preliminary objections in most cases, after which the defendants would file an appeal and ask for stay of proceedings and await the outcome of the appeal. While proceedings have been suspended, the appeal would travel for many years up to the Supreme Court, which would then, in most cases, dismiss the appeal and ask the defendants to go back to the trial court for the case to be re-opened. However, the passage of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 by former President Goodluck Jonathan marked the dawn of a new era in the Nigerian criminal justice system, as the law, among other radical provisions, abolished stay of proceedings. Another interesting provisions of the Act is Section 396(3) and (4) which stipulated that "hearings shall be on a daily basis, but in exceptional cases, while adjournments, not to be in excess of 14 working days, may be granted, but such adjournments must not exceed five in any proceedings. But it is not yet Uhuru as defence lawyers have started to deploy other tricks, which were not envisaged by the ACJA, to delay criminal cases and keep them perpetually in court. Among such new dilatory tricks are long cross-examination of witnesses by defence lawyers; intimidation of judges through petitions and complaints of alleged bias; filing of no-case submission and constant resort to appeal as exemplified by the ongoing N400million alleged fraud case of a former Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Olisa Metuh. Another factor against speedy disposal of high-profile cases is the Constitutional presumption of innocence, which makes it extremely difficult to prove allegations of corruption in an adversarial system that Nigeria operates. Except this is reversed, conviction of high-profile corrupt persons will remain a mirage. The above scenario was responsible to the lack of speedy disposal of high-profile corruption cases. For instance, only 12 major convictions have been secured after trial in 17 years since the inception of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in 2002, out of about the 177 high-profile prosecution conducted, between 2000 and 2017. On the other hand within the same period, the EFCC and ICPC secured an average of 100 convictions each year for low-level offenders. Those convicted are Mrs Anajemba; Mr Emmanuel Nwude; Chief Bode George, whose conviction was\~ overturned by the Supreme Court on technical grounds. The remaining seven convictions were subject to plea bargain, one of which was the conviction of Mr Lucky Igbenedion, the former governor of Edo State, who was sentenced to a prison term with an option of fine which was paid promptly in court. Some others were the conviction of Chief Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, a former Governor of Bayelsa and one Mr Golama, a former Chairman of Bank of the North, both of them were convicted subject to plea bargain, but former President Jonathan has granted them Presidential pardon. Backlog of high-profile cases The 2018 legal year began with the trail of high-profile cases, which were a carry over from previous legal years. Some of the notable cases involved Saminu Turaki, a former Governor of Jigawa State, charged for alleged misappropriation of N36 billion while in office; Sule Lamido, former governor of Jigawa State, charged for alleged abuse of office and money laundering; Aliyu Akwe Doma, former governor of Nasarawa State, charged for allegedly laundering State funds to the tune of N8 billion; Ikedi Ohakim, former governor of Imo State, charged for allegedly making cash payment of $ 2.29 million for land; Olisa Metuh, former Publicity Secretary of the PDP, standing trial for corruption charges along side his firm, Destra investment limited to the tune of N400million, said to be from the office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), without executing any contract. Col. Sambo Dasuki (retd), was National Security Adviser to former President Goodluck Jonathan. He is standing trial for allegedly mismanaging $2.1 billion meant for purchase of arms to fight Boko Haram insurgents. Year of reforms At his inauguration, the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen promisedthe Executive arm the full cooperation of the judiciary in the continuation of the war against corruption and misconduct in the judiciary. It was on account of this promise that he instituted a wide-range 13-point reform that if faithfully adhered to by his colleagues on the bench, can literally revolutionise the delivery of judicial services in the country. In  driving home these reforms, which are aimed at improving quick dispensation of justice and also rid the system of bad eggs, the CJN adopted the use of new technology through the introduction of Nigeria Case Management System (NCMS). Onnoghen also inaugurated a 13-man steering committee on judiciary reform. The committee headed by the Secretary of the National Judicial Service Commission, Mrs Bilkisu Bashir, was tasked "to coordinate a comprehensive reform of the country's judiciary". The reform introduced new modalities for the  appointment of judicial officers, tightening judicial discipline regulations; and fashioning out a speedy way to clear backlog of cases, among other measures. In addition, judges require the notification and permission of the CJN to travel out of the country. Judges of the lower courts are required to submit for assessment by the Federal Judicial Service Commission, quarterly report of cases handled, while higher courts submit their reports to the NJC. In other to keep incompetent men and women out of the bench, appointment will be subject to written examination and interviews through rigorous screening and painstakingly appointment procedures. To give effect to this anti-corruption stance, the NJC constituted the Corruption and Financial Crimes Cases Trial Monitoring Committee (COTRIMCO) headed by a retired Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Suleiman Galadima, to serve as checks on the excesses of some bad eggs on the bench. The committee has identified poor prosecution, absence of counsel for parties in court, reliance on irrelevant documentary evidence, multiplicity of charges, non-adherence to court rules/procedure, retirement/transfer of judges; amendment of charges after commencement of trial amongst others as some of the factors militating against speedy disposal of corruption cases. Justice Onnoghen had at the beginning of the 2017/2018 legal year, announced the setting up of special courts within high courts to handle only corruption cases. Breakthroughs The 2018 legal year saw the conviction of ex-Plateau governor and serving Senator, Joshua Dariye to 14 years imprisonment on charges of criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of over N1.16 billion belonging to the state. The sentence was, however, commuted to 10 years by the Court of Appeal. His Taraba State counterpart, Jolly Nyame, was equally  sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, which was commuted to 12 years by the Court of Appeal. Judiciary corruption Conceding that corruption is deep rooted in the judiciary, the CJN, Justice Onnoghen stated that "corruption in the judiciary is not limited to bribe-taking, but the giving of judgments or orders based on any consideration other than legal merit". Onnoghen was addressing judges and Khadis at the 2018 refresher course held at the National Judicial Institute (NJI), Abuja. Also, his predecessor, Justice Mariam Aloma Mukhtar at a different forum, had cause to lament what she described as the rising culture of lobbying, favouritism, and godfatherism in the Nigerian judiciary. Recall that in October 2016, the Department of State Service (DSS), in what it termed "sting operation" stormed the residences of seven serving judicial officers of the Supreme, Federal and High courts across the country at the wee hours of the night and arrested some of them. However, more than seven out of the hundreds of high-profile criminal cases initiated under the Buhari administration has been concluded, but none of them resulted in the conviction of the defendants as they were either discharged at the trial court or their conviction at the trial court was over-ruled by the Court of Appeal. For instance, the Lagos Division of the Court of Appeal had on December 12, 2017 dismissed the corruption charges instituted against a Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Hyeldzira Ngangiwa, on a very novel ground that generated controversy in the judicial circle. The decision of the Court of Appeal was to the effect that a serving Judge could not be investigated or prosecuted without first being disciplined by the NJC. Irked by that judgment, the Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee against Corruption (PACAC), Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN) said it was a show of Espirit de corps among the judges. Cleaning the Augean stable As a self-cleansing organ of government, the National Judicial Council (NJC), which is the body charged with the responsibility of hiring, firing and disciplining erring judicial officers appears to have heightened its activities lately. More judicial officers are now getting warnings for different judicial infractions, while others are recommended for dismissal or compulsory retirement periodically. A lot more are also under investigation following plethora of petitions before the NJC. Those sacked by the NJC for various acts of misconduct include Justice Adeniyi Ademola of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court; Justice Rita Ofili-Ajumogobia; also of the Federal High Court; Justice Segun Tokode, Federal High Court; Justice Michael Goji of the High Court of Adamawa State and Justice James Agbadu-Fishim of the National Industrial Court. Nigerians want improved economy, security, hitch-free elections in 2019 Amid the worsening security situation, apocalyptic economic predictions and rising fear over next year's general elections, Nigerians have called on the government to rise to its responsibilities on all fronts to save the nation from further slide in 2019. A cross section of Nigerians who spoke to Sunday Sun on their expectations from the government in the coming year unanimously agreed that kick-starting the New Year with transparent, free and fair elections would be pivotal to achieving peace and tranquility in the country in 2019. National Chairman of Arewa United Forum, Alhaji Shuaibu Ado Dansudu tasked the government to take necessary steps towards ensuring a credible election in the coming year. Dansudu reasoned that Nigeria already had so many problems to contend with, saying that the nation could not afford to add election crisis to its present challenges. Prof Abiodun Michael Oni, Head, Department of Political Science, Babcock University, Ogun State, called on the government to show more commitment in prosecuting the war against insurgency in the country. Oni opined that it was high time the government showed more ruthlessness in prosecuting the war, stressing that the government has so far been playing politics with the issue. He also called on the government, as well as other stakeholders to play by the rules as the nation heads towards the 2019 election. He said that the incumbency factor must not be unduly exploited. "It is only when we have a flawless election that we can prevent violence. INEC must resist every temptation that may taint the outcome of the exercise. Buhari must do everything possible to ensure credible election having been a victim of flawed elections in the past," he said. Dr Margaret Okafor, an educationist, said the government must sustain its anti-corruption crusade in the coming year if Nigeria must overcome its numerous challenges. Okafor who identified social injustice as the bane of the country maintained that only a sustained effort by the government to address social injustice in the country would save Nigeria from total collapse. On his part, a lecturer in the Department of Economics, University of Lagos, Dr Afolabi Adebisi, expressed concern over the nation's economy, which he believes has been stagnated by lack of proper attention from the government on the real sector. "The economy is still in doldrums. The government must focus on the real sector of the economy. Our economy does not have a strong structural base. The real sector of the economy is not there. The nation's economy is dominated by buying and selling; no effort is being made to bring the real sector, which is the basis, to life. This must change next year; the government must focus on the real sector of the economy," he said. Uche Nwaleke, Professor of Banking and Finance, Nasarawa State University, Nasarawa State, said that he would like to see the nation's economy coming out stronger in 2019 just as he called for improved infrastructure in the country. "I expect the stock market to rebound in 2019, especially after the general elections which I pray should be free, fair and credible. In particular, I expect to see the return of foreign portfolio investors in Nigeria next year who are currently taking flight due in part to the heightening political risk as we approach the polls. "The halt in capital flow reversals next year will support healthy external reserves and stable exchange rate. By and large, I expect to see a stronger economy in 2019 where the contributions of key sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing to GDP will be on the rise and helped in particular by CBN's strategic interventions," he said. Chinelo Ugwu, a postgraduate student of University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus, said that she would like to see Nigeria go through another hitch-free election year that would culminate in the emergence of good economic team to lead the nation out of its current economic crisis. Alhaji Rasheed Awofeso, a community leader in Lagos State, in his own contribution said that he is looking forward to better times in 2019 after what he described as a rough year. "My expectation in year 2019 is for things to get better. Honestly, the outgoing year has really been tough on Nigerians because of our crawling economy. So, I expect that come year 2019, the government would provide enabling environment devoid of social insecurity. I believe that once this is attained, both local and foreign investors will be attracted, and this will be a catalyst for growing employment opportunities." Prince Saviour Iche, national president, Association of Micro Entrepreneurs of Nigeria, AMEN, hopes to see Nigeria feel the impact of governance better in 2019 and called for more decisive actions in dealing with insecurity in the country. His words: "We had a very rough 2018; things were mostly on the negative. The recent killings in Zamfara plus that of the former naval chief showed how bad it has become. A situation where a top ranking military official is killed on the road makes one to worry for the common masses. So, in 2019, we would want our budget to be passed on time by the National Assembly and I expect it to reflect on the common man. Also I expect that we have a free and fair election without bloodshed," he said. Eric Obuh, an artist, admonished the government to pay attention to the demands of the labour unions to avoid nationwide strike. Aham Njoku, a legal practitioner urged the government to do everything within its powers to ensure that the 2019 elections meet international standards just as he called for an end to violence and killings in Nigeria. Bamidele James Avose, a community leader, urged the government to have a fruitful dialogue with the labour, ASUU and ASUP in order to avoid total shutdown in the nation's tertiary institutions.

I. PREAMBLE We, the Heads of State and Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the Russian Federation, the Republic of India, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of South Africa, met from 25 \- 27 July 2018 in Johannesburg, at the 10th BRICS Summit. The 10th BRICS Summit, as a milestone in the history of BRICS, was held under the theme "BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for Inclusive Growth and Shared Prosperity in the 4th Industrial Revolution". We are meeting on the occasion of the centenary of the birth of Nelson Mandela and we recognise his values, principles and dedication to the service of humanity and acknowledge his contribution to the struggle for democracy internationally and the promotion of the culture of peace throughout the world. We commend South Africa for the Johannesburg Summit thrust on development, inclusivity and mutual prosperity in the context of technology driven industrialisation and growth. We, the Heads of State and Government, express satisfaction regarding the achievements of BRICS over the last ten years as a strong demonstration of BRICS cooperation toward the attainment of peace, harmony and shared development and prosperity, and deliberated on ways to consolidate them further. We reaffirm our commitment to the principles of mutual respect, sovereign equality, democracy, inclusiveness and strengthened collaboration. As we build upon the successive BRICS Summits, we further commit ourselves to enhancing our strategic partnership for the benefit of our people through the promotion of peace, a fairer international order, sustainable development and inclusive growth, and to strengthening the three-pillar-driven cooperation in the areas of economy, peace and security and people-to-people exchanges. We recommit ourselves to a world of peace and stability, and support the central role of the United Nations, the purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter and respect for international law, promoting democracy and the rule of law. We reinforce our commitment to upholding multilateralism and to working together on the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals as we foster a more representative, democratic, equitable, fair and just international political and economic order. We reiterate our determination to work together to strengthen multilateralism and the rule of law in international relations, and to promote a fair, just, equitable, democratic and representative international order. We express satisfaction at the outcomes of Ministerial Meetings that have been held (Annex 1) and look forward to the remainder of meetings to be held under the 2018 BRICS Calendar of Events. II. STRENGTHENING MULTILATERALISM, REFORMING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND ADDRESSING COMMON CHALLENGES We reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations, as the universal multilateral organisation entrusted with the mandate for maintaining international peace and security, advancing global development and promoting and protecting human rights. We reaffirm our commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and support for the United Nations as the universal intergovernmental organisation entrusted with the responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, advancing sustainable development as well as ensuring the promotion, and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We reiterate our commitment to the strengthening of multilateral institutions of global governance to ensure that they are able to comprehensively address global challenges. We also recognise the inherent strength of regional initiatives in support of the objectives of the broader multilateral system. We further reaffirm our commitment to the centrality of the universal collective security system enshrined in the UN Charter. We recognize the importance of working towards an international system based on international law, with the UN Charter as its fundamental cornerstone, which fosters cooperation and stability in a multipolar order. We note the long overdue outstanding task of ensuring the adequate representation of African States in the UN, especially in peace and security matters. Faced with international challenges requiring our cooperative efforts, we reiterate our commitment to shaping a more fair, just and representative multipolar international order to the shared benefit of humanity, in which the general prohibition of the use of force is fully upheld and which excludes the imposition of unilateral coercive measures outside the framework of the UN Charter. We emphasise the indivisible nature of peace and security and reiterate that no country should enhance its security at the expense of the security of others. We recall the 2005 World Summit Outcome document and reaffirm the need for a comprehensive reform of the UN, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more representative, effective and efficient, and to increase the representation of the developing countries so that it can adequately respond to global challenges. China and Russia reiterate the importance they attach to the status and role of Brazil, India and South Africa in international affairs and support their aspiration to play a greater role in the UN. We underscore the importance of sustained efforts aimed at making the United Nations more effective and efficient in implementing its mandates. We encourage further collaboration amongst the BRICS countries on a better resourced UN, on its administration and budget, on preserving the UN's Member State-driven character and ensuring better oversight of and strengthening the Organisation. We express our support for continued cooperation of BRICS members in areas of mutual interest including through regular exchanges amongst their multilateral Missions. We reaffirm our commitment to fully implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to provide equitable, inclusive, open, all-round innovation-driven and sustainable development, in its three dimensions \- economic, social and environmental \- in a balanced and integrated manner, towards the ultimate goal of eradicating poverty by 2030. We pledge our support for the important role of the United Nations, including the High Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF), in coordinating and reviewing global implementation of the 2030 Agenda, to reform the UN Development System with a view to enhancing its capability in supporting member States in implementing the 2030 Agenda. We urge developed countries to honour their Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments fully in time and to provide additional development resources to developing countries. Regarding Climate Change, we welcome the progress towards finalizing the Work Programme under the Paris Agreement and express our willingness to continue working constructively with other Parties to conclude its related negotiations at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) towards the 24th Conference of the Parties (UNFCCC COP24 ) to be held in Katowice, Poland in December 2018. We call upon all countries to fully implement the Paris Agreement adopted under the principles of the UNFCCC including the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and urge developed countries to provide financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries to enhance their capability in mitigation and adaptation. We undertake to strengthen BRICS cooperation in energy, especially in transitioning to more environmentally sustainable energy systems supportive of the global sustainable development agenda, balanced economic growth and the collective socio-economic wellbeing of our citizens. We continue to strive toward universal energy access, energy security, energy affordability, reduced pollution and environmental conservation. We reaffirm that the diversification of energy supply sources, including renewable and low carbon energy sources, investments in energy and energy infrastructure, energy industry and market development and intra-BRICS collaboration for access to primary energy sources will continue to underpin our energy security. We recognise the need to accelerate energy transition including in transportation, heating and industry uses. We acknowledge the importance of energy efficiency and the popularisation of an energy efficient life style in virtue of its potential contributions to energy security, industrial competitiveness, emissions reduction, economic growth, job creation and other areas when introduced. We acknowledge that the BRICS Ministers of Energy agreed to establish the BRICS Energy Research Cooperation Platform and to develop its Terms of Reference, and note the ongoing discussions for that purpose. We reaffirm and support the establishment of the BRICS Agricultural Research Platform (ARP) initiated by India in 2016. We appreciate the fundamental importance of research, development and innovation in global sustainability and competitiveness. We endeavour to strengthen the agricultural research collaborative networks among the BRICS countries to enhance the resilience of the collective agricultural and food systems in the face of the changing climate. We recognise the need for follow-up steps in implementing the aims and objectives of the ARP. We commit to step up intra-BRICS collaboration including within the frame of the Agriculture Research Platform and the Basic Agriculture Information Exchange System (BAIES). We acknowledge the outcomes of the 4th BRICS Environment Ministers Meeting which was held under the theme "Strengthening cooperation amongst BRICS on Circular Economy in the context of the Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP)". We note that the circular economy approach represents enormous potential to reduce waste, to forge more environmentally sustainable processes, diversify our economies whilst contributing to economic growth and job creation. We acknowledge the outcomes of the successive BRICS Environment Ministers' Meetings including the implementation of the Environmentally Friendly Technology Platform, Clean Rivers Umbrella Programme and the Partnership for Urban Environment Sustainability Initiative. The progress in the establishment of the BRICS Environmentally Sound Technology (BEST) Cooperation Platform is acknowledged, which is intended to be practical and results orientated, and would include partners, science organisations, civil society, private sector and financial institutions. We welcome the commitment to enhance cooperation in the field of water on the basis of sustainable development in an integrated way, addressing the themes of water access flood protection, drought management, water supply and sanitation, water and climate, systematically facilitating water pollution prevention and control, river and lake ecosystem restoration and preservation, ecosystem conservation, and water resources management. We acknowledge the BRICS Meeting of Heads of Disaster Management in Buffalo City, wherein the Action Plan 2018-2020, was adopted and the first meeting of the BRICS Joint Task Force was held to further enhance our cooperation in this field. We reaffirm the intention to enhance cooperation and collaboration amongst BRICS countries in the field of biodiversity conservation, sustainable use and equitable access and benefit sharing of biological resources, and also undertake to promote our cooperation in biodiversity-related international conventions and fora including on endangered species and amongst our National Parks authorities. We recognise the vast potential in cooperation and collaboration in advancing the Oceans Economy amongst BRICS countries, which encompasses multiple sectors, including the strategic areas of maritime transport, shipbuilding, offshore oil and exploration, aquaculture, port development, research and technology, conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, marine and coastal tourism, financial and insurance services, as well as coastal industrial zone development. We remain committed to the continued implementation of the Agenda for BRICS cooperation on population matters 2015-2020, which was agreed to by the Ministers responsible for Population Matters in 2014, because the dynamics of population age structure changes in BRICS countries pose challenges and present opportunities, particularly with regard to gender inequality and women's rights, youth development, employment and the future of work, urbanisation, migration and ageing. We deplore the continued terrorist attacks, including in some BRICS countries. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations wherever committed and by whomsoever. We urge concerted efforts to counter terrorism under the UN auspices on a firm international legal basis and express our conviction that a comprehensive approach is necessary to ensure an effective fight against terrorism. We recall the responsibility of all States to prevent financing of terrorist networks and terrorist actions from their territories. We call upon the international community to establish a genuinely broad international counter-terrorism coalition and support the UN's central coordinating role in this regard. We stress that the fight against terrorism must be conducted in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international refugee and humanitarian law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We reaffirm our commitment on increasing the effectiveness of the UN counter-terrorism framework, including in the areas of cooperation and coordination among the relevant UN entities, designation of terrorists and terrorist groups and technical assistance to Members States. We call for expeditious finalisation and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) by the United Nations General Assembly. To address the threat of chemical and biological terrorism, we support and emphasise the need for launching multilateral negotiations on an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism, including at the Conference on Disarmament. We firmly believe that those responsible for committing, organising, or supporting terrorist acts must be held accountable. We call upon all nations to adopt a comprehensive approach in combating terrorism, which should include countering radicalisation, recruitment, travel of Foreign Terrorist Fighters, blocking sources and channels of terrorist financing including, for instance, through organised crime by means of money-laundering, supply of weapons, drug trafficking and other criminal activities, dismantling terrorist bases, and countering misuse of the Internet by terrorist entities through misuse of the latest Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). We reaffirm the importance of the elaboration under the UN auspices of rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States in ensuring security in the use of ICTs. We embrace the undeniable benefits and new opportunities brought about by the advances in ICTs, especially in the context of the 4th industrial revolution. However, these advances also bring with them new challenges and threats resultant from the growing misuse of ICTs for criminal activities, the increasing malicious use of ICTs by state and non-state actors. In this regard, we stress the importance of international cooperation against terrorist and criminal use of ICTs and therefore reiterate the need to develop a universal regulatory binding instrument on combatting the criminal use of ICTs within the UN. We acknowledge the progress made in promoting cooperation according to the BRICS Roadmap of Practical Cooperation on Ensuring Security in the Use of ICTs or any other mutually agreed mechanism. We also acknowledge the importance to establish a framework of cooperation among BRICS member States on ensuring security in the Use of ICTs and, in this regard, BRICS member States will work towards consideration and elaboration of a BRICS intergovernmental agreement on cooperation on this matter. III. STRENGTHENING AND CONSOLIDATING BRICS COOPERATION IN INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY We reaffirm our commitment to collective efforts for peaceful settlement of disputes through political and diplomatic means, and recognise the role of the UN Security Council as bearing the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. We express our concern over the ongoing conflict and heightened tensions in the Middle-East region and our conviction that there is no place for unlawful resorting to force or external interference in any conflict and that, ultimately, lasting peace can only be established through broad-based, inclusive national dialogue with due respect for the independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of each of the countries of the region. We agree that, in each of the countries in the region, citizens have legitimate aspirations to fully enjoy civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and fundamental freedoms, especially with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian situation. We agree that the conflicts elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa should not be used to delay resolution of long-standing conflicts, in particular the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. We reiterate the need for renewed diplomatic efforts to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East on the basis of relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid Principles, the Arab Peace Initiative and previous agreements between the parties, through negotiations with a view to creating an independent, viable, territorially contiguous Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel. We reiterate that the status of Jerusalem is one of the final status issues to be defined in the context of negotiations between Israel and Palestine. With regard to the situation in Gaza, we reiterate our support to the UN General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/ES-10/20) on the protection of the Palestinian population and call for its full implementation. We reiterate our support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). We commend its vital role in providing health, education and other basic services for almost 5.3 million Palestinian refugees and underscore its relevance to bringing stability to the region and the need for ensuring a more adequate, sufficient, predictable and sustained funding for the Agency. The ongoing conflict and major humanitarian crisis in the Republic of Yemen are also causes for further concern. We call for unhindered access for the provision of humanitarian assistance to all parts of Yemen and urge the international community to expeditiously provide the necessary assistance. We urge all parties to fully respect international law, to cease hostilities and to return to the UN brokered peace talks, leading to an inclusive Yemeni-led dialogue towards the achievement of a political solution to the conflict. We also call on all parties directly involved in the current diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region to overcome their dissensions through dialogue and welcome the efforts of Kuwait in this regard. We reaffirm our support for the process of an "Afghan-led, Afghan-owned'' national peace and reconciliation process. We express our concern over the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan particularly the increase in the number and intensity of terrorist-related attacks on the Afghan National Security Forces, the Government and civilians. We call on the international community to assist the government and the people of Afghanistan with the objective of working towards the realisation of peace. We also welcome the Parliamentary elections that are scheduled to be held in October 2018 and the Presidential elections in 2019. We reaffirm our commitment for a political resolution of the conflict in Syria, through an inclusive "Syrian-led, Syrian-owned" political process that safeguards the state sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, in pursuance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015) and taking into account the result of the Congress of the Syrian National Dialogue in Sochi. We reiterate our support for the Geneva process and the mediation offered by the UN, as well as the Astana process which has been showing signs of positive developments on the ground, and stress the complementarity between the two initiatives. We reaffirm our commitment to a peaceful resolution in Syria and our opposition to measures that run contrary to the UN Charter and the authority of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and that do not contribute to advancing the political process. We also highlighted the importance of unity in the fight against terrorist organisations in Syria in full observance of the relevant UNSC Resolutions. We reiterate our strong condemnation of the use of chemical weapons by any party, for any purpose and under any circumstances and renew calls for comprehensive, objective, independent, and transparent investigations of all alleged incidents. We call for enhanced efforts to provide necessary humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people, bearing in mind urgent reconstruction needs. Recalling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on the Iranian nuclear programme we call upon all parties to fully comply with their obligations and ensure full and effective implementation of the JCPOA to promote international and regional peace and security. We welcome recent developments to achieve the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and maintain peace and stability in North East Asia. We reaffirm the commitment for a peaceful, diplomatic and political solution to the situation. We express our serious concern about the possibility of an arms race in outer space and of outer space turning into an arena for military confrontation. We reaffirm that the prevention of an arms race, including of the placement of weapons in outer space, would avert a grave danger for international peace and security. We emphasise the paramount importance of strict compliance with the existing legal regime providing for the peaceful use of outer space. We also reaffirm that there is a need to consolidate and reinforce this regime. We welcome the newly established Group of Governmental Experts to discuss possible elements for a legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space including inter alia, on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space. We stress that practical transparency and confidence building measures may also contribute towards non-placement of weapons in outer space. We reiterate that the Conference on Disarmament, as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, has the primary role in the negotiation of a multilateral agreement or agreements, as appropriate, on the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects. We welcome South Africa's hosting of the Meeting of BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations in Pretoria on 4 June 2018. The Ministers exchanged views on major global political, security, economic and financial issues of common concern and on strengthening BRICS cooperation. We look forward to the forthcoming Meeting of the BRICS Ministers of Foreign Affairs/International Relations on the margins of the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly. We welcome the 8th Meeting of the BRICS High Representatives for Security held on 28 and 29 June 2018 in Durban, and commend them for enriching BRICS' dialogue on the global security environment, counter-terrorism, security in the use of ICTs, major international and regional hotspots, transnational organised crime, peacekeeping, as well as the linkage between national security and development issues. We emphasise the important role of United Nations peacekeeping to international peace and security, and the contribution of BRICS countries in this regard. We recognise the need for BRICS countries to further enhance mutual communication and cooperation on peacekeeping matters at the United Nations and the South African initiative for a BRICS working group on peacekeeping in this regard. We commend the African Union for its efforts aimed at resolving and managing conflicts on the continent and welcome the strengthening of the cooperation between the United Nations Security Council and the African Union Peace and Security Council. We commend the African Union's commitment to the "Silencing of the Guns by 2020" and support efforts to strengthen the African Peace and Security Architecture. IV. BRICS PARTNERSHIP FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY, REFORM OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC GLOBAL GOVERNANCE INSTITUTIONS, AND THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION We welcome that the global economy has continued to improve, while noting that growth has been less synchronised and that downside risks still remain. This is reflected in a variety of challenges including rising trade conflicts, geopolitical risks, commodity price volatility, high private and public indebtedness, inequality and not sufficiently inclusive growth. We understand the critical importance of ensuring that the benefits from growth are shared in a more inclusive manner. We further stress the importance of a favourable external environment for sustained growth of global trade. BRICS economies continue to support global economic expansion and outlook. We advocate continued use of fiscal, monetary and structural policies in concert, to forge strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We express concern at the spill-over effects of macro-economic policy measures in some major advanced economies that may cause economic and financial volatility in emerging economies and impact their growth prospects adversely. We call on major advanced and emerging market economies to continue policy dialogue and coordination in the context of the G20, FSB and other fora to address these potential risks. Recalling the Johannesburg Summit's focus on the 4th Industrial Revolution and the outcomes of the BRICS Meetings of Science and Technology and Industry Ministers, we commend the establishment of the BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution (PartNIR). To commence the full operationalisation of PartNIR, an Advisory Group will be set up, comprising of respective representatives of BRICS Ministries of Industry, in consultation with appropriate Ministries, to develop, as a first step, the Terms of Reference and a Work Plan aligned with the 4th Industrial Revolution priorities, to be submitted to the BRICS Chair. The PartNIR aims at deepening BRICS cooperation in digitalisation, industrialisation, innovation, inclusiveness and investment, to maximise the opportunities and address the challenges arising from the 4th Industrial Revolution. It should enhance comparative advantages, boost economic growth, promote economic transformation of BRICS countries, strengthen sustainable industrial production capacity, create networks of science parks and technology business incubators, and support small and medium-sized enterprises in technology intensive areas. We believe that the initiative to establish the BRICS Networks of Science Parks, Technology Business Incubators and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises is a promising step in that direction. We recognise the critical and positive role the internet plays globally in promoting economic, social and cultural development. In this regard, we commit to continue to work together through the existing mechanisms to contribute to the secure, open, peaceful, cooperative and orderly use of ICTs on the basis of participation by all states on an equal footing in the evolution and functioning of the internet and its governance, bearing in mind the need to involve the relevant stakeholders in their respective roles and responsibilities. We recognise the importance of BRICS scientific, technical, innovation and entrepreneurship cooperation for sustainable development and to enhance inclusive growth. We welcome the dynamic development of BRICS cooperation in science, technology and innovation and attach special importance to the advancement of our joint work in this area. We affirm the value of implementing coordinated BRICS scientific projects aimed at promoting BRICS science, technology and innovation potential as a contribution to our combined efforts in addressing the challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We commend the progress of ongoing BRICS IPR cooperation. We recognise the importance of the development and transfer of technologies, including to developing countries, contributing to long-term sustainable and balanced global growth, and in this regard stress the importance of strengthening cooperation in intellectual property rights which contributes to innovation and the advent of new technologies to the benefit of society as a whole. We are convinced that trade and technology are vital sources of inclusive growth, including through economic integration and consolidation of global value chains in sustainable and equitable ways. Technological progress will have wide ranging implications for production of goods and services as well as incomes of people. Appropriate policies and measures need to be taken to ensure that the developing countries benefit from the advantages of technological progress and do not suffer from lack of its early adoption. It is essential to develop effective policies to bridge the digital divides, including through supporting people to learn and by adopting new technologies and ensure effective mechanisms for transfer of relevant technologies. We strongly acknowledge that skills development is critical to addressing the emerging mismatch between the new skills demanded by an increasingly technology-and knowledge-driven global economy and the older skill set of many workers. The pace, scale and scope of present-day economic change make it that more challenging. In this regard, we support measures including policy recommendations proposed in the G20 Initiative to Promote Quality Apprenticeship and the BRICS Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation and Reduction through Skills, to further facilitate vocational training, lifelong learning and the training that is relevant to the fast-changing demand of growing economies and world of work. We reaffirm the centrality of the rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive multilateral trading system, as embodied in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), that promotes a predictable trade environment and the centrality of the WTO, and recognise the importance of the development dimension, and will make all efforts to strengthen the multilateral trading system. We recognise that the multilateral trading system is facing unprecedented challenges. We underscore the importance of an open world economy, enabling all countries and peoples to share the benefits of globalisation, which should be inclusive and support sustainable development and prosperity of all countries. We call on all WTO members to abide by WTO rules and honour their commitments in the multilateral trading system. We recall that the WTO Dispute Settlement System is a cornerstone of the multilateral trading system and is designed to enhance security and predictability in international trade. We note with concern the impasse in the selection process for new Appellate Body Members that can paralyse the dispute settlement system and undermine the rights and obligations of all Members. We, therefore, urge all Members to engage constructively to address this challenge as a matter of priority. We acknowledge the need to upkeep WTO's negotiating function. We, therefore, agree to constructively engage in further developing the current legal framework of the multilateral trading system within the WTO, taking into consideration the concerns and interests of all WTO members, including in particular the developing members. We acknowledge the importance of infrastructure development and connectivity in Africa and recognise the strides made by the African Union to identify and address the continent's infrastructure challenges, inter alia, through the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA). We support the importance of stimulating infrastructure investment on the basis of mutual benefit to support industrial development, job-creation, skills development, food and nutrition security and poverty eradication and sustainable development in Africa. We therefore reaffirm our support for sustainable infrastructure development in Africa, including addressing the infrastructure financing deficit. Keenly aware of the need for Africa's industrialisation and the realisation of the African Union's Agenda 2063, we commend African countries and the African Union on the signing of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The AfCFTA is an important step to economic integration on the continent and the unlocking of the tremendous potential of intra-African trade and in addressing its socio-economic challenges. In this regard, we reiterate our support for Agenda 2063 and efforts to promote continental integration and development. We advocate for a strong Global Financial Safety Net with an adequately resourced, quota-based International Monetary Fund (IMF) at its centre. To this effect, we reaffirm our commitment to conclude the IMF's 15th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula while protecting the voice of the poorest countries by the 2019 Spring Meetings and no later than the 2019 Annual Meetings. Governance reform of the IMF should strengthen the voice and representation of the poorest members of the IMF, including Sub-Saharan Africa. We welcome and congratulate Governor Lesetja Kganyago of the South African Reserve Bank on his appointment as the Chair of the International Monetary and Financial Committee. We note the steps undertaken on strengthening and ensuring the operational readiness of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) and welcome the completion of a successful test run of the de-linked portion of the CRA mechanism. We encourage cooperation between the CRA and the IMF. We note with satisfaction the progress achieved on establishing the BRICS Local Currency Bond Fund, and look forward to starting its operation. We agree to further strengthen cooperation on convergence of accounting standards and auditing oversight of BRICS countries in the area of bond issuance, and to further cooperation in these areas. We welcome the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on Collaborative Research on Distributed Ledger and Blockchain Technology in the Context of the Development of the Digital Economy. We believe that this work will contribute to our cooperation in adapting to the evolving internet economy. Infrastructure, investment and international development assistance projects are the bedrock for sustainable economic development and growth; boosting productivity and enhancing integration. We stress the significance of infrastructure development and integration to foster closer economic ties. We underscore the role that Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), in particular, the New Development Bank (NDB), are playing in catalysing private sector financing for public infrastructure and investment. We draw satisfaction from the progress made by the NDB in providing resources to contribute to the social, economic and environmental prospects of our countries and expect the Project Preparation Fund to be put into operation soon. We welcome the upcoming establishment of the Americas Regional Office in S\'e3o Paulo, Brazil, which, alongside the Africa Regional Centre, will help the NDB consolidate its presence in those continents. We note the NDB's Board of Governors' discussions on Innovative Approaches for Development Finance at its 3rd Annual Meeting on 28-29 May in Shanghai, China, that deliberated on the NDB's future development in the changing global environment. We stress the importance of enhancing BRICS financial cooperation to better serve the real economy and meet the development needs of BRICS countries. In the regard, we reaffirm our commitment to facilitate financial market integration through promoting the network of financial institutions and the coverage of financial services within BRICS countries, subject to each country's existing regulatory framework and WTO GATS obligations, and to ensure greater communication and cooperation between financial sector regulators. We will continue to enhance currency cooperation, consistent with each central bank's legal mandate, and to explore more modalities of the cooperation. We will also further expand green financing, so as to promote sustainable development in BRICS countries. We reaffirm our commitment to support international cooperation in combating illicit financial flows, including cooperation within Financial Actions Task Force (FATF) and World Customs Organisation. In this regard, we underscore the importance of increasing mutual exchanges and data sharing. We emphasise the importance of upholding and supporting the objectives of FATF and to intensify our cooperation to implement and improve its Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation in FATF. Corruption remains a global challenge with long-lasting impact, including the undermining of legal systems of states. It also presents a threat to economic growth by discouraging the necessary local and foreign investment in a country. We reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation as envisaged in Chapter IV of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. In that context, we commit to strengthening international cooperation within the context of the BRICS Working Group on Anticorruption Cooperation. Subject to our domestic legal systems we will cooperate in anti-corruption law enforcement, extradition of fugitives, economic and corruption offenders and repatriation in matters relating to assets recovery and other related criminal and non-criminal matters involving corruption and call on the International community to deny safe haven to corrupt persons and proceeds of corruption. We regard experience sharing and exchange as key to increasing mutual understanding and enhancing BRICS anti-corruption cooperation and will continue our efforts in this aspect as we have done in previous years. We will further offer each other support in the implementation of the UNCAC by creating platforms for exchanging information and exploring convergences in multi-lateral platforms. We commend the African Union on choosing 2018 as the year of combating corruption. In operationalising the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership, we welcome the positive outcomes of the 8th BRICS Trade Ministers Meeting as supported by the ongoing activities of the BRICS Contact Group on Economic and Trade Issues (CGETI). We also welcome the good progress made in the implementation of the BRICS Action Agenda on Economic and Trade Cooperation. We encourage measures that support greater participation, value addition and upward mobility in Global Value Chains for our firms, particularly in industry and agriculture, especially Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), including through the preservation of policy space to promote industrial development. In recognising the importance of increased value-added trade amongst BRICS countries, we commend the Ministers of Trade for reconvening CGETI's Trade Promotion Working Group as well as the BRICS E-Commerce Working Group. We welcome the commissioning of the review of the BRICS Joint Trade Study on promoting intra-BRICS Value Added Trade. We welcome the positive outcomes of the 8th BRICS Trade Ministers Meeting on cooperation on the IPR, e-commerce, trade in service, and further enhancement of cooperation in E-commerce, on standards and technical regulations, MSMEs and model e-port. We welcome the signing of the BRICS Memorandum of Understanding on Regional Aviation. We believe it is an important milestone in strengthening BRICS cooperation in the fields of connectivity and infrastructure. We appreciate the outcomes of cooperation between BRICS Customs Administrations in implementing the Strategic Framework of BRICS Customs Cooperation, and welcome its long-term objectives, including the early conclusion and entry into force of the BRICS Customs Mutual Administrative Assistance Agreement so that the BRICS Authorised Economic Operator Programme is functional by the end of 2022, including mutual recognition of controls and economic operators. In this regard, we further welcome the BRICS Customs Action Plan, which identifies actions that will be taken collectively by the BRICS Customs Administrations in the short, medium and long term to achieve the stated goals and the establishment of BRICS Custom Training Centres. We recognise the potential of the BRICS Customs Cooperation Committee and call for enhanced intra-BRICS cooperation and at relevant multilateral fora, including in trade facilitation, law enforcement, use of advanced information technologies and capacity building. We acknowledge the continued support provided by the BRICS Revenue Authorities for all the international initiatives towards reaching a globally fair and universally transparent tax system. We will continue our commitment to deal with the implications of the digital economy and, within that context, to ensure the fairness of the international tax system particularly towards the prevention of base erosion and shifting of profits, exchange of tax information, both on request and automatically, and needs-based capacity building for developing countries. We commit to deepen exchanges, sharing of experiences, best practices, mutual learning and exchanges of personnel in taxation matters. We welcome the establishment of the Capacity Building Mechanism between BRICS Revenue Authorities.

We welcome the establishment of Digital Economy Working Group within the framework of BRICS Business Council. Recognizing tourism's great potential to contribute to sustainable economic and social development, we welcome the initiative to establish a BRICS Working Group on Tourism, to foster greater cooperation between the BRICS countries and increase economic development and people-to-people relations. The BRICS Tourism work stream will exchange knowledge, experience and best practices in the areas of travel trade, air connectivity, tourism infrastructure, culture and medical tourism, barriers to tourism marketing, tourism safety and support \- financial, insurance and medical. We note with satisfaction that Intra-BRICS Tourism has grown despite the global economic downturn. V.

We recognise the importance and role of culture as one of the drivers of the 4th Industrial Revolution and acknowledge the economic opportunities that it presents. We commend the organisation of the 3rd BRICS Film Festival and recognise the need to further deepen cooperation in this field. We acknowledge South Africa's proposal regarding a draft BRICS Treaty on Co-Production of Films to further promote cooperation in this sphere and to showcase the diversity of BRICS cultures. We emphasise the guiding role of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Agreement between the Governments of the BRICS States on Cooperation in the Field of Culture (2017-2021) for creative and sustainable cultural cooperation, and we note the various ongoing activities and initiatives of the BRICS culture experts. We acknowledge the 2nd BRICS Seminar on Governance 2018 in Johannesburg, while recognising the intention of Brazil to hold the 3rd meeting in 2019 with greater and more diverse participation of academia and thinktanks of all BRICS countries. We acknowledge with satisfaction the progress made towards strengthening cooperation and interaction amongst our people, through exchanges including the Think-Tank Council, the Academic Forum, the Civil BRICS Forum, the Young Diplomats Forum, the Youth Summit and the Young Scientists Forum. We acknowledge the South African initiative regarding a BRICS Foreign Affairs Spokespersons Engagement.

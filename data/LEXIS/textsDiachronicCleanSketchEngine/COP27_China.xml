African climate change campaigners are optimistic that the United Nations climate change conference , or COP27 , being held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, will discuss issues pertinent to the continent. According to the African Development Bank, the continent loses $7 billion to $15 billion a year to climate change, and the figure is expected to hit $50 billion a year by 2030 if the situation doesn't change. The World Meteorological Organization estimates that stress over freshwater supplies due to climate change is affecting 250 million people in Africa and is expected to displace up to 700 million people by 2030. Mithika Mwenda, executive director of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, a consortium of more than 1,000 organizations from 48 African countries, said Africa has high hopes about COP27 .It is the fifth COP held in Africa, he said. While it's being called the African COP for "African civil society we are qualifying it to be the African people's COP, because we want the issues pertinent to Africa to be articulated during the conference," he added. COP27 . Key issues include recognition that Africa requires support, as the continent has special needs and circumstances and is more impacted than other regions. "Right now we are facing enormous challenges in terms of drought, floods and hurricanes. All that puts Africa into a very precarious position in terms of achieving its development objectives," he said. "We are calling for loss and damage to be acknowledged and for money to be put in." Other activists have also called for developed countries, which are responsible for the majority of carbon emissions, to compensate developing countries for the loss and damage caused to them by climate change. COP27 opened, to put the "loss and damage" issue on the agenda. Heated debate and discussions are expected on the topic during the two-week conference. Mwenda said the continent is in need of more climate finance, noting that implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions to tackle climate change in African countries is conditional on receiving financial support from industrialized countries. He also said genuine conversations were needed on what constitutes climate finance and whether it should be considered private or public money. He added that climate financing should be additional to official development assistance from industrialized countries. Mwenda added there is enough money to address climate change to build the resilience of people on the front line. However, the problem has been a lack of political commitment, which is being demanded at COP27 . HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202211/08/6369a9c2a310407c07e70d25.png Link to Image Civil society has put in place platforms for climate governance to hold African governments at both national and subnational levels accountable on how climate financing is spent. Unlike mitigation of climate problems, Mwenda said adaptation is not popular with donors because it does not show a return on investment. In a statement released by the African Development Bank in October, experts called for strengthening collaboration on climate adaptation across the continent. Anthony Nyong, senior director and Africa regional director at the Global Center on Adaptation, estimated climate change would cost $579 billion by 2030, with global finance skewed toward mitigation. He said only 7.2 percent of global finance goes to climate adaptation. Al-Hamndou Dorsouma, acting director of Climate Change and Green Growth Department at the ADB, underscored the urgent need for accelerated action on adaptation coupled with rapid and deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid a mounting loss of life, biodiversity and infrastructure. Tanguy Gahouma-Bekale, special adviser to the president of Gabon and permanent secretary of the National Climate Council, endorsed the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program as a primary vehicle for implementing the Africa Adaptation Initiative's mandate. The program seeks to mobilize $25 billion to accelerate action on climate change adaptation across Africa.

China has called on parties to focus on the implementation of goals that have already been set ahead of the COP 27 United Nations climate change conference , instead of merely paying lip service to raise ambitions. Li Gao, director of tackling climate change at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the remark at a news conference on Thursday in the lead-up to the UN gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from Nov 6 to 18, the slogan of which is "Together for Implementation". Li called on parties to fully and faithfully implement the principles and targets in the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its 2015 Paris Agreement to jointly build a global climate governance system that is fair, rational, cooperative and beneficial to all. While the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is inscribed into both the convention and the agreement, the 2015 treaty aims to keep the global temperature increase this century below 2 C from preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 C. Currently, most countries have announced their targets for post-2020 climate actions under the Paris Agreement, he said. It's important to come up with these targets, but what is even more important is to take concrete actions to bring the targets into reality. "This is the fundamental solution to effectively cope with global climate change," he said. COP 27 should call on parties to transform their targets into effective policies, solid actions and concrete projects, instead of raising new targets when no adequate effort has been made to implement their previous ones, he stressed. "We believe shouting empty slogans doesn't mean ambition, and what can demonstrate ambition is to implement the targets," he stressed. Li also called on COP 27 to address the key concerns of developing nations about climate adaptation and financial support. "The conference is to be held in a developing nation. It should practically respond to concerns of developing states," he stressed. Climate adaptation is a key concern of developing nations, the official said. The issue, however, hasn't been given adequate importance in the global multilateral climate process. Li called for concrete progress in COP 27 to lay a solid basis for reaching an ambitious and implementable global target for climate adaptation in COP 28 next year. "Developed countries should beef up financial support for climate adaptation actions in developing nations and come up with a road map to double the adaptation fund," he said. In 2009, developed countries pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 to support climate action in developing countries. The promise, however, has yet to materialize, Li said. This has not only adversely affected and hindered developing nations to carry out climate actions, but also severely undermined the political trust between developed and developing nations, he said. "We urge developed countries to materialize the $100 billion support per year, other than to submit a report at COP 27 that seeks reasons and excuses for the long-overdue financial support," he said. He said developed nations should, with the $100 billion support per year as a starting point, hammer out a more ambitious road map for 2021-25 climate fund support and an updated post-2025 target to enhance the trust between developed and developing countries, and the global synergy in climate actions.

CAIRO, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt launched Tuesday a public bicycle sharing project to promote eco-friendly means of transport in downtown Cairo, the capital of Egypt, the Cairo Governorate announced in a statement. The Cairo Bike project comes a few months ahead of Egypt's hosting of the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, scheduled for November this year. The current trial phase of the project starts with five docking stations in downtown Cairo. Following the trial operation, the project will be expanded to a fleet of 500 GPS-tracked bicycles in 45 stations across the city, said Cairo Governor Khaled Abdel-Aal. A citizen can hire a bicycle for 1 Egyptian pound (0.053 U.S. dollars) per hour through a mobile application or a prepaid card. The project is "the first of its kind in Egypt" as previous ones were limited to closed urban communities or narrow areas, said the governor, adding that the project will help reduce traffic congestion in downtown Cairo. The project is launched by Cairo Governorate, in cooperation with the United Nations Human Settlements Program (UN-Habitat), funded by Switzerland's Drosos Foundation and technically supported and supervised by the New York-based Institute for Transportation and Development Policy.

During the meeting, China's Special Envoy on Climate Change Xie Zhenhua and envoys of seven PICs - Tonga, Fiji, Micronesia, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu - exchanged views on various topics, including climate change policy actions, outcome expectations and South-South cooperation on climate change for the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ). COP27 will take place from November 7 to 18 in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt this year. They said they are willing to further strengthen dialogue coordination on climate change with China and together make more contributions to promoting the multilateral climate process. China is willing to work with PICs to make COP27 a conference themed on implementation and action, and achieve positive results on issues that are of the greatest concern to developing countries such as fundraising, Chinese representatives said during the meeting. China plans to provide further support to Pacific island countries in tackling climate change, such as jointly establishing low-carbon demonstration zones, implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and conducting training. Another training course for climate change officials and technicians from Pacific island countries in the near future is scheduled, according to a statement released by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. China also invited ministers of Pacific island countries to attend a high-level forum on South-South cooperation on climate change during COP27 . Sun Shao, a senior research fellow from the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday that over the past half century or so, exchanges and cooperation between China and PICs have been expanding, covering trade and investment, marine environment, disaster prevention and reduction, poverty alleviation, and medical and health care fields. PICs are now one of the regions in the world most affected by climate change. Holding dialogue with PICs on climate change and sharing best practices of how China copes with climate change will help deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership and build an even closer community of shared future between China and PICs through South-South cooperation, Sun noted. China attaches great importance to tackling climate change. Through a series of policies and measures, such as adjusting industrial structure, improving energy efficiency, optimizing the energy structure and developing renewable energy, China has reached its 2020 carbon emission target ahead of schedule. The Chinese government will strive to reach the carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, which fully demonstrates its responsibility as a major responsible country, Chinese representatives told the meeting. Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment also attended the meeting in Beijing. \</doc>

African young activists are adding their voices to the climate question, saying that world leaders must make sure that the voices of the African people are reflected in the outcome of negotiations at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 , in Egypt. Most of the young climate activists on the continent are of the opinion that this year's climate summit should not be about promises, but action especially for the pledges that have been made and not delivered, such as delivering climate finance to vulnerable communities. Elizabeth Wathuti, an activist from Kenya, delivered an open letter to COP27 president Sameh Shoukry on Nov 10, calling for loss and damage finance to urgently flow to communities living on the front lines of the climate crisis. She said over 130,000 people globally signed the petition, which calls for loss and damage finance to be the priority and the defining factor of whether or not COP27 succeeds. "People who have contributed least to the climate crisis are right now suffering its worst impacts, and decency demands that finance be mobilized urgently through a loss and damage facility to help them," Wathuti said in her letter. Suffering witnessed Wathuti said she has witnessed the suffering that interconnected climate, nature and food crises are bringing right now across the African continent. "Most of the people I meet in drought-stricken areas do not know that decisions made in faraway places might have something to do with the situation they are facing. What would they do if they knew that the actions of other rich, high-emitting nations in the Global North had something to do with their predicament?" Wathuti said. In a similar move, a group of youth from South Africa released a statement at COP27 , calling for climate justice and equity to underpin all actions toward addressing the climate crisis, catered toward the issues faced by the Global South. During a youth roundtable meeting with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres held on Nov 9 at the COP27 summit, African youth called on world leaders to use COP27 as the last opportunity to work harder toward their climate goals and take youth voices into consideration because they are the future and they have a lot of potential and great ideas to contribute.

by Mahmoud Fouly ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- On the beaches in the Egyptian city of Alexandria, a group of Egyptian young people are usually seen holding green and white plastic bags to collect the scattering waste. They are participants in a cleanup campaign organized by Banlastic Egypt, an environmental project launched by a group of youth in the Mediterranean city. The project seeks to raise the public's awareness of plastic pollution and how single-use plastic waste harms marine life if it eventually ends up in seas and oceans. Manar Ramadan, a co-founder of the project, told Xinhua that the waste they collected was divided into four categories: recyclable PET plastic bottles and cups, non-recyclable waste, cigarette ends, and bottle caps. The PET plastic waste will be sent to a recycling company, the cigarette ends are sent to another company that treats and uses them as filling material for making bean bags, while the bottle caps are sent to a charitable project that sells them and uses the money to buy chairs for people with special needs, Ramadan explained. Later, the young people were joined by some children whose parents like the idea. Mostafa Rabie, from Upper Egypt's Minya province, was happy to see his four children joining the campaign to clean up the beach. "My children love cleanliness as their mother brought them up this way. It's a beautiful idea. It makes the beach look great," Rabie said. The Egyptian Ministry of Environment is considered as "a basic partner" with Banlastic Egypt, said Ahmed Yassin, a solar engineer and another co-founder of the initiative. "The ministry provides us with technical and logistic support," Yassin said, noting that Alexandria is one of the biggest and most populous cities of Egypt, where single-use plastic is widely used and people need to learn more about its ecological problems. "Plastic waste on beaches eventually ends up in the sea and then the oceans, forming large floating piles, known as gyres, that harm marine life," Yassin told Xinhua. About 5.25 trillion plastic particles weighing about 269,000 tons are floating in the world's oceans, according to a study in the open-access journal PLOS ONE. Egyptian environmental experts said that such campaigns are very important to help the government with raising eco-awareness among the citizens, especially since Egypt has recently launched its "Go Green" campaign ahead of hosting the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in November. "Plastic debris in seas and oceans takes too long to dissolve and affects biodiversity, for it can lead to the death of marine organisms," said Adel Soliman, an environmental expert with the Egyptian Ministry of Environment. Soliman emphasized that such cleanup campaigns send a message to the world ahead of COP27 that Egypt has raised the eco-awareness among its citizens, including the youth and children. "We want to tell the world that our youth launch campaigns that help limit the impacts of climate change. This is surely a very important message," said the Egyptian ecologist. Enditem \</doc>

By KARL WILSON in Sydney | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-28 09:29 Pacific Island nations may not have got everything they hoped for at COP27 , the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt, but they, along with other poorer countries, did manage to get rich nations to agree to establish a loss and damage fund. This is an achievement that Tuvalu's finance minister, Seve Paeniu, said is a historic breakthrough after almost 30 years of climate talks. Speaking on Radio New Zealand on Tuesday, Paeniu said: "This is something we have been seeking for years. This is a major breakthrough and a victory for the Pacific island countries." Although details have yet to be worked out, the fund could result in the richest - and worst- carbon-polluting countries contributing to the cost of climate loss and damage that developing nations have incurred. COP27 was a "missed opportunity". "It is regrettable that we haven't achieved equal success in our attempt to achieve the 1.5 C targets," he told Radio New Zealand. "It is regrettable that we haven't got strong language included in the cover decision before us on phasing out fossil fuels." He was referring to a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels. The Marshall Islands' climate envoy, Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, said world leaders need to take more responsibility and phase out fossil fuels immediately. Facing threat She told the COP27 Jacqueline Peel, director of Melbourne Climate Futures, a climate initiative of the University of Melbourne, said: " COP27 has shown that the fossil fuel industry and their country backers still wield considerable power. "Their outsized presence in Egypt at this year's meeting has left a large black footprint on the cover text. "The commitment to 1.5 C is anemic, the mitigation work program watered down, carbon markets left with some dark corners for shady deals, low emissions recognized alongside renewable energy as energy sources of the future, and the failure to tighten Glasgow (COP26) language on coal phase down to include other fossil fuels." One of the few bright spots, she said, was the agreement on "new funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change". Peter Newman, professor of sustainability at Curtin University in Western Australia, said one of the things he noticed at the COP27 meeting was a "divergence of action deepening between states and non-state actors". Nation states are being barricaded into zero action by some states that are essentially fronts for large fossil fuel companies, he said. \</doc>

Illustration:Liu Xidan The better part of November saw the world's attention focussed on Sharm El-Sheikh, where the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference was held.\~ More commonly referred to as the COP27 , the meeting came at a time when the world is confronting the unprecedented impact of climate change, which has caused the spread of, as well as an increased magnitude and frequency of droughts, floods, and other disasters.\~ Against this background, the Global South become sick and tired of the usual lengthy discussions with its stalling, delaying tactics and procrastination that have hampered implementation and delivery at such Summits. These countries have made it clear from the onset that the world can no longer afford to spend more time ducking around the real issues. The discontent, irritation and resentment directed at the developed world by the Global South during the conference was welcomed and justified. To date, the pledge made in 2009 during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Denmark, committing $100 billion annually, remains unsubstantiated.\~\~ It is a development that has aroused angry discourse with questions emerging on why developed countries continue to power industrialization using dirty energy instead of decarbonising their production and making use of clean energy to manufacture for the world. In the early days of COP26, the Scottish Government committed \£32 million for Loss and Damage. This escalated the focus on finance for Loss and Damage, exerting more pressure on other developed countries to follow Scotland's footsteps.\~ Subsequently, developing countries collectively called for the establishment of the the Glasgow Facility for Financing Loss and Damage to mobilize and channel finance to vulnerable developing countries to support their efforts to address loss and damage.\~ Ultimately, pushback from developed countries has proved too strong to overcome, and the Facility was not established. Instead, as a shaky compromise, the Glasgow Dialogue was established as a platform for discussing the arrangements for funding to avert, minimise and address loss and damages.\~ It is worth mentioning that Loss and Damage is not an abstract subject of endless dialogue; it is our daily experience and the living nightmare of millions of people especially in developing countries. Due to the scale of disruption, it was inevitable that Loss and Damage would take the centre-stage in Egypt.\~ Speaker after speaker from the South took issue with it, and sought that it be addressed with a level of seriousness which demonstrates fairness, urgency and consideration. At one point, the West was reminded, not once, not twice, but multiple times, that Africa contributes only less than 3 percent of the pollution responsible for climate change. But it is most severely impacted by the ensuing crisis. It was, therefore, only fair and proper that COP27 takes requisite measures to recognise Africa's special needs and circumstances under the Paris Agreement, in line with the convention and relevant decisions adopted by previous COPs. In the face of impending catastrophe - whose warning signs are already unbearably disastrous - the Global North was told that weak action will be unwise and that no action will be dangerous; Rather, our discourse must focus on delivery, and our conversation must be centred on our commitments and implementation. It was maintained that developed nations must rise to the challenge of the moment and make difficult but necessary decisions and seize transformative opportunities from the grasp of climate disaster. This, the Global South explained, meant honoring spending commitments for mitigation and adaptation, and mobilizing increased financial flows to those affected. The overwhelming pressure exerted on developed countries appeared to bear fruit. After almost two weeks' long conference, the Parties at COP27 made a historic decision - after nearly three decades of deliberate delay and inaction - and agreed to establish and operationalize a Loss and Damage fund, particularly for nations most vulnerable to the adverse effects of the climate crisis.\~\~ The fund is expected to see these countries supported for losses arising from droughts, floods, rising seas and other disasters that are attributed to climate change. But it is not clear who should pay into the fund, where this money will come from and which countries will benefit.\~ Be it as it may, the development brings to an end the thorny issue that has been one of the most contentious on the negotiating table. It has also brought to the fore the question: Is Africa, Asia and South America finally exerting its influence in the governance of the world? How will the Global South shape the globe in the future? This, clearly, looks to be the case as the South-South cooperation flourishes in various areas such as trade, regional security, infrastructure development, economy, among others. Indeed, this is the era of the South. The author is a researcher and expert on China-Africa cooperation based in Nairobi, Kenya. Follow him on Twitter @kapchanga.

NAIROBI, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- Unlocking financing to help African countries deal with the climate crisis will be a key agenda at the upcoming 27th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) summit to be held in Egypt from Nov. 6 to 18, officials said Thursday. Speaking during the virtual launch of the State and Trends in Adaptation in Africa 2022 report, the officials stated that by hosting the global climate summit, the continent will be well-positioned to lobby for financial and technical support required to hasten its green transition. Akinwumi Adesina, the president of the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), said that COP 27 presents an opportunity to bridge the funding gap that has derailed Africa's transition to a green and resilient future. Despite bearing the brunt of climate emergencies, Africa receives annual climate financing of partly 18 billion U.S. dollars, yet the continent requires 128 billion dollars annually to deal with devastations linked to planetary warming, said Adesina. Adesina revealed that Africa requires 41 billion dollars annually to support climate adaptation in key sectors of the economy including agriculture, energy, water, health, and forestry. He emphasized that to bridge the 110 billion dollar climate financing gap, African countries should push for additional funds from multilateral lenders and wealthy bilateral partners during COP27 . "Part of this financing should support the establishment of climate resilient infrastructure and food systems that can withstand shocks like severe droughts and floods," said Adesina. The 2022 State and Trends in Adaptation report for Africa notes that despite its minimal contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, Africa is reeling from a host of climate emergencies, posing existential threats to ecosystems and livelihoods. The fragility of food systems, water resources, human health, and economies has worsened against a backdrop of extreme weather events like droughts, forest fires, heatwaves, and cyclones sweeping over vast parts of Africa, said the report. "The magnitude of many of these climate shocks can overwhelm communities, entire regions, or even small nations," said the report compiled by the Global Center on Adaptation, an international green lobby. Josefa Leonel Correia Sacko, the Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture at the African Union Commission (AUC) said COP 27 will offer a platform for exploring innovative financing tools that could boost climate response in the continent. Sacko emphasized that domestic resource mobilization when combined with friendly regulations to attract investments in green technologies has the potential to accelerate low-carbon and resilient growth in Africa.

By WANG XIAODONG in Nairobi, Kenya | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-21 10:19 Climate financing pledged for developing countries should be fulfilled and must be expanded to match the evolving needs of developing countries to fight climate change, a leading expert said at the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 . COP27 , told China Daily in an exclusive interview. At COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009, developed countries promised to provide $100 billion every year as a goal to achieve by 2020 to help developing countries fight climate change, but so far the minimum level has not been met, Mohieldin said. "It shouldn't have been that hard to fulfill the promise of mobilizing $100 billion, which constitutes only 0.12 percent of the global GDP," he said. Climate financing was a major topic during the two-week COP27 , which closed in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Sunday, with many developing countries calling for rich countries, which have contributed to the bulk share of greenhouse gas emissions over the past centuries, to fulfill their duties. A breakthrough agreement was reached at the last moment of the conference on Sunday to provide "loss and damage" funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate change. In terms of financing developing countries to cope with climate change, developed countries need to increase investment rather than debt to developing countries, Mohieldin said, adding that 60 percent of low-income countries are now at high risk of, or already in, debt distress, citing figures from the International Monetary Fund. "We need to see more investments and concessional financing, as well as innovation in financial instruments, blending of climate finance and the establishment of international carbon markets," he said. In addition, more climate change investments are needed from the private sector, Mohieldin said. "Today the private sector's share of the total financing of climate adaptation efforts on the African continent is not more than 3 percent ($11.4 billion). To encourage a bigger role for the private sector, governments should lead, until the business case for adaptation is well established," he said. Providing opportunities Tackling climate change also provides business opportunities to the commercial sector, including Chinese companies, Mohieldin said. The Africa Carbon Markets Initiative, which was inaugurated at COP27 to support the growth of carbon credit production and create jobs in Africa, is one such example. Carbon markets can offer many opportunities to unlock billions for the climate finance needs of African economies, while expanding energy access, protecting biodiversity and driving climate action, he said. "We have already seen huge signals of progress on the green transition from China and Chinese enterprises," said Mohieldin, citing China's share of global passenger electric vehicle sales increasing from 26 percent in 2015 to 56 percent in the first half of this year. "In forging the path to zero emissions, China's private sector and local governments will give the national government the confidence to create an even more enabling policy environment, in which businesses can further innovate and scale up transformative solutions."

COPENHAGEN, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- Hans Kluge, regional director for Europe at the World Health Organization (WHO), called the current response to climate change "dangerously inconsistent and far too slow" in a statement on Monday. "Climate change and the crises it has triggered have long been clear health emergencies. WHO and (its) partners have long sounded the alarm," Kluge said, urging participants of the current United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt to act faster and more coherently. To avoid increasing exposure and vulnerability to heatwaves and other extreme weather events, Kluge called for drastic adaptation and mitigation measures that could tackle climate change and improve individual, societal and planetary health. According to Kluge, the devastating wildfires that hit Europe last summer had caused the highest carbon emissions since 2007, "polluting our air, killing many people." He warned that extreme temperatures caused heat stress, which had become the leading weather-related cause of death in Europe. Based on country data, the WHO puts the number of heat-related deaths to 15,000 in 2022, Kluge said. Last year, high-impact weather and climate events like floods and storms directly affected over half a million people, he said. Kluge cited a report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), saying that Europe was the fastest-warming region in the world, where extreme temperatures had accounted for over 148, 000 lives lost in the last 50 years. According to Kluge, his organization intends to "use the collective power of WHO member states to (...) integrate health into any climate change plan". "We need to do it now if we are to prevent the climate crisis from turning into an irreversible climate disaster for our region and our entire planet," he said. Enditem \</doc>

Experts, leaders and social groups at the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 , have called for action on water adaptation and resilience in the fight against climate change. Hani Sewilam, Egypt's minister of water resources and irrigation, said the global water crisis is currently affecting billions of people worldwide and is projected to be further aggravated by increasing demand, changing water availability and increasing impacts of floods and droughts. He said Africa is harshly affected by rising temperatures, noting that more than half of the continent is under severe drought even as it experiences sea level rise at more than 3 millimeters per year. As part of the solution, the COP27 presidency in partnership with the World Meteorological Organization launched the Action for Water Adaptation and Resilience Initiative to address water-related challenges and solutions across climate change adaptation. The initiative is expected to push for water and adaptation investments for the most vulnerable communities and ecosystems in Africa. In close cooperation with the African Union and African Ministers' Council on Water among other stakeholders, the initiative aims at offering transitional adaptation solutions for the planet and its people. It will focus on decreasing water losses worldwide and improving water supply. It will also propose and support implementing mutually agreed policy and methods for cooperative water-related adaptation action and its co-benefits. The initiative will also promote cooperation and interlinkages between water and climate action in order to achieve Agenda 2030, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 6 that focuses on clean water and sanitation for all. Sewilam said the initiative will catalyze inclusive cooperation to address water as a key to climate change adaptation and its co-benefits, as well as enhanced resilience. "I urge the agencies, international organizations and friends and countries to express interest in joining the initiative and specify projects and actions to be implemented on the ground," he said. Sameh Shoukry, president of COP27 , said the initiative will bring together stakeholders to alleviate the challenges faced by the world's vulnerable communities and ecosystems. Elena Manaenkova, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, said 74 percent of all natural disasters are water-related and Africa is particularly vulnerable with the main killers being floods and droughts. According to a paper launched by the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions at the climate conference on Monday, floods killed over 435 people in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal Province in April and caused more than $1.57 billion in infrastructure damage. In Nigeria, October floods killed 600 people, displaced more than 1.4 million people and affected over 2.5 million. Additionally, cholera is on the rise in the country due to flooding.

CAIRO, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Hani Suweilam said on Sunday that Egypt is one of the world's most affected countries by climate change, Ahram Online news website reported. The Egyptian minister made the remarks during the opening session of an environmental and development forum on Egypt's preparations to host the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) that will be held in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh in November. Egypt is suffering water scarcity, high temperature, erosion and saltwater intrusion into fresh water, the minister was quoted as saying. The increases in population, unstable water shares (from rivers such as the Nile) and climate impacts have led to a shortage of water used for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes in several countries, he added. The minister also urged all countries to strengthen cooperation on dealing with extreme climate, stressing the need to place the water sector, food and agriculture on the global climate agenda. Egypt is making great efforts in improving water management, which includes rehabilitating canals to better deliver water to farmers, Suweilam said, adding water is a key element in agriculture and food security. The minister underlined the necessity of expanding water desalination projects, studying less costly and more efficient ways of reusing wastewater. Enditem \</doc>

CANBERRA, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- South Australia is facing higher temperatures, less rainfall, longer droughts and more intense bushfire seasons by 2030, a government report has warned. Susan Close, Deputy Premier of South Australia (SA) and Environment Minister, on Friday released the state's Guide to Climate Projections for Risk Assessment and Planning report. It predicts more deaths from heat, lower yield in agricultural regions, an increase in coastal flooding and changes to growing seasons. Close described the report as a "sobering reading." "I think the escalating shift towards drought conditions is of greatest concern," she told reporters from the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in Egypt. "It's much harder to farm consistently if you've got more hot days and less rainfall and there is an increased risk of catastrophic events such as fires," she added. According to the report, under a medium emissions model median temperatures in Adelaide will increase by 1.1 degrees Celsius by 2030 and 1.6 degrees by 2050. It means in the state's capital there will be another 5.6 days with a maximum temperature exceeding 35 degrees Celsius by 2030. In the opal mining town of Coober Pedy in the SA Outback, there will be an extra 18.4 days above 35 degrees centigrade every year by 2030. By 2050 it forecasts a 40 percent increase in the number of days above 35 degrees. Close said the report justified the SA government's move to declare a climate emergency in June. "We have to both mitigate and adapt, and that's challenging for the world," she said. "The upside of course, for South Australia is that we had the opportunity to capitalize economically on the world's shift to net zero because we have a good, renewable energy profile."

A China-initiated alliance of 15 leading universities launched a campaign on Monday in search of a systematic, global solution to the looming consequences of devastating climate change. Dubbed "Climate X", the agenda of the campaign launched by the Global Alliance of Universities on Climate features a Climate X Leadership Training Pilot, co-initiated by Sciences Po in Paris and Tsinghua University in Beijing. A regional event titled the African Regional Forum on Climate Change will be organized by South Africa's Stellenbosch University, the alliance's only African member, according to a media release from the alliance secretariat at Tsinghua. Three additional international events are planned this year, namely the Global Youth Climate Week, the GAUC Climate X Summit, and the GAUC COP27 event at the 27th United Nations climate change conference , widely known as COP 27 , which is slated to be held in Egypt in November. Proposed by Tsinghua in 2019 during the World Economic Forum in Davos, the GAUC aims to create collective global leadership for efforts by higher education toward addressing climate change. It currently consists of 15 of the world's leading universities. "This is a time of enormous challenge. Our health and well-being, peace and prosperity and nature itself are under threat," Amina J.Mohammed, UN deputy secretary-general, said via video link during the launch ceremony in Beijing. Mohammed underscored the urgent need for ambitious action to protect people and the planet, citing extreme droughts and the resulting food crisis in the Horn of Africa, the heat waves across Europe and the recent flooding in Asia, as examples. The most pressing problems confronting countries are ultimately global in nature and they demand global solutions, she stressed, adding that "the focus of the Climate X campaign is an excellent example of this". Climate change's negative impact on the environment has spread to the economy and society, strengthening public awareness of the vulnerability of the world and highlighting the need for urgent collective action, he said. "Being here with you today, I see the power of youth driving us toward the optimistic prospect of a sustainable, net-zero future," he said. Climate change is not only relevant to people's lives today, but also to future generations, he said, and it is closely intertwined with the wellbeing of humans and other species. To overcome a challenge of such complexity, Wang stressed the need for cross-disciplinary thinking to be able to understand the synergy among climate change and social and economic sectors, and then leverage that synergy toward effective and innovative solutions. "Working closely hand-in-hand, I look forward to more emerging opportunities for greater achievements," he said. According to the GAUC secretariat, the alliance has proposed the launch of the Global Youth Climate Week to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Scheduled ahead of each UN Climate Change Conference, it is envisaged as a way of helping the young around the world formulate concrete steps toward global climate governance by coordinating global action.

By OTIATO OPALI in Nairobi, Kenya | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2022-11-18 07:48 West's focus on continent's fossil fuels threatens climate goals, experts say Energy-hungry Western nations eyeing gas reserves in Africa have come in for stepped-up criticism during climate talks in Egypt. Faced with energy shortages resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, many countries in the West have been turning to Africa in the hope of making up the shortfalls. But environmental campaigners have sounded the alarm, with their concerns heightened by a track record of these countries' exploitative practices in Africa and other parts of the world. The concerns have been aired during the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 During Energy Day at the conference this week, activists pointed out that Africa has 39 percent of the world's clean energy potential and does not need gas speculators. The troubling potential expansion of oil, gas and coal projects despite their impact on global warming was at the center of the discussions, with many experts fearing that the goal of curbing global warming to 1.5 C could be in danger. Joab Okanda, an adviser with the nongovernmental organization Christian Aid, in Kenya, said that no place has suffered more than Africa from the impact of burning fossil fuels. As such, the continent is perfectly placed to show the world a different path to develop, freed from the shackles of a dirty energy system that has wrecked the climate. "Fossil fuel companies are showing their greed and plan to exploit fossil fuels in 48 out of 55 African countries," Okanda said. 'Galling' fact "What is so galling is that 89 percent of the liquefied natural gas infrastructure being built in Africa is to be exported to Europe to bail them out of their addiction to Russian gas. We cannot be Europe's gas station. Otherwise, we will crash the climate." The remarks come after a report titled "Who is Financing Fossil Fuel Expansion in Africa?" revealed that the United States is leading both financially and institutionally in funding fossil fuel exploration on the continent. The report released by the Africa Climate Reality Project, a nongovernmental organization based in South Africa, and its partners this month observed that Western fossil fuel industries have brought nothing but conflicts and ecological and economic destabilization to the continent. According to the report's findings, the two largest institutional investors in fossil fuel expansion in Africa are US-based companies with holdings of over $20 billion. "Between January 2019 and July 2022, banks headquartered in the US accounted for over 20 percent of commercial bank support for fossil fuel expansion in Africa," the report states. "Next in line are French, UK and Japanese banks. Collectively, banks from these four countries accounted for 56 percent of global bank finance for fossil fuel developers in Africa." According to activists, researchers and advocacy groups at the COP27 summit, exporting natural gas may bring short-term profits but exacerbate the climate crisis and leave African nations worse off in the long run. Thuli Makama, African program director at Oil Change International, a nonprofit organization in the US, said that history has proved time and again that fossil fuel extraction in African countries has not resulted in development. However, Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change executive secretary, noted some positive developments on the continent, pointing out that South Africa has launched a multimillion-dollar plan to shift from coal toward green energy. "This is a key moment in the global push for the transition away from fossil fuels," he said. "So, we are making headway at COP27 , but moving further and faster also means action beyond COP to drive down emissions." \</doc>

by Martina Fuchs GENEVA, Oct. 13 (Xinhua) -- Wildlife populations in tropical regions are plummeting at a staggering rate and freshwater species populations have globally been reduced by 83 percent, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said on Thursday. There is no time to lose in securing a nature-positive society, it warned in the 14th edition of its biennial Living Planet Report 2022. Across the globe, monitored wildlife populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish have seen a devastating 69 percent decline on average since 1970. In a video interview with Xinhua, WWF International's Director General Marco Lambertini said that "The figures are shocking and confirm the fact that our way of living, consuming and producing is just simply not sustainable. The impact on the natural world is immense." "We need to restore what's possible and we need to sustainably manage the rest. That means we need to transition the 'Big Five' economic drivers of nature loss: agriculture, fishing, infrastructure, extractives and forestry from nature-negative to nature-positive practices," Lambertini said. The dataset in the report features almost 32,000 populations of 5,230 species. The Living Planet Index (LPI) within the report, provided by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), shows that between 1970 and 2018, monitored wildlife populations in Latin America and the Caribbean region declined by 94 percent on average. It also revealed that in less than a lifetime, monitored freshwater populations have fallen by an average of 83 percent, the largest decline of any species group. Habitat loss and barriers to migration routes are responsible for about half of the threats to monitored migratory fish species. ONLY ONE CHANCE The report was released on the eve of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), to be held in Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh between Nov. 6 and Nov. 18. "At COP27 , our main focus is going to be supporting and pushing for more nature-based solutions to climate to be embraced by the governments and more climate finance to go towards supporting nature-based solutions," Lambertini said. "In fact, nature is indispensable to achieving a net-zero result by 2050 because emissions reduction alone is not going to be enough." COP27 will be followed by the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) in Montreal, Canada, between Dec. 7 and Dec. 19 with China in the chair. The WWF said it will be a once-in-a-decade opportunity to course-correct for the sake of people and the planet. The organization is advocating for leaders to commit to a "Paris-style'" agreement capable of reversing biodiversity loss to secure a nature-positive world by 2030, Lambertini noted. "We really hope that a global goal could be adopted so that we will have carbon neutrality on the one hand and secure a nature-positive world on the other," Lambertini said. The authors of the report also called on policymakers to transform economies so that natural resources are properly valued. "We need to invest more directly in supporting the global south and in protecting more of the nature they still have," Lambertini said. "A mobilization of resources led by the north through different mechanisms from the private sector and multilateral banks is necessary to support more action in the global south for nature conservation and sustainable management."

CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- China is one of the most prominent contributors to Africa's sustainable development and a major supporter of developing countries, an Egyptian official said in a recent interview. Mohamed Ibrahim Nasr, director of Climate, Environment and Sustainable Development Department at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, said China was "one of the largest development partners for Africa." "Through its huge financial and technical assistance and its participation in the construction of infrastructure projects such as ports, airports, railways, roads, bridges, energy projects and others, China has a strong presence in African countries," Nasr told Xinhua on the sidelines of the third Aswan Forum for Sustainable Peace and Development. The two-day forum, which ended in Cairo on Wednesday, was held under the theme of "Africa in an Era of Cascading Risks and Climate Vulnerability: Pathways for a Peaceful, Resilient and Sustainable Continent." Nasr, also a chief negotiator for the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), which is scheduled to be held later this year in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, also praised China's role in helping Africa to combat climate change. China frequently help developing countries, particularly those in Africa, to build eco-friendly projects, he said, adding climate change continues to be an important factor impacting the sustainable development in the African continent.

Despite projected emissions declines from China and the European Union, the world's overall carbon emissions this year remain at record levels, with no sign of the decrease urgently needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 C, according to a recent study. The world's total global carbon dioxide emissions in 2022 are projected to be 40.6 billion metric tons, said the Global Carbon Budget report, which was produced by an international team of over 100 scientists. They are fueled by fossil-fuel generated CO2 emissions that are projected to rise 1 percent compared with 2021 to 36.6 billion tons, slightly above the 2019 pre-COVID 19 levels, noted the report as climate diplomats recently met at the COP27 United Nations climate change conference in Egypt. If current emissions levels persist, there is now a 50 percent chance that global warming of 1.5 C will be exceeded in nine years, it says. The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change aims to keep the global temperature rise this century below 2 C from preindustrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase even further to 1.5 C. The 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body that assesses the science behind climate change, highlighted a series of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5 C. By the end of this century, for example, the rise in global sea levels would be 10 centimeters lower with a temperature increase of 1.5 C compared with 2 C. "This year we see yet another rise in global fossil CO2 emissions, when we need a rapid decline," said Pierre Friedlingstein of the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute, who led the study. There are some positive signs, but leaders meeting at COP27 will have to take meaningful action if the world is to have any chance of limiting global warming close to 1.5 C. "The Global Carbon Budget numbers monitor the progress on climate action and right now we are not seeing the action required," he said. This year's carbon budget shows that the long-term rate of increasing CO2 emissions has slowed. The average rise peaked at 3 percent per year during the 2000s, while growth in the last decade has been about 0.5 percent annually. The 2022 picture among major emitters is mixed. Emissions are projected to fall by 0.9 percent in China and 0.8 percent in the EU, according to the report. An increase of 6 percent is expected for India, 1.5 percent for the United States and 1.7 percent for the rest of the world combined. Corinne Le Quere, a professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, said the team's findings reveal turbulence in emissions patterns this year resulting from the pandemic and global energy crises. If governments respond by turbo-charging clean energy investments, and plant  not cut down  trees, global emissions could rapidly start to fall, Le Quere said. "We are at a turning point and must not allow world events to distract us from the urgent and sustained need to cut our emissions to stabilize the global climate and reduce cascading risks," she said. \</doc>

The 2022 United Nations climate change conference , or COP 27 , should address funding for climate adaptation and mitigation for developing countries, while spelling out implementation plans and prioritizing African interests, said South African researchers. Romy Chevallier, a researcher from think tank South African Institute of International Affairs, said the "African COP" should be the "implementation COP" with a clear road map on how to fund various climate policies and projects. COP 27 will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from Nov 6 to 18. Although it emits less than 5 percent of greenhouse gases globally, Africa has been the most seriously impacted by climate change. The unprecedented drought in the Horn of Africa over the past four decades has once again highlighted the climate plight Africa faces. Chevallier stated there is a strong expectation from African countries that the COP 27 presidency, Egypt, will represent developing countries' and particularly African interests very well. The COP president has an influence on the agenda and guidance on discussion, she said. A key issue to be discussed during COP 27 would be honoring the pledge made by developed countries during previous UN climate change conferences to contribute $100 billion to developing countries annually to support climate adaptation and resilience. COP 27 , Chevallier said. "There is a clear and obvious expectation that COP 27 will deliver the outcomes related to climate financing that is balanced. There is a call from Africa for it to be balanced between mitigation and adaptation projects. Africa has been calling on the international community to put more emphasis on money for adaptation, resilience building and delivery of promises made. They want more clarity on the road map of financial delivery going forward," said Chevallier. Meanwhile, many African countries will be looking forward to some robust discussion and clarity on how the global community will support the implementation of the just transition from coal to clean energy. Chevallier pointed out that Africa calls for specific financial facilities for adaptation, loss or damage as a result of climate change and would be hoping to get the concessions at COP 27 . The South African government has said it wants to see a just transition to clean energy where those who are employed in the so-called unclean energy sector and those in the value chain are trained to make a living. Chevallier said geopolitical issues would surface at COP 27 with many countries looking to be energy independent following the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Johannesburg-based African Union Development Agency's head of environment and climate change, Kwame Ababio, said COP 27 must come up with a "concrete agreement" on adaptation and mitigation, which is one of the most important climate change goals. Ababio said COP 27 Ababio said many African ministers have been meeting and agreed to contribute 2.9 percent of their GDP to tackle climate change. Many African countries use coal mostly to drive their economies. COP 26, held last year in Glasgow, the United Kingdom, resolved that countries should make a transition from reliance on coal to clean energy at their own pace depending on their national interests and priorities. He said African countries cannot be "rushed" to dump coal "immediately". He said Africans want to be helped for loss or damage to their livelihoods, restoration of the land and for economic loss. Ababio said Africa is committed to a "just and equitable transition" that won't affect the majority of people. Ababio said African innovators will showcase their ideas to tackle climate change during COP 27 . He emphasized that Africa needs financial and technical support to move away from a reliance on coal to clean energy. \~ The author is a freelance journalist for China Daily. \</doc>

African leaders have called on developed countries to help more in the fight against climate change, noting that Africa suffers some of the worst effects even though it is responsible for just 3.8 percent of global emissions. The leaders, speaking at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 In Sharm El-Sheikh, Kenyan President William Ruto spoke of the need for commitments on funding for mitigation and adaptation strategies to be met. "As we speak, the pledge made 13 years ago in Copenhagen, committing $100 billion annually, remains unfulfilled," said Ruto, referring to the 2008 climate conference in the Danish capital. "Such egregious and unexplained default is a major cause of persisting distrust." Ruto said the unfulfilled promises at international climate conferences, marked by stalling tactics from developed countries, are cruel and unjust. He said that COP26, held in Scotland last year, established the Glasgow Dialogue to formulate funding arrangements for measures to prevent, mitigate and remedy loss and damage associated with climate change. In Kenya, rising water levels in the Rift Valley lakes in 2020 displaced 75,987 households in 13 counties, causing a humanitarian crisis, the Kenyan leader said. "Loss and damage must therefore be addressed with a level of seriousness that demonstrates fairness, urgency and consideration," he said. Ruto called on developed economies to decarbonize their production by directing industrial investments to Africa and making use of clean energy. Despite the problems suffered by Africa, he said the continent has the potential to play an indispensable role in the planet's efforts against climate change. He said the continent's vast tracts of land, deep treasures of diverse natural resources, untapped renewable energy potential, and a young workforce are clear advantages. In a similar message to the delegates, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said developing countries have not received the required multilateral support to face the challenges, including for climate change-induced damage. "We need to acknowledge that the multilateral development banks and international financing institutions need to be reformed to meet the climate financing needs of developing economies," he said. "We need to promote the use of non-debt instruments to ensure that developing countries do not have to shoulder an even greater debt burden," he said. Ramaphosa said the fact that the global community was able to mobilize $17 trillion within two years in response to the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that the resources to meet climate commitments exist. "It is our task at this COP27 to harness the political will and mobilize the resources for the just transition," he said. Commitments urged He said African economies are losing between 3 and 5 percent of their GDP to the effects of climate change. "Our common starting point is that all parties should honor their undertakings and commitments in line with the guiding principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities," Ramaphosa said. Senegalese President Macky Sall also called for the fulfillment of climate change commitments, adding that the $100 billion pledge from Copenhagen should be doubled. He said the richest countries must pay the most to save the planet from the impacts of climate change. Sall said African delegates were attending the Sharm El-Sheikh conference in a spirit of responsible participation in the efforts to save the planet.

ENTEBBE, Uganda, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said on Monday that while the developed world must reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Africa should play its part in stopping the destruction of forests and wetlands, which has contributed to adverse climate change effects. Museveni told reporters here at State House Entebbe, 40 km south of the Ugandan capital of Kampala, that African countries need to restore the wetlands and forests that have been destroyed. The Ugandan leader has been critical of the destruction of wetlands and forests in the eastern African country to build industries and human settlements. The Ugandan government is embarking on the uphill task of evicting people and industries that have reclaimed swamps. The president, who addressed a wide range of issues, also said the developed world should help Africa with resources to restore the destroyed environment. Museveni's comment comes as world leaders and environmentalists meet at a UN conference on climate change COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, kicked off on Sunday as the world seeks possible solutions to climate change challenges.

Photo: VCG In what has been hailed as a "breakthrough" achievement, negotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed to set up a "loss and damage" fund meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters after two weeks of negotiations at COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Experts said that although the landmark agreement will serve as a powerful response to developing countries' requests, it will only come into effect as long as rich countries honor their promises, rather than making another sham promise just to quell poorer countries' criticism. China, a strong supporter of establishing a loss and damage mechanism, has been actively helping developing countries tackle climate issues via the South-South cooperation. But faced with pressure from the US and other countries for China to contribute to the loss and damage mechanism, experts said that the onus is first and foremost on rich countries, the main contributors to historical global warming, to pay for the mechanism, and that China will not be coerced or pressured on climate issues.\~ After days of intense negotiations that stretched into early Sunday morning in Sharm El-Sheikh, countries at the COP27 reached agreement on an outcome that established a funding mechanism to compensate vulnerable nations for loss and damage from climate-induced disasters.\~ The deal calls for a committee with representatives from 24 countries to work over the next year to figure out exactly what form the fund should take, which countries should contribute and where the money should go. Many details, however, remain vague, media reported. "This COP has taken an important step towards justice. I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period," UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres said in a video message issued from the conference venue in Egypt, underscoring that the voices of those on frontlines of the climate crisis must be heard. "The announcement offers hope to vulnerable communities all over the world who are fighting for their survival from climate stress," said Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's minister for climate change. The agenda item was proposed by Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 coalitions of developing nations and China during talks in Bonn, Germany, earlier this year.\~ Chinese scientists praised the deal as "historic." Under the backdrop of the ever more intense climate crisis, this agreement serves as a powerful response, and a political signal to developing nations' requests on the climate crisis, which can help alleviate the global damage from the crisis," Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser at Greenpeace China who is attending the summit, told the Global Times.\~ The creation of a loss and damage fund was almost derailed by disputes that ran into the dawn hours of Sunday over other elements of a broader agreement, including how deeply countries should cut their emissions and whether to include language that explicitly called for a phase out of fossil fuels, including coal, natural gas and oil. By 5 am in Egypt, negotiators were still debating those other measures, media reported. The US and other wealthy countries had long blocked the idea, for fear that they could be held legally liable for historical greenhouse gas emissions and the colossal payment they could face. Although agreement on the mechanism was reached, Yang Fuqiang, a research fellow at Peking University's Research Institute for Energy is pessimistic that the promise will translate into meaningful action by the rich countries. "Developed countries are constantly grilled on why they have defaulted on their previous promises of transferring $100 billion per year to vulnerable states hit by increasingly severe climate-linked impacts and asked to be responsible for their historical emissions. So maybe signing this agreement is just to quell developing countries from firing criticisms at them," Yang told the Global Times. "It is almost predictable that US and other rich countries are just making empty promises," Yang said.\~ A decade ago, the US, European Union and other wealthy emitters pledged to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020 to help poorer countries shift to clean energy and adapt to future climate risks through measures like building sea walls. They are still falling short by tens of billions of dollars annually. Yang pointed out that details of how to carry out the mechanism are not hammered down, nor is how to quantify the damage caused by climate crisis, which will make it difficult for the mechanism to work and leaves room for rich countries to maneuver.\~ "Moving forward into discussions [on] the details of the [loss and damage] fund, we need to ensure that the countries and corporations most responsible for the climate crisis make the biggest contribution. That means new and additional finance for developing countries and climate vulnerable communities not just for loss and damage, but for adaptation and mitigation too," Yeb Sa?o, Executive Director, Greenpeace Southeast Asia and Head of the Greenpeace delegation attending the COP said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Sunday. But the US and the European Union are pushing for assurances that China will eventually contribute to the fund - and that China would not be eligible to receive money from it, The New York Times reported on Sunday. When asked whether the US has informed him that China should contribute to the loss and damage fund, Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy on climate change said that China supports the loss and damage mechanism. He said the solution is simple, that is common but differentiated responsibility.\~ "China has no responsibility [on loss and damage], but China is willing to help developing countries raise their adaptability by South-South cooperation and China is already doing that," Xie said.\~ China is still a developing country and it has been offering help to developing countries via multiple international channels, said Yang. "We stick to common but differentiated responsibility, and we will never be coerced or pressured by Western countries on climate issues." A constructive negotiation On Saturday local time, Xie told reporters that Chinese and US negotiators had "very candid, friendly, positive and constructive" negotiation at COP27 , and the result is very constructive, but will only be made public after formal negotiations. Xie said that formal talks, or even face-to-face discussion between Beijing and Washington, will be conducted after COP27 is concluded.\~ The fact that Xie's US counterpart John Kerry tested positive for COVID-19 has hampered the two countries' discussions at the summit.\~ Climate negotiations between the two countries resumed after the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the G20 summit last week in Bali, Indonesia. The two presidents agreed that the two countries will jointly work for the success of COP27 . Scientists are overwhelmingly praising the resumption of talks between the world's two biggest economies as a positive sign, and the final negotiations could yield positive results to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "The US is denounced by other Western countries as it lacks efficient efforts in tackling global warming, and flip flops on its climate promises. Thus it strives to cooperate with China, because Beijing wins wide support among developing countries on addressing climate change," Yang said. However, to show sincerity over the cooperation, Washington must abandon its previous crackdown on China's clean energy industry, such as on photovoltaic products, Yang warned.\~ \</doc>

By JONATHAN POWELL in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-15 09:28 Analysts say negotiators face a difficult task as they aim for a breakthrough on key issues at the COP27 climate conference being held in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. With government ministers flying in for the second, final week of the summit, focus turns to the formulation of a document that establishes a consensus reached, or not. At the center of debates are greenhouse gas emissions reductions, how to end the use of fossil fuels, and finance for the most vulnerable countries suffering the worst climate effects. Egypt's COP27 "Our common objective is to adopt consensus decisions and conclusions on Friday that will constitute comprehensive, ambitious and balanced outcomes of the Sharm el-Sheikh conference," he told delegates. "It is now up to us all here to rise to the occasion and respond to the demands and calls from our communities around the world. We will accept no less than meaningful outcomes at COP27 . "Time is not on our side and the world is watching. Let us come together and deliver now." A report released at COP27 showed carbon emissions, which according to the Paris Agreement must decline nearly 50 percent by 2030, are on course to reach record levels this year. Rich countries and developing nations have so far been unable to come to any agreement on how to fund reductions in carbon pollution. At last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow, nearly 200 countries vowed to "keep alive" the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Analysts say few nations have taken the required action, and the world remains on track to warm up by about 2.5 C, which scientists say is the dangerous tipping point for Earth's climate system. At the midway point of the COP27 summit, little progress has been made, reported the Agence France-Presse. "Parties are basically staring each other down, thinking they have done their part and waiting for the other side to move," said the head of WWF France, Pierre Canet. Stakeholders and negotiating blocs all have their own concerns and interests, which makes reaching consensus a daunting challenge, said Reuters. It is hoped that the arrival of government ministers to the conference will help to push beyond some of the political discord. "All the big political crunch issues are unresolved," said Alden Meyer, a senior analyst at climate think tank E3G. Reports say no plans have yet emerged from the conference to improve on the agreement reached at COP26 to "phase down" the use of coal. On climate finance, the key issue on the agenda is that of "loss and damage", which covers climate impacts that cannot be "mitigated or adapted to", such as when land is so frequently flooded it is no longer habitable. This is a concern for the United States and others that fear costs imposed for their historic pollution. \</doc>

ALGIERS, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Algeria and Egypt launched an economic forum here on Thursday to boost economic partnership, with the attendance of Algerian Prime Minister Ayman Benabderrahmane and his Egyptian counterpart Mostafa Madbouly. In his opening address to the Algerian-Egyptian Economic Forum, Benabderrahmane hailed Egypt as "one of Algeria's most important Arab partners" in terms of investments and trade volumes. The Algerian government "is working to modernize the banking and financial system and draw up a new investment law to respond to the concerns of domestic and foreign economic operators," he noted. Madbouly, who was concluding his two-day visit to Algeria, said in a speech at the forum that Egypt, which has seen an improved business environment domestically through reforms, welcomes Algerian investors. Egypt has taken measures to encourage private investments, including amending tax and investment laws, said the Egyptian premier. The forum was also attended by business representatives of both countries. Later on Thursday, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune met with the Egyptian delegations led by Madbouly in his office, discussing ways to boost economic ties and cooperation in various fields, state-run Algeria Press Service reported. Madbouly, on behalf of the Egyptian president, invited Tebboune to attend the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) held in Egypt later this year. On Wednesday, the two countries inked 13 cooperation agreements under the framework of the 8th Higher Algerian-Egyptian Committee in Algiers, which cover the fields of industry, trade, investments, finance, water resources management, higher education, and scientific research.

By NDUMISO MLILO in Johannesburg, South Africa | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-07 09:24 South Africa has vowed to negotiate for the balancing of funding for adaptation and mitigation and push for developed countries to honor the climate change financing pledge at the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 27 , in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Barbara Creecy, South Africa's minister of forestry, fisheries and the environment, said developed countries have been responsible for greenhouse emissions for more than 200 years, while African countries that are most affected by climate change have contributed less than 4 percent to accumulated greenhouse emissions. "We have had recent estimates that African countries require over $440 billion for the next 10 years for mitigation and adaptation. We think it is important in the short term that developed nations need to honor the commitments that they have made to climate financing," Creecy told China Daily. "We know the commitment made in Paris has still not been honored for raising $100 billion per annum. We think that to establish trust between developing and developed countries it would be very important that pledges are honored." African countries have limited resources and are developing with most of them "heavily indebted", she said, and they should not borrow money to address the effects of climate change that would increase their indebtedness. There should be a fund for developing countries to claim money when they experience disasters as a result of climate change, Creecy said. "We want to make sure there are new financial goals after 2025 and we want that to be met. It should not be a thumb-sucked figure that is not new finance. It must be predictable and available. "We want to make sure that developed countries responsible for historic greenhouse gas emissions are not reneging on the climate financing commitment they made at COP 26. We want to make sure that they are not trying to push responsibility for climate commitments to developing countries. We hope to get the best deal for our people, country and humanity." Creecy said there should be a balance on the financing for adaptation and mitigation. Developing countries have to honor climate commitments so vulnerable communities and sectors of the economy are not left behind, she said, and conflict of climate justice within the Global North and South should be understood, mainstreamed and integrated into the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and financed. Hope expressed Crispian Olver, executive director of South Africa's Presidential Climate Commission, said it is looking forward to COP 27 . He welcomed the government's negotiating position at COP 27 , which he said is aligned with the expectations of many South African stakeholders. "We want the global goal on adaptation to be implemented. There is a target there, 50 percent resilience by 2030 and 90 percent by 2050. We are pleased that the South African government is pushing this adaptation finance facility, which will be embedded into the global architecture. The most important one for us is to push the notion of a just transition. "Developed countries in the North that are primarily responsible for the climate crisis need to step forward and deliver on the commitment of $100 billion per annum for climate finance, and they have not been forthcoming. In fact, needs are much higher than that." Olver said the research will be presented on climate investment needs at COP 27 , and what South Africa has been doing on climate change will be highlighted.

Tackling climate change can provide new incentives for economic growth, as demonstrated by China's successful experiences in developing new energy, said senior officials attending the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP 27 , on Tuesday. "Coping with climate change is a challenge and an opportunity as well," said Zhao Yingmin, Chinese vice-minister of ecology and environment, during a side event at the conference. "Data have shown transforming to a low-carbon economy has provided great development opportunities." China achieved economic development at an average annual rate of 6.5 percent between 2012 and last year, at the cost of annual growth of 3 percent of energy consumption, he said. During the decade, China's emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of gross domestic product decreased by a third due to increased efficiency in energy use, resulting in energy savings equivalent to 1.4 billion metric tons of coal. China has also become a world leader in new energy development, driven by a low-carbon transformation. China's electric vehicle market accounts for more than half of the global market, and China has remained at the top spot for many years in terms of total installed capacity for wind and solar power, Zhao said. "We need to accelerate the transformation to a low-carbon economy, and ensure the process is fair, orderly and secure," he said. Manuela Ferro, regional vice-president for East Asia and Pacific at the World Bank, said China has made remarkable progress in renewable energy, and accumulated experiences useful for many other countries. "I think that there are many lessons from China from both its development story and developing a more sustainable, climate-wise way," she said. Facts have shown it is possible for China to continue to grow, and grow in a more sustainable way that is consistent with China's own goals, she said, adding that coping with climate change can bring growth including job creation. Despite the challenges China faces in fighting climate change, China is well positioned to meet its climate commitments of achieving peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060, and transition to a greener economy while meeting its development goals, according to a report released by the World Bank last month. 'Green jobs' In the renewable energy sector, China has already created about 54 million "green jobs", with more than 4 million jobs in renewable energy, the report said. Zhao said during a COP 27 side event on Sunday that the Chinese government attaches high importance to managing climate change, and it will unswervingly follow a path of low-carbon development. China will accelerate integrating the reduction of carbon emissions with high-quality economic development, and work with the international community to contribute to fighting global climate change, he said.

A logo of the COP 27 summit Photo: Xinhua China attaches great importance to addressing climate change and is willing to work with the international community to promote global climate governance, the Chinese delegation said on Tuesday at the ongoing 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) held in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, noting that China, in the past decade, has saved a total of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal. Climate change is a common challenge faced by all mankind. China attaches great importance to addressing the issue, and has implemented a national strategy to actively respond to climate change and unswervingly pursuing a green and low-carbon development path, Zhao Yingmin, vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment leading the Chinese delegation at the conference, said at a side meeting on Tuesday. To achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, China has set up a special working group and issued implementation plans for key areas including energy, industry and transportation, and completed the construction of the "1+N" policy system of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, Zhao said. Zhao noted that in the past decade, China's annual energy consumption growth rate of 3 percent supported an average economic growth rate of 6.6 percent, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP decreased by about 34.4 percent, energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, and achieved a cumulative saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal. China regards the carbon market as an important tool for climate policy, and actively promotes the construction of a national carbon emissions trading market, said Zhao, adding that the national carbon market officially launched online trading on July 16, 2021, covering 4.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, making it the world's largest carbon market. The market has operated in a stable and orderly manner on the whole over the past year. Sebartian Eckardt, a practice manager in the East Asia and Pacific Region with the World Bank, said at the meeting that the challenges to achieve these goals are indeed unprecedented, but they will also bring new opportunities. Other scholars at the meeting said that they believe China will play an important role in global climate change governance. China has maintained good communication and cooperation with the United Nations and international financial institutions to actively address climate change, the Chinese delegate said. China is willing to work with the international community to promote the comprehensive, balanced and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, and continuously contribute Chinese wisdom and solutions to jointly build a fair and reasonable global governance system for climate change with win-win cooperation, said Zhao.

JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- The South African government on Saturday welcomed the draft outcomes text to the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). The COP27 was held in Egypt during Nov. 6-18. The South African government said it captures many issues which were discussed including the urgency of climate change. "The draft correctly frames the climate crisis and its solutions in terms of the sustainable development goals and just transitions, leaving no one left behind, and the need for broader financial sector reform to achieve these," said Peter Mbelengwa, spokesperson of the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries. Mbelengwa said South Africa expects the multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to take decisive action to scale-up climate finance in 2023 and make their institutional arrangements fit for the purpose. South Africa believes further urgent action is required to meet developed countries' obligations, Mbelengwa said. Mbelengwa said the country welcomed the urgent new financing arrangements and a mechanism to address damage caused by climate change for developing countries. Enditem \</doc>

This year's UN climate summit in Egypt, which kicked off after a year of devastating natural disasters and energy crisis, will focus on industrialized countries' commitment on tackling global warming, as asking wealth countries to honor their pledges of financing developing countries on the climate issue will be top focus of the summit. Chinese experts warned that rich countries should take real actions at the summit, which is billed by some as the world's "watershed moment" on climate action, otherwise global efforts on the climate issue will be thrown into great jeopardy. Meanwhile, the climate cooperation efforts between China and the US was singlehandedly bungled by Washington as it neglected Beijing's core interests and weaponized climate issue to suppress China. Observers predicted climate talks between Beijing and Washington are unlikely to be reopened during this summit unless the US properly addresses its previous wrongdoings against China. In addition, the US is an unreliable partner on addressing global climate issue, because it is likely to roll back its promises on climate if Republicans secure a victory in the House after the midterm elections. The 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) on climate change kicked off at the Red Sea resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Sunday. This year's summit, under the slogan Together for Implementation, is seen by scientists as an opportunity to advance prior commitments to limit global warming. COP27 delegates agreed on Sunday to discuss whether rich countries should compensate poorer nations most vulnerable to climate change at the summit, Reuters reported. Diplomats approved a much-disputed agenda item to talk about matters relating to "funding arrangements responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including a focus on addressing loss and damage." Top of Egypt's "to-do" list is the $100 billion a year developed countries promised way back in 2009 to help the developing world cut emissions and adapt to changing climate, BBC reported. Saying the money was supposed to be delivered in 2020 but now won't be available in full until next year - three years late. "Don't underestimate how angry developing nations are," Guterres said in an interview with BBC recently. He said they feel high-income countries have welched on the landmark deal made at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015. During an interview published on Sunday, Li Gao, general director of the Department of Climate Change with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) of China said that since COP27 is held in a developing country, it should reflect the developing world's request, and achieve results that are in accordance with those countries. Li stressed that currently, what's missing is not goals but actions. This conference [ COP27 ] is not a place where countries make new goals, countries should implement the already agreed promises, including rich countries to honor their promises of helping developing countries financially, said the official. The reason rich countries and developing countries failed to push forward cooperation on the climate issue is largely because of developed countries' failure to fulfil their promises of financing the developing world on tackling climate change, said Teng Fei, Deputy Director of Energy Environment Economy Institute, Tsinghua University. He noted that such inaction has broken the mutual trust built in 2015. "Now that the trust is hobbled, even collapsed in some areas." Pakistan, which suffered terrible floods this year, is demanding the developed world to also agree on a funding mechanism to compensate for the loss and damage climate change is already causing in developing countries. It brings real heft at the talks as chair of a key UN grouping of 134 developing countries, including China. "I don't think it is an impossible request," the Pakistani climate minister, Sherry Rehman, told the BBC last week. Just look at how much money the world finds to fund wars, she said. The COP27 summit is overshadowed by this year's climate disasters such asthe deadly flood in Pakistan and historical heatwave in Europe and China. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis has also ignited an energy crisis that has stoked inflation and threatened food security. These incidents have greatly set back global efforts on tackling climate change, with many European countries backpedaled to coals. Glasgow's objective to "keep 1.5 C alive" looks increasingly in jeopardy after the latest UNEP report concluded that national emissions reduction pledges implied a rise of between 2.4 C and 2.6 C. Despite similar challenges, China is steadily pushing forward its climate agenda. On Oct 27, the MEE released a 2022 report on China's policy and actions on climate change. According to the report, the country's carbon emissions per unit of GDP dropped by 3.8 percent in 2021 compared with the previous year, 50.8 percent lower than 2005. Climate talk saboteur Another focus of COP 27 is whether China and the US will be brought back to the table and resume the climate talk, which was suspended as a countermeasure of Chinese side in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island of Taiwan in August. Before the summit, John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, said last week that China and the US must find opportunities to work together to address the global climate crisis. "We have argued adamantly that it's not a bilateral relation, it's a multilateral global threat," he said. Teng believes the bilateral talks are unlikely to happen at the COP27 summit, though there could be talks on multilateral occasions. Cooperation should be based on trust, yet the trust issue between the two countries is not solved, and for this trust to be restored, the ball is on the US side to properly address China's bottom-line problems, said Teng. Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, believes climate cooperation between the two has been greatly impeded by the US, who has always weaponized the climate issue to crackdown on China. "The US has repeated pressured China to back to the climate talk table, but if Kerry is sincere to resume climate talks between China and the US, he should first persuade the US government to remove the roadblocks, for instance, lifting sanctions on Xinjiang's photovoltaic industry and ceasing the unreasonable crackdown on China in the field of chips," said Li. Li pointed out US climate policy is again on the crossroad of getting flip-flop as Republicans are positioned to regain control of the House of Representatives during midterm elections. "A Republican-controlled House will greatly frustrate Biden's climate plans. Moreover, such policy shift by the world's biggest emitter will exert huge blow to global effort of realizing climate goals," said Li. Republicans are preparing to advance an ambitious energy agenda if they win control of the House in the upcoming elections, including faster approvals of fossil fuel projects and probes of how the Biden administration is spending its hundreds of billions in climate dollars, US media Politico reported earlier this month. \</doc>

WINDHOEK, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- Namibia has welcomed the decisions taken at the just-ended 27th session of Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) on climate change, an official said Sunday. The climate change conference took place in Sharm El-Sheikh Egypt earlier this month negotiated on a wider range of issues, from global reporting on national climate change efforts, and how to finance such efforts, Namibia's Ministry of Environment, Forestry, and Tourism spokesperson, Romeo Muyunda said in an update statement. "Namibia was represented adequately at both political and technical levels," he said, as he highlighted some of the decisions Namibia is pleased with. According to Muyunda, the landmark win agreement on establishing the first-ever dedicated fund for loss and damage is one of the decisions welcomed by Namibia. "The fund will assist developing countries with financial and technical support to rescue and rebuild the physical and social infrastructure of developing countries devastated by extreme weather events including climate-related emergencies, sea level rise, displacement, relocation, migration, insufficient climate information, and data, or the need for climate-resilient reconstruction and recovery," he added. New pledges, totalling more than 230 million U.S. dollars, were made to the Adaptation Fund at COP27 , a small sum given the scale of the needs in developing countries. Despite efforts made on the financial pledges to the Adaptation Fund, the COP27 also urged developed countries to lay down a clear roadmap on mobilizing 100 billion U.S. dollars per year by 2024/5, Muyunda said. Furthermore, Muyunda said the decision to double adaptation finance was reached and the COP27 called for urgency on developed countries to scale up and mobilize financial support to the developing countries to implement their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Muyunda said the mitigation work program was established to halve the current emissions by 40 to 50 percent by 2030 with the developed countries taking the lead. "It was also decided that the work program shall function in a manner that is consistent with the procedures and timelines for communication of successive NDCs established in the Paris Agreement, and that the scope of the work program should be based on broad thematic areas relevant to urgently scaling up mitigation ambition," he said. Meanwhile, Muyunda said parties agreed to initiate the development of a framework for the global goal of adaptation to be undertaken through a long-term structured approach under the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work program in 2023 with a view for the framework being adopted at the next COP.

By EDITH MUTETHYA in Nairobi, Kenya | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-09-27 09:34 Ahead of the United Nations climate change conference COP 27 scheduled for November, young African climate activists are demanding action against loss and damage due to climate change impacts. Dissatisfied with inadequate global efforts for halting the climate crisis, activists took to the streets over the weekend to voice their demands. In Kenya's capital Nairobi, thousands of youths, under the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, demanded that states compensate for losses that pastoralists and smallholder farmers in the country suffer due to the ongoing drought, which has been described by locals as the "worst in 40 years". Chanting "We are calling for climate reparations now! Not as charity, but as a transformative justice process", the youth demanded the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations include the financing of loss and damage and that the financing is not in the form of loans. The activists called for the wealthiest developed nations to be held responsible for their actions, inaction and willful ignorance. Mithika Mwenda, executive director of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, said communities are losing livelihoods due to the climate crisis. Data from the alliance indicated that floods last year killed about 100 people in Kenya and displaced about 200,000, with 3.5 million people becoming victims of extreme weather. In South Africa, hundreds of youth and members of civil society marched from Hanover Street to the Cape Town parliament on Saturday as part of Heritage Day celebrations, demanding urgent action against climate change and socioeconomic crises. The protests were organized by the youth-led African Climate Alliance. "We have a system in this country and in many parts of the world that treats the majority of people and our living planet as worthless," Gabriel Klaasen from the African Climate Alliance said ahead of the protests. Inequality highlighted "This has led to many interlinking crises from income inequality to water and food insecurity, to the climate crisis. We are marching for urgent action to address the climate crisis and transform our economic and social systems." The peaceful protests in both Kenya and South Africa aligned with the global climate strike led by young climate activists across the globe. Meanwhile on Saturday, Egypt, which is hosting COP 27 , called on the international community to act on climate pledges made to developing countries. In his speech to the high-level segment of the UN General Assembly, Egypt's Minister for Foreign Affairs Sameh Hassan Selim appealed to all members of the international community to act on the pledges and commitment of support for developing countries to cope with the devastating impacts of the emergency. Selim said adaptation finance needs to be doubled and that the $100 billion promised for climate finance annually must be duly delivered. He added there must also be a just transition to renewable energy. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called on countries to take climate actions instead of "finger-pointing" at the ongoing UN climate change conference. He made the remarks during a press briefing at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is scheduled to close on Friday in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Guterres said that COP27 will come to an end in 24 hours, but there is clearly a "breakdown" in trust between North and South. There is no time for finger-pointing, he noted, adding "the blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction." On climate actions, Guterres urged the parties to act in three critical areas -- to respond to loss and damage, close the emissions gap, and deliver on finance. The UN chief also asked the developed countries to fulfill their pledge of providing 100 billion U.S. dollars per year for developing countries and set a credible roadmap for doubling adaptation finance. He noted that developed countries "must" provide the support that developing countries need to develop renewable energy and enhance their climate resilience. "Renewables are the exit ramp from the climate hell highway," he said, echoing his earlier remarks about the so-called "highway to climate hell" made at the COP27 leaders' summit. Guterres called for quickly reaching a consensus at COP27 , warning that the "climate clock is ticking and trust keeps eroding." During the briefing, Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry stressed that there are still a number of issues lacking progress at the late stage of COP27 . The parties "are shying away from taking difficult political decisions," he said. Enditem \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called for multilateralism and diplomacy to make the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference 2022 ( COP27 ) in Egypt "turning points for hope." " COP27 must be the place to rebuild trust and re-establish the ambition needed to avoid driving our planet over the climate cliff," the UN chief said in a press encounter. In the last few weeks, report after report has painted a clear and bleak picture -- emissions are still growing at record levels, Guterres said, adding that temperatures are also on course to rise by as much as 2.8 degrees. "And that means our planet is on course for reaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We need to move from tipping points to turning points for hope," he said. It is time for a historic pact between the developed and emerging economies -- a pact in which developed countries deliver on the commitment made in Paris -- to help emerging economies speed their renewable energy transition, said Guterres. " COP27 must be the place to close the ambition gap, the credibility gap and the solidarity gap. The world must come together to support developing countries and vulnerable communities," he said.

Egypt's presidency of the ongoing UN climate conference and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) launched on Saturday a food and agriculture initiative to increase climate resources to support the most vulnerable communities. In a statement, the presidency of the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said the initiative, dubbed the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST), will reimagine agrifood systems to deliver triple wins for people, climate action and nature. The COP27 presidency said in the statement that FAST's action priorities are access to finance, knowledge and capacity, and policy support and dialogue. "Through the FAST initiative, we will be mobilizing the world to unlock finance flows to increase climate resilience and implement urgently needed transformation across agrifood systems," COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said. Shoukry added the impact of climate change is disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities around the world. "To address this imbalance, we need to develop sustainable farming and food systems and meet the urgent needs of food-importing developing countries," he added. Meanwhile, FAO Deputy Director General Maria Helena Semedo said bold actions are needed to transform agrifood system, support countries and ensure that resources reach food producers across the value chain. COP27 kicked off on November 6 in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, with countries working together to address the global climate change. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- The presidency of the ongoing UN climate conference launched an agenda on Tuesday to "enhance resilience for 4 billion people living in the most climate vulnerable communities by 2030." The Sharm-El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda was announced by Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry during a speech at a roundtable held in Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, on the sidelines of the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Shoukry, also the COP27 president, said the agenda is a plan that offers solutions to the challenges of climate finance and pledge implementation. In a written statement, the COP27 presidency said the agenda outlined 30 adaptation outcomes, each of which offered solutions that could be adopted at a local level to adapt to climate change. Collectively, these outcomes represent "the first comprehensive global plan to rally both state and non-state actors behind a shared set of adaptation actions that are required by the end of this decade across five impact systems: food and agriculture, water and nature, coasts and oceans, human settlements, and infrastructure, and including enabling solutions for planning and finance," it added. The agenda includes global 2030 targets related to transitioning to climate-resilient and sustainable agriculture, protecting and restoring critical ecosystems, installing smart and early warning systems that could benefit around 3 billion people across the world, investment to protect mangroves, and expanding people's access to clean cooking, among others.

THE 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) started Sunday in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, with countries jointly seeking to combat the global climate crisis. In the past year, in addition to climate change and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has been battered by multiple crises such as geopolitical conflicts, higher energy and food prices, increasing inflation, and frequent extreme weather events. Under such circumstances, the convening of the climate conference appears all the more important. Collective, complementary and collaborative actions by countries around the world to adapt to the effects of climate change, mitigate its negative repercussions, and provide finance have become the focus of this year\' s conference agenda. Urgent need for actions Millions of people across the world have suffered in their daily lives because of the impacts of natural disasters and climate change. Europe has experienced unprecedented high temperatures and heatwaves, as well as droughts and wildfires. One third of Pakistan has been completely submerged by flooding. Powerful hurricanes have made thousands of families homeless in the United States. Yet, Robert Stefanski, the World Meteorological Organization\' s chief of Applied Climate Services, said 2022 may be the year with the best climate from now on. He warned that if the world does not take urgent actions, extreme weather events may become the  new norm in the world. Should global warming reach 3 degrees Celcius by 2100, according to a U.N. report, drought losses could be five times higher than they are today, with the largest increase in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic regions of Europe. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by 2030 Africa will lose two-thirds of its arable land if desertification  the spread of arid, desert-like areas of land  continues at the current pace. Since the beginning of this year, many African countries are facing food shortages, even in countries with rich water resources. The loss and damage caused by global climate change have become one of the top issues, said Egypt\' s chief climate negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr, adding that  the international response is still not up to the challenge of the impacts. COP27 will hold a round table summit on climate change and food security, during which initiatives on agriculture, food security and nutrition will be proposed, and agricultural solutions under climate change will be a priority in multilateral negotiations, the ambassador said.  We have witnessed during this year painful events in Pakistan, the African continent and various parts of Europe and America. All these events and the destruction and impact represent a lesson to be learned all over the planet ... to more precaution, and to act quickly to take all necessary measures as per our commitments and pledges, Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said at the opening ceremony of COP27 .  Dealing with climate change problems is obligatory, not a choice, said Egyptian climate and environment expert Magdy Allam. Under the slogan of COP27  Together for implementation  the host country Egypt calls on countries across the globe to convert their previous commitments on climate change from lip service to action. Climate debt of rich countries However, since the 2009 climate change conference in Copenhagen (COP15), developed countries have not been able to fully deliver on their commitment of providing US$100 billion of climate finance per year to developing countries.  Parties enjoy getting into the process of planning all the time. But nothing is happening on the ground, Nasr said.  Who will be paying the price?  Climate change-related efforts over the past decades were remarkably polarized, which has slowed down progress of the negotiations, Shoukry said, adding the pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars per year has not yet been honored. African countries are far less to blame for global warming than developed countries, but suffer most from climate change. Yasmine Fouad, Egypt\' s environment minister and ministerial coordinator and envoy for COP27 , noted that Africa accounts for only 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but suffers the most, and that 20% of its population live in countries most vulnerable to climate change. As such, a significant step for unified efforts is that developed countries provide a constantly increasing amount of adaptation funds for developing countries, said Allam.  When soft loans and aid to poor countries increase, this will help reduce instances of chopping and burning forest trees in those countries, he said.  African countries have shown their willingness to confront climate change, but they need support, Shoukry said. Apart from urging developed countries to honor their pledge on current climate funding which focuses on cutting carbon emissions, this year\' s conference also introduced climate reparations into its agenda so that vulnerable nations will receive money for the loss and damage they\' ve suffered from climate change. Green growth a common cause  Europe, after the Russian gas was cut, tends to use any kind of fuel and escaped its climate change obligation, Allam said, adding that  the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a reminder that we should find alternative energy sources, and veer toward a green economy. China\' s Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua said Sunday at a side event of COP27 that China has been actively fostering its green energy sectors for years, while encouraging its citizens and private companies to participate in the efforts to reduce carbon emissions. China will readily work with other countries to support COP27 and contribute its wisdom and strength to building a fair, reasonable and win-win global climate governance system, Xie said.  Green development is not an alternative, but an irreplaceable way for the world to limit carbon emissions and protect the environment, said Waleed Gaballah, professor of financial and economic jurisdictions at Cairo University. Countries need to show faith in multilateralism as they negotiate to deliver on the goals of the U.N. Climate Convention and the Paris Agreement, Shoukry said.  No one can be a mere passenger on this journey, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said Sunday at the opening ceremony of COP27 .(Xinhua) \</doc>

The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP27 , concluded on Sunday with the reaching of a historic agreement to provide "loss and damage" funding to vulnerable countries most affected by global climate change. "This COP has taken an important step towards justice. I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video message issued from the conference venue in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. "Clearly this will not be enough, but it is a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust," he said, adding that the UN system will support the effort every step of the way. For the first time, "loss and damage" was a primary agenda item for discussion during this year's gathering. Developing countries have long called for financial compensation for their loss and damage caused by global warming, which has been mostly attributed to richer, industrialized countries that have emitted the bulk of greenhouse gases in recent centuries. During this year's session, developing countries also repeatedly called for developed countries to fulfill their promise to provide $100 billion each year to developing countries to help them fight climate change, a pledge made during COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, 13 years ago. Simon Stiell, the UN's climate change executive secretary, said of the agreement, which was reached on Sunday after days of intense negotiations among countries, "At COP27  we've determined a way forward on a decadeslong conversation on funding for loss and damage." The negotiations were difficult, but "this historic outcome does move us forward and it benefits the vulnerable people around the world", Stiell said. "Let's use this success as a springboard to restore trust in our process. Let's use it to achieve greater ambition and faster implementation," he said on social media. Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, commenting on the "loss and damage" agreement, said it is a "win for climate justice, a win for the developing world in honor of 33 million victims of Pakistan floods and millions around the world who suffer from a climate catastrophe they did not create and do not have resources to address". In addition to agreeing to set up a dedicated fund to assist developing countries in responding to loss and damage, countries attending COP27 also committed to establishing a transitional committee to make recommendations for countries to adopt at COP28 next year, according to a UN news release. While emphasizing that a fund for loss and damage is essential, Guterres said that much more needs to be done to prevent the worsening of climate change, such as accelerating the phasing out of coal and the development of renewable energy. The UN chief also stressed the need for developed countries to honor their long-delayed promise of providing $100 billion a year in climate change mitigation financing for developing countries. Mahmoud Mohieldin, the UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for Egypt, said the $100 billion figure should be scaled up to meet the evolving needs of developing countries today. "People who have done the least to cause the climate crisis are paying the highest price. Africa accounts for no more than 3 percent of global emissions, yet many of its people are suffering the most from climate change," he said.

CAIRO, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is counting on the upcoming 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) to obligate developed countries to honor their commitments to finance climate change projects and mitigate the effects of harmful climate changes, a COP official said on Friday. To tackle climate challenges, some 120 world leaders will gather in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh from November 6 to 18 for the COP27 . "We need to find a space to discuss funding arrangements...then the climate finance," Special Advisor of the COP27 President-Designate Wael Aboulmagd said during a virtual press briefing. He said he hoped everyone could focus on the important agenda of COP27 , which is to put forward a strong work program by the end of the conference to facilitate climate change mitigation. "We need to deliver a very strong message at COP27 on the global goal and adaptation," he stressed, adding a discussion on the funding arrangements for loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change was necessary. "We will have more than 120 world leaders here. They will not just deliver plenary style statements, but attend six round tables to discuss various important things," Aboulmagd said. The themes of discussions will include transition, water, food, vulnerable communities, green hydrogen, innovation and finance, he noted. "These round tables will not only be attended by world leaders, but also by representatives of the private sector and financial institutions as well as Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). Every relevant stakeholder will be represented," he added. The COP Presidency will work hard to ensure the COP27 agenda include the issue of "loss and damage" associated with the adverse effects of climate change, according to Aboulmagd. "Negotiations are difficult. They depend on an agreement reached by more than 190 members...but people will realize that we can work together to push the needle forward," Aboulmagd said. He stressed that developed countries had constantly fallen short of their commitment to contribute 100 billion U.S. dollars a year, pointing out that the COP Presidency will urge developed countries to fulfil their commitment at the upcoming COP27 . Aboulmagd said he hoped to see real contributions to the negotiations, initiatives, projects and commitments for climate change. Enditem \</doc>

China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua (left) and US climate envoy John Kerry (right) delivers speech during the COP27 summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. Photos: AFP Top climate officials from China and the US started talks after the leaders of both countries endorsed the resumption of communications on climate change, which scientists believe is expected to push the ongoing COP27 summit to be a venue for concrete results and may also point to a possible bilateral consensus at the summit. US climate envoy John Kerry and China's top climate official Xie Zhenhua met for about 45 minutes at the Chinese delegation's offices in the COP27 conference zone, the Associated Press reported.\~ It quoted Kerry as saying "We had a very good meeting." It was "much too early" to talk about any remaining differences, he said. "But we're gonna go to work."\~ The meeting came shortly after the meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden on Monday. The two presidents agreed that the two countries will jointly work for the success of COP27 . The two countries' communication on climate change was suspended after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's highly provocative visit to the island of Taiwan in August. The two leaders' meeting in Indonesia has assuaged conflicts at COP27 , Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser at Greenpeace China who is attending the summit, told the Global Times. Usually, a consensus on climate between China and the US, the two biggest emitters, can directly push forward multilateral progress during climate summits.\~ "Now that China and the US have resumed talks on climate change, it can also help push COP27 to reach a concrete result," said Li.\~ Scientists are also optimistic that it is possible that reopening communication will translate into concrete agreements between Beijing and Washington at COP27 , which is scheduled to end on November 18. "I believe the two will reach a certain degree of consensus at the meeting," Guan Dabo, a professor from the Department of Earth System Science at Tsinghua University, who is also attending the summit, told the Global Times. The two countries should focus on how to cooperate to jointly lead the globe in achieving carbon neutrality around the mid of century. Further, the two countries should also think about the leadership in global financing system to prevent the risk of climate extremes, which affects both rich and poor countries, certainly the latter will be more vulnerable.\~ Last year, before COP26 convened in Glasgow, China and the US issued a joint announcement in November, vowed to intensify their efforts on tackling global warming.\~ However, the two are at loggerheads about some issues at this year's COP27 summit. The single largest issue facing negotiators in Egypt is whether to create a fund to help poor countries cope with the loss and damage from continuing climate disasters. The agenda item was proposed by Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, yet the US appears to be the most visible blocker of such a mechanism.\~ Speaking at a sideline event last week, Xie said that Beijing is prepared to spend money to help poorer countries. "It is not China's responsibility, but we are willing to help," said Xie, while urging rich countries to pay the promised money.\~ Despite hailing the progress in China-US cooperation on the climate as "shining point" at COP27 , experts cast doubts on the stability and consistency of US promises on climate change. The impact of US domestic politics on its promise about climate change\~makes it hard for the US to make more promises on climate change, and may affect the\~stability of China's cooperation with the US on the issue, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times. Although Republicans' gains in the US midterms are unlikely to knock Biden's existing climate policies off course, experts still worry that the filibuster may undermine Washington's future climate efforts. Former president Donald Trump on Tuesday launched a bid to regain the presidency in 2024, and it was during his administration that the US pulled out of the Paris Agreement in 2017.\~ "The US instability on climate issues leaves room for China to play a larger role in leading climate issues globally, especially among developing countries," said Guan.\~ The reason why climate change was among the first areas where China and the US resumed communications is because it is a less political issue between the two, Li Haidong said. Since the two restarted such communications, it is important that Washington stop weaponizing the issue, such as imposing sanctions on Xinjiang region's photovoltaic industry.\~ "The influence of domestic policy, plus the US tendency of using climate change as a weapon to crack down on China, makes Washington the obstacle for bilateral cooperation," said Li Haidong. \</doc>

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-01 09:15 PM considers U-turn as Britain faces criticism for planning not to take part Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is reportedly considering a U-turn on his decision not to attend the United Nations COP27 climate summit in Egypt after criticism from political opponents and members of his own Conservative Party. Last week, a spokesperson said Sunak was not expected to attend the gathering, which comes a year after the United Kingdom hosted the COVID-delayed COP26 in Scotland, "due to other pressing domestic commitments including preparations for the autumn Budget". King Charles III, the country's new monarch, was believed to be keen to attend but was told by Truss that he should not, a position backed up by Sunak, but with so many world leaders going, there has been heavy criticism of the fact Britain will not have a high-ranking presence. Conservative member of Parliament Alok Sharma, who was the UK's president of COP26, will hand over the presidency to Egypt at the summit, which takes place in Sharm el-Sheik from Nov 6 to 18. He told The Times newspaper he was "pretty disappointed" Sunak was not planning to attend. He said: "Going to COP27 would allow for engagement with other world leaders. And I think it does send a signal - if the prime minister was to go - about our renewed commitment on this issue." Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, accused Sunak of a "failure of leadership", and Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at environmental organization Greenpeace, said his not attending the handover of the COP presidency "is like a runner failing to turn up with the baton at a crucial stage of the relay". But now the BBC and Daily Mirror newspaper report that Sunak may be having a change of heart. Environment Minister Mark Spencer told BBC Breakfast that the new prime minister had "a huge inbox" of challenges to deal with, but did not completely rule out that he might make an appearance. "I'm sure if his diary allows he would want to go but at this moment in time don't quite know if he's going to be have time to do that," he said. Following his instruction not to attend, Charles has arranged a gathering of what Buckingham Place said would be more than 200 "international business leaders, decision makers and NGOs "on Nov 4, to mark the end of the British COP presidency. Another thing that may have a bearing on the likelihood of Sunak's presence is the suggestion that former prime minister Boris Johnson may attend. Sunak was chancellor of the exchequer under Johnson, but when he quit his position in July, saying in his resignation letter "it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different&hellip; I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this", it was one of the biggest contributory factors to the ending of Johnson's term of office, before he stepped down. \</doc>

Photo: VCG China has made important contributions to the positive progress achieved\~ at the COP27 in dealing with the global climate change, and defended the interests of developing countries, China's environment authority said on Monday.\~ "China has fully and deeply participated in the negotiations and consultations on nearly 100 issues, firmly safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries, and has made important contributions to the package of positive outcomes achieved at the meeting," Liu Youbin, the spokesperson at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told the Global Times. COP27 , or the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, came to a\~ conclusion at Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on November 20, 39 hours earlier before the scheduled close. Dozens of resolutions were adopted at the meeting, and a relatively balanced package of results was agreed upon, including the establishment of "loss and damage" funding. "Loss and damage" refers to expenses already incurred by climate change, such as rising sea levels or extreme heat waves, according to the Xinhua News Agency. "However, we are also very sorry to see that developed countries still do not fully face up to their historical responsibilities, and have a negative attitude on providing funds and technical knowledge to developing countries," Liu said. "The developed countries' pledge of $100 billion per year remains unfulfilled, and there is no clear funding arrangement for adaptation funding." During the conference, China submitted the"Progress on the Implementation of China's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)" to the COP27 secretariat, elaborating on the progress made by China in implementing its NDC targets since 2020, which includes reaching its carbon peak before 2030 and achieving carbon neutralization before 2060. "It reflects China's determination and achievements in promoting the development of green groups and actively responding to climate change," Liu said. In the China Corner at the COP27 , China shared its wisdom and plans in tackling climate change. Li Gao, director of tackling climate change at the Ministry of Ecology and vice director of Chinese delegation to COP27 , was chosen as Vice-President of the COP, according to Liu. "China will, as always, maintain multilateralism, continue to actively participate in the global governance of climate change, and continue to deepen South-South cooperation on climate change with other developing countries within its capacity, based on the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities," Liu said. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of four major developing countries on Tuesday called for the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to make substantial progress in talks on global adaptation goals. The BASIC Group, which is comprised of Brazil, South Africa, India and China, held its 31st ministerial meeting on climate change here, saying that the progress would lay a solid foundation for achieving ambitious and feasible global adaptation goals at COP28. In the meeting, environment ministers of the BASIC countries introduced the progress made by each member in dealing with climate change and had an in-depth exchange of views on jointly promoting the success of COP27 . As a vital force in the multilateral process of climate change, the BASIC countries have been persistently leading all parties to adhere to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement and playing an essential role in safeguarding the common interests of developing countries, according to Zhao Yingmin, vice minister of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Zhao said that hosted by a developing country, COP27 should reach productive results on the issues of adaptation and finance, which are of most concern to developing countries. Chaired by South Africa's Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Barbara Creecy, the meeting was attended by Brazil's Minister of Environment Joaquim Leite, India's Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav, as well as Zhao. The ministers stressed in the meeting the basis of equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities for tackling climate change. They urged developed countries again to fulfill the annual support pledge of 100 billion U.S. dollars as soon as possible and set a roadmap for doubling adaptation funding. They also adopted the BASIC Ministerial Joint Statement at the UNFCCC's Sharm el-Sheikh Climate Change Conference. In the statement, they pledged full support to the Egyptian COP27 Presidency for a successful conference.

By Wang Xiaodong and Otiato Opali in Nairobi, Kenya | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-11-20 23:48 The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP27 , concluded on Sunday with the reaching of a historic agreement to provide "loss and damage" funding to vulnerable countries most affected by global climate change. "This COP has taken an important step towards justice. I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video message issued from the conference venue in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. "Clearly this will not be enough, but it is a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust," he said, adding that the UN system will support the effort every step of the way. For the first time, "loss and damage" was a primary agenda item for discussion during this year's gathering. Developing countries have long called for financial compensation for their loss and damage caused by global warming, which has been mostly attributed to industrialized countries that have emitted the bulk of greenhouse gases in recent centuries. During this year's session, developing countries also repeatedly called for developed countries to fulfill their promise to provide $100 billion each year to developing countries to help them fight climate change, a pledge made during COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, 13 years ago. Simon Stiell, the UN's climate change executive secretary, said of the agreement, which was reached on Sunday after days of intense negotiations among countries, "At COP27 ... we've determined a way forward on a decadeslong conversation on funding for loss and damage." The negotiations were difficult, but "this historic outcome does move us forward and it benefits the vulnerable people around the world", Stiell said. "Let's use this success as a springboard to restore trust in our process. Let's use it to achieve greater ambition and faster implementation," he said on his social media. Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, commenting on the "loss and damage" agreement, said it is a "win for climate justice, a win for the developing world in honor of 33 million victims of Pakistan floods and millions around the world who suffer from a climate catastrophe they did not create and do not have resources to address". In addition to agreeing to set up a dedicated fund, countries attending COP27 also committed to establishing a transitional committee to make recommendations for countries to adopt at COP28 next year, according to a UN news release. The UN chief also stressed the need for developed countries to honor their long-delayed promise of providing $100 billion a year in climate change mitigation financing for developing countries. Mahmoud Mohieldin, the UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for Egypt, said the $100 billion figure should be scaled up to meet the evolving needs of developing countries today. "People who have done the least to cause the climate crisis are paying the highest price. Africa accounts for no more than 3 percent of global emissions, yet many of its people are suffering the most from climate change," he said. \</doc>

CAIRO, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) started Sunday in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, with countries jointly seeking to combat the global climate crisis. In the past year, in addition to climate change and the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has been battered by multiple crises such as geopolitical conflicts, higher energy and food prices, increasing inflation, and frequent extreme weather events. Under such circumstances, the convening of the climate conference appears all the more important. Collective, complementary and collaborative actions by countries around the world to adapt to the effects of climate change, mitigate its negative repercussions, and provide climate finance have become the focus of this year's conference agenda. URGENT NEED FOR CLIMATE ACTIONS Since the beginning of 2022, heatwaves, torrential rains, floods, droughts and other natural disasters occurred one after another around the world. Europe has experienced unprecedented high temperatures and heatwaves not seen in centuries, as well as frequent droughts and wildfires. One third of Pakistan has been completely submerged by historic flooding. Powerful hurricanes have made thousands of families homeless in the United States. Yet, Robert Stefanski, the World Meteorological Organization's chief of Applied Climate Services, said 2022 may be the year with the best climate from now on. He warned that if the world does not take urgent actions, extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts and floods may become the "new norm" in the world. Should global warming reach 3 degrees Celcius by 2100, according to a UN report, drought losses could be five times higher than they are today, with the largest increase in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic regions of Europe. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that by 2030 Africa will lose two-thirds of its arable land if the march of desertification -- the spread of arid, desert-like areas of land -- is not stopped. Since the beginning of this year, many African countries are facing the risk of food shortages or supply interruption, even in countries with rich water resources. The loss and damage caused by global climate change have become one of the top issues, said Egypt's chief climate negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr, adding that "the international response is still not up to the challenge of the impacts." COP27 will hold a round table summit on climate change and food security, during which initiatives on agriculture, food security and nutrition will be proposed, and agricultural solutions under climate change will be a priority in multilateral negotiations, the ambassador said. "We have witnessed during this year painful events in Pakistan, the African continent and various parts of Europe and America. All these events and the destruction and impact represent a lesson to be learned and alarm all over the planet ... to more precaution, and to act quickly to take all necessary measures as per our commitments and pledges," Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry said at the opening ceremony of COP27 . "Dealing with climate change problems is obligatory, not a choice," said Egyptian climate and environment expert Magdy Allam. Under the slogan of COP27 -- Together for implementation -- the host country Egypt calls on countries across the globe to convert their previous commitments on climate change from lip service to action, he said. CLIMATE DEBT OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES "We know that we have reached a point where finance makes or breaks the progress of the program ahead of us," Alok Sharma, president of COP26 hosted in Glasgow, Scotland, said Sunday during the opening ceremony of COP27 , highlighting the important role finance plays in this conference. However, since the 2009 climate change conference in Copenhagen (COP15), developed countries have not been able to fully deliver on their commitment of providing 100 billion U.S. dollars of climate finance per year to developing countries. "Parties enjoy getting into the process of planning all the time. But nothing is happening on the ground," Nasr said. "Who will be paying the price?" "Climate change-related efforts over the past decades were remarkably polarized, which has slowed down progress of the negotiations," Shoukry said Sunday, adding the pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars per year has not yet been honored. Although the contribution of African countries to global warming is far less than that of developed countries, the poorest continent on Earth is far more vulnerable than developed countries in terms of climate change. Yasmine Fouad, Egypt's environment minister and ministerial coordinator and envoy for COP27 , noted that Africa accounts for 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but suffers the most from them, and that 20 percent of the continent's population live in countries that are in the top 10 most vulnerable to climate change. As such, a significant step for the world to jointly address climate issues is that developed countries provide adaptation funds for developing countries, and the amount of the funds needs to be constantly increased, said Allam. "When soft loans and aid to poor countries increase, this will reduce these countries' share in chopping and burning forest trees which are the lungs of the globe," he said. "The countries of the African continent have shown their willingness to confront climate change, but they need support," Shoukry said. Apart from urging developed countries to honor their pledge on current climate funding which focuses on cutting carbon emissions to prevent climate change in the future, this year's conference also introduced the loss and damage funding into the agenda to compensate countries that cannot avoid or "adapt" to the changes that have already happened. GREEN DEVELOPMENT AS COMMON PURSUIT Since the United States and the EU have imposed an embargo on Russian oil and gas after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the current energy crisis in Europe has forced many countries to fall back to traditional energy sources such as coal. At the same time, explosions in the Nord Stream pipelines have released a large amount of natural gas into the atmosphere, putting global emission reduction achievements in jeopardy. "Now Europe, after the Russian gas was cut, tends to use any kind of fuel and escaped its climate change obligation," Allam said, adding that "the Russia-Ukraine conflict shows the world that we should search for alternatives, turn to the green economy and change our concepts of consuming energy." While the developed world has suffered setbacks, many developing countries have maintained an ardent and persistent desire for green development despite challenges. China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua said Sunday at a side event of COP27 that China has been actively creating a green and low-carbon atmosphere for years, encouraging the public to participate in carbon emissions reduction, and exploring to establish a pluralistic mechanism of social participation. Under the principles of openness and transparency, broad participation, consensus and party-driven, China will work with all parties to promote the success of COP27 and contribute its wisdom and strength to building a fair, reasonable and win-win global climate governance system, Xie said. "Green development is not an alternative, but an irreplaceable way for the world to limit carbon emissions and protect the environment," said Waleed Gaballah, professor of financial and economic jurisdictions at Cairo University. Countries need to show faith in multilateralism as they negotiate to deliver on the goals of the UN Climate Convention and the Paris Agreement, Shoukry said. "No one can be a mere passenger on this journey," UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said Sunday at the opening ceremony of COP27 . Enditem \</doc>

On November 8, during the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Egypt, 14 global large-scale agri-food companies including COFCO International jointly released an "Industry Roadmap", promising to take collective action to curb the existing risks in agricultural production. Deforestation, helping to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Original Press Release: Nov. 17 --COFCO Group Co., Ltd. issued the following news release: On November 8, during the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Egypt, 14 global large-scale agri-food companies including COFCO International jointly released an "Industry Roadmap", promising to take collective action to curb the existing risks in agricultural production. Deforestation, helping to achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the food system produces about one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and global deforestation is mainly due to the expansion of agricultural land. In order to reverse the trend of deforestation and protect forest resources, the agri-food industry roadmap requires signatories to improve the traceability of agricultural products, reduce carbon emissions caused by land use changes, provide incentive funds for farmers to protect vegetation, and cooperate with governments and financial institutions of various countries. Institutional cooperation, etc., mainly involves the production and trade of palm oil, beef, and soybeans. The roadmap proposes that each signatory company also needs to formulate its own action plans and goals, announce relevant progress every year, and accept third-party supervision. With the support of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA), the roadmap has been consulted for a year. Dong Wei, CEO of COFCO International, said: "We congratulate all parties on this progress, which is a major milestone for the industry in eliminating deforestation driven by commodity trade and advancing the UN's 1.5C temperature control target." COFCO International's current business covers about 100 countries and regions around the world, with an annual trade volume of bulk agricultural products exceeding 100 million tons. Since 2017, the company has launched a soybean traceability project in Brazil, where its largest assets are located, to ensure that soybean supply farms do not have deforestation problems. Up to now, the traceability scope of the company's direct procurement of soybeans has covered all business operations in Brazil.

Depending on what one expected, the outcome of the two-week UN COP 27 summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, was either inspiring or disappointing. For those who anticipated an event producing "action" on what countries agreed upon last year, the "loss and damage" deal alone was nothing less than a historic, monumental achievement. For those hoping for a greater global commitment to joint moves toward goals set under the Paris Agreement and a faster pace, the absence of a substantial commitment on phasing down fossil fuels was another "missed opportunity". Considering how divided nations have been on the urgency of and approach to a joint response to climate change, having developed nations finally commit to a special fund to compensate developing countries that suffer "loss and damage" is a significant step toward "climate justice". Which is why some have praised it as "the most significant" development since the 2015 Paris Agreement. The historic concession of the rich nations will certainly be conducive to fostering synergy and building a truly global contingent for containing climate change. After all, over the past decades, developing nations have borne a grudge against the developed ones, which have obviously been the foremost contributors to global warming, yet have been dragging their feet in delivering the assistance they had pledged. In this sense, there may be a greater chance for developing countries assuming more active roles when it comes to a collective climate response. Yet until the specifics are worked out, and the most vulnerable victims get the assistance they need and deserve, it is hard to tell what a difference this could make in the real world. The difficult negotiations throughout COP 27 illustrate how divided countries remain over a common course of action. So much so that the prospect of having one appears dim even after that "historic" milestone. Indeed, except for meeting the developing world's demand for "fairness", which may help mitigate the pains resulting from climate-related losses, the meeting produced little consensus on addressing emissions. Without dealing with the root causes of climate change, with the most outstanding roadblock being the reliance on fossil fuels, there is no hope of limiting the global temperature rise. The text of the final statement did not include commitments to "phase down" the use of fossil fuels. Key fossil fuel suppliers and consumers alike had lobbied hard against calls for accelerating the phase-out. President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, which will host next year's COP 28 climate summit, even said his country would continue to deliver oil and gas "for as long as the world is in need". All these indicate the impossibility of emissions peaking in 2025. EU green chief Frans Timmermans was correct in saying, "This is the make or break decade but what we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward". That means there's still work to be done. \~ \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry on Saturday called for efforts to ensure a positive outcome at the UN Climate Change Conference, or COP27 , in Egypt in November. Egypt, in its capacity as the host of COP27 , appeals to all members of the international community to act on their pledges and commitments and support the developing countries and the least developed countries in their efforts to confront the devastating impact of climate change, he said. They are the most deserving of such support based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, he told the General Debate of the UN General Assembly. "Thus, we look forward during COP27 hosted by Egypt in a few weeks to reaching outcomes that would contribute to accelerating the pace of implementation across the board so that the international community would confirm its commitment to addressing climate change, including reducing emissions, enhancing mitigation and adaptation ... and more importantly, raising ambitions in climate financing," said Shoukry. The ability of the international community to move forward and implement the Paris Agreement goals, especially limiting the rise in global temperature, is closely linked to the concrete outcomes of the Sharm El-Sheikh conference, he said, adding that Egypt will spare no effort in providing all favorable conditions to achieve such outcomes. Shoukry also called for a renewed commitment to multilateralism. "The current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a very delicate historical moment as we are witnessing a myriad of intertwined crises of enormous complexity. This requires concerted and serious action, and a renewed commitment to multiculturalism, first and foremost, under the umbrella of the United Nations," he said. Enditem \</doc>

chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-11-14 16:51 A large number of posts on social media criticized delegates of hypocrisy for flying to Egypt by private jet to attend the COP27 , British paper Daily Mail has reported. Reports and posts included diverse estimates for the number of such planes bringing delegates to the COP27 , the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the report said. Egyptian sources confirmed claims that about 400 private jets landed during the conference, it added. The AFP on Thursday quoted an unnamed source close to the Egyptian aviation authorities as saying more than 400 private jets landed in the past few days in Egypt. A private jet can emit 2 tons of carbon dioxide per hour and pollutes five to 14 times more per passenger than a commercial aircraft, according to the European clean transport campaign group Transport and Environment, the report said. An online emissions calculator provided by the International Civil Aviation Organization indicates that a passenger on a commercial flight from London to Sharm El-Sheikh in premium class would produce about half a ton of carbon dioxide, it added. Scientists say climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is exacerbating devastating disasters such as floods, heatwaves and droughts, which could intensify in the decades to come if emissions are not cut, according to the report. \</doc>

CAIRO, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has set out a vision for the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which aims to make it an "implementation COP" by pushing for actions across prior agreements through all areas of climate change needs, according to a press release by Egypt's COP27 Presidency. "We must accelerate climate action on all fronts including mitigation, adaptation and finance in addition to adopting more ambitious mitigation measures to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach," Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President-Designate Sameh Shoukry was quoted as saying in the Wednesday press release. Egypt will host COP27 from Nov. 7 to 18 in its Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh. There is "no room for delay in the fulfillment of climate pledges or backtracking on hard earned gains in the global fight against climate change," Shoukry was quoted as saying. "We must work together for implementation. We need to act, and act now, to save lives and livelihoods," Shoukry added. Wael Aboulmagd, special representative of the COP27 president, told a COP27 press briefing that 5 million people die every year because of temperature extremes and 4 percent of global economic output could be lost by 2050 because of climate change, according to the press release. Over the past few years, Egypt has been focusing on green economy by building solar energy plants, promoting eco-friendly industries such as waste recycling, boosting use of natural gas-powered vehicles, working to plant 100 million trees nationwide, and raising popular awareness of protecting the environment.

CAIRO, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) will present public health priorities in light of sustainable development plans, a UN envoy announced on Tuesday. "It is important to connect the priorities of climate action with the world's challenges related to health," said Mahmoud Mohieldin, UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for Egypt, in a press release. Mohieldin, who also serves as UN special envoy on financing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, made the appeal during the 69th session of the World Health Organization Conference on the Eastern Mediterranean held in Cairo late Monday. Contributing about 4.4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, the health sector should take environmental considerations into account, Mohieldin said. "Harmful emissions are increasing by about 14 percent, a marked deviation from the target of reducing it to no less than 45 percent by 2030 by international pledges," he added. COP27 , which is scheduled for Nov. 6-18 in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh, will focus on ensuring the implementation of the 2030 UN Agenda and reducing the public health consequence of high temperatures, harmful emissions and malnutrition, said Mohieldin. Highlighting the significance to provide the necessary climate finance, he said "80 percent of climate finance comes from the public budgets of countries." He added in previous climate summits developed countries committed to mobilizing 100 billion U.S. dollars annually by 2020 to address the pressing need of developing countries, had this amount been fulfilled, it only represents three percent of these countries' needs. Encouraging and activating innovative financial instruments and benefiting from the financial markets concerned with sustainable green finance are tools to carry out climate change projects, he added.

From the conflict in Ukraine to the midterm elections in the United States, there are plenty of ongoing and impending events to distract countries and their leaders from this year's United Nations climate change conference now in session in Egypt. But the evidence of climate change's devastating impacts is accumulating, and without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors and regions, it will be impossible to keep warming below 2 C, never mind the hoped-for 1.5 C. As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned nations at the opening of the meeting, known as COP 27 , we are "on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator". Solidarity and collective action are pressing imperatives. The highway to hell is littered with broken promises and these have become outstanding obstacles to a collective response to climate change. There have been too many hope-raising pledges made in the past by the developed countries that have not been met, not least because they are not the countries most affected by climate change. As the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change notes in a summary for policymakers, across sectors and regions, it is the most vulnerable people and ecosystems that are bearing the brunt of climate change, with Small Island States disproportionately affected the most. It is thus inspiring to learn that international leaders agreed on the first day of the meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh to put loss and damage on the agenda. This is a historic breakthrough for global climate negotiations, which may pave the way for badly needed compromises between major contributors to climate change and its most vulnerable victims, which will in turn facilitate joint actions. An outstanding obstacle to a collective response to climate change has been the dispute over loss and damage, a divisive topic since it was first raised by a small group of island nations in 1991. As Seychelles President Wavel John Charles Ramkalawan said, "Our contribution to the destruction of the planet is minimal. Yet we suffer the most." A dozen years back, the richest, most polluting countries recognized they had an obligation to compensate. Developed countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States committed to contributing $100 billion a year by 2020 (and through 2025) to poor countries for their mitigation and adaptation projects. Last year at COP 26 in Glasgow, the developed countries agreed to at least double funding for adoption by 2025 from 2019 levels, to around $40 billion per year. None of these goals has been met. The wealthy countries have been dragging their feet on honoring their promises to help developing countries mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to new energy sources, technologically and financially. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was correct in saying, "The question today is: can we summon the collective will to deliver on those promises?" A meaningful collective response is imperative. The developed nations can no longer just pay lip service to the issue. \~ \</doc>

By WANG QINGYUN | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-11-21 21:02 China made important contributions to the Sharm el-Sheikh Climate Change Conference and will continue to promote a fair and reasonable global climate governing system that features win-win cooperation, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday. COP27 , which concluded in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday, reached a package of relatively balanced outcomes and gave out positive signals of multilateralism and cooperation to tackle climate change, Mao said. The outcomes reflect the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, Mao said, adding the conference responded effectively to developing countries' urgent needs by deciding to set up a loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries. China, which attached great importance to the conference, did all it could to support Egypt in hosting it, Mao said. The Chinese delegation participated in talks on about 100 issues, coordinated closely with all other parties and upheld firmly the shared interests of developing countries, the spokeswoman said, adding China will continue to take part actively in global governance to tackle climate change. On the other hand, developed countries again failed at the conference to deliver on the goal of mobilizing $100 billion every year to help developing countries tackle climate change by 2020, and there is not yet a clear roadmap for doubling the adaptation fund, Mao pointed out. "This does not help in building trust between the South and the North," Mao said. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- A new initiative to expand Africa's participation in voluntary carbon markets was launched at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change being held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh on Tuesday. Led by a 13-member steering committee of African leaders, CEOs, and carbon credit experts, the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) was launched to support the growth of carbon credits production, create jobs and protect biodiversity in Africa, according to a press release by the initiative. ACMI announced a bold ambition for the continent to reach 300 million credits offered annually by 2030. This level of supplies would unlock 6 billion U.S. dollars in income and support 30 million jobs, it added. By 2050, the statement said, ACMI is targeting over 1.5 billion credits annually in Africa, leveraging over 120 billion U.S. dollars and supporting over 110 million jobs. A number of African nations including Kenya, Malawi, Gabon, Nigeria and Togo shared their commitments to collaborating with ACMI to scale up carbon credit production via voluntary carbon market activation plans.

LUSAKA, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government on Thursday called for closer collaboration among African countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in advancing mutual interests ahead of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) slated for Egypt in November this year. The Minister of Green Economy and Environment Collins Nzovu said as chair of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN), Zambia was committed to ensuring Africa and the LDC Group work closely and advance their interests at the UNFCCC ( COP 27 ). He said the African Group has historically worked with the LDC Group in advancing mutual interests in the negotiation process, noting that Zambia wanted to build on the long-standing tradition of strengthening the collaboration. "I look forward to this meeting taking stock of the progress made to date in the international climate change negotiations, fully discuss key issues and challenges and the need to develop a plan of action with agreed priorities and positions for COP 27 ," he said in a release. He further called on developed countries to take leadership and remain committed to 45 percent emissions reductions by 2030 in order to ensure that the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal was kept alive regardless of the current geopolitical situation that the world faces. The UNFCCC ( COP 27 ) will be held from Nov. 6 to 18 in Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt. It was originally expected to take place in November 2021 but was rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Editor's Note: Young Chinese people in the new era are confident, aspirational, and responsible. With a global vision, they stand at the forefront of the times ready to fully commit to a more global outlook. Chinese people accept and quickly respond to the world's trending schools of thought. Some members of China's Generation Z have begun to practice the tenets of their "global citizen" identity and use their actions to influence the society. The Global Times has therefore launched a series of introductory stories on China's Gen Zers who are interested in different global topics, such as environmental protection, equality, and employment issues, and invites them to share their stories, sentiments and ideas. Recently, we spoke with two excellent Chinese students who care about climate change and just returned from the recently concluded 27th session of the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC ( COP27 ) in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. They, representing the young generation, made their voices heard while gaining experience and honing their leadership skills by engaging with their communities and driving climate actions. Wang Xinlu at the COP27 Photo: Courtesy of Wang In recent years, Wang Xinlu has voyaged on the Jinsha River to collect water samples and guage water quality. Wang is a PhD student studying Hydro-environmental Engineering at Tsinghua University. Her research focuses on exploring hydro-eco mechanisms and the impact of large-scale hydropower construction on the Yangtze River of China. "River ecological protection and climate change are also closely related, especially when we see the impact of the current climate extremes, many of which, in fact, are caused by climate change," Wang told the Global Times. She is passionate about sustainable development, climate action, international governance, and collaborative solutions to these issues. With her knowledge in hydrology and ecology, she focuses on extreme hydrological events in terms of climate change and hopes to find better solutions. This month, Wang went to Egypt as part of the COP27 Youth Delegates with the Global Alliance of Universities on Climate (GAUC) China delegation, which is initiated by top universities in the world including Tsinghua, aiming to advance climate change solutions through research, education, and public outreach. There, Wang and her peers made their voices heard and gained vital experience which will help them in the future deal with climate issues.\~ Voices for the new generation Majored in water conservancy, Wang had the opportunity to visit several hydropower stations at home and abroad and to learn about how these constructions are combined with local ecosystems.\~ "The hydropower projects proposed and constructed under Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) are technologically sound," she said. "It is also an important part of the the topic of adaptation in confronting climate change, that is to financially and technologically aid less-developed countries, to help them counter the effects of climate disasters," she explained. In 2019 she completed a climate change-related internship and this year, she started a climate change course at GAUC, which also affored her the opportunity to attend the COP27 . At the aspirational event, the youth ambassadors from different countries released an open letter directed to world leaders at the "Climate x" event in the China Pavilion on November 9.\~ Global climate leaders including Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy on climate change, also attended the event. "Now is the time to encourage more young people to join this movement and put forward innovative solutions," he said at the event.\~ Wang and her peers also presented the letter to Inger Andersen, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme.\~ "I feel lucky to be able to show our young people's actions and commitment to world leaders with this letter," she said. "Our young people are very positive and willing to promote the awareness on climate change. I hope that other attendees of the COP27 were able to feel the passion of young people," she said. The Global Alliance of Universities on Climate (GAUC) youth delegation at the COP27 on November 7, 2022 Photo: Courtesy of GAUC Today, the youth are increasingly aware that the climate crisis presents challenges and risks, and that addressing climate change presents opportunities for sustainable development, according to the UN. "In ongoing negotiations, each country just seeks its own benefit with numerous clashes. But a variety of interests and goals need to be dealt together to solve climate issues," Wang said. "Young people will become the decision makers on climate change issues in the future. The COP27 and organizations like GAUC have provided us with an opportunity to build up connections and mutual trust," she said. Seeing improvements Wang was born in Weihai, East China's Shandong Province, which is a coastal city. "I feel that I have a natural intimacy with the ocean, so I have paid extra attention to the marine environment since I was a child, especially after I went to college. This is also one of the reasons that led me to focus more on climate change," she said. When Wang first started at Tsinghua in 2016, it was a time when northern China was impacted by severe smog. "In winter, we often needed to wear face masks," she said. "But after some years, air quality in Beijing has greatly improved. It means if we acted, there would be changes, even in bigger issues such as the climate change," she said. In Wang's opinion, in dealing with environment and climate issues, China is "more inclined to action." "China formulates climate policies based on its own national conditions and has always promoted the achievement of such goals," she said. Thanks to China's persistent efforts to combat all types of pollution, clear waters and blue skies are becoming more common across the country. Air quality has improved notably, with the average concentration of PM2.5 hazardous airborne particles decreasing from 46 micrograms per cubic meter in 2015 to 30 micrograms per cubic meter in 2021, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Xinhua News Agency reported in September. \</doc>

The Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China holds a monthly press conference on October 27, 2022 photo: Shan Jie/GT China has urged the COP27 to effectively respond to the concerns expressed by developing countries and pay special attention to their demands in the global process of tackling climate change, while expressing hope that the event will focus on realizing existing goals, instead of eagerly coming up with new ones. "China supports Egypt in hosting a successful COP27 . We look forward to working with all parties to build COP27 into a conference in the theme of 'implementation' and the highlights of adaptation and funding, which are of the greatest concern to developing countries," Li Gao, general director of the Department of Climate Change with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) of China, said at a Thursday press conference. The COP27 , or the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18. Some members of the Chinese delegation will depart for Egypt this coming weekend, the Global Times learned from the MEE. Li urged all parties to fully and accurately implement the goals and principles of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, especially the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, adhere to the global temperature control goal of "within 2 C and strive for 1.5 C," and jointly build a fair, and reasonable cooperation. COP27 should encourage all parties to transform the already proposed nationally determined contribution goals into effective policies, solid actions, and specific projects, rather than rushing to propose new goals, Li said.\~ "We believe that empty slogans are not ambitions, and real ambitions can only be demonstrated by implementations," he said. In terms of the topic of adaption, Li said that China supports UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres' initiative on establishing a global early warning system. Developed countries should increase financial support for adaptation efforts in developing countries, and propose a roadmap for doubling adaptation funds. In 2009, wealthy countries pledged $100 billion a year to help lower-income nations by 2020 at COP15 in Copenhagen. However, they still have not made good on the pledge.\~ "This has not only seriously affected and hindered the development of climate action in developing countries, but has also seriously damaged mutual political trust between developed and developing countries," Li said. "We urge developed countries to fulfill their annual funding commitments of $100 billion as soon as possible, instead of just submitting a report during COP27 that makes excuses for the delay in fulfilling commitments." "Climate change is related to the future of mankind, and only the concerted efforts of all parties can effectively deal with it. We must uphold true multilateralism, reject any unilateral measures and the politicization of climate issues, and oppose any kind of decoupling or de-globalization," Li reaffirmed. On Thursday, the MEE published the annual report on China's policies and actions in tackling climate change.\~ According to the report, compared with 2005, CO2 emissions per unit of GDP had dropped 50.8 percent by 2021 in China, and non-fossil fuel energy accounted for 16.6 percent of primary energy in 2021. The total installed capacity of wind and solar power has reached 635 million kilowatts, coal consumption per unit of GDP has been significantly reduced, and forest coverage and stock volume have achieved growth for 30 consecutive years.\~ The national carbon emission trading market has been in operation for a year and has seen a carbon emission allowances trade of 194 million tons. China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. To achieve these goals, China has created short- and long-term strategies and has seen achievements. According to the report, for instance, the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games were the world's first "carbon neutral" Winter Olympics, as all venues met green building standards, and 100 percent of conventional energy in the event used green electricity. \</doc>

By DENG YANTING | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-29 07:41 Africa's ability to manage climate challenges will remain weak unless the funding gap is addressed Despite Africa, the continent with the most developing countries, contributing the least to global warming - accounting for less than 4 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions - nearly all countries across the continent disproportionately face exponential secondary and derivative disasters caused by frequent natural catastrophes resulted from climate change. This severely impacts their economy, stability and peoples' livelihoods, while challenging the continent's modest development gains and pushing people back into extreme poverty. Africa is the most vulnerable continent on the "highway to climate hell" under all climate scenarios above 1.5 degrees Celsius, since most African countries are yet to find a credible pathway to convert their commitments under Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2015 (COP 15) into a climate-resilient and smart growth dynamic. Africa's trauma and developed countries' sluggish delivery of their promises in terms of climate financing, technology transfer and capacity building highlight the urgent need to further improve the West-proposed climate governance paradigm so there is more consideration for the developing world, including Africa. The push for more finance to support Africa's climate change mitigation through natural disaster prevention and relief rather than carbon emissions reduction is the pressing focus of the continent's engagement in the global climate arena. While the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, discussed projected CO2 emissions of 37.5 billion tonnes this year, a new record, the continent closest to carbon neutrality is actually paying the most miserable price for the world's CO2 reduction plan being well behind schedule. Even in 2022, the harsh drought in the Horn of Africa, the deadly Cyclone Ana in Malawi and the devastating floods in Nigeria and South Africa, displaced millions of people and caused social unrest, further highlighting the correlation between global warming and the stability deficit which was already exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and soaring food prices. A research report recently published by the UK relief agency Christian Aid indicates that with eight of the 10 most vulnerable countries being in Africa, by 2050 the continent may lose 20 percent of its GDP to devastation caused by extreme weather. Although Africa has emphasized that the historical polluters of the developed world should pay the debt of this huge imposed damage and it has called on the West to provide a 10-fold increase in climate financing, according to the US think tank Climate Policy Initiative, only $30 billion a year on average has actually been released to Africa over the past decade. Evidently, the prospect of Africa's ability to manage climate challenges will remain bleak unless the growing huge funding gap is properly tackled. Regarding climate change adaptation, synchronizing plans on energy structure transformation with efforts to overcome the power deficit through technological and talent support would be Africa's fulcrum. Except South Africa, which needs to decrease its existing large scale coal-powered electricity production, carbon peaking and carbon neutrality for most African countries with almost negligible carbon emissions call for the direct substitution of renewable energy for fossil fuels in their envisaged modernization blueprint. However, this will give rise to a paradox between the current and potential economic dividend of huge reserves of unexploited fossil fuels across the continent with African countries' urgent need to satisfy their peoples' power thirst. Taking Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, as an example, the soaring international energy price has brought it an additional $25 billion from its exports of crude oils in the first half of 2022, a year-on-year increase of 83 percent. Reducing the country's oil exports, which now account for 79 percent of the country's total exports, would mean eroding the Nigerian government's capability to modernize its national grid due to the shrinkage of its oil-based foreign exchange. Meanwhile, the prospect of filling the huge power gap is still bleak if the stable procurement of renewable energy is not feasible in the near future. A World Bank study shows that in 2022 the electricity access rate in Africa has been a meager 40 percent, which means more than 640 million Africans still live in darkness at night. Considering the rigid power demand brought by the world's highest population growth rate of 2.7 percent, Africa needs more international cooperation to embrace reliable renewable energy at competitive cost if the continent is to be persuaded to totally detach its energy security concerns from fossil fuels. A McKinsey report in 2015 showed that Africa possesses a potential renewable capacity of 10 TW, but data from the International Renewable Energy Agency indicate that as of 2022 only 26 GW renewable power capacity, or 0.2 percent of this energy endowment, has been exploited in the past decade. Aside from solar photovoltaic, wind and hydro power, the cost competitiveness of geothermal, bio-energy, and tidal-power is still weak due to insufficient technology transfer and capacity building. By making full use of the home advantage, the African Group of Negotiators and Draft Africa Climate Change Strategy 2020-2030 are striving to make a breakthrough at the COP 27 , while some promising achievements such as the launch of the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative have been made. The African Union's accession to the G20 would be another step forward for Africa to engage in global climate governance alongside multilateral cooperation led by the United Nations. By consolidating the AU's representation of Africa's common position, the continent as a whole will have direct contact with the main stakeholders of the global climate agenda, including the traditional carbon emitters of the West, emerging economies with the fastest growing carbon contribution such as India, and countries with successful implementation of carbon reduction such as China, and more room to let Africa's voice be heard. With this new framework, Africa is expected to gradually evolve from being a victim of climate change to a promoter and beneficiary of global climate justice.

Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt  An international climate summit starting in several days in Egypt will test the resolve of nations to combat global warming, even as many of the biggest players are distracted by urgent crises ranging from conflict in Europe to rampant consumer inflation. More than 30,000 delegates, including representatives from some 200 countries, will gather in the seaside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh to hash out details on how to slow climate change and help those already feeling its impacts. But with nations dealing with the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, along with soaring food and fuel prices and stuttering economic growth, questions loom over whether they will act quickly and ambitiously enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. A United Nations report released last week showed most countries are lagging on their existing commitments to cut carbon output, with global greenhouse gas emissions on track to rise 10.6 percent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. Scientists said emissions must drop 43 percent by that time to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures  the threshold above which climate change risks spinning out of control. COP 27 talks have submitted new or updated emissions-cutting plans since last year's UN climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, even though all had committed to doing so, according to the UN climate agency. The two-week UN negotiations in Egypt follow a year of wild weather disruptions around the world, as global warming takes a toll from the devastating floods in Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria, to heat waves in the Arctic and across Europe and record-setting droughts in the US West and France. The talks are likely to address how these and other nations affected by climate change could be compensated by rich countries believed to have caused it.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from nearly 50 countries and organizations on Monday launched the International Drought Resilience Alliance here at the ongoing COP27 to help countries to be better prepared for future droughts. Initiated by Senegal and Spain, the alliance is established as a specific solution for the United Nations (UN) to the impacts of climate change, according to a statement issued by the Alliance. "The mission of the alliance is to give political impetus to make the land's resilience to drought and climate change," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Senegal's President Macky Sall jointly declared on Monday. "Drought is a natural hazard but does not have to lead to human disaster. The solutions are available, and we can create a drought-resilient world by increasing our ambition, harnessing the political will, and joining forces to act together," said Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The Alliance will be bolstered by new political commitments, including a 5-million-euros (5.01 million U.S. dollars) seed fund announced by Spain, to support the work of the Alliance and catalyze a process to mobilize more resources for this agenda, the statement said. The Alliance calls on leaders to make drought resilience a priority in national development and cooperation, including deepening the engagement of stakeholders, such as the private sector. Among the key objectives of the Alliance is promoting the consolidation of regional initiatives, to fast-track sharing of innovation, technology transfer, and mobilization of resources, the statement added. The Alliance will also collaborate with other platforms, including the initiative launched by the UN secretary-general and the World Meteorological Organization to achieve universal coverage of early warning systems and regional initiatives to reap the maximum benefits of working together on drought resilience.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Belgium jointly launched a global renewable hydrogen forum here on Tuesday, as the world is seeking to find environmentally friendly solutions to energy problems, the Egyptian Presidency said in a statement. "In partnership with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, I am pleased to announce today the launch of the Global Renewable Hydrogen Forum, which aims at establishing a permanent platform for dialogue between hydrogen-producing countries and hydrogen-consuming countries and the private sector, organizations and financial institutions operating in this field," the statement quoted Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi as saying. Sisi made the remarks in a speech during a round table discussion on green hydrogen at the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. Egypt and Belgium have worked on the initiative over the past months in coordination with a number of partners, Sisi noted. Green hydrogen is one of the most prominent solutions to energy problems in terms of making a shift to green economy in the coming years, Sisi said, adding "it represents a real opportunity for economic development that is compatible with efforts to confront climate change and the Paris Agreement goals." Sisi pointed out that many countries have already begun to take serious steps in this direction, as a main source of energy, either through local production, import, or both. Sisi also announced the launch of the first phase of an Egyptian-Norwegian green hydrogen plant with an electrolyser capacity of 100 megawatts for producing hydrogen in Egypt's Ain Sokhna on the Red Sea coast.

NAIROBI, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- The rise in multiple extreme weather events in Africa calls for a coordinated approach for evidence-based negotiations at the COP27 in Egypt, a climate negotiator said on Wednesday. George Wamukoya, the team leader of the African Group of Negotiators Expert Support (AGNES), said in a statement released in Nairobi, Kenya's capital, there has been a lack of coordination between African policymakers, scientists, and negotiators to provide evidence on the effects of global warming on the continent. "In all the positions that Africa takes, negotiators must do technical or background papers to generate evidence guiding that position," Wamukoya, an experienced lead coordinator on agriculture said. "Ahead of the climate change conference, we have convened pre-meetings where scientists and negotiators have discussed the agenda and identified areas that require evidence. These scientists have helped negotiators in packaging a common African position that is informed by science," he added. On Tuesday, Guleid Artan, the Director of the IGAD's Climate Prediction and Applications Center (ICPAC), said Africa would at the meeting focus on getting adaptation funds from countries that have created the mess for the continent. Africa is among the continents that have suffered the worst effects of the climate crisis, with countries like Nigeria and South Africa enduring floods as drought ravages the Horn of Africa. The adverse impacts of the climate crisis have led to increased food insecurity, water scarcity, reduced crop yields and disruption of food systems have taken a toll on African households and the continent's economic growth. "Science tells us that Africa is the most vulnerable continent yet it has contributed the least in terms of emissions. Africa's voice in the global climate negotiations, therefore, becomes critical," stated Wamukoya. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the cost of adapting to climate change shocks across Africa is estimated to rise to 50 billion U.S. dollars by 2050 if the global temperature increase remains within 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels. This is despite the continent accounting for less than 4 percent of global emissions. "Delivering a good outcome at COP27 for Africa is, therefore, an imperative. AGNES is ready to make a case for adaptation, doubling adaptation finance, creating greater prominence for loss and damage discussions, raising mitigation ambition, and institutionalizing agriculture in the UNFCCC process. We must deliver on agriculture," said Wamukoya. The Conference of the Parties 27 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will kick off in Egypt on Nov. 6. Enditem \</doc>

GENEVA, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Climate change is dramatically affecting vulnerable people across the globe, particularly those who live in conflict situations or do not have sufficient access to basic health care, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned on Friday. In a joint statement issued with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), ICRC said that of the 25 countries most vulnerable to climate change, the majority are also experiencing armed conflict and a lack of access to basic healthcare. "When climate shocks occur in countries with limited food, water and economic resources, people's lives, health, and livelihoods are threatened," the statement said. Somalia has experienced an erratic cycle of droughts and floods in recent years, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation due to three decades of armed conflict. Humanitarian organizations have also been responding to flooding in South Sudan and across the Sahel, devastating cyclones in Madagascar and Mozambique, and severe drought in the Horn of Africa, the statement said. The climate crisis is also worsening health and humanitarian crises, it added. "As humanitarians, we are alarmed by the current reality and projections for the future. We see droughts, floods, insect plagues and changing rainfall patterns which can all jeopardize food production and people's means of survival. We see more extreme and more powerful weather events such as cyclones which destroy essential health infrastructure. We see changing patterns of deadly diseases such as malaria, dengue and cholera," the statement said. In a world that has already warmed 1.2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, additional warming will lead to disastrous consequences unless urgent and ambitious mitigation measures are taken, it added. Adequate support must be mobilized for the most severely affected countries, so they can adapt to growing climate risks. Representatives from across the world will gather in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm el-Sheikh to attend the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) from Nov. 6-18. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called for multilateralism and diplomacy to make the COP27 a "turning point for hope." Enditem \</doc>

by Mahmoud Fouly NEW ALAMEIN, Egypt, July 24 (Xinhua) -- In an industrial district close to Egypt's northern coast, colored lights and nine massive luminous artworks made of factory waste materials by seven recycling artists brightened the night. The artworks, mostly made of scraps of iron, plastic and wood, are installed and exhibited at the first edition of the Alamein Art Festival, which is being held at an industrial park of Industrial Development Group (IDG) in the Mediterranean resort city of New Alamein and organized by Art D'Egypte, an Egyptian platform for art and heritage. The one-month festival, which kicked off on July 21, seeks to promote the concept of environmental sustainability through art, said Nadine Abdel-Ghaffar, founder of Art D'Egypte and chief organizer of the festival. "Through their eco-friendly art installations, Egyptian contemporary artists call on people to be aware of conserving the environment and the climate," she told Xinhua, adding the event could be seen as a prelude to the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) that will be held in Egypt in November. One of the artworks on display features two large leaves standing side by side inside two opposing metal frames, resembling two pages of an open book. One of the two leaves has a mauve frame and is painted in red, while the other has a red frame and is painted in mauve. "I connected the two panels of a scrap iron fence to form a shape of a page, sketched a shape of a leaf inside each page and chopped off the surplus materials," veteran Egyptian sculptor Omar Tossoun explained how he created his sculpture "A Leaf." "It sends a message to factories that the materials they deem scraps can be used for good purposes by artists in creating artworks, which can make a place more beautiful," said Tossoun. In the center of the open-air exhibition area, visitors' attention is drawn to a colorful six-meter-tall shining object that resembles a jellyfish. It took a month for Marwa Magdy, an artist and assistant professor at the Faculty of Art Education, Helwan University, to finish the artwork called "Jellyfish," which took half a tonne of wasted iron. "I use a jellyfish as a symbol for marine life and other organisms living in oceans, as they suffer a lot from environmental pollution. I think we need to recycle all waste in an eco-friendly way and be aware of other organisms' living conditions," Magdy told Xinhua. The waste materials for the artworks of Magdy and other artists were collected by them during trips to several factories one month before the opening of the festival. The trips were organized by industrial developer IDG. Visitors are impressed by the concept of recycling waste materials into artworks. "If you look around, the artists have really done very nice works. It is such a brilliant idea to use something that should be discarded and make it into a beautiful piece of art," said Yehia Hamad, one of the visitors. Enditem \</doc>

COPENHAGEN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- As the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) reels from the effects of a prolonged heatwave responsible for a series of ferocious wildfires and escalating record-breaking high temperatures, regional governments have been urged by the WHO to implement the Paris climate agreement, whose position has been reinforced "as a health treaty" by the COP26 ( United Nations Climate Change Conference ) Health Programme. "Governments need to demonstrate political will and genuine leadership in implementing the global Paris Agreement on climate change, with collaboration replacing division and empty rhetoric," WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement on Friday. According to Kluge, 1,700 people have died as a result of the current heatwave in Spain and Portugal, and wildfires have spread from southern Europe to as far north as Scandinavia. This week, with the "scorching summer season barely halfway done," fires in London have destroyed 41 homes. "Ultimately, this week's events point yet again to the desperate need for pan-European action to effectively tackle climate change --the overarching crisis of our time that is threatening both individual health and the very existence of humanity," he said. In reaction to the extreme effects of the current heatwave, the WHO has issued guidance support for national and local authorities "to save lives and strengthen the resilience of communities and people to cope during extreme heat." The WHO guidance recommended basic steps that everyone should take to safeguard themselves and their loved ones from the heat, including keeping out of the heat as much as possible during the night as well; avoiding strenuous physical activity and ensuring children and animals are not left in parked vehicles; and seeking medical advice if one is suffering from a chronic condition or taking multiple medications. Furthermore, Kluge reiterated the United Nations Climate Change Conference 's call for "health systems to assume their share of the responsibility to step up their resilience to, and fight against, climate change," arguing that coordinated action on multiple fronts will "strengthen environmental health and reverse the ravages of climate change."

China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua addresses the Climate Implementation Summit at the COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, November 8, 2022. Photo: Xinhua While including climate compensation into the formal agenda of COP27 for the first time at global climate talks is considered a breakthrough, China's special envoy for climate change said Wednesday that China strongly supports claims from developing countries, especially the most vulnerable countries, for claiming loss and damage compensation. However, setting up a mechanism is a priority, which should follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.\~ Despite the progress, some countries have lobbed accusations at each other, urging developing countries such as China and India to do more in compensating others. During a press conference on Wednesday, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua said the biggest difference is that some countries support the amounts of compensation being suggested, but others are against it. They also disagree on how the loss and damage compensation should be funded.\~\~ "We hope we can find a good result through negotiations at this dialogue," Xie said.\~ As COP27 goes into its third day, the focus is on how developing countries can collaborate to secure more money to help their energy transitions. There are rising calls to fund more support for countries that have and will face damages from climate-fueled natural disasters, particularly since 2022 saw disastrous floods, heatwaves and hurricanes sweep across the world, in both developed and developing nations, bringing home the severity of the climate crisis to the public.\~ Developing and emerging countries, excluding China, need investments well beyond $2 trillion annually by 2030 if the world is to stop the global warming, according to media reports, citing a recent UN-backed report.\~ A trillion dollars should come from rich countries, investors and multilateral development banks, Al Jazeera reported on Wednesday. And the rest of the money - about $1.4 trillion - must originate domestically from private and public sources.\~ No matter how the external environment changes, China's firm determination and position to implement its goals to peak carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality, and to actively participate in global climate governance will never change, Xie said in an address on Tuesday. China's commitment\~ As the world's second-largest economy and the biggest developing country, China has made solemn promises on carbon emission reduction goals and has been steadily advancing those goals by achieving remarkable progress in renewable energy, which Western countries cannot fault, experts said.\~ However, some Western countries continue pressuring developing countries like China to pay more toward the climate bill, and they will use the issue to create discord between China and other developing countries in a bid to evade their responsibilities and create more division in the international community, experts noted.\~ China over-fulfilled on its commitments for emissions reductions before 2020, but developed countries have not achieved their emissions reductions of 25- 40 percent as required according to commitments to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Xie said.\~ In terms of finance, developed countries pledged in 2009 in Copenhagen to provide $100 billion in climate finance every year, but now 13 years have passed, and we have not seen that money on the table, Xie said. "In total, they have an outstanding debt of a $260 billion. I think this year we should first discuss how to make sure that $100 billion finance is on the table and then also to have clear timetables and road maps for that $260 billion to be paid."\~ Speaking to reporters at the COP27 venue in Sharm El-Sheik, Egypt, on Tuesday evening, Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, who is also the chair for Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), said that India and China must pay climate compensation alongside other major polluters, according to media reports.\~ To date, climate vulnerable countries have called on historical emitters like the US, UK and the EU to pay climate reparations.\~ Global climate change action faces severe challenges and developing countries are the biggest victims of climate change, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a routine press on Wednesday in Beijing.\~ China supports COP27 to make reasonable arrangements on the issue of loss and damage, which is of great concern to developing countries.\~ We urge developed countries to seriously fulfill their historical responsibilities and international obligations, especially fulfill their promise of providing $100 billion in climate finance as soon as possible and draw a road map for doubling the adaptation finance, the spokesperson said.\~ From 2012 to 2021, China recorded an average annual growth of 3 percent energy consumption to achieve an average of 6.6 percent of GDP growth, while carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP dropped about 34.4 percent and its energy intensity fell by 26.4 percent, achieving a cumulative saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal, Zhao said.\~ Li Zhiqing, a professor in environmental economics and Chinese Economy at Fudan University, told the Global Times that while China is a major emitter of greenhouse gases, some of this can be attributed to other nations outsourcing their pollution to the country, due to China's role as an important goods manufacturer for the world.\~\~ To evaluate whether China has done enough good or needs to step up efforts, it should fully consider China's stage of development phase and its determination in investing in greening the economy, Li said. "Our analysis showed that we need to invest about 300 to 400 trillion yuan ($41.4 trillion to $55.2 trillion) to achieve our goals, which far exceeds annual GDP," he said.\~ While discussions about loss and damage payments are still ongoing, some Chinese experts attending the summit said it is more important to establish this payment mechanism rather than create new divisions among countries.\~ "Developed countries as major historical emitters of greenhouse gases need to take a leading role in providing this funding, and if developed countries have not made any payments but instead are focused on how much developing countries could offer, it will damage the mutual trust and pose obstacles for implementing the mechanism," Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser at Greenpeace China who is now attending the summit, told the Global Times.\~\~ China-US cooperation?\~ Although formal climate talks between China and the US have not resumed yet, Xie said at the Wednesday press conference that to ensure COP27 is a success, China has already started informal consultations with the US side.\~ Climate cooperation efforts between China and the US were singlehandedly bungled by Washington as it neglected Beijing's core interests and weaponized the climate issue to suppress China. Bilateral talks on the matter were suspended as a countermeasure by the Chinese side in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island of Taiwan in August. Xie emphasized that the responsibility for the suspension of the climate talks is with the US side. However, even during the suspension, he and John Kerry, US special climate envoy, "are old friends for 25 years. We never stopped our personal communication." "I don't agree with that saying that the door is now open waiting for China, but I think the door is actually closed by them," Xie said, adding that China's door is always open.\~\~ Some Chinese experts believe that resuming climate change talks between the world's biggest emitters will benefit the world, and the two sides could use the occasion for some informal communication at the technical level.\~ "I believe that COP27 has created an occasion for communication, as we hope to carry on some exchanges on climate change and advance cooperation for reciprocal benefits," Li Zhiqing said. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government attaches great importance to addressing climate change and has accelerated the implementation of its "dual carbon" goal in an all-round way, a Chinese delegate said Sunday. China implements a national strategy to actively address climate change, and unswervingly follows the path of ecological priority, green and low-carbon development, said Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which opened here Sunday. Zhao, also vice minister of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the remarks at a side event on the theme of "Pollution Reduction and Carbon Reduction Synergy: Achieving Win-Win for Environment, Climate and Economic Benefits" hosted by the ministry. China has accelerated the implementation of its "dual carbon" goal, which is to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, in an all-round way, including establishing a national agency to coordinate the top-level design of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality and issuing the guidelines on how to achieve the goal, Zhao said. Given that the emissions of environmental pollutants and carbon dioxide have the same root and process, China regards the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction as a starting point for promoting a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development, he said. "The road of quality development is to reduce carbon while reducing pollution, and reduce pollution while reducing carbon, so as to realize the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction, and achieve a win-win situation for environmental, climate, economic and social benefits," he said. China will speed up building a Chinese-style modernization "in which human and nature coexist in harmony," promote green production methods and lifestyles, and actively participate in global climate governance, said the vice minister. "Together with the international community, we will jointly implement policies and actions to achieve synergies in pollution reduction and carbon reduction, and work together to contribute Chinese wisdom and strength to building a clean and beautiful world," Zhao said. \</doc>

by Mahmoud Fouly CAIRO, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- A group of volunteers took a boat on the Nile River in the Egyptian capital Cairo, equipped with life jackets, rubber gloves and fishing nets with long handles, to pick up floating bottles and other plastic waste in an awareness campaign to mark World Cleanup Day. Around 60 volunteers joined the Nile cleanup activity launched by VeryNile, an Egyptian environmental initiative devoted to removing garbage and plastic waste from the longest river in the world and raising awareness about the importance of combating plastic pollution. World Cleanup Day is marked annually on the third Saturday of September, which falls this year on Sept. 17. "We pick up plastic waste from the Nile and its bank. We learn about cleaning the river and preserving the environment and also how plastic waste can be recycled into something useful," said Mohsen Ahmed, a university student of interior design, noting that he's been volunteering with VeryNile for about three years. Later in the afternoon, in another area on the riverbank, the VeryNile initiative built a pyramid of compressed plastic bottles as part of the campaign, to show people how big the problem of plastic pollution is. The pyramid is composed of more than 200,000 plastic bottles collected from the Nile. It is more than five meters high and weighs more than six tons, according to Alban de Menonville, co-founder and managing director of VeryNile. "VeryNile aims to tackle plastic pollution, to collect plastic waste from the Nile, and most importantly to raise awareness about how everyone should make small steps in his daily life to have less impact on the environment," VeryNile's managing director told Xinhua. The cleanup campaign comes about two months ahead of Egypt's hosting of the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) scheduled for November this year in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh. "Regarding the environment, it's a very special year for Egypt," said De Menonville, adding, "We want to show the world that when we have one resource as marvelous as the Nile, we in Egypt care about it and are trying to do our best to preserve it." After taking part in picking up plastic bottles from the river, Ala El-Khatib, one of the volunteers, said that she teaches her daughters to reduce using plastic bags and separate garbage at home into recyclable and non-recyclable. "Such activities shed more light on Egypt's environmental efforts, for most foreigners think Egypt is not that advanced in this area. So, these campaigns put us get attention and show how we're very much into sustainability and relevant initiatives," El-Khatib, who works for an international bank in Egypt, said. VeryNile and its cleanup campaigns are supported by the Egyptian Ministry of Environment. The ministry is supportive of such initiatives as the government can't work alone in raising public awareness and it encourages non-government organizations to assist, said Mona Kamal, an environmental expert and former director of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency at the Ministry of Environment. "Civil society organizations and youth initiatives are very influential because they work within their communities and launch awareness campaigns to make people understand the dangers of plastic waste and the importance of its recycling," she said. "The Nile River is our life. It is the lifeline of Egypt, and it's very important to protect it and preserve the quality of its water," the Egyptian ecologist told Xinhua. Enditem \</doc>

2022 SEP 02 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily China News -- Investigators discuss new findings in Climate Change. According to news reporting originating from Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "This paper proposes a novel integrated approach combining structural vector autoregression model, impulse response function with event study to examine the overconfidence and overreaction in China's carbon markets. The structural vector autoregression model and impulse response function are adopted to measure the overconfidence and the relationship between market return and trading volume." Financial support for this research came from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the University of Jinan, "The event study method is adopted to detect overreaction. We make the empirical test for the events of the United Nations Climate Change Conference and the proposal of China's carbon-neutral target. It is the first to explore the overconfidence and overreaction in China's carbon markets. The empirical results show that overconfidence exists in Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Fujian carbon markets, while Hubei carbon market has no overconfidence. Carbon market transactions are positively correlated with market returns. Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Chongqing carbon markets exist overreactions to the United Nations Climate Change Conference during 2014-2019." According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Chongqing carbon markets exist overreactions over China's carbon-neutral target."

WINDHOEK, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's Deputy Minister of Environment Forestry and Tourism, Heather Sibungo on Wednesday called on African countries to submit more ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as well as adopt ambitious deadlines for achieving net zero emissions. Speaking at a press briefing in Windhoek, Namibia, Sibungo said Namibia further calls on developed countries to provide the means of implementation and support for the effective implementation and enhancement of nationally determined contributions by developing countries. Namibia has revised its NDCs to address shortcomings identified as hampering effective implementation, she added. The semi-arid nation has revised and updated its NDCs and set a target for reforestation of about 20,000 hectares every year as of 2021 and at the same time to reduce the deforestation rate by 75 percent by 2030. Sibungo said a considerable amount of finance is urgently needed to support NDCs implementation to reach a net zero emissions trajectory as soon as possible. "Namibia urges the scaling up of the levels of climate finance, by providing concrete long-term targets for climate finance pathways and accounting methodologies for the collective goal by developed countries to reach 100 billion U.S. dollars a year from 2025 and beyond, while striking a balance of the allocation between adaptation, mitigation and loss and damage through a significant increase of grant-based support for adaptation," she said. The Conference of Parties or COP27 will be held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, from Nov. 6-18, 2022. At this year's conference, Namibia will be represented by a delegation from the government, private as well as the academic sector while the country will have a pavillon to accommodate all side events.

NAIROBI, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- African experts will at the forthcoming COP27 meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, push for prioritization of the continent's climate adaptation needs as losses and damages arising from the effects of climate change surge, they said on Tuesday. The climate experts from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) said in a statement released in Nairobi, Kenya's capital that developed countries emit most of the carbon dioxide that has fueled climate change and thus should fund mitigation measures in developing countries that are suffering the worst of effects because they are least prepared. Africa has in the past months suffered some of the severest effects of climate change including the flooding in Nigeria and the ongoing drought in the Horn of Africa. Guleid Artan, the director of the IGAD's Climate Prediction and Applications Center (ICPAC), said Africa wants the world to realize that it is bearing the brunt of climate change. "For us, it is a daily reality. Our continent has already warmed by at least 1.8 degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial times, and we are going from one extreme to another - from floods to droughts," he said. He observed that the focus currently has been on mitigating climate change, but this needs to change to adaptation, and countries that have created the mess for Africa must be part of the solution. "We had an agreement for 100 billion U.S. dollars to be given each year by developed nations to fund adaptation in developing countries, but we haven't seen much of it. I hope that following up from COP26 in Glasgow, a clear implementation plan can be agreed upon," he said. Philip Omondi, a climate change specialist at ICPAC, said on the question of loss and damages, the standards are not adapted to the African context. "We are so close to 2030. Even if we are given everything we are asking for, time is extremely short. I hope people come to COP with a clean heart and an open mind, but still, some key players are not putting all their cards on the table when it comes to loss and damages for Africa," Omondi said. Ahmed Amdihun, the Disaster Risk Management Programme Coordinator at ICPAC, said it is time to step up climate action. "The way we're handling climate change is, in my view, a bit fragmented. We must bring coherence between the different agreements and commitments that drive the climate agenda. I hope that the concept of anticipatory action can be mainstreamed in all commitments made at COP," he said. Linda Ogallo, a climate adaptation expert, at ICPAC, called on Africans to unite and define the climate problems and come up with solutions. "We always go to negotiations as a recipient, which makes it very difficult for us to set the terms. Africa is a huge market, it's the next wave of the future, there are a lot more opportunities that we don't see, but that we can seize if we can begin to articulate what we need and what we can offer one another." The 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) will be hosted by Egypt on Nov. 6-18 in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh.

United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres delivers a speech at the leaders summit of the COP27 climate conference at the Sharm El-Sheikh International Convention Center, in Egypt's resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, on November 7, 2022. Photo: AFP This year's COP27 Yet, as delegates officially entered two weeks of negotiations, experts warned on Monday that as global efforts to tackle global warming are needed more than ever at this "watershed moment" on climate action, politicization and pointing fingers at others at the summit will only damage trust between countries and block joint efforts. It is the US that has been taking politicization of the climate issue to a new level before the summit. With Washington sparing no effort to use this summit to shore up its leadership on climate issues, it is shifting blame onto China over climate issues and sowing discord between China and other developing countries. Observers said such behavior showed the US is jealous about China's popular role among developing countries in dealing with global warming and other climate issues.\~ Humanity is in "the fight of our lives" as climate change intensifies droughts, floods and heatwaves, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned world leaders on Monday, at talks in Egypt on curbing global warming. "Co-operate or perish," he told leaders at the COP27 summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik. "It is either a climate solidarity pact, or a collective suicide pact," media reported. Speaking at a side event at COP27 on Sunday, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua introduced China's progress on climate change in recent years. "China has actively implemented the Paris Agreement and further enhanced its nationally determined contribution, aiming to reach carbon peak and achieve carbon neutralization in a strong, orderly and effective manner. China has made great progress in this regard," said Xie.\~ "I hope the conference this time will meet the demands of developing countries as much as possible, as it is being held in Egypt, a developing nation," he said.\~ In addition to addressing unresolved issues from last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow, discussions about financing for and mechanisms to compensate the loss and damage caused by climate change are likely to be the main focuses at this year's COP summit, said Teng Fei, Deputy Director of the Energy Environment Economy Institute, Tsinghua University.\~ Delegates from nearly 200 countries kicked off the UN climate summit in Egypt on Sunday. Diplomats approved discussion on matters relating to "funding arrangements responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including a focus on addressing loss and damage." The agenda item was proposed by Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China during inter-sessional work at Bonn, Germany, in June this year. It envisages compensating developing nations for mounting damage linked to climate change, media reported.\~ The loss and damage agenda, which comes in response to developing countries' concerns, is likely to be established during the summit and become a political legacy of COP27 , Li Shuo, senior global policy advisor from Greenpeace East Asia, told the Global Times. However, he warned there will be an arduous journey before any final resolution is reached.\~ Convened after a year of devastating climate disasters and amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has triggered an energy crisis that has stoked inflation and threatened food security, Li warned that this year's conference will be closely tied up with geopolitical factors, posing a challenge for COP27 .\~ Speaking on the sidelines of the COP27 summit in Egypt, French President Emmanuel Macron said the US, China and other non-European rich nations must pay "their share" to help poorer nations deal with climate change, AFP reported. "We need the United States and China to step up," Macron said, noting that "Europeans are paying. We are the only ones paying. Pressure must be put on rich non-European countries, telling them, 'you have to pay your fair share'." Developed countries shoulder greater historical responsibility as they are overwhelmingly blamed for the catastrophe of global climate change, said Yang Fuqiang, a senior advisor on climate change and energy transition at the Energy Research Institute at Peking University. However, those countries are constantly making empty promises on financing developing countries in tackling global warming. "Those rich countries should first honor their own pledges before pointing fingers at others. They are not the only ones paying." At the top of Egypt's "to-do" list is the $100 billion a year developed countries promised way back in 2009 to help the developing world cut emissions and adapt to changing climate, BBC reported, adding that the money was supposed to be delivered in 2020 but now won't be available in full until next year - three years late. Experts said that handling global warming requires global cooperation, and pointing fingers and shifting blame will only harm the trust between countries, which will wreck global joint efforts in this field.\~ A political show The US, however, could not miss the opportunity to elevate its politicization of the issue to another level. Despite making little progress on curtailing emissions on its own soil, and US\~facing the possibility of returning to climate denialism if Republicans gain a sweeping victory in midterm elections, the Biden administration is reportedly going all out to assert itself as a global leader on climate action at COP27 .\~ Biden will arrive in Sharm El-Sheikh on November 11, shortly after the midterm elections. At the summit, the US seeks to challenge China's claim to global leadership and restore US credibility on climate action to counter China's courting of developing countries, US media outlet Politico reported. The US tactic of throwing mud at China includes shifting the blame onto China for halted climate talks and pressuring it to pay, analysts said.\~ Washington has always served as the bulwark of wealthy countries' resistance to making such payments, but before the summit, it suddenly changed its tune, saying it was open to paying reparations to countries suffering the ravages of climate change  but only if China ponies up, too, according to Politico in another report.\~ China should contribute its own funds to the cause, US Special Envoy John Kerry told reporters late last month, "especially if they think they're going to continue to go on to the next 30 years with increasing their emissions," Politico reported.\~ In fact, it reflected Washington's sour grapes mentality after seeing that China's role on climate action is winning acclaim among developing countries and is expanding cooperation with them, said Yang. He explained that the US has a desire to assume leadership in every field, thus it seeks to make China look bad and sow discord between China and other developing countries.\~ However, the US attempt to assume leadership on climate action is doomed to fail, as the world has witnessed how the country failed to make concrete progress in tackling global warming and how fragile its commitment is when faced with political changes at home, said experts. The US has inflicted more than $1.9 trillion in damage to other countries from the effects of its greenhouse gas emissions, the Guardian reported, citing a new analysis in July that provided the first measurement of nations' liability in stoking the climate crisis. The huge volume of planet-heating gases pumped out by the US, the largest historical emitter, has caused such harm to other, mostly poor, countries through heatwaves, crop failures and other consequences, that the US is responsible for $1.91 trillion in lost global income since 1990, the Guardian reported, citing the study.\~ In comparison with the US resistance to offering money to ease developing countries' suffering due to climate issues, China has offered 1.1 billion yuan ($150 million) on South-South cooperation in climate change, offered energy-saving and new energy products to nearly 40 countries and trained 1,500 professionals on climate change for 120 developing countries, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry, said last year.\~ Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing pointed out that US climate policy is again on the brink of seeing a flip-flop, as Republicans are positioned to regain control of the House of Representatives during midterm elections. The US pulled out of the Paris Agreement in 2017 under Republican president Donald Trump.\~ "A Republican-controlled House will greatly frustrate Biden's climate plans. Moreover, such a policy shift by the world's biggest emitter will deal a huge blow to global efforts to realize climate goals," said Li. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Actively adapting to climate change is a "realistic and urgent" task, said the head of the Chinese delegation to the UN climate conference on Thursday. Zhao Yingmin, also vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the remarks at a side event themed "China's Strategies and Actions on Climate Adaptation" held at the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. The minister said that mitigation and adaptation are the two major solutions to dealing with climate change, which should be given equal attention and neither of them should be neglected. Since global climate change has already taken place, effective adaptation actions can reduce its adverse effects and the risks faced by countries and regions so to protect socio-economic development as well as ecological and environmental security, Zhao said. In addition to promoting domestic adaptation, China is also actively carrying out South-South cooperation with developing countries on adapting to climate change, he said. "China has provided equipment to developing countries such as micro-satellites, meteorological mobile stations, and drones to support them in improving their ability in terms of natural disasters monitoring and early warning, as well as climate adaptation," Zhao noted. He urged the developed countries to fulfill their promise of providing 100 billion U.S. dollars to the developing countries in climate finance per year, and draw a road map for doubling the adaptation fund. On the issue of loss and damage caused by climate change, Zhao said that it is a major concern for developing countries. "China will also make positive efforts and contributions to promoting the progress of the negotiations on loss and damage," he said. Co-hosted by the Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Asian Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation, the side event also featured discussions on the policies and actions needed to be taken on adaptation to climate change, and sharing of experiences and cases.

A logo of the COP 27 summit.Photo: Xinhua The high level of cooperation between China and the Egyptian presidency of COP27 continues to become stronger, with far reaching results that will have a lasting positive impact for both peoples and the rest of the developing countries, Egyptian Ambassador to China Assem Hanafi told the Global Times in an exclusive interview. Ambassador Hanafi noted that China plays a pivotal role in combating climate change, and has supported various projects in line with the agenda. Xie Zhenhua, special representative for Chinese President Xi Jinping and China's special envoy for climate change, pledged at COP27 that China will gradually enhance its ability to control methane emissions. "China is willing to strengthen communications and exchanges with other countries for cooperation in policymaking, innovation, and technology application of methane emission control, and make joint contributions to tackling global climate change," Xie said. "There is a mutual vision between our two countries when it comes to the necessity of continuing the global effort to mitigate climate change impacts, and compensate the least developed countries for losses and damage, commending the level of cooperation on these issues at the bilateral and multilateral levels," Hanafi told the Global Times. "China and the group of the 77 play a vital role in putting forward the interests of the developing countries regarding climate change negotiations," he added. The 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) opened on November 6 and will last until Saturday, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in hopes to turn global climate finance pledges into action. At the opening ceremony, Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry stressed the need to confront the negative effects of climate change during the two-week conference, where more than 120 world leaders will seek possible solutions to climate change challenges, Xinhua reported. "Egypt believes that the climate crisis will aggravate social, economic and environmental threats. Hence, urgent and serious actions are needed to address the climate crisis and to strengthen the implementation of response with an aim to create a resilient planet," said Hanafi. According to him, Egypt's priority at COP27 is to "move from talks, negotiations and planning to actual implementation; it is the time for action on the ground and we need to move quickly towards full, timely, inclusive, and at-scale action on the ground." In addition to climate change, the world over the past year has also suffered from the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises including increasing inflation and frequent extreme weather events among others. All these crises call for joint global action, which make this year's COP27 crucial. "There is a necessity to harmonize global efforts, and turn our pledges and commitments to action, this is our highest priority. We shall all agree that in order to help developing countries address climate change, it is essential that we make significant progress on the crucial issue of climate finance while moving forward on all finance related items on the agenda," said the diplomat. "The importance of adequacy and predictability of climate finance is key to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, to this end there is a need for enhanced transparency of finance flows and facilitated access to meet the needs of developing countries especially Africa and least developed countries (LDCs)." The ambassador called on developed nations to "take urgent measures to help climate-vulnerable developing countries better cope with the impacts of climate change, such measures include financing targeted infrastructure projects and mechanisms to share risk through financial markets.' Economies of developing countries are now facing accelerating climate threats such as hurricanes in the Caribbean and Latin America and floods in Asia and Africa. The extreme weather has not only caused loss of property and precious human lives, but also heavy economic pressure on developing countries as media reports have shown. "Extreme weather events from heatwaves, floods, forest fires have become an everyday reality of our lives. The Global Goal on Adaptation was one of the significant outcomes of COP26, we must ensure that COP27 makes the crucially needed progress and urge all parties to demonstrate the necessary political will and assess our progress towards enhancing resilience and assist the most vulnerable communities. COP27 should witness enhanced global agenda for action on adaptation, confirming what we agreed on in Paris and further elaborated in Glasgow pact with regard to placing adaptation at the forefront of global action." China's climate envoy also noted in his address at COP27 that developing countries are the principal victims of climate change, with insufficient adaptation ability and external support in the face of global warming. "As a result, developing countries, in particular, need technical and financial support," Xie said. On the one hand China is urging developed countries to fulfill their pledges and "make the pie bigger" on climate finance, the envoy noted, on the other hand China is helping developing countries improve their climate adaptation capabilities through South-South cooperation, Xie said. China has so far signed 45 climate change cooperation documents with 38 developing countries, constructed three low-carbon demonstration areas, carried out 42 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, held 45 offline and seven online training courses in China, and trained about 2,000 officials and technicians in the field of climate change for more than 120 developing countries, according to reports. \</doc>

Illustration: Xia Qing/GT The recently concluded UN's Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) left no doubt that the Global South is rising to its full potential on the global stage, by shaping and leading discussions on the most pressing issue of climate change.\~ Held in Egypt, the conference was dubbed the African COP where developing countries, including those in Africa, South America and Asia, strongly influenced ongoings to determine an ambitious framework to tackle climate change. In the last decade and increasingly in this decade, the Global South's voices on matters of global interest such as growth and development have become stronger. Developing countries have shown an unrelenting determination to wield a unified voice that can no longer be ignored. No longer passive recipients of aid and support, developing countries have pushed for partnerships of equals. A partnership reminiscent of the Africa and China collaboration that has seen the continent achieve accelerated growth in infrastructure, connectivity and their respective GDPs. Against this backdrop and throughout discussions and negotiations that spanned over a period of two weeks, the Global South took center stage with the Global North taking a more docile role. Environmental activists, representatives from non-governmental organisations, community leaders and governments from the South put developing countries under the spotlight. They particularly challenged the Global North for undermining their own promises on adapting to and mitigating climate change.\~ As the conference unfolded, it became clear that the Global North is significantly losing ground with regard to the power and influence it once held over developing countries. In Egypt, the Global South was not pushing to be included, but proactively and consistently setting the tone and pace of discussions throughout the life of the conference. By taking a tough stance against the Global North, largely constituting of wealthier carbon emitting nations, the message was clear- it will no longer be business as usual. There is a significant number of poor and highly vulnerable nations in the Global South extremely affected by the impact of climate change. There are communities therein that are reaching the edge of their climate change adaptability. In the last 10 years, industrially developed countries have stalled conservations on loss and damages, in other words, the issue of providing financial assistance to poorer and vulnerable nations at the forefront of ongoing climate change disaster. Climate vulnerability hotspots are in the Global South regions of Africa, South America and Asia. Not only are millions of people at risk from climate change catastrophes including devastating impacts on their GDPs, developed countries are far behind their annual climate finance commitment of $100 billion that started in 2020 and will end in 2025. Against this backdrop, the Global South managed to raise a unified voice, challenging industrially developed countries over their historical responsibility behind growing harmful greenhouse gases emissions and the consequent impact of said gases on the Global South.\~ More so, bearing in mind that while the 10 countries most affected by climate change are in Africa, the African continent contribution to all released carbon is estimated at 3 percent. It is this gap between emissions and effects of climate change on one hand, and financial responsibility of adaptation and mitigation efforts that dominated discussions. So strong and adamant were voices from the Global South that unlike during previous conferences, industrially developed nations addressed the elephant in the room. This led to a break through agreement to provide "loss and damage" funding to vulnerable nations hardest hit by effects of severe climate change. The breakthrough is ground breaking in more ways than one. It is expected to boost the capacities of poor nations highly vulnerable to climate change to adapt to the inevitable impacts of the ongoing climate change, but it also reveals a shift in geopolitics. It appears that the old days of dominance from the Global North are slowly and surely coming to an end. Developing countries have proven that they can take a stand, unite and demand accountability and justice for historical missteps from the Global North. What, only a decade ago seemed like an insurmountable outcome - a united Global South firmly addressing historical injustices wielded by more developed nations - is today becoming a reality. This begs the question, having shown the global community that developing countries can push developed countries to make tough decisions, is the golden era of world dominance from the Global North coming to an end? If COP27 is a sign of things to come, there is no doubt that the world is entering a new era, an era where the Global North will be required to make amends for historical injustices and it has started with the pressing issue of climate change.\~ The author is a Kenya-based journalist.

KIGALI, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) -- The newly launched Rwandan government green investment facility will boost green financing by unlocking new spending for the country's response to climate change, according to private investors. Dubbed Ireme Invest, the investment facility with 104 million U.S. dollars in initial capitalization was launched earlier this week by President Paul Kagame on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations climate change conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The government's initiative was launched through the Rwanda Green Fund and the Development Bank of Rwanda with support from a range of other development partners. "As players in the e-mobility sector, it is a capital-intensive business. It requires investment and we hope the Ireme Invest facility offers us an opportunity for scalability," Donald Kabanda, the Chief Executive of Rwanda Electric Motors Ltd, told Xinhua. "We are enthusiastic to get more funding to contribute toward the targets of cutting carbon emission through e-transport. The company is ready to scale up, we have trained human resource and it is well positioned based on our business model to tap into the new investment facility once it becomes operational," he said. The company helps commercial motorcycle operators who wish to retrofit their bikes to environmentally friendly ones. Emmanuel Hakizimana, an official at Ampersand, Africa's electric motorcycles company working in Rwanda to assemble electric motorcycles, also said the facility will enhance the private sector's contribution to the country's response to climate change. "The facility will ease access to needed green investment funds. Putting more e-motorcycles on the road or setting more battery swap stations all require money yet for startups in green business without collateral, it is not easy to acquire loans from banks," Hakizimana said. Ireme Invest is poised to offer a range of financial instruments tailored to meet the needs of Rwanda's private sector. Information from the Rwanda Green Fund shows that the facility has several financing instruments and two windows that will work in an integrated approach. A project preparation facility at the Rwanda Green Fund will offer grants to cover early-stage project activities to move projects from feasibility to bankability while a credit facility embedded within the Development Bank of Rwanda will offer credit guarantees and concessional loans. Rwanda has set an ambitious climate action agenda that the government hopes will build the country's resilience and foster green growth. To hit the goals, the country needs investments worth 11 billion U.S. dollars, according to the Ministry of Finance. Teddy Mugabo, the Chief Executive Officer of Rwanda Green Fund, said achieving Rwanda's ambitious climate action goals requires significant financial resources and collective stakeholders' engagement. "We are delighted to bring together public and private funding to boost the country's efforts to address climate change. Ireme Invest will be a one-stop center for private sector-led green investments that will spur innovative green climate solutions," she said. According to officials, the facility will strengthen the country's ownership of climate finance and build the green finance capacity of local banks through innovation, risk mitigation, and deal arrangements. Kampeta Sayinzoga, the Chief Executive Officer of the Development Bank of Rwanda, described the Ireme facility as a truly unique green financing initiative that positions the private sector in the driver's seat of Rwanda's green growth while unlocking sustainable finance for the country's banking sector. "Climate change is a global crisis and everyone needs to play their role. That's why we are delighted to work with a range of partners who have supported this impactful initiative," she said. The facility was designed to support Rwanda to achieve its climate and development goals as well as create green jobs through investments in sustainable agriculture, renewable energy and e-mobility. Private sector companies operating in Rwanda will have the opportunity to partner with Ireme Invest from early 2023. Investing in such sectors is hoped to drive Rwanda's green growth and recovery through the creation of a more resilient and sustainable society. Rwanda's launch of Ireme Invest will foster private sector-led green growth and increase access to green finance in the country, said Ahunna Eziakonwa, Director of UNDP's Regional Bureau for Africa. Rwanda has cut 126,000 tonnes of carbon emissions over the last nine years owing to climate resilience investments. Enditem \</doc>

Over 100 institutions, organizations, and networks from six continents jointly launched the Global Youth Climate Week on Monday. The event is usually hosted a week before the COPs. COP27 , or the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), will take place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6 to 18. Promoting carbon neutrality has been a global trend, which involves more than 130 countries and regions, 88 percent of the carbon emission, and 95 percent of the world's population, Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, pointed out at the opening ceremony on Monday.\~ He emphasized multilateralism, urging that the Paris Agreement to be fully implemented by all parties. In his speech, Xie also encouraged the youth to recognize global trends and find solutions in tackling climate change to make contributions toward the global goal of carbon neutrality.\~ "The geological and industrial diversity of the co-initiators reflects the commitment of multi-stakeholders to conquering the climate challenge," said Yang Bin, vice president of Tsinghua University and the chair of the Global Alliance of Universities on Climate (GAUC) Executive Committee. "That commitment is what the world needs in this critical time." Within a month, over 100 co-initiators from six continents are on board to back climate action proposed by the youth consisting of participants from a variety of backgrounds, including academic institutions and think tanks, renowned brands from private sector, media agencies, charities, international and regional organizations, NGOs, and the civil society, the Global Times learned.\~ The inaugural week meant to last for five days and conclude on November 4 features diversified events organized by its co-initiators to offer different perspectives through which the youth can approach the challenge of climate change as well as the Global Youth Summit on Net-Zero Future, a youth-led event organized by the GAUC Global Youth Ambassadors to present their interdisciplinary approach to said challenges.

CAIRO, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government is implementing a clear strategy to transform the country into a regional center for the production and export of green energy, said Egyptian officials and experts. Egypt recently inked a series of deals with energy firms based in India, Norway, Germany and the United Arab Emirates to set up green hydrogen and green ammonia production facilities in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, with the foreign partners pledging to invest over 40 billion U.S. dollars in total by 2030. LEVERAGING KEY LOCATION Egypt has strived "to localize the manufacture of electrolysis used in green hydrogen given the expected growing demand for green fuel from international shipping lines in the near future," Ayman Hamza, a spokesman for the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, told Xinhua. The strategic location of the economic zone can help Egypt to become a "leading region in the world in this emerging industry, as well as transforming it into a global logistic center for green bunkering ships," said Presidential Spokesperson Bassam Rady in a statement in May. The hydrogen generated by renewable or low-carbon power such as solar and wind is called green hydrogen, which helps decarbonize shipping and transport sectors in the future, where it can be used as a fuel. Chemical industries can produce ammonia using the water electrolysis technique, so a key ingredient in agricultural fertilizer will become greener. Such cooperation in green hydrogen and green ammonia is part of Egypt's efforts to realize the goal of expanding the renewables in the national energy mix to 42 percent by 2035, along with earmarking 30 percent of government investments to the green field in the current fiscal year, and hosting the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in November. NEXUS FOR GREEN GRIDS "Egypt has developed a strategy to expand green and renewable energy from the sun and wind, and there is great interest from global companies to invest in green energy in Egypt," Hamza said, adding that the proximity to Europe gives Egypt an advantage in supplying one of the fastest growing markets for renewable energy. Hamza said Egypt's renewable energy production will exceed 10,000 megawatts in 2023, backed by "distinguished projects" such as the Benban Solar Park. Located in the desert of upper Egypt's province of Aswan, the huge photovoltaic power complex now produces a total capacity of about 1,465 megawatts and can be expanded to a full capacity of 2,000 megawatts. Ahmed Hegazy, head of the Egypt Green Energy Association, told Xinhua that Egypt is well positioned to be a nexus for the neighboring countries in Africa, Asia and Europe in terms of the power grid and transmission lines. Foreign investors who coveted the wind energy potential in Egypt have formed joint ventures in building two wind farm projects in the Gabal El Zeit and Zafarana regions along the west coast of the Gulf of Suez, Hegazy added. COOPERATION UNDER BROADER SCOPE Egypt, along with its Russian partners, has also pushed forward the plan to build its first nuclear power plant, the El-Dabaa plant. Located in the Mediterranean province of Matrouh, the plan was designed to have a total capacity of 4,800 megawatts. Egypt announced in July that the construction of the first reactor had begun. Realizing the profound challenge posed by climate change, Egypt has also deepened cooperation with emerging heavyweight countries in renewable tech and manufacturing such as China, said Egypt's Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad. "This includes solar panels, and other cooling and heating facilities with low emission features," she told Xinhua, adding that there are great potentials for Egyptian government entities to cooperate with Chinese partners in getting more energy efficient and environmentally friendly.

This year's COP27 , convened after a year under the shadow of climate disasters and an energy crisis, appeared to have made some breakthrough to include loss and damage compensation into talks, in response to developing nations' persistent demands, and perhaps offered a chance for leaders around the world to make efforts together and take concrete actions. Yet, as delegates officially entered two weeks of negotiations, experts warned on Monday that as global efforts to tackle global warming are needed more than ever at this "watershed moment" on climate action, politicization and pointing fingers at others at the summit will only damage trust between countries and block joint efforts. It is the US that has been taking politicization of the climate issue to a new level before the summit. With Washington sparing no effort to use this summit to shore up its leadership on climate issues, it is shifting blame onto China over climate issues and sowing discord between China and other developing countries. Observers said such behavior showed the US is jealous about China's popular role among developing countries in dealing with global warming and other climate issues. Humanity is in "the fight of our lives" as climate change intensifies droughts, floods and heatwaves, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned world leaders on Monday, at talks in Egypt on curbing global warming. "Co-operate or perish," he told leaders at the COP27 summit in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik. "It is either a climate solidarity pact, or a collective suicide pact," media reported. Speaking at a side event at COP27 on Sunday, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua introduced China's progress on climate change in recent years. "China has actively implemented the Paris Agreement and further enhanced its nationally determined contribution, aiming to reach carbon peak and achieve carbon neutralization in a strong, orderly and effective manner. China has made great progress in this regard," said Xie. "I hope the conference this time will meet the demands of developing countries as much as possible, as it is being held in Egypt, a developing nation," he said. In addition to addressing unresolved issues from last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow, discussions about financing for and mechanisms to compensate the loss and damage caused by climate change are likely to be the main focuses at this year's COP summit, said Teng Fei, Deputy Director of the Energy Environment Economy Institute, Tsinghua University. Delegates from nearly 200 countries kicked off the UN climate summit in Egypt on Sunday. Diplomats approved discussion on matters relating to "funding arrangements responding to loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including a focus on addressing loss and damage." The agenda item was proposed by Pakistan on behalf of the Group of 77 and China during inter-sessional work at Bonn, Germany, in June this year. It envisages compensating developing nations for mounting damage linked to climate change, media reported. The loss and damage agenda, which comes in response to developing countries' concerns, is likely to be established during the summit and become a political legacy of COP27 , Li Shuo, senior global policy advisor from Greenpeace East Asia, told the Global Times. However, he warned there will be an arduous journey before any final resolution is reached. Convened after a year of devastating climate disasters and amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has triggered an energy crisis that has stoked inflation and threatened food security, Li warned that this year's conference will be closely tied up with geopolitical factors, posing a challenge for COP27 . Speaking on the sidelines of the COP27 summit in Egypt, French President Emmanuel Macron said the US, China and other non-European rich nations must pay "their share" to help poorer nations deal with climate change, AFP reported. "We need the United States and China to step up," Macron said, noting that "Europeans are paying. We are the only ones paying. Pressure must be put on rich non-European countries, telling them, 'you have to pay your fair share'." Developed countries shoulder greater historical responsibility as they are overwhelmingly blamed for the catastrophe of global climate change, said Yang Fuqiang, a senior advisor on climate change and energy transition at the Energy Research Institute at Peking University. However, those countries are constantly making empty promises on financing developing countries in tackling global warming. "Those rich countries should first honor their own pledges before pointing fingers at others. They are not the only ones paying." At the top of Egypt's "to-do" list is the $100 billion a year developed countries promised way back in 2009 to help the developing world cut emissions and adapt to changing climate, BBC reported, adding that the money was supposed to be delivered in 2020 but now won't be available in full until next year - three years late. Experts said that handling global warming requires global cooperation, and pointing fingers and shifting blame will only harm the trust between countries, which will wreck global joint efforts in this field. A political show The US, however, could not miss the opportunity to elevate its politicization of the issue to another level. Despite making little progress on curtailing emissions on its own soil, and US facing the possibility of returning to climate denialism if Republicans gain a sweeping victory in midterm elections, the Biden administration is reportedly going all out to assert itself as a global leader on climate action at COP27 . Biden will arrive in Sharm El-Sheikh on November 11, shortly after the midterm elections. At the summit, the US seeks to challenge China's claim to global leadership and restore US credibility on climate action to counter China's courting of developing countries, US media outlet Politico reported. The US tactic of throwing mud at China includes shifting the blame onto China for halted climate talks and pressuring it to pay, analysts said. Washington has always served as the bulwark of wealthy countries' resistance to making such payments, but before the summit, it suddenly changed its tune, saying it was open to paying reparations to countries suffering the ravages of climate change  but only if China ponies up, too, according to Politico in another report. China should contribute its own funds to the cause, US Special Envoy John Kerry told reporters late last month, "especially if they think they're going to continue to go on to the next 30 years with increasing their emissions," Politico reported. In fact, it reflected Washington's sour grapes mentality after seeing that China's role on climate action is winning acclaim among developing countries and is expanding cooperation with them, said Yang. He explained that the US has a desire to assume leadership in every field, thus it seeks to make China look bad and sow discord between China and other developing countries. However, the US attempt to assume leadership on climate action is doomed to fail, as the world has witnessed how the country failed to make concrete progress in tackling global warming and how fragile its commitment is when faced with political changes at home, said experts. The US has inflicted more than $1.9 trillion in damage to other countries from the effects of its greenhouse gas emissions, the Guardian reported, citing a new analysis in July that provided the first measurement of nations' liability in stoking the climate crisis. The huge volume of planet-heating gases pumped out by the US, the largest historical emitter, has caused such harm to other, mostly poor, countries through heatwaves, crop failures and other consequences, that the US is responsible for $1.91 trillion in lost global income since 1990, the Guardian reported, citing the study. In comparison with the US resistance to offering money to ease developing countries' suffering due to climate issues, China has offered 1.1 billion yuan ($150 million) on South-South cooperation in climate change, offered energy-saving and new energy products to nearly 40 countries and trained 1,500 professionals on climate change for 120 developing countries, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of China's Foreign Ministry, said last year. Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing pointed out that US climate policy is again on the brink of seeing a flip-flop, as Republicans are positioned to regain control of the House of Representatives during midterm elections. The US pulled out of the Paris Agreement in 2017 under Republican president Donald Trump. "A Republican-controlled House will greatly frustrate Biden's climate plans. Moreover, such a policy shift by the world's biggest emitter will deal a huge blow to global efforts to realize climate goals," said Li. \</doc>

Collaboration and multilateralism will be key to addressing climate change and environmental challenges confronting the world today, said top Chinese officials and foreign diplomats on Wednesday. With humanity facing the increasingly severe impact of climate change, joint efforts among the international community are urgently needed, said Liu Qibao, vice-chairman of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. "As a developing country, China has actively pushed for the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and consistently followed through on its commitments," Liu said. "China, Europe and Africa share a lot of consensus on climate change and green development. The three parties should deepen exchanges and cooperation on green economy and clean energy, and jointly pursue green, low-carbon and sustainable development." Liu made the remarks at the China-Europe-Africa Green Energy Development Forum, held on Sept 7 and 8 in Hangzhou, capital of East China's Zhejiang province, as China prepares to attend the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP27 , in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from Nov 6 to 18. The forum, organized by the China-EU Association, seeks to promote high-quality development in the era of carbon neutrality, and build a China-Europe-Africa green energy development community in response to the myriad challenges posed by climate change. Various studies show that the number of extreme weather events has grown significantly as a result of climate change. In a 2021 report, the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that global surface temperatures have increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years, leading to growing extreme heat waves, droughts and flooding. In 2022, unprecedented heat waves have caused severe droughts in China, the United States, Europe and other parts of the world. Lack of rainfall in the Horn of Africa has put over 22 million people at the risk of starvation, according to the UN's World Food Programme. More recently, deadly floods have ravaged Pakistan, killing more than 1,300 people and leaving thousands homeless. "In the face of global challenges and crises, no country can stay alone. Multilateralism and win-win cooperation are the only options," Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, said via video link at the forum, echoing Liu's call for the international community to join hands. "China, the EU and African countries share common ground on the implementation of the Paris Agreement and taking forceful actions," Xie added. China has been making persistent efforts to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In September 2020, China pledged to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Official figures show that by 2021, China's energy consumption per unit of GDP had dropped by 26.2 percent compared with 2012, equivalent to a reduction of 2.94 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. "We need friendly emerging economies like China to partner with South Africa and other African countries in mitigating the impact of our energy transition," said Siyabonga Cwele, South African ambassador to China, who believed China can offer a lot for Africa's green transition in terms of funding, innovative technologies, skills training and management, among other areas. "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together," said Nan Cunhui, chairman of the Chint Group, a leading new energy company with a global presence based in Zhejiang, quoting an African proverb at the forum to illustrate the benefits of cooperation. In the process, policy support such as easier market access and tax incentives will be needed, Nan said, "to encourage more companies to invest in the green energy industry". Last year, China and Africa issued the Declaration on China-Africa Cooperation on Combating Climate Change, including the launch of a three-year action plan and the further development of green energy, to tackle climate change.

Leaders coming together for the BRICS Summit are expected to discuss global challenges such as the pandemic, climate change and global governance, say African experts who are keen to see a bigger global role for the grouping of emerging economies. Saliem Fakir, a senior climate diplomacy and geopolitics adviser at the African Climate Foundation in South Africa, said the pandemic response will likely figure prominently, noting that China has been the "key provider of vaccines to Africa". More broadly, Fakir said the summit on Thursday is expected to project the grouping even deeper into a future in which South-South cooperation grows more important. With the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 27 , to be held in Egypt in November, climate change is shaping up as an important topic for discussion at the virtual summit, which brings together the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. "In the year of the 'Africa COP', we expect them (BRICS members) to tackle the climate negotiations" while affirming the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, Fakir said. The senior adviser said the talks may encompass technology-driven approaches in the cooperation against climate change, pointing out China's strengths in digital technology including artificial intelligence. Fakir said many in Africa are looking to the opportunities offered by the New Development Bank, an institution launched under the BRICS framework. "From an African perspective, there is also the role of institutions such as the BRICS bank in addressing some of the challenges from climate finance, financing for renewable infrastructure and agriculture," he said. "Its potential to become a major bank of the future for the South is underutilized. Within Africa, more and more are asking how the bank can be better capitalized to scale up its operations notably in renewable infrastructure financing. We hope the answer will emerge from the summit." Cooperation mechanism Fakir said that the BRICS cooperation mechanism will always remain relevant. Dennis Munene, executive director of the China-Africa Center at the Africa Policy Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, said the BRICS countries aim to promote peace, security, cooperation, and development. He suggests the group can be expanded to include more African countries in order to broaden South-South cooperation. "Amid the current global economic crisis, the BRICS member states have a unique opportunity to provide renewed impetus to global economic cooperation," he said. "For example, BRICS trade and investment with low-income countries has served as a major support system during the COVID-19 pandemic, with China taking the lead in the fight against the pandemic." Naledi Pandor, South Africa's minister of international relations and cooperation, recently told Parliament that the country is using its BRICS membership to address its challenges. "We continue to derive great value from the BRICS partnership," she said. "We look forward to leading further progress on BRICS initiatives once more, as we assume the chair of BRICS in 2023."

By Ali Obaid Al Dhaheri | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-11-22 09:00 Our beautiful planet is our shared home. Its bountiful rewards are nature's gifts to us all, but its ailments are problems that concern everyone - challenges we must all respond to and face together. COP27 , the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference , recently concluded in Egypt. The annual summit is an indispensable forum for bringing together the global family of nations under one roof to share scientific insights, discuss strategies and pledge commitments in combating climate change - the defining challenge of our time. As my own country, the UAE, gets ready to take on the mantle of hosting COP28 in Dubai next year, it is worth reflecting on how we as Emiratis, along with our international friends and partners, especially in China, have been working towards these goals. In his recent policy report to the 20th Party Congress of the CPC, President Xi Jinping spoke astutely of the need for multilateralism and international cooperation in all spheres - diplomacy, trade, technological innovation. Perhaps nowhere is this multilateralism more desperately needed than in our planetary fight against climate change, a sentiment echoed by the President of the UAE, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his address at COP27 : "The dangers of climate change affect everyone without exception, and the future of our children and grandchildren depends on the measures we take today." Both of our national leaders are keenly aware of the fact that, as two advanced countries at the forefront of technological innovation, it is especially incumbent upon us to be active global stakeholders at this precarious time. We know the threat is real. We do not need alarmist predictions of impending doom; however, it is worth noting the geographical scope of recent climatic cataclysms to remind ourselves this is a responsibility we all share. Extreme weather phenomena have been unfolding all over the world: abnormal heatwaves across India, devastating monsoon rains in Pakistan; in China, the longest summer drought since official records began, alongside a record high in heavy rain warnings; in Europe, perhaps the worst summer drought for the continent in 500 years. I mention these things not to be defeatist in the face of uncontrollable forces, but to emphasize climate change is the one issue that concerns all of us, and must be acted on accordingly. It is surely no accident both this year's COP27 and next year's COP28 are taking place in the Middle East and North Africa region, an arid part of the world that has long been at the frontier of climate change and has had to adapt to living with desertification and water scarcity. As this year's host, Egypt should be applauded for doubling down on its focus on Africa - a vast and rich continent which nevertheless continues to bear the brunt of the globe's climate change woes, especially when it comes to food security. The UN has warned abnormal droughts have pushed some 22 million people in the Horn of Africa to be highly susceptible to starvation. In that regard, and largely through the efforts of the G77 group of developing countries, this year's summit has achieved an unprecedented breakthrough of agreeing on the creation of a "Loss and Damage" fund to help poorer nations facing the most risk from climate change. The UAE wholeheartedly supports Egypt's commitment to addressing the pressures faced by the Global South and recognizes the far-reaching efforts China has made over several years in building resilience in some of the world's least developed countries. As the main logistics hub for the Belt and Road in the Middle East, the UAE understands first-hand the integral role multilateral initiatives can play in promoting development and connectivity, alleviating some of the absolute poverty that makes the effects of climate change immeasurably worse. For our part, to date the UAE has invested $16.8 billion in renewable energy ventures in 70 countries, and has pledged to invest over $50 billion in clean energy projects at home and abroad over the next decade. Together, the UAE and China both strive to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of eliminating world hunger - something that can only be achieved through concerted scientific collaboration on an international level. Through the comprehensive strategic partnership between our two nations, the UAE and China are pioneering new agricultural technologies and sustainable methods, and working on enhancing food security. This was the main focus of our recent bilateral 'Sci-Tech' forum, hosted by the UAE Embassy to the People's Republic of China, which brought together leading policymakers and scientists from our country with their counterparts in China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Our joint efforts are bearing fruits and will go on to benefit some of those societies across the globe that are most vulnerable to climate change. Both the UAE and China understand our immense duties in nurturing and conserving our natural landscapes so that future generations can continue to enjoy their wonders. Despite its desert climate, the UAE is also blessed with some of the most impressive biodiversity in the Arabian Peninsula and an extensive wetland ecosystem. During our presidency of COP13 - the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands - in 2018, the UAE assembled the international community to discuss how best to protect these unique and fragile ecosystems, which play a major role in the mitigation of climate change. As China becomes the standard bearer of wetland conservation this year with its presidency of COP14, it was an honor for me to address the opening ceremony in Wuhan at the invitation of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. I have no doubt China will continue to be a world leader in this area in the years to come. Most importantly, the UAE and China are resolutely devoted to our commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement - a resounding symbol of the very best in multilateral policymaking. The UAE was the first country in the MENA region to adopt and sign the Paris Agreement, as well as the first to commit to a net zero target by 2050. As we prepare for our COP presidency next year, we should note COP28 in Dubai will conclude the first comprehensive assessment of all the progress that has been made on the Paris Agreement to date and determine a new way forward. Alongside this "global stock-take", COP28 will also set the "Global Goal on Adaptation" to assess the efficacy of ongoing global efforts to adapt to climate change. Adaptation is the very essence of our strategy. In the UAE, we do not see the fight against climate change as a zero-sum game, pitting the health of the planet in opposition to human progress. We are committed to cutting emissions, not to reducing development. We believe the challenges ahead of us offer exciting opportunities for technological advancement, new areas of employment and productivity. While the UAE already produces some of the world's least carbon-intensive crude oil, our ongoing dedication to energy transition has inspired the Emirati people to develop a peaceful nuclear program, which prevents the release of 21 million tons of carbon emissions each year - the equivalent of removing 3.2 million cars from the road annually. As Xi mentioned in his recent report, China is also focused on its energy transition and will seek to use existing sources in a cleaner and more effective way - this will also open up new opportunities for technological innovation. As Egypt passes the baton to the UAE for COP28, it is worth noting another resounding success of this year's summit has been the landmark deal between the two countries to build one of the world's largest wind farms, which will offset nearly 10 percent of Egypt's annual carbon emissions. The road to November 2023 and beyond is full of challenges, but the spirit of international cooperation the COP summits exemplify is strong, and it is the bedrock on which the battle against climate change must be fought.

BERLIN, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Europe's largest economy is a long way from achieving its climate targets for 2030, according to a report by the German government's expert council on climate issues published on Friday. "The emission reduction rates achieved so far are far from sufficient to meet the 2030 climate protection targets," council member Thomas Heimer said, stressing that the targets have been missed by individual sectors as well as the economy as a whole. Germany aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 65 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and to be climate neutral by 2045, five years earlier than originally planned. Annual emissions reductions would have to more than double to achieve these targets, Heimer stressed. Meanwhile, Germany's transport sector would require a 14-fold increase in reductions. During the review period 2000-2021, greenhouse gas emissions in Germany fell by around 27 percent. The country's energy sector contributed almost half of this reduction, according to the government's report, presented in the run-up to the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, from Nov. 6 to 18. On the other hand, Germany's industry, and buildings and transport sectors saw a "phase of stagnation or even a slight increase" in emissions. Although emissions in industry and transport fell due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this trend was reversed in 2021, the report found. The effects of emission-reducing technologies were offset by more prosperity and economic growth. "Efficiency gains have been counteracted by overall economic growth, larger living spaces, and increased transport volumes," the council's chairman Hans-Martin Henning said. Enditem \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to work with the international community to promote the comprehensive, balanced and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, a Chinese delegate said Tuesday. China has implemented a national strategy to address climate change, a common challenge and crisis faced by mankind, and unswervingly follows the path of ecological priority, green and low-carbon development, said Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Zhao, also vice minister of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the remarks at an event about the China Country Climate and Development Report released by the World Bank. In order to implement the "dual carbon" goal, which is to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, China has established a carbon neutralization working mechanism, which has clarified the top-level design of the "dual carbon" work, formulated implementation plans in energy, industry, transportation and other key areas, and a carbon neutral "1+N" policy system has been established, Zhao said. From 2012 to 2021, China's annual energy consumption growth rate of 3 percent supported an average economic growth rate of 6.6 percent, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) decreased by about 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, with a cumulative saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal, he said. Zhao said China regards the carbon market as an important tool of climate policy and actively promotes the construction of a national carbon emission trading market. On July 16, 2021, the national carbon market officially launched online trading, covering 4.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually, making it the world's largest carbon market. The market has operated in a stable and orderly manner on the whole, and the role of market mechanisms has initially emerged, he added. As the largest developing country, China makes all-out efforts on climate governance while pursuing economic development. "China will play a pivotal role in global climate governance," said Nicholas Stern, a British economist. "China has maintained sound cooperation with the United Nations and international financial institutions to address climate change, and China is ready to work with the international community to promote the comprehensive, balanced and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, and continue to contribute China's strength, wisdom and solutions to the building of a fair, equitable and win-win global climate change governance system," Zhao said. \</doc>

By ANGUS MCNEICE in London | China Daily | Updated: 2022-10-22 08:28 Overseas impact From an international perspective, China's coal policy is set to have a notable impact on driving the green transition. Last year, China pledged to end financing for building coal plants overseas, which CAT estimates will result in the cancellation of 43 gigawatts of new coal projects across Asia. CCS Director Hu said that green projects within the Belt and Road Initiative are also helping to drive down emissions beyond China's borders. "China is helping developing countries, especially small island countries, African countries and LDCs (least developed countries), to enhance their capacity and capability to cope with climate change and reduce the adverse effects of climate change," Hu said. Stern said that increased collaboration with other large economies must also drive China's climate agenda. "It is critically important that China and the United States, as the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gasses, are able to work together on tackling climate change," he said, adding that the United States has now passed a landmark bill to massively increase investments in clean energy. Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, said in August that the US is fully responsible for the current halt in China-US climate cooperation. In a news conference on Sept 20, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that China remains receptive to working with the US on climate change. The two nations signed a joint declaration to address the global climate crisis at the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, in Glasgow in November. "If China and the US can manage their bilateral relations well, reduce impediments and negative factors and jointly respond to climate change, public health and food and energy security challenges, people of both countries and the world at large will enjoy more benefits," Wang said. \</doc>

GABORONE, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Botswana is exploring possibilities of finding a far cleaner way to use the energy in coal, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said Thursday. Speaking at the commissioning ceremony of the Morupule Coal Mine's Motheo project in the central part of Botswana, President Masisi said the southern African country is aware of the sensitivities, particularly from the point of view of environmental sustainability and a green future. "Actually, beyond being aware, we are also actively pursuing globally-adopted standards of decarbonization of fossil fuels like coal through using clean technologies," said Masisi. In April 2021, the parliament of Botswana adopted a climate change policy in accordance with the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference , more commonly referred to as COP-26, requirements to reduce carbon emissions, according to Masisi. During the energy transition period to a green economy, Masisi said Botswana will, in partnership with independent power producers, work steadily toward attaining investment capacity for the requisite energy mix that incorporates a significant proportion of cleaner energy sources. Through the efficient and effective implementation of this policy, Botswana will ensure that the activities surrounding the country's coal mining efforts will adhere to the international commitments for climate change, he said. "We want to promote responsible exploitation of our natural resources for sustainable development while at the same time taking extraordinary measures to make best of the value of our coal resources to enable economic diversification in Botswana," he said. Charles Siwawa, a mining expert and the chief executive officer of the Botswana Chamber of Mines, told Xinhua on the sidelines of the commissioning ceremony that the backbone of research technologies will enable Botswana's transition from a dependence on fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Mining experts suggest that Botswana has significant quantities of untapped coal, which is estimated at around 202 billion tonnes. Enditem \</doc>

By JAN YUMUL in Hong Kong | China Daily | Updated: 2022-10-03 11:42 As the United Arab Emirates' energy transition gathers pace before it hosts the United Nations climate conference next year, it is looking to climate partners such as China to help it sustain the momentum, its climate change special envoy says. Sultan Al Jaber, the UAE special envoy for climate change and minister of industry and advanced technology, said the UAE is seeing "record growth in renewables", representing more than 80 percent of all new power-generating capacity last year. However, he said, a transformative and pragmatic global energy transition is needed to deliver climate action, and while wind and solar accounted for the vast majority of all new power-generating capacity last year, this still only accounts for 4 percent of today's energy mix. "As the world's energy needs grow ever larger, maintaining global energy security will require oil and gas to remain a significant part of the mix for decades to come," Al Jaber said. A successful energy transition must make progress with economic and climate action in tandem, he said. As part of this, "we know we must do more now" to reduce the impact of oil and gas on the climate, and in the medium term the UAE plans to increase its renewables portfolio to 100 gigawatts by 2030. "I see many more opportunities for collaboration with China as we continue to build and adapt to clean energy solutions. We are constantly looking to the future and have allocated more than $1.5 billion in grants and low-interest loans for renewable energy innovation in more than 40 countries." Like China, Al Jaber said, the UAE is also investing in clean energy projects globally, with more than $50 billion across six continents, including in 27 climate-vulnerable island nations, which, he said, "is extremely important to us" and is one of the country's key approaches for COP 28 UAE next year. In 2017, the UAE launched Energy Strategy 2050, which is considered the first unified energy strategy in the country that is based on supply and demand. It aims to increase the contribution of clean energy in the total energy mix from 25 percent to 50 percent by 2050 and reduce carbon emissions from power generation by 70 percent. It also seeks to raise the consumption efficiency of individuals and companies by 40 percent, the UAE government says. Furthermore, the strategy targets an energy mix that combines renewables, nuclear and clean energy sources to meet the UAE's economic requirements and environmental goals, which are 44 percent clean energy, 38 percent gas, 12 percent clean coal and 6 percent nuclear. The Australian aggregator Compare the Market's Green Fuel Index ranks the UAE first among countries whose use of renewable energy has increased. Its renewable capacity has grown almost 20,000 percent in the past 10 years. The UAE, it said, "has traditionally relied on its plentiful supplies of oil" but has recently made a big effort to shift away from fossil fuels, although just 7.2 percent of the country's energy needs are met by renewable means. Al Jaber praised China's focus on excellence in all aspects of the renewable energy supply chain, from research and development to materials, manufacturing and installation, which he said "sets the standard for other countries to follow". "Solar, in particular, is an example of where the government has encouraged growth with supporting policies, resulting in China's leadership in both solar power generation and manufacturing. There is much to learn from this example." China's leadership in technology "is also helping the world take advantage of the commercial opportunities of the energy transition", Al Jaber said, citing a consortium of Chinese companies that are partnering with the UAE to develop and build Al Dhafra Solar Park, 35 kilometers south of Abu Dhabi. It will become one of the world's largest solar plants, delivering more than 2 GW of clean energy, Al Jaber said. China "is leading the world with respect to solar, in both manufacturing and supply chains", he said. The UAE, he said, has three of the world's largest single-site solar plants. The Noor Abu Dhabi Solar plant has 3.2 million solar panels and has been developed with expertise and investment from the Chinese clean technology company Jinko Power. "As we prepare for COP 28 UAE, there are many lessons we can draw on from China's experience in practical, commercially viable clean tech development," Al Jaber said. "We intend to take a similar, pragmatic approach that promotes an energy transition that is based on scientific, economic and engineering facts, appreciates the multiple dilemmas and challenging trade-offs, and accelerates the deployment of practical solutions." COP 28 next year is the 28th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties. COP 27 will be held in Egypt in November. \</doc>

Adapting to the impacts of climate change and risks has been overshadowed for years by climate change mitigation, which attempts to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The lion's share of attention and finance is channeled to support mitigation activities. According to the estimates of the United Nations Environment Programme, global public and private adaptation investment reached $30 billion in 2017-18, accounting for less than 20 percent of total climate finance during that period. The cost of adaptation, however, will reach $140-300 billion per year by 2030, and $280-500 billion annually by 2050. The lack of appetite for adaptation investments might be explained by multiple factors. Many adaptation projects are not perceived as bankable, due in part to the dearth of tools and methodologies to help properly measure their outcomes, including climate resilience. Adaptation projects are also hard to standardize across geography, as each community, region and country is vulnerable in its unique ways, requiring bespoke solutions to build adaptive capacity. Moreover, the fact that climate adaptation and general development interventions are inextricably interlinked renders it challenging to mobilize additional resources for adaptation per se. On the one hand, quality development projects can contribute to climate adaptation. Well-designed roads, for instance, can contain engineering structures that can withstand extreme climatic events. On the other hand, climate adaptation could bring about development dividends. The support for drought resistant crops is a case in point. It is not only climate-smart, but also generates sustainable alternatives for livelihoods. Ultimately, it is the similar set of socioeconomic and environmental factors (for example, education level, natural endowments, technology advancement and institutions) that underlie development progress and the status of resilience. Efforts have been dedicated to disentangling climate adaptation from development for project financing. In their estimate of adaptation finance, the multilateral development banks, for instance, examine and assess the contribution of individual project components, rather than the project as a whole. Only those elements that are truly incremental by demonstrating their direct relevance to addressing a climate vulnerability in the project area are considered adaptation and eligible for climate finance. Such a disaggregated approach could help prevent adaptation finance from being diluted by costless co-benefit of "business-as-usual" development projects that would have happened in any case. While such endeavors are conductive to safeguarding the additionality of adaptation finance, they are not meant to serve as the end goals. In fact, the preoccupation with distinguishing adaptation from development may compromise the full integration of adaptation into regular development practices. Regardless of the sources of finance, adaptation investments are, after all, intended to enhance the accessibility of adaptation solutions and strengthen the resilience of development projects. The assessment of adaptation finance may, therefore, take one step back to look at what really matters. The pursuit of accurate and rigorous tracking is certainly commendable to ensure well-leveraged inputs for adaptation. Yet, the impact of adaptation finance cannot be truly optimized without devising quality projects that factor in existing and future climate risks. To achieve that entails a more meticulous review of projects' designs in the first place. How this will work out requires asking essential questions as to what actual development challenges, including those imposed by climate risks and variability, are to be addressed through the project, as well as what can be done more effectively to reduce the vulnerability of people, assets or ecosystems that are at stake. Effective adaptation is not necessarily more costly. Small adjustments or nudges could make a difference. Capacity building activities (such as workshops, training) that help raise climate awareness or crystallize the thoughts on climate risks to inspire informed decision-making are a good case in point. These have been observed in many projects involving rural smallholder households who are so habitual to adapting without consciously knowing. To give another example, traditional infrastructure projects (for example, transport projects) are increasingly incorporating to build intelligent management systems that can provide early warning of climate-related events through consolidated data. In the run-up to the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 However, the numbers of adaptation finance do not speak directly to the impacts it could generate. And spending wisely is probably equally important as mobilizing more. In the continuous efforts to refine adaptation finance assessment, the opportunities to mainstream climate considerations must be grasped in the stage of project preparations to ensure that effective adaptation measures are captured. Simple adaptation actions, such as those mentioned above, could make an impact accumulatively, if repeatedly conducted across projects. Exploring the ways to define and measure the effectiveness of adaptation finance may be the next big step forward for the global community. The development of common metrics may help. So too, the many intended beneficiaries of adaptation investments, who are entitled to tell their development stories. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/26/635863bba3109375854d208a.png Link to Image WANG YIMENG/FOR CHINA DAILY \~ \~ The author is a climate specialist at the New Development Bank.

A logo of the COP 27 summit. Photo: Xinhua The 2022 UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) is being held in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh from November 6 to 18. During the year since the Glasgow Climate Change Conference was held, the climate crisis has further intensified, and many parts of the world have been hit hard by extreme weather and natural disasters. At the same time, the world is facing multiple challenges such as energy crisis, food crisis and high inflation. Some developed countries have shaken their positions on climate change issues. Egypt, the host of COP27 , admitted the conference will be the most difficult one in at least one decade. At the Glasgow Conference last year, all parties reached a consensus on the implementation details of the Paris Agreement following difficult negotiations. At the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009, developed countries pledged to provide developing countries with $100 billion in climate funding each year by 2020. But for more than one decade, even with all kinds of "making up," these investment commitments are far from being fulfilled. Among them, the US has only completed less than 20 percent of its due share, and Australia, Canada and other countries haven't even fulfilled half of their commitments. Dunning developed countries for payment has almost become a key topic of the annual climate summit, but it has repeatedly become a "hide-and-seek" game. Developed countries, especially the US, are keen to say good things and use new promises to cover up the "failure" of their old promises. Therefore, Egypt adopted in a timely manner the slogan of "Together for Implementation," calling on all countries to implement their previous commitments on climate change. It should be said that addressing the issue of climate financing, especially the fulfillment of financial commitments made by developed countries, is the consensus of most countries at the conference, and it is an "overriding" topic. In an interview, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres made a serious warning that rich countries must sign a "historic pact" with the poor ones on the climate, or "we will be doomed." In addition, the issue of "loss and damage" (for the purpose of discussing the compensation provided by advanced industrial countries to developing countries suffering from climate change), which has been boycotted by developed countries such as the US, will be discussed for the first time at this ongoing conference, with the efforts of countries such as the host country Egypt as well as Pakistan, the rotating presidency of the Group of 77 (G77) and China. Before departing for COP27 , US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry indicated that the US is "open" to multilateral discussions on the issue. If Kerry's statement is sincere and the US intends to take real actions, it is a positive sign that will be welcomed by the international community. But it is noteworthy that this act, which is supposed to be its historical responsibility, has turned into a "good reason" to besiege China in Washington's calculations. Not only did the US media say that the US was trying to aim China and make China pay for it, but some US scholars also said that this was to drive a wedge between China and other developing countries to split the G77 group. Some developing countries are worried about such manipulation by the US. Since the Biden administration took office, it has been trying to define its relations with China in terms of the "Competition, Cooperation and Confrontation" (3Cs), and climate change has been listed as one of the few areas where "cooperation" is deemed possible. But now, even this "cooperation" issue has been secretly dragged into the list of "confrontation" by Washington, which reveals the essence of the so-called 3Cs positioning and the malice behind it to contain and suppress China. There are even calls in the US that it is time to "fight China" on the issue of climate change. In their view, competing with China rather than cooperating with China, and engaging in the "green competition," is conducive to the development of the clean energy industry in the US, and helps the US to "influence" its partners across the globe, which is an important area that can "win" over China. It has been said previously that climate change cooperation is an "oasis" between China and the US. It is also an "oasis" for global cooperation. Now that the "oasis" between the two sides has been destroyed by US' provocation, will Washington let the harmful behaviors of "competition" and confrontation destroy the global "oasis"? The damage caused by Washington's paranoid "competitive" and confrontational tactics in the world economy has been fully demonstrated. If the US is allowed to put the "competition" into the field of climate change that is related to the global common destiny, it will inevitably have serious consequences, which deserves everyone's vigilance and resistance. \</doc>

Fossil fuel businesses have long been criticized for their environmental impact and are seeking to adapt in a world where sustainability policies are an increasingly urgent priority for governments around the world, as can be seen from the more than 35,000 people who attended the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt. However, it's important to remember that these industries are also essential to our way of life. They still provide much of the energy that powers our homes and businesses, and they play a vital role in many aspects of the economy. As such, it's important to find ways to make fossil fuel production more environmentally friendly  and safe  while pursuing the transition to other forms of energy. One potential way to do this is through the use of 5G and AI technologies. And while there are many good ideas, practical applications are important if real progress is to be made. Huawei's new MineHarmony OS represents an example of how ideas are being quickly turned into reality to make coal mining safer and more environmentally friendly. Coal has been used as an energy source since the early days of human civilization with the first recorded use of coal dating back to the first century AD, when the Chinese used it to smelt bronze. By the 13th century, coal was being mined in England and used to fire furnaces for glass-making and iron production. The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries saw a dramatic increase in the use of coal, as it became the main fuel for powering factories, steamships and trains. Today, coal is still an important energy source for several reasons. First, it is abundant and relatively easy to extract. It is also cheap, which makes it a viable option for countries with limited resources. With growing geopolitical uncertainty, domestic supplies of coal help contribute to energy security. Additionally, coal can be used in a variety of ways. It can be burned to generate heat or electricity, or it can be converted into gaseous or liquid fuels. Moreover, coal mining is an important source of employment. So, balancing employment security with the global transition to a new energy mix is another issue that must be considered. Addressing the related safety and environmental issues is important for countries around the world. While the use of coal has grown dramatically, what has not changed over the centuries is that coal mining has remained a dangerous and dirty job. But, with the advent of 5G and AI technology, that is now changing, and some of the most noteworthy developments in making coal mining safer and more environmentally friendly are happening today in China  a country that mined 4.01 billion metric tons of coal in 2021 with 207.9 billion tons of proven reserves, according to China's Ministry of Natural Resources. In recent years, there has been a lot of discussion about the potential of 5G and AI technology to transform various industries. In the mining sector, these technologies are seen as a way to improve safety and efficiency. For example, because 5G offers high speeds and low latency, it can be used to transmit data from sensors in real time. This information can be used to detect things like gas leaks or structural issues before they become dangerous. AI can also be used to analyze data and identify patterns that could indicate problems if left unchecked. In addition, these technologies can be used to track the location of workers and automatically route them around hazards. By using 5G and AI technology, coal miners can work more safely and efficiently, reducing the risks of accidents and injuries. Huawei Mine OS is a real-world example of how 5G and AI can be integrated to make coal mining safer and greener. 5G allows a wide variety of equipment to be connected in real-time through unified standards, frameworks and data specifications while AI ensures that better decisions are made. Jointly developed by Huawei and China Energy Investment Corp, this system has been deployed on 3,300 sets of equipment in 13 mines and one coal washery throughout the entire Wulanmulun mine in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region. While Huawei has gained the most attention in applying 5G and AI technologies to traditional industries such as coal mining, it is not alone. China's No 2 telecom gear maker  ZTE Corp  has launched a comparable effort in partnership with State-owned China Baowu Steel Group Corp to deploy 5G-enabled autonomous mining trucks at an open-pit iron ore mine in Anhui province. Meanwhile, Alibaba is working with Shaanxi Coal and Chemical Industry Group to provide cloud computing, big data, AI and blockchain technologies in order to enhance enterprise management, online operations and international business development. All of these initiatives represent efforts to realize President Xi Jinping's call for "New Infrastructure" to bolster the country's economy under the country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25). As the world looks ahead after COP27 , China's contributions in advancing both global energy security and sustainability will grow. Despite misgivings in some circles, fossil fuels still have a role to play with both opportunities to be seized and challenges to be overcome and an integrated system incorporating 5G and AI technologies can play a positive role. Ge Shirong, president of the China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing, and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said: "The industry needs an operating system enabling ubiquitous interconnectivity for coal mines. Intelligent coal mining has been promoted rapidly in China. Digital technology is key to helping coal mines achieve this goal but still has a long way to go."

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- A long-awaited "loss and damage" fund to help those countries vulnerable to climate change was approved on Sunday at the end of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). "I welcome the decision to establish a loss and damage fund and to operationalize it in the coming period," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement, noting that the two-week conference held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh "has taken an important step towards justice." However, Guterres said that the fund will not be enough but is "a much-needed political signal to rebuild broken trust." This photo shows the closing plenary of the COP27 climate change conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Nov. 20, 2022. (Xinhua/Sui Xiankai) "A fund for loss and damage is essential, but it's not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map, or turns an entire African country to desert," said the UN chief. Guterres also stressed that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is a "red line" that the world must not cross. The idea of establishing a fund for loss and damage suffered by developing and poor nations due to climate change had always been shunned by developed countries due to their concerns that the fund could expose them to legal liabilities and lawsuits from the affected countries. "Today, here in Sharm El-Sheikh, we established the first-ever dedicated fund for loss and damage -- a fund that has been so long in the making," said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who is also president of the COP27 , at the closing session. "Millions around the globe can now sense a glimmer of hope that their suffering will finally be addressed swiftly and appropriately," he said. Attended by representatives of nearly 200 nations, the COP27 was extended for more than a day till the proposed agenda was finished. Shoukry said that the achievements of COP27 deliver a message to the world "that multilateral diplomacy still works" and that, despite the difficulties and challenges, "we remain committed to the fight against climate change." For his part, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said that the outcome of the COP27 , which wasn't easy to accomplish, was "historic" as it benefits the most vulnerable people around the world. Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to the COP27 and vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told Xinhua that the COP27 made progress on adaptation, finance and "loss and damage," which are issues of great concern to developing countries. In addition to the establishment of the "loss and damage" fund, the conference also decided to establish a global adaptation framework, he noted. However, at this year's conference, developed countries took a passive attitude towards issues such as providing financial and technical support to developing countries, said Zhao. Developed countries have neither delivered on the 100 billion U.S. dollars in annual climate finance commitment, nor made a clear funding arrangement for doubling adaptation finance, he added. Zhao said he hoped that developed countries would work together with the international community towards building a shared future of sustainable climate. Egyptian veteran ecologist Magdy Allam, secretary-general of the Arab Federation for Environmental Experts affiliated with the Cairo-based Arab League, considered the COP27 "a great triumph." "Including the 'loss and damage' fund on the COP27 agenda is a great victory. It has been completely rejected at all former COP summits," Allam told Xinhua. "It's a big progress that developed and major industrial countries admitted the damages they have caused to the environment," he said, adding that it is the first COP that underlines implementation and shows commitment. \</doc>

SYDNEY, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Professional services firm, KPMG Australia, on Thursday released an annual report on the economic risks to Australia's mining industry, which reveals that future commodity prices and decarbonization were perceived as major issues. The Australian Mining Risk Forecast 2022/23 report was compiled after surveying Australian mining executives on their largest fears for the industry. The report showed that Australia's mining industry's focus had shifted from the COVID-19 pandemic to the commodity market and new environmental regulations. "The focus has shifted away from the geopolitical tensions of the past two years where the global pandemic and fears around possible fallout from a global trade war were top of mind for Australian mining leaders," said Nick Harridge, partner and national mining leader for KPMG Australia. The report referred to decarbonization as a "double edged sword", both an opportunity and a point of uncertainty for the sector. It said that 87 percent of the executive's response believed that new technology played a key role in the transition, and nearly half said technological innovation would be a major source of disruption. Major commodity companies have been making shows of a transition to renewable energy generation. Last month mining company BP Australia announced it would acquire a major stake in one of the world's largest green energy hubs in Western Australia. However, as the nation moves away from using fossil fuels domestically it is ramping up its exports. An annual report from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, forecast that Australia would export 184 million tons of metallurgical coal by financial year 2026-27, up from 171 million tons in 2020-21. Caron Sugars, a partner in KPMG's Governance, Risk and Controls Advisory and Board Advisory Services groups, called out the increasing focus on regulatory and compliance concerns. "They (mining leaders) are operating in a heightened environment of intensifying regulatory requirements and stakeholder scrutiny particularly in the wake of (the United Nations climate change conference ) COP26 last November."

Active preparations are underway across China for the upcoming 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP 14) from Nov 5 to 13, to be held in Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei province. Themed "Wetlands Actions for People and Nature", this year's conference is committed to strengthening national actions and international cooperation for the smart conservation of wetlands. It is the first time for China to host this international wetland event, and Wuhan is the first "International Wetland City" to host it. This year being the 30th anniversary of China's accession to the Ramsar Convention, China will showcase the great strides it has made in enhancing wetland conservation and restoration over the past decades, contributing to the global endeavor to realize an ecological civilization. World leaders have been facing the challenge of delivering win-win policies for the economy and ecology, which has been exacerbated by climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and other extreme events. Undoubtedly, China's endeavors in expanding wetland areas and establishing wetland parks have not only improved water quality and provided critical habitats for migratory birds, but also contributed more than $8 billion to regional economic growth and directly created over 47,000 new jobs. Wetlands will play an important role in the Chinese path to modernization characterized by harmony between humanity and nature. Wetlands are natural or artificial water-saturated areas, existing either all year round or seasonally. They are one of the three major ecosystems, the others being forests and oceans. They are widely distributed around the world, and 10 percent of the world's wetlands are in China, spread across 65.9 million hectares. Although covering only 6 percent of the Earth's surface, wetlands are home to 40 percent of the world's animal and plant species. Consequently, wetlands protection is also vital for biodiversity conservation. Wetlands act like giant sponges or reservoirs, which may absorb and store excess water when flooded. During the dry season, wetlands release stored water, delaying and deferring drought disasters and avoiding water shortages. The wetlands' role in regulating runoff can help prevent inundation and flooding. They are also premier carbon sinks, locking 300-600 billion metric tons of carbon globally, accounting for 12-24 percent of the total carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, which can be considered as a useful tool for achieving carbon neutrality. In addition, wetlands nurture species that are food sources for human beings, and also drive the development of ecotourism, green agriculture and other industries to boost economic prosperity and rural revitalization, which is an important assurance for the ecological civilization of China. It needs to be stressed that wetlands are being wiped out due to environmental pollution, overfishing and land reclamation, and other human activities. In 2020, the World Wide Fund reported that nearly 90 percent of the world's wetlands had been degraded since the 1700s, and we are losing wetlands three times faster than forests. More proven measures should be taken to bend the curve on freshwater biodiversity loss. Since the adoption of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in 1971, more countries have been aware of the urgency and importance of wetlands protection. China joined the convention in 1992, stepped up its endeavors to restore wetlands, and has become an important participant, contributor, and torchbearer of the global efforts. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-20), the Chinese central government invested 9.87 billion yuan ($1.35 billion) in over 2,000 projects to implement wetland ecological compensation subsidies, turn croplands back to wetlands, and restore wetlands. To date, China has established 64 wetlands of international importance, 29 of national importance, more than 600 wetland nature reserves and 1,600 wetland parks. Under the management system, more than 50 percent of China's wetland areas are under protection. Besides, wetland survey and high-tech monitoring systems have been introduced and China is the first country in the world to have conducted three rounds of nationwide wetland resources investigation, improving timely supervision of wetlands conditions. Most importantly, China came up with its first wetland protection law in June this year, marking a new stage of law-based wetlands protection in China. Hosting the COP 14 at a time of bird migrations, China will showcase the charm of wetlands and offer a beautiful view of harmonious human-nature coexistence. To build a beautiful China, the country will continue its efforts in establishing 50 new wetlands of national importance by 2025 and raising the rate of national wetlands protection to 55 percent. But policymakers should pay attention to the following issues: From a holistic perspective, wetland protection should embark on watershed management, because upstream and downstream ecosystems are closely intertwined. In addition, no water, no wetlands. We need to guarantee water quality, water quantity, and water ecology to nurture wetlands. Last but not least, an economic compensation and punishment system for wetland conservation needs to be established to crack the dilemma of wetland protection and construction funds. To completely tackle the challenges of shrinking wetlands and the degradation of their ecological functions, global cooperation is more vital than ever. We must shift to a path of balanced and sustainable development. Moreover, coinciding with the United Nations climate change conference ( COP 27 ) and one month before the UN biodiversity conference (COP 15), we should seize the opportunity of the COP 14 to demonstrate the importance of Ramsar and wetlands to meet climate goals, and ensure the new Global Biodiversity Framework includes wetlands, thus positioning wetlands as critical elements in national implementation plans. Every stroke counts. Our headway in wetland conservation is creating a shared future for all. Chen Bin is the director of the Center for Eco-Environment Governance at Beijing Normal University.

At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP 26) in November 2021, countries agreed to bring forward plans to limit global warming to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, calling for stronger national action plans to be submitted in 2022 and a phase-down of coal power. Developed countries were urged to fully deliver on the goal of providing $100 billion a year for developing countries. In a major report in February 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that any further delay in concerted global action would miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all. The pledges that governments have so far submitted would only limit temperatures to under 2 C.Furthermore, recent forecasts indicate that if current policies continue unchanged, the world would soon be hotter by 2.7 C or even 3.6 C above pre-industrial levels. Three former UN climate chiefs have just described such a scenario as "catastrophic". The extreme weather conditions in the months since the COP 26 should be alarm bells for the world that more needs to be done. Yet, energy security also remains important. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have put other issues to the fore that threaten to take precedence over the climate emergency. Where do the three major actors that are between them responsible for some 50 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, namely the United States, the European Union and China, stand today? In the US, greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by 50-52 percent by 2030, and net zero emissions should be achieved economy-wide no later than 2050. But in 2021, the US burned some 25 percent more coal than in 2020, and the output of greenhouse gases rose 6 percent. President Joe Biden has proposed what he described as the most ambitious environmental and climate agenda in history. Yet to fulfill these promises, he requires major legislation that appears increasingly remote. Given his tenuous position in Congress\u-243 which is all but certain to worsen in the midterm elections in November\u-243 his proposal to spend some $555 billion on climate measures is unlikely to become reality. Biden has also attempted to mitigate the worldwide rise of gasoline prices by releasing crude oil from the US' Strategic Petroleum Reserve and selling oil and gas leases on federal land. If current policies continue, greenhouse gas output might by 2030 not be 50 percent, but only 10 percent lower. Some analysts therefore describe Biden's climate ambitions as "all but dead". The picture for the EU is, at first glance, rosier. The EU has pledged a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 55 percent by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2050. A few days ago, it submitted official data to the UN indicating that it had by 2020 slashed greenhouse gas emissions by 34 percent below the 1990 levels, well overshooting its own target of 20 percent. While the EU claims that this is a confirmation of a 30-year downward trend, others are not so sure. In 2020, EU countries had shut down their economies to contain the novel coronavirus. But in 2021, as their economies recovered, greenhouse gas emissions under the EU Emissions Trading System alone rose more than 7 percent. Furthermore, European governments are currently attempt to lower the price of energy from fossil fuels by slashing taxes on the consumption of gasoline, thus counteracting their own stated intention to discourage the use of fossil fuel-driven cars. In Europe, too, analysts therefore are wary of a rebound in emissions. China has announced that it will peak greenhouse gas emissions before 2030 and become carbon neutral before 2060. That means it will have to achieve the world's highest carbon emission reduction\u-243 from carbon peak to carbon neutrality\u-243 in the shortest time in world history. While it has achieved progress in the past two years, this remains challenging as China's per capita electricity consumption is currently still increasing. Transformation of the country's coal-based energy structure cannot be reached overnight: reality has to be taken into account. China should not only have a green and clean environment, but also ensure that production and life are normal. It is therefore important for China to flesh out its policy framework and describe in greater detail how its aims will be achieved on the provincial, city and industry levels. In the interest of maintaining energy security and combating price rises, the US, the EU and China currently all favor a more flexible approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Were such tendencies to persist, they could become a challenge to the realization of the lofty goals agreed at the 2015 Paris Conference. To successfully master such a challenge, timely and effective trilateral cooperation is needed. This will have to be addressed at the UN Climate Change Conference to be held in Egypt ( COP 27 ) in November 2022.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi Monday called on developed countries to fulfill their climate pledges to help developing countries that suffer the most from the climate crisis. Sisi made the remarks in an inaugurating speech to the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit, which gathers heads of state and government worldwide here at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. (Egypt- COP27 -Climate Pledge) - - - - BAGHDAD -- Iraqi rescue teams on Monday continue to search for the 11 missing people believed to have been buried in the rubbles of a building that was engulfed by a massive fire on Sunday in central Baghdad.

Seven African presidents will travel to the Netherlands next month in search of promised funds to help their countries cope with the disastrous forces of climate change. Still, their European counterparts plan to forgo the meeting, with experts anticipating a flop. According to Politico, the summit will be the first significant test of the rich world's pledge to double its financial support for climate-proofing projects in poorer nations to approximately $40 billion per year by 2025. The promise was made at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, the U.K., last November. Significant as it is, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is the only European leader planning to attend in person, which is probably the case given that the event will be hosted in his own home country, meaning he simply has no other option but to attend. Organizers from the Global Centre on Adaptation said they had invited leaders from countries that have traditionally contributed to financing initiatives for climate change adaptation, including France, Denmark, Finland, and Norway. But none of those countries'leaders have committed to making the short trip to Rotterdam to attend the summit in person, despite the anticipated presence of seven presidents from Senegal, Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zambia. The European Commission will be represented by Executive Vice President for the Green Deal Frans Timmermans. A spokesperson revealed that the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had also received and declined an invite, the EU's top leader likewise having somewhere else to be, Politico reported. Experts warn the summit could fall flat if European leaders fail to reciprocate the enthusiasm of their African counterparts and instead choose to solely prioritize domestic issues in the face of a generational cost-of-living crisis now gripping the continent. Development finance for adaptation projects like sea walls, drought-resistant infrastructure and early warning systems for extreme weather events lags far behind in terms of the amount of funding outlays made for emissions-cutting projects like solar farms, projects that can more readily generate a handsome income and attract private investment. In 2020, roughly a third of international climate finance  some $28.6 billion  was spent on adaptation. "Adaptation is not as sexy as mitigation. It's egregiously underfunded. So that's a hard sell in the best of times," Theodore Murphy, director of the Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Politico, adding: "It's probably not the best time in Europe to be raising funds for something that nobody cares all that much about." \</doc>

Drought this year in China, floods in Pakistan and forest fires across Europe demonstrate the need for an immediate global response to climate change. Yet, as the next United Nations Climate Change Conference ( COP 27 ) to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, in November draws ever closer, signs of progress are slight. Indeed, with the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the vast increase in the wholesale price of natural gas, the risks of regression\u-243 increasing carbon emissions by reinstating coal burning plants or opening new gas fields\u-243 are very real. Such slippage is dangerous in that it creates a precedent for again prioritizing the short over the longer term, favoring this generation at the expense of future ones. Even if the slippage is only temporary, the transition will need to be more rapid\u-243 potentially more brutal\u-243 if targets for carbon reduction are to be met. There is much talk of a just transition in the context of the need to rapidly respond to climate change. As the term is used by the International Labour Organization, a just transition focuses attention on the loss of carbon-dirty jobs necessary to reach zero-carbon emissions, and on the importance of meaningfully compensating those people and communities affected. This is important in reminding policymakers that change can create casualties and do long-term damage unless managed justly. Many of the regions in Europe and North America where carbon-heavy industries closed over 40 years ago are still characterized today by multiple deprivation. In China, income losses affecting workers in State-owned enterprises are minimized by redeployment and relatively generous social security payments but the consequences for private sector employment are less clear. However, issues of justice in the global transition to a low carbon economy do not arise only with respect to the individuals immediately affected. Distributional justice\u-243 who benefits and loses, and which people and organizations are encouraged or required to change their behavior\u-243 is clearly important. So is procedural justice\u-243 who participates in the decision-making and how\u-243 and recognition of power asymmetries and institutional discrimination and oppression. COP 26, held in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021, demonstrated procedural injustice at a global scale with industrial might silencing valid complaints of longstanding exploitation. The fossil-fuel lobby had 503 delegates\u-243 more than any country\u-243 while the largest non-plenary room had just 144 seats, less than the number of parties to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. With aspirations to limit temperature rises to 1.5 C in the year 2100, the most optimistic estimates after Glasgow suggested a 1.8 C increase. Wang Yi, senior advisor to the Chinese delegation of COP 26, observed that "if we are going to aim for 1.5 C instead of 2 C, there has to be an increase in funds available to make that happen". Developed countries at COP 26 deferred on their promise of jointly investing $100 billion in supporting developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. No less than 11 African countries currently spend more on climate adaptation than on health. Additionally, there was no agreement on establishing finance for loss and damage. The United States alone is estimated to have inflicted $1.9 trillion in damage on other countries from the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Away from the disappointments of Glasgow COP 26, President Xi Jinping proposed a Global Development Initiative before the General Debate of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly. In doing so, he reminded world leaders that combating climate change is one element in a much broader global agenda focused on 17 sustainable development goals to be achieved as early as 2030. He advocated a "new type of international relations based on mutual respect, equity, justice" to "accommodate common development and progress of all countries".And to help address the "huge funding gap", he said that China "will allocate more of its own development cooperation resources" to the GDI. At the launch meeting of the Group of Friends of GDI in January 2022, Zhang Jun, the permanent representative of China to the United Nations, reemphasized the importance of development, suggesting that the eight priorities of the GDI were chosen to ensure the achievement of all 17 SDGs. Of the eight priorities, climate change, poverty alleviation and food security reflect the challenge of the green transition, while industrialization, the digital economy, and connectivity are the means of facilitating it. Zhang further opined that the GDI, "with development as its priority and commitment to people-centered development, aims to protect and promote human rights through development". Some Western skeptics question the coupling of human rights with development and find difficulty in appreciating the importance of common development and common prosperity. In the former case, they overlook the core principle of progressive realization: a state's compliance with its obligation to take appropriate measures is assessed in the light of the resources\u-243 financial and others\u-243 available to it. Development is a fundamental prerequisite for the full realization of human rights. In the latter case, they ignore the principle of a just transition: the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of policies pertaining to transition. Policies that benefit shareholders but not workers or those laid off are patently unjust; so are those that further enrich developed countries at the expense of developing ones. If all in a community cannot benefit from a transition, the disbenefits should at least be minimized and fairly allocated. Principles of justice differ from other kinds of moral concern in that they establish\u-243 or should establish\u-243 rightfully enforceable expectations or entitlements. In more affluent jurisdictions, therefore, polluters are liable to punishment while consumers of carbon fuels miss out on the subsidies available to users of green energy. It is less evident, though, that procedural justice is invariably enforced or that the least powerful do not bear a disproportionate share of the disbenefits of transition. Lacking resources and access to technical expertise and investment, developing countries find transition difficult. Additionally burdened by debt to the developed world, just transition becomes almost impossible. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202209/22/632b8e8ca3109375854cd9bb.png Link to Image XING WEI/FOR CHINA DAILY \~ \~ Yang Lichao is an associate professor at the School of Sociology at Beijing Normal University.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has been hitting the headlines the world over with the North-South debate on climate change heating up since its opening. The gathering takes place as the world has been afflicted with a global polycrisis. During the past year, overshadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries were suffering from geopolitical conflicts, elevated energy and food prices, soaring inflation, and last but not least - frequent extreme weather conditions. Using the energy shortage as an excuse, some European countries have fallen back to traditional energy sources such as coal. Hit by the financial crisis, some have temporarily put aside the battle against climate change. Meanwhile, developing countries battered by climate disasters are craving for financial and technical support, while developed countries have never fulfilled their pledge made in 2009 to provide 100 billion U.S. dollars annually in climate finance. Under such challenging global circumstances, as a participant and leader in the process of and contributor to enhancing global ecological conservation, China has always been committed to a path of green development, contributing to enhancing global climate governance through a wide range of pragmatic actions. LOSS AND DAMAGE At COP27 , loss and damage is a frequently mentioned topic. With the joint efforts of a large number of developing countries, the loss and damage funding was introduced as an agenda item for the first time in the 30-year history of the UN climate change conference. However, the vulnerable countries are strongly demanding climate damage compensations at COP27 , to which developed countries, who made historical contributions to global climate change, have turned a deaf ear. Disappointing still is not only their failure to repay the climate debt they owed to poor countries, but their reckless reopening of coal power plants, which jeopardizes global progress in reducing emissions. Such retrogressive and irresponsible behaviors are blasted by developing countries, not least the vulnerable ones susceptible to the impacts of imminent global climate change. Naz Baloch, member of Pakistan's National Assembly and parliamentary secretary on climate change, pointed out that the developed countries have been reluctant to fulfill their pledge to provide 100 billion dollars in climate finance as they do not "understand the significance of climate change and have their own priorities." "What happened in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan," said Baloch. "No country is immune to climate change." Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni lashed out at Europe's return to coal energy, deeming it "brazen double standards" towards Africa in its climate and energy policies. "We will not accept one rule for them and another rule for us," Museveni wrote in his blog released at COP27 . Magdy Allam, an Egyptian climate and environment expert, also accused Europe of "escaping its climate change obligation," saying that the energy crisis in Europe "shows the world that we should search for alternatives and turn to the green economy and change our concepts of consuming energy." "We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit, adding that "the planet is fast approaching the tipping point that will make climate chaos irreversible." "Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish," the UN chief warned at the leader summit. TOGETHER FOR IMPLEMENTATION As the main slogan of COP27 , "Together for Implementation" calls on representatives of developing countries to speak up with a louder and stronger collective voice. "What do we need? Climate justice!" "We need your help!" chanted a group of advocates wearing traditional costumes of South Pacific countries at the COP27 venue. "We hope that COP27 can begin to make a change just like what people are talking about, moving pledge into implementation. Climate finance is the building block, and this is the core problem that we need to resolve," said Satyendra Prasad, Fiji's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the Moana blue pacific pavilion organized by 14 South Pacific countries that are most prone to climate change. South Pacific countries need "speedy" funds to battle climate change, he said, adding that the climate finance Fiji received over the past years only accounts for 10 percent of the required amount. "We realize the pain because we've been through it, and we want the rest of the world to understand how tough it is. We should act before it's too late," Baloch said. The UN chief expressed his support for developing countries in demanding climate finance. "Adaptation needs in the developing world are set to skyrocket to as much as 340 billion U.S. dollars a year by 2030. Yet adaptation support today stands at less than one-tenth of that amount," Guterres said. "The most vulnerable people and communities are paying the price. This is unacceptable," he stressed. Xie Zhenhua, special representative for Chinese President Xi Jinping and China's special envoy for climate change, also made clear China's position on this issue. "It has been 13 years since developed countries pledged 100 billion dollars a year at the Copenhagen conference in 2009, but it has not yet been fulfilled until now," he said. "What we need to do here is not to renegotiate the Paris Agreement, but to translate commitments into action and produce solid results," the Chinese envoy noted. "There are many ways to support clean energy in the developing world, one of them is the promise of 100 billion dollars annually and I really hope that the advanced economies will honor their commitments, either during this COP27 or right after," Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) told Xinhua. STORY OF HOPE As a responsible developing country, China not only stands in solidarity with other developing countries at COP27 , but also makes its due contributions to combating global climate change with pragmatic actions. During the past decade, China has made impressive progress in reducing carbon emissions and achieving renewable transition. From 2012 to 2021, China sustained average economic growth of 6.6 percent with an annual increase of 3 percent in energy consumption. Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP reduced by 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, equivalent to saving of 1.4 billion tonnes of standard coal. China also drew a timetable and roadmap for carbon peak and carbon neutrality, and steadily promote energy transformation with installed capacities of hydropower, wind power and solar power generation ranking first in the world. China has become a major producer and buyer of new energy vehicles and established the world's largest carbon market, three times bigger than the European Union's. In 2018, China incorporated ecological advancement into its Constitution for the first time. "All the efforts that China has announced are very much appreciated. Raising the ambition in accelerating the climate action for more reduction of emissions would be vital to the whole world climate and for saving our humanity," said Egypt's Minister of Environment Yasmine Fouad. During talks with the Chinese delegation at COP27 , the UN chief praised China's accelerating green transformation and focus on pragmatic actions as well as China's efforts in developing renewable energy. Guterres voiced hope that the Chinese delegation will continue to exert its influence during COP27 , strengthen communication and coordination with all parties, and contribute to the global response to climate change. China's strenuous effort in developing renewable energy to replace fossil fuels has been a "story of hope" in fighting climate change, said Kevin Conrad, executive director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations. "China for us is a good example of the types of investment that need to be made. China is showing the world hope," he said. \</doc>

Despite some progress at COP27 , developed countries have been blamed for taking a passive attitude toward issues such as providing financial and technical support to the more vulnerable developing countries.  As the conference closed on Nov. 20, African experts and civil society organizations found no good news for communities that are facing prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall and flooding.  While developed countries are turning a deaf ear to Africa's call for deeper cooperation on green development, many developing countries, including China, are reaching out to the continent with utmost sincerity. KAMPALA, Nov. 27 (Xinhua) -- Many African participants walked into the UN climate conference held earlier this month in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh with much optimism, but came out with unmet expectations. The two-week gathering, also known as the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), sought to move from negotiations to implementation and call for actions when extreme weather events are impacting the lives of millions of people worldwide. Despite some progress at COP27 , including a decision to set up a "loss and damage" fund and an agreement to establish a global adaptation framework, developed countries have been blamed for taking a passive attitude toward issues such as providing financial and technical support to the more vulnerable developing countries. AFRICAN PARTICIPANTS DISAPPOINTED Africa accounts for 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but suffers the most from them, noted African climate campaigners, adding that 20 percent of the continent's population live in countries that are in the top 10 most vulnerable to climate change. This year alone, the continent has seen deadly flooding in parts of West Africa and the worst drought in decades in the Horn of Africa. Some 22 million people in the Horn of Africa are food insecure due to drought. Figures from the World Food Programme showed that at least 9.2 million livestock deaths occurred in the drought-affected areas of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia in 2022. In Nigeria, more than 600 people have been killed and over 3.2 million affected as a result of the flooding that hit more than 30 states in the country this year. At the start of COP27 , Chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat called for climate justice to address the damage Africa has suffered due to climate change effects, appealing to the developed world to honour their promise made at COP26 to double funding by 2025. However, as the conference closed on Nov. 20, African experts and civil society organizations found no good news for communities that are facing prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall and flooding. Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a collection of civil society organizations, said COP27 ended leaving millions of Africans in continued climate-related misery. Africans left COP27 disappointed, said PACJA Executive Director Mithika Mwenda. "We came with the hope that the momentum created by the discussions in the year ahead of COP27 under the facilitation of UNFCCC, the COP Presidency, and the facilitation of friends of the COP will materialize with concrete outcomes in Egypt. But unfortunately, the end of COP is an anti-climax," he said. While describing the "loss and damage" fund agreement as a "much needed political signal to rebuild broken trust," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it is not enough to address concerns. "A fund for loss and damage is essential, but it's not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map, or turns an entire African country to desert," he said. BRAZEN DOUBLE STANDARD Thirteen years ago in Copenhagen, developed countries promised to mobilize 100 billion U.S. dollars per year for climate actions in developing countries, but have so far defaulted with all kinds of excuses. In 2021, nearly 200 participating countries adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact at the end of COP26, which includes an unprecedented goal for developed countries to double the funding provided to developing ones for adaptation by 2025. However, doubts were high that developed countries would again fail to honor their commitment. This year at COP27 , some rich nations attempted to cancel their long-delayed climate finance pledge, and although an agreement to establish a global adaptation framework was reached at the end of the conference, it lacked clarity and a credible roadmap to double adaptation funds. And while developed countries are going back on their word and are returning to coal energy, especially amid a lingering energy crisis, some of them have been ordering developing countries to speed up green energy transition. In mid-September, the European Parliament passed an emergency resolution urging Uganda and Tanzania to halt the construction of a crude oil pipeline that passes on a 1,445-km journey from the oil wells in western Uganda to the Tanzanian seaport of Tanga, saying it threatens the "protected and sensitive" ecosystems. The move was described as hypocrisy by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who said later at COP27 that Europe is applying "brazen double standard" towards Africa in its climate and energy policies. "We will not accept one rule for them and another rule for us," Museveni wrote on his blog. The African Development Bank's 2022 Africa Economic Outlook projected that Africa will need to mobilize as much as 1.6 trillion dollars between 2022 and 2030 to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions to fight climate change. But as the developed world has failed to meet its finance commitment to the continent's green energy transition, a few experts in Africa, like Jonathan Tabalanga, an international relations expert and lecturer at Uganda's Cavendish University, fear that the continent may be left with no options but to continue using fossil fuels for development. "Africa is confronted with a decision to make on whether to get their people out of poverty through industrialization, which is also a problem to the environment, or resort to eco-friendly means of production which are extremely expensive," Tabalanga said. WALKING THE TALK In late June, the AU published its Climate Change and Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan (2022-2032) and described it as "a key instrument in supporting regional collaboration on climate change and more effective international partnerships." "There is a need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of transboundary cooperation to ensure that decision-making and investment occur at appropriate timeframes to respond to the speed of changes in the climate and environment," said the document. While developed countries are turning a deaf ear to Africa's call for deeper cooperation on green development, many developing countries, including China, are reaching out to the continent with utmost sincerity. At the 8th Ministerial Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation held last year, China proposed that the two sides advocate green and low-carbon development, and actively promote solar, wind and other sources of renewable energy, saying it will work closely with African countries to implement the green development program in the years to come. China has walked the talk. For example, in De Aar, a town in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, Chinese company Longyuan Power has partnered with local firms on a wind power project that has been in operation since 2017 with an installed capacity of nearly 245 MW. Chinese-built Adama wind farms, installed with 102 turbines with a total generating capacity of 153 MW, is helping Ethiopia tap into its rich renewable energy potential. In Kenya, official figures showed that the installed capacity of solar power is more than 100 MW, while the China-financed Garissa Solar accounts for 50 MW. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said recently that his country hopes to learn from China's experience in green development and energy transition, and is ready to actively participate in the Belt and Road cooperation. At a time when the world is facing an energy crisis, China continues to make solid progress in dealing with climate change and plays an important role in advancing the global response to climate change, said UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell when meeting with the Chinese delegation to COP27 . "China can be a very good contributor to the advanced levels of keeping Africa green because they are technologically more advanced. They can come and help us with solar, wind energy. Those areas are important," said Tabalanga, the Ugandan expert. \</doc>

CANBERRA, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has announced it will bid to co-host the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference in 2026 with Pacific nations. Chris Bowen, minister for Climate Change and Energy, recently said the government has decided against bidding to host the 29th session of the Conference of Parties (COP29) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2024, and will instead focus on 2026. "Our delegation at COP27 and our COP31 bid will go a long way to help drive Australia's economic transformation to a net-zero economy, and strengthen green trade partnerships and secure jobs for Australian workers," he said in a media release on Saturday. He said the upcoming COP27 , slated for Nov. 6-18 in Egypt, is an opportunity to showcase Australia's renewed climate leadership, "as we demonstrate our potential as a renewable energy superpower." The announcement has been welcomed by environmentalists. Dermot O'Gorman from the World Wide Fund For Nature said hosting COP31 would "revive" Australia's reputation on climate issues. "This is an Olympic moment -- a huge opportunity to host a nation-building global event," he told the Australian Associated Press. At the COP27 in Egypt, Australia's delegation will demonstrate the government's commitment to action on climate change, according to Bowen. Enditem \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable progress toward its goals of reaching peak carbon emissions and carbon neutralization, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua said Sunday. He made the remarks at a side event themed "Green Life, Joint Efforts and Shared Benefits -- Advocating Public Participation in Taking Green Actions" in China's pavilion at the venue of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to COP27 and vice minister of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, also attended the meeting. Xie pointed out that China has actively implemented the Paris Agreement, and further enhanced its nationally determined contribution, aiming to reach carbon peak and achieve carbon neutralization in a strong, orderly and effective manner. "China has made great progress in this regard," Xie said. According to preliminary calculations, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions China produces per unit of GDP in 2021 is 3.8 percent lower than that in 2020 and 50.8 percent than in 2005, he said. The Chinese envoy added that China has been actively creating a green and low-carbon atmosphere for years, encouraging the public to participate in carbon emissions reduction, and exploring to establish a pluralistic mechanism of social participation. He said that China has also integrated ecological civilization into its national education system and strengthened ecological education in schools. "Public participation is an important driving force for green and low-carbon development and a key indicator for the modernization of the environmental governability and governance system in a country," Xie said. Under the principles of openness and transparency, broad participation, consensus and party-driven, China will work with all parties to promote the success of COP27 and contribute China's wisdom and strength to building a fair, reasonable and win-win global climate governance system, he added. At the side event, representatives from China's enterprises, scientific research institutions and social organizations, such as Tsinghua University and All-China Environment Federation, jointly discussed cases, challenges and recommendations for public participation in low-carbon action. Starting on Sunday, the COP27 will last till Nov. 18 in the coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt. \</doc>

KIGALI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has launched a new green investment facility to spur investment in the private sector-led green growth in the country by availing sustainable finance. Dubbed Ireme Invest, the investment facility with 104 million U.S. dollars initial capitalization provided by the Development Bank of Rwanda and other partners, was launched as a side event at the COP27 which opened in Egypt on Monday. The launch of Ireme Invest is a significant milestone for Rwanda, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said during the event. "Ireme Invest embodies Rwanda's commitment to achieving tangible results toward a green economy through public-private partnerships in key areas," he said. He noted that climate adaptation requires big changes in how countries produce and consume energy."How we move around, all that depends on climate adaptation and change. What we eat and how its grown; all that comes together. In short the entire economy is affected, which means the private sector has a tremendous role to play," said Kagame. According to Kagame, whether the progress made at the COP27 is big or small, there are still many tools available to countries to get things done on the ground. "That is really the key point we are driving home with the launch of Ireme Invest, and with green public-private partnership generally," he said. World leaders, government representatives, experts, representatives of the private sector and policymakers have gathered at the COP27 to discuss pressing matters on climate change and effective responses.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- The 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change kicked off on Sunday in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, introducing for the first time the loss and damage funding into the agenda. Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister and president of COP27 , said during the opening press conference that he is pleased to see the Parties agreed to introduce loss and damage funding as an agenda item, adding that the world needs a "qualitative leap to confront climate change's challenges." The term "loss and damage" in UN climate negotiations refers to expenses already incurred as a result of climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels or extreme heat waves. While current climate funding focuses on cutting carbon emissions to prevent climate change in the future, establishing a "loss and damage" fund means compensating countries that can't avoid or "adapt" to the changes that have already happened. The Egyptian diplomat also noted that numerous burdens and crises are brought on by the current global geopolitical environment, adding those need to be handled so that they will not affect progress in achieving commitments related to combating climate change. Shoukry said that the countries of the African continent are among the countries that suffer from problems and issues of climate change. "The countries of the African continent have shown their willingness to confront climate change, but they need support," Shoukry said. Shoukry presided over a meeting earlier in the day to finalize the COP27 agenda, which included numerous items that aim to adapt to the effects of climate change, mitigate its negative repercussions, and ways to provide climate finance. During the meeting, Shoukry stressed the need to confront the negative effects of climate change during the two-week conference, where over 40,000 participants from over 190 countries and dozens of international and regional organizations will try to work together and seek possible solutions to one of the biggest challenges the world is facing. Meanwhile, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said that COP27 comes at a very sensitive time in which the world is exposed to "existential dangers." "There is no doubt that these dangers and challenges require quick action by all countries to lay down a rescue roadmap that protects the world from the effects of climate change," Sisi said in an official statement on his Facebook page. The Egyptian president added that his country is looking forward that the climate conference could turn promises into implementation. Meanwhile, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly inaugurated the Green Zone, which will witness many events and activities on the sidelines of COP27 . Madbouly explained that the area allocated to the Green Zone is much larger than any previous climate summits, pointing out that this reflects an important message from Egypt. "Egypt represents the continent of Africa in this summit, which will witness for the first time the allocation of 'Africa Day.' The event will discuss ideas of African youths and all the entities that represent the black continent," Madbouly said during the opening of the zone. He stressed that while the African continent is one of the regions most affected by the negative consequences of climate change, African countries have only emitted 4 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. Therefore, he said, organizing the conference in Africa is a real opportunity to send clear messages to the whole world that Africa needs great support in order to deal with climate change. \</doc>

COPENHAGEN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Participants in the International Energy Agency's (IEA) 7th Annual Global Conference on Energy Efficiency, taking place in Sonderborg in southern Denmark between June 7 and June 9, pledged on Wednesday to "turbocharge energy efficiency progress to combat the energy crisis and meet the climate goals." "Energy efficiency is a critical solution to so many of the world's most urgent challenges -- it can simultaneously make our energy supplies more affordable, more secure and more sustainable," IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said . "The oil shocks of the 1970s set in motion major advances in efficiency, and it is utterly essential that efficiency is at the heart of the response to today's global energy crisis." The gravity of the crisis is underscored by the publication of a new IEA report, timed to coincide with the global conference, which urges delegates to seek "a rapid solution to the crippling effects of the spike in energy prices, strengthening energy security and tackling climate change." The analysis says that a "global push on efficiency would help create 10 million additional jobs in fields ranging from building retrofits to manufacturing and transport infrastructure." According to Dan Jorgensen, Denmark's minister of climate, energy and utilities, the current pressure on Europe's energy security makes energy efficiency even more important. "By saving energy, we also reduce demand. So, we are not as dependent as we used to be on fossil fuels," Jorgensen told Xinhua. According to the IEA analysis, doubling the current global rate of energy intensity improvement to 4 percent per year could reduce final energy consumption by 95 exajoules per year by the end of the decade. Global carbon emissions would be reduced by an additional 5 billion tonnes per year by 2030. Jorgensen said he expected Denmark's experiences with renewable energy and energy-efficient solutions to serve as a model for other countries. "China is a huge country with a huge potential for growth in a sustainable way, which is also the goal of the Chinese government," he said. "If we in any way can help with some of our solutions, our technology, then that will be great," he added. This year's global conference is jointly organized by the IEA and Denmark's Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, with support from Danish engineering company Danfoss. The conference is attended by approximately 25 ministers from around the world, as well as United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) President Alok Sharma, African Union Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy Amani Abou-Zeid, and European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson.

The COP27 is to be held from Nov. 6 to18 in Egypt's resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Photo: Xinhua China has made remarkable progress toward its goals of reaching peak carbon emissions and carbon neutralization, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua said Sunday during this year's UN climate summit in Egypt. According to preliminary calculations, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions China produces per unit of GDP in 2021 is 3.8 percent lower than that in 2020 and 50.8 percent than in 2005, he said, according to the Xinhua News Agency. He made the remarks at a side event themed "Green Life, Joint Efforts and Shared Benefits -- Advocating Public Participation in Taking Green Actions" in China's pavilion at the venue of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to COP27 , also attended the meeting. Starting on Sunday, the COP27 will last until November 18 in the coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, Xinhua reported. Xie pointed out that China has actively implemented the Paris Agreement, and further enhanced its nationally determined contribution, aiming to reach carbon peak and achieve carbon neutralization in a strong, orderly and effective manner. "China has made great progress in this regard," Xie said. The Chinese envoy added that China has been actively creating a green and low-carbon atmosphere for years, encouraging the public to participate in carbon emissions reduction, and exploring to establish a pluralistic mechanism of social participation. He said that China has also integrated ecological civilization into its national education system and strengthened ecological education in schools. "Public participation is an important driving force for green and low-carbon development and a key indicator for the modernization of the environmental governability and governance system in a country," Xie said. Under the principles of openness and transparency, broad participation, consensus and party-driven, China will work with all parties to promote the success of COP27 and contribute China's wisdom and strength to building a fair, reasonable and win-win global climate governance system, he added. Separately, Zhao Yingmin, also\~vice minister of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said on Sunday at a side event on the theme of "Pollution Reduction and Carbon Reduction Synergy: Achieving Win-Win for Environment, Climate and Economic Benefits" hosted by the ministry that the Chinese government attaches great importance to addressing climate change and has accelerated the implementation of its "dual carbon" goal in an all-round way. China implements a national strategy to actively address climate change, and unswervingly follows the path of ecological priority, green and low-carbon development, said Zhao. China has accelerated the implementation of its "dual carbon" goal, which is to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, in an all-round way, including establishing a national agency to coordinate the top-level design of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality and issuing the guidelines on how to achieve the goal, Zhao said. Given that the emissions of environmental pollutants and carbon dioxide have the same root and process, China regards the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction as a starting point for promoting a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development, he said. "The road of quality development is to reduce carbon while reducing pollution, and reduce pollution while reducing carbon, so as to realize the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction, and achieve a win-win situation for environmental, climate, economic and social benefits," he said. China will speed up building a Chinese-style modernization "in which human and nature coexist in harmony," promote green production methods and lifestyles, and actively participate in global climate governance, said the vice minister. "Together with the international community, we will jointly implement policies and actions to achieve synergies in pollution reduction and carbon reduction, and work together to contribute Chinese wisdom and strength to building a clean and beautiful world," Zhao said.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- The developed countries should fulfill their promise of providing 100 billion U.S. dollars in climate finance as soon as possible and draw a road map for doubling the adaptation fund, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua said Tuesday. Xie, also the special representative for Chinese President Xi Jinping, made the remarks in an address to the Climate Implementation Summit at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Facing the grave challenges posed by the frequent extreme weather events that have caused heavy losses on every continent and by the emergence of energy and food crises this year, multilateralism, solidarity and cooperation remain the only way out of the predicament, Xie said. China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua addresses the Climate Implementation Summit at the COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Nov. 8, 2022. (Xinhua/Sui Xiankai) Meanwhile, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the mechanism of nationally determined contributions are still the "inevitable choice" to overcome the climate challenges, he said. As the UNFCCC marks its 30th anniversary this year and the Paris Agreement has entered the stage of full implementation, the COP27 shoulders the important mission of upholding the consensus on the UNFCCC principles and promoting pragmatic actions by all parties, the Chinese envoy said. Noting that China has been actively tackling climate change with persistent and pragmatic actions, Xie said that, with the recent successful conclusion of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China's determination to follow the path of green development was further strengthened. "China's firm determination and position to implement the goals of reaching carbon peak and achieving carbon neutralization, and to actively participate in global climate governance will never change," Xie vowed. He expressed the hope that the COP27 will focus on the implementation of promises, while urging the developed countries to take the lead in exerting more effective efforts to reduce emissions so to achieve carbon neutralization significantly ahead of schedule, and achieve substantive results on the adaptation and finance issues. China hopes that "the developed countries will fulfill their pledge of providing 100 billion U.S. dollars as soon as possible and draw a road map for doubling adaptation finance to enhance mutual trust and joint action between the North and the South," Xie said. "We are willing to work with all parties to adhere to multilateralism, build a fair and reasonable global climate governance system with win-win cooperation, and make greater contribution to tackling the challenges posed by global climate change," he added. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) -- The 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) opened on Sunday in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh in hopes to turn global climate finance pledges into action. During his speech at the opening ceremony, Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry stressed the need to confront the negative effects of climate change during the two-week conference, where more than 120 world leaders will seek possible solutions to climate change challenges. "Climate change threatens human life, and the development pattern in the industrial field which is no longer sustainable must be changed because this will lead to dire consequences," Shoukry warned. "We have witnessed during this year painful events in Pakistan, the African continent and various parts of Europe and America. All these events and the destruction and impact represent a lesson to be learned and alarm all over the planet ... to more precaution, and to act quickly to take all necessary measures as per our commitments and pledges," he said. The COP27 president also underscored the importance of the participation of non-state actors, including the private sector, banks, international finance institutions, civil society, youth associations and indigenous associations, for the sake of an efficient implementation of pledges and commitments. "Climate change-related efforts over the past decades were remarkably polarized, which has slowed down progress of the negotiations," Shoukry said, adding the pledge to mobilize 100 billion U.S. dollars per year has not yet been honored. Meanwhile, Alok Sharma, president of COP26 hosted in Glasgow, Scotland, urged unity to keep the 1.5-degree-Celsius goal within reach, highlighting the important role finance will play in this conference. "We know that we have reached a point where finance makes or breaks the progress of the program ahead of us," he noted. "This summit must be about concrete actions and I hope when the world leaders join us today, they will explain what their countries achieved during the last year and how they will go further," the British politician said.

Shanghai pledged further efforts to push forward the green economy and decarbonization initiatives, as city officials and multinational executives attended the 34th annual meeting of the International Business Leaders' Advisory Council (IBLAC) for the Mayor of Shanghai on Friday night. This year the conference was held under the theme of "Promoting green, low-carbon development for urban sustainability." Abbott and OMRON Corporation are two new members that joined dozens of multinationals to offer their recommendation for the city's decarbonization efforts. Starting with 12 members from seven countries in the late 1980s, its membership has expanded to nearly 50 from 16 nations. A total of 37 council members and three honorary members joined the virtual meeting from 24 countries and regions. PwC Global Chairman Robert Moritz chaired the conference, and three vice chairmen were TOSHIBA Corporation chairman Satoshi Tsunakawa, Roche Group CEO Severin Schwan and Tishman Speyer president and CEO Rob Speyer. Alok Sharma, full-time president for COP 26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference , was the special guest speaker. A total of 14 papers were selected as outstanding for their extensive case studies in overseas metropolis, solid suggestions for the Shanghai government and relevant stakeholders. Shanghai Party Secretary Li Qiang said the city is still full of resilience and vibrancy, and it's still committed to opening up and deepening international collaboration. "We hope the IBLAC to serve as a bridge, and we welcome more leading multinational companies to set up their businesses in Shanghai to share development opportunities," he said. "Green and low-carbon emissions is an inevitable trend and also an important aspect for future technology and industry development revolution," he added. "We welcome all parties to put forward words of wisdom and contribute to Shanghai's sustainable development." Shanghai considers low-carbon and green economies a crucial sector and will enhance investment and relevant initiatives, he noted. Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng said the city will continue to enhance environmental protection and governance and intends to pursue a high-quality development model that prioritises ecological and low-carbon development. "We believe Shanghai will emerge again full of strength and vitality with an open and positive stance and we hope to draw inspirations and ideas through deeper connections and exchange with multinationals during the IBLAC sessions," he said. Cosmetics giant L'Or\'e9al proposes that Shanghai focuses on sustainable consumption with a "Shanghai model," sci-tech innovation solutions driving adoption of sustainable consumption behaviors and boosting Shanghai's positioning as an "international consumer center." Chairman of L'Or\'e9al Group Jean-Paul Agon said the company envisages three critical roles for the Shanghai government. He expects Shanghai would become a "blueprint planner" in bolstering standards enforcement and regulation in sci-tech innovation, and an "industrial enabler" to provide targeted support for critical elements that underpin sci-tech innovation in sustainable consumption, as well a "best practice advocate" for others to follow with flagship initiatives. Chair of Board of Managing Directors and CEO of Boehringer Ingelheim Hubertus von Baumbach commented that it believes Shanghai can emulate global best practices to fully leverage the combination of government policies and market-based solutions to achieve sustainable social-economic development and the ambition of an international healthy city. He expects the city to continue the development of renewable energy and carbon reduction technologies, as well as including the biopharma industry in its overall carbon reduction initiative. Danone CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique noted that as the core engine of the Chinese economy, Shanghai has a leading and exemplary role in promoting the ESG concept. He suggests that government, ESG ratings agencies, companies and investors have a joint responsibility for exploring ESG practices in line with Chinese characteristics and Shanghai's distinctive features, drawing on the experience and expertise of international institutional guarantees and corporate practice. \</doc>

Photo: VCG Editor's Note: The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) concluded in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt on Sunday. The conference reached a relatively balanced package of outcomes and sent a positive signal of upholding multilateralism and a jointly enhanced response to the global climate crisis. China attached great importance to this meeting, and fully supported Egypt in making it a success. In addition to the COP27 , China and Egypt have also initiated wide-ranging cooperation under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The Global Times reporter Xie Wenting (GT) interviewed the newly appointed Egyptian Ambassador to China Assem Hanafi (Hanafi) to elicit his thoughts on the COP27 , cooperation under the BRI, as well as the future of China-Egypt bilateral ties. GT: The COP27 just concluded. What were some of the highlights from the conference that you would like to share? Hanafi: Egypt believes that the climate crisis will aggravate social, economic, and environmental threats. Hence, urgent and serious actions are needed to address the climate crisis and to strengthen the implementation of a response with an aim to create a resilient planet. Egypt's priority in COP27 was to move from talks, negotiations, and planning to actual implementation. It is the time for action on the ground and we need to move quickly toward full, timely, inclusive, and at-scale action on the ground. In addition to that, there is a necessity to harmonize global efforts, and turn our pledges and commitments to action; this is our highest priority. We can all agree that in order to help developing countries address climate change, it is essential that we make significant progress on the crucial issue of climate finance while moving forward on all finance-related items on the agenda.\~ The importance of adequacy and predictability of climate finance is key to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. To this end there is a need for enhanced transparency on finance flows and facilitated access to meet the needs of developing countries especially African countries or LDCs (least developed countries). Developed nations need to take urgent measures to help climate-vulnerable developing countries to better cope with the impacts of climate change. Such measures include financing targeted infrastructure projects and mechanisms to share risk through financial markets. The economies of developing countries face accelerating climate threats such as hurricanes in the Caribbean and Latin America and floods in Asia and Africa. GT: How do you assess China's commitment to dealing with climate change at the COP27 ? Hanafi: China plays a pivotal role in combating climate change, and has supported various projects in line with the agenda. There is a mutual vision between our two countries when it comes to the necessity of continuing the global effort to mitigate climate change impacts, and compensate the least developed countries for losses and damages suffered, while commending the level of cooperation on these issues at the bilateral and multilateral levels.\~ China and the group of the 77 play a vital role in putting forward the interests of developing countries regarding climate change negotiations. The high level of cooperation between China and the Egyptian presidency of COP27 continues to become stronger, with far reaching results that will have lasting positive impacts for both peoples and the rest of the developing countries. Egyptian ambassador to China Assem Hanafi Photo: Courtesy of Egyptian embassy to China GT: How do you evaluate the implications of the COP27 on the world as it faces increasing climate change pressures?\~ Hanafi: Extreme weather events from heatwaves, floods, and forest fires have become an everyday reality in our lives. The Global Goal on Adaptation was one of the significant outcomes of the COP26. The COP27 should push forward an enhanced global agenda for action on adaptation, confirming what we agreed on in Paris and further elaborated on in the Glasgow pact with regard to placing adaptation at the forefront of global action. It is essential that we make significant progress on the crucial issue of climate finance while moving forward on all finance-related items on the agenda.\~ GT: How do you evaluate China's development over the last decade? What parts of China's development have impressed you the most? From your point of view, what are the development experiences that both countries can share with each other? Hanafi: I am a newcomer to China, as I just arrived in October 2022, and I have only visited Shanghai to participate in a forum on financing development at the New Development Bank (NDB). The Modern Chinese urban scene is impressive; a true cosmopolitanism with a vibrant lifestyle, fusing modern and ancient cultures, and I am looking forward to visiting many Chinese provinces in the coming period in order to strengthen cooperation between our two countries in various fields. China presented a remarkable model in achieving sustainable development, notably in eradicating extreme poverty, as it succeeded in elevating more than 800 million from extreme poverty by 2021 and 10 years ahead of the timeframe previously set by the sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030, which is considered an economic miracle by all means, and a case study that should be adopted by many developing countries, especially amid the major challenges that we are facing during the current period. Egypt and China are two ancient civilizations with a lot in common, and there is a huge opportunity for cooperation between the two friendly countries through cultural activities and people-to-people exchanges, that will be beneficial for both sides. Pursuant to the above, Egypt is also consolidating its efforts to combat poverty and elevate the living standards of its people, as H.E. Mr. Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, launched several national initiatives in this regard to achieve comprehensive and sustainable development goals, such as the Decent Life Initiative or Haya Karima, which aims to provide a decent life for the most vulnerable groups nationwide and contributes to enhancing the quality of daily public services provided to citizens, especially aimed at inhabitants of rural areas. The 2nd edition of the summit of the Green Middle East Initiative, held on the sidelines of the COP27 GT: How do you assess the cooperation between Egypt and China under the BRI? Hanafi: Egypt is part and parcel of the BRI, due to its unique geographical location among three continents, as it represents a gateway for the Chinese products to many foreign markets. Egypt succeeded in attracting Chinese investments under the BRI framework, and one of the flagship projects is the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone, as it has gradually become one of the important platforms for China-Egypt economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchange, attracting around 96 enterprises, 40 of which are manufacturing enterprises. The cooperation between the two countries under the BRI is robust, and is consistently expanding. We are looking forward to attracting more investments in TEDA over the coming period, as the project is expanding into additional phases, and the two sides succeeded in reaching an agreement on the China-aided vocational and technical training center project. GT: How do you evaluate the importance of economic cooperation between China and Egypt when the world is experiencing economic downturn pressures? Hanafi: Egypt and China are blessed with two ancient civilizations and long histories with enduring legacies to humanity, and their positive contributions have been manifested in various domains. Currently we are facing an unprecedented challenge that has not been witnessed for a century which had a severe impact on the economic development especially on developing countries and emerging markets, and now it's imperative to consolidate our efforts so that we can reach a solution as soon as possible. The cooperation between Egypt and China represents a remarkable model for South-South cooperation, China-Arab cooperation, and China-Africa cooperation, under the guidance and wisdom of presidents of the two countries, as the two countries succeeded in increasing the trade balance on an annual basis despite repercussions suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, in addition to the keenness of the two sides to expand cooperation in new fields, which was manifested in the joint COVID-19 vaccine production cooperation, as both countries signed an agreement in 2021 for the first joint Sinovac vaccine production in Africa, in addition to a cooperation agreement in January 2022 to establish a cold storage facility for vaccine storage and preservation, which can accommodate up to 150 million doses of coronavirus disease vaccines annually. It was successfully inaugurated in September 2021 and will enhance vaccine storage capacity in Egypt and make it a regional hub for vaccines in the African continent. In light of the above, the two countries can synergize their efforts through promoting trilateral cooperation in Africa in different fields especially the ones related to the basic needs and the elevation of the living standards of our African friends, which will have a win-win outcome for all parties and accelerate the frequency of sustainable development in the African continent. Egyptian pyramids Photo: VCG GT: What are your expectations for the future development of China-Egypt Relations? Hanafi: We are looking forward to strengthening the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two friendly countries under the leadership of the two presidents, and reach the desired goals, in addition to promoting\~ relations to a higher level, as both countries agreed in 2020 when H.E. Mr. Wang Yi, State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs in China, visited Egypt in January 2020 as his first stop in his African tour, in addition to enhancing the current level of cooperation to increase the trade volume between the two countries. Furthermore, Egypt is keen on promoting the level of coordination and mutual support with China in the multilateral platforms, as Egypt joined the New Development Bank in December 2021, and also joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) as a "dialogue partner" in September 2022 . \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt-- The 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change opened on Sunday in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh in hopes to turn global climate finance pledges into action. During his speech at the opening ceremony, Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry stressed the need to confront the negative effects of climate change during the two-week conference, where more than 120 world leaders will seek possible solutions to climate change challenges. (Egypt- COP27 -Opening) - - - - SANAA -- Yemen's government forces said on Sunday that it shot down two bomb-laden drones launched by the Houthi militia over the past 24 hours. In a statement aired by Yemeni TV, the army said that one drone was downed in the central province of Marib, while the other one was intercepted near Al-Hazm, the capital city of the northeastern province of Al-Jawf. A noticeable upsurge in Houthi attacks across Yemen since the six-month national peace collapsed on Oct. 2 has raised concerns about potential major confrontations. Yemen's internationally-recognized government said last week that it started to tighten up precautionary security measures around key production facilities in some southern regions. (Yemen-Houthis-Conflicts) - - - - ANKARA -- At least three people were killed and 32 others injured on Sunday in a traffic accident on a motorway in northwestern T\'fcrkiye, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.

African government officials, members of civil society and the private sector, and officials from the United Nations and multilateral agencies have called for collaboration on climate, as the continent continues to face devastating climate change effects, including extreme weather conditions, severe drought and floods. More than 1,000 delegates made the call during the ongoing Africa Climate Week 2022 in the Gabonese capital Libreville, which was aimed at discussing the threats and opportunities associated with climate change ahead of the COP27 UN Climate Change Conference scheduled for Nov 6-18 in Egypt. Speaking at the opening ceremony on Monday, Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba said droughts are causing extreme famine in Africa and displacing millions of people. "Today, 22 million people in the Horn of Africa face starvation because of climate-induced drought and famine. Countries in the south of the continent are regularly hit by deadly cyclones," he said. "Rising sea levels threaten megacities such as Dakar, Lagos, Cape Town and Libreville. COP27 is Africa's COP and will significantly shape the continent's future." Ondimba said Africa Climate Week can bring Africans together to walk down the road to the UN climate change conference with the unity of purpose and resolve to fight for a better future. "I urge you to take this opportunity to work on innovative, concrete and sustainable solutions, and give African nations the means to fight climate change successfully," Ondimba said. Ovais Sarmad, deputy executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said COP27 must be the implementation COP, where nations show how they will put the Paris Agreement to work in their countries through legislation, policies and programs. "In this time of mounting challenge, of crisis upon crisis, cooperation and consensus are fundamental to address the existential threat of climate change. And we must maintain our focus on that threat," he said. Sameh Shoukry, foreign minister of Egypt and president-designate of COP27 , said while Africa contributes to less than 4 percent of the world's energy-related emissions, it still faces serious consequences to the lives and livelihoods of its people. "Africa is obliged, with its already limited financial means and scant level of support, to spend around 2 to 3 percent of its GDP per annum to adapt to these impacts\u-243 a disproportionate responsibility that cannot be described as anything other than climate injustice," he said. Shoukry expressed the need for climate justice based on equity and the availability of means of implementation, and guided by the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Mahmoud Mohieldin, climate champion of COP27 , termed Africa Climate Week as an important moment for climate action in Africa to showcase the continent's contributions to the global movement to address climate change and highlight its special needs. "The just transition toward the green economy is a priority for Africa through balancing its need to combat climate change with an urgency to develop the continent's economies," he said.

By Hou Liqiang | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-06-14 01:35 Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, has called on nations to maintain the strategic focus on promoting the green transition despite challenges that are jeopardizing some nations' energy security. Addressing the opening ceremony on Monday of the annual general meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development, a high-level think tank that supports China's government, he reiterated China's climate commitment, and noted significant progress in honoring it. "The world is currently experiencing overlapping challenges, from the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical risk, economic upheaval and energy security," he said. "The economic recovery is slowing down and the global supply chain is suffering constant strain." Against this backdrop, some nations have been mulling how to address their need to ensure stability and security while maintaining sustainable development in the long term, said Xie, who is also a vice-chairman of the council, which is known as CCICED. He called for endeavors from countries to attain both short-term and long-term interests and to stay strategically focused on coping with climate change and promoting the low-carbon transition, saying: "This is the general trend for socioeconomic development." Based on the requirements of its internal sustainable development, and its due responsibility for building a global community of shared future, China, as a responsible major developing nation, has made significant progress in hammering out the policy systems needed for its climate targets, Xie stressed. China aims to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and realize carbon neutrality before 2060. In addition to completing the top-level design of the system, he said the country has unveiled implementation plans for 37 industries and sectors in which it specified timetables, roadmaps, policies, measures, and actions for each. "China is forging ahead with green transition in its energy system in a prudent and orderly manner," he said. Xie said the COP26 United Nations climate change conference held in Glasgow, the United Kingdom late last year sent out a clear message that, amid the crisis of climate change &ndash; a common challenge for all nations &ndash; the world needs to jointly promote the global climate change process with focuses on concrete actions, innovation, and cooperation. "China has been proactively carrying out dialogues and pragmatic cooperation with various nations in its endeavor to promote progress in global climate governance," he said, citing the China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s and the China-US Joint Statement Addressing the Climate Crisis, both of which unveiled last year, as examples. "We live on the same Earth, and we only have one Earth," Xie said. "We believe, as long as the international community works together adhering to multilateralism under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, the world will surely turn crisis into opportunities and successfully safeguard the planet we call home and the wellbeing of our future generations." \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- A huge slogan -- "We need 100 billion (U.S. dollars) annually to save our rainforests" -- on the wall of the Papua New Guinea pavilion has grabbed wide attention. At the ongoing 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, representatives from developing countries have blasted advanced economies for dragging their feet on climate finance. Naz Baloch, member of Pakistan's National Assembly and parliamentary secretary on climate change, told Xinhua at the Pakistan COP27 pavilion that the developed countries have been reluctant to fulfill their pledge of providing 100 billion dollars in climate finance as they do not "understand the significance of climate change and have their own priorities." "What happened in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan," said Baloch, citing the slogan of the Pakistan pavilion for COP27 . "No country is immune to climate change." "We realize the pain because we've been through it, and we want the rest of the world to understand how tough it is. We should act before it's too late," Baloch said. Kevin Conrad, executive director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, told Xinhua that the developed countries "have a lot of excuses" to dodge providing the promised 100 billion dollars in climate finance. "In 2022, they still haven't delivered," Conrad said. "What we are trying to say is that 100 billion dollars are not enough only for protecting rainforests. We need more than that." Conrad said the amount of funds to protect rainforests is estimated at 400 billion dollars per year. "The countries who are historically responsible have a moral obligation in duty to deliver 100 billion dollars. That has been promised," Fiji's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Satyendra Prasad told Xinhua at Moana blue club pavilion co-organized by 14 South Pacific island countries. Facing the double threats of rising sea levels and increasingly frequent natural disasters caused by climate change, island countries need climate finance that is "within reach and speedy," Prasad said. However, "the system is delivering less than 10 percent of the climate finance that is needed," Prasad noted. "Climate finance is a fundamental pillar," said Mazin al-Lamki, chief executive officer of Energy Development Oman. "Without it, the progress towards the goal of climate change will suffer.

U.S. climate envoy John Kerry met yesterday [Macau time] with his Chinese counterpart at annual United Nations climate negotiations in Egypt in a further hint of improving relations between the world's top two polluters, seen as vital for substantial progress against global warming. The meeting between Kerry and China's top climate official Xie Zhenhua raised prospects for a full-fledged resumption of climate talks between the two countries, which Beijing put on hold three months ago in retaliation for U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Taiwan. Kerry and Xie met for about 45 minutes at the Chinese delegation's offices in the COP27 conference zone. Neither side revealed much after it was over. The Chinese officials left without commenting. "We had a very good meeting," Kerry said. It was "much too early" to talk about any remaining differences, he said. "But we're gonna go to work." A day earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed with U.S. President Joe Biden to resume the talks. Government ministers are pushing for a substantial climate deal by the time the meeting is supposed to wrap up on Friday. Officials from developing nations, meanwhile, have been increasingly lashing out in anger and frustration at wealthy countries at the gathering, known as COP27 , condemning them for not doing enough to cut back emissions or help them cope with a warming Earth.

CAIRO, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- There is non-delivery and potential backsliding in finance pledges for climate change by developed countries, Egypt's chief climate negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr said Tuesday. Nasr made the remarks during a virtual press briefing on the preparations of the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) that will be hosted by Egypt next month in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Answering a question by Xinhua, Nasr said the developed countries have consistently failed to meet their pledge to provide 100 billion U.S. dollars a year in climate finance to developing countries since the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009. There is backsliding and non-delivery of pledges, said Nasr, who is also director of the Environment, Climate and Sustainable Development Department at the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The parties "enjoy" going into a process of planning, but nothing is happening on the ground, he added. He noted that future generations will most probably pay the price for the current non-delivery of pledges. "If you look at the climate finance pledges, they are minimal compared to what is being mobilized for other causes," Nasr said. Egypt, the host country, hopes that the current global geopolitical scene will not find its way into the COP27 negotiations, the Egyptian official affirmed. Enditem \</doc>

By ANGUS McNEICE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-04 05:15 United Kingdom and Chinese companies shared their carbon-busting strategies at a conference in London this week, including an oil and gas giant going green and an iconic British car brand ditching petrol engines. The 5th China-UK Economic and Trade Forum saw 300 political, business, and academic figures join together in the capital to discuss the future of the Sino-British relationship, with regional development strategies and the road to net-zero top of the agenda. China's Ambassador to the UK Zheng Zeguang said that both nations are "well positioned to enhance exchanges" on the climate response and said that China will continue to "pursue green and sustainable development and will work to avoid ecological degradation". The UK has set a target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and China has committed to a 2060 deadline. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow last year, known as COP26, the Chinese delegation encouraged countries to commit to "action, not empty slogans". "Glasgow was the time when reality took over from the headlines," Perry told China Daily at this week's trade conference, which was hosted by the China Chamber of Commerce in the UK. "Most of the nation-states were talking in soundbites to sound good. What China did was say 2060, and it is not a figure we have taken out of the air, we have been working for the last 30 years to figure out how we can get to zero." He added: "China is absolutely committed to 2060, and it will happen, that's how China works. It doesn't make these targets and then work out how to get there; they make these targets as a consequence of working out how to get there and how long it will take. We can learn from China, long-term planning is key." Along with committing to emissions targets, both the UK and China have encouraged businesses to develop carbon-cutting strategies. During a panel dedicated to China-UK actions in the pursuit of net-zero, Corinna Fletcher, who is the organizational development director at car manufacturer Lotus, outlined her company's fossil fuel-free future. Fletcher said that the company, which is majority-owned by Chinese automaker Geely, designed its last combustion engine this year. "All of our new product launches from 2023 will be all-electric vehicles," she said. "We have committed to cutting emissions and leading our industry in minimizing impact on the environment, benefiting society and the planet as a whole. Customers are demanding more sustainable products, so there is also a really strong commercial argument." Lotus has been making cars for 74 years, and the company grew to prominence with its Formula 1 racing team, which won seven championships. Geely took a 51 percent controlling stake in the company in 2017, and the Chinese carmaker has invested heavily in the switch to electric. Geely also owns the London Electric Vehicle Company, which produces the electric model of the London black taxi. At the trade conference, Keith Martin, who is senior vice president of PetroChina International, outlined the company's plans to shift from fossil fuel production to renewable energy. PetroChina, which is China's largest oil and gas producer, aims for renewables to comprise one-third of its energy portfolio by 2030, increasing to 50 percent by 2050. The company also plans to peak carbon emissions by 2025, and target net-zero for 2050. "PetroChina has embraced the energy transition with vigor," Martin said. "And we feel a wave of support from China to get to that net-zero target." The conference also heard from Andrew Bissell, founder of Scottish company Sunamp, which makes smart thermal storage solutions. Thermal batteries provide low-carbon heating and hot water for buildings, and the technology helps to stabilize grids that run on renewable power, which is a fluctuating power source. Sunamp recently signed a 50-million-pound ($55.8-million) partnership with Chinese company Thumos, which includes the installation of 400 batteries into high-end apartments in Shanghai. Sunamp technology is also used in some social housing in the UK. "I want to do it for every home in China, I want to do it for every home in the UK, I want to do it for every home in the world," said Bissell. \</doc>

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has given a stark warning to global leaders at the COP27 conference that humanity is on a "highway to climate hell" if the fight for a livable planet is lost this decade. Many small, poor countries are already hurtling down that highway, and nowhere is this more profound than in the Pacific, experts say. At the two-week COP27 , the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, now being held in Egypt, rich states are already sprinkling largesse on battling the effects of climate change, they say. Well before this year's COP, the Pacific Islands Forum, a regional political and economic policy group comprising 18 countries, declared a climate emergency and demanded real action from world leaders. Leo Hickman, editor of Carbon Brief, a UK-based website covering the latest developments in climate science, climate policy and energy policy, said that "in terms of saving the Pacific, many of the Pacific nations argue their existential 'point of no return' for them, in terms of sea level rise, is the 1.5 C goal". However, "that is now very, very close to being lost", he said, citing the recent UN Environment Programme Emissions Gap Report. The World Meteorological Organization said recently that climate change is happening at catastrophic speed, with the last eight years the warmest on record. Guterres said sea levels are rising twice as fast as they were in the 1990s, posing an existential threat for low-lying island states, especially in the Pacific, and threatening billions of people in coastal regions. Glacier melt records are themselves melting away, jeopardizing water security for whole continents. "We must answer the planet's distress signal with action, ambitious, credible climate action," Guterres said. " COP27 must be the place, and now must be the time." The leaders of 14 Pacific countries are attending COP27 . Call for compensation But already many developed countries, including Australia, have cast doubts over compensation. Karlos Moresi, the program adviser of resilience development finance at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, said there was push-back from developed countries. Speaking on Radio New Zealand on Tuesday, Moresi said the Pacific states argued for the inclusion of compensation or liability as a sub-item on the agenda, but after hours of negotiation the argument fell short. "We may have conceded on the compensation and liability text, but we still managed to get loss and damage included on the agenda," Moresi said. Speaking on the same program, Daniel Lund, Fiji's special adviser on climate change and loss and damage, said "there is a latency of ambition that is hitting the poorest the hardest". Asked if there were any compromises to get loss and damage onto the agenda, Lund said: "We've been compromising for three decades." The Vanuatu government has launched a global campaign to seek an advisory opinion on climate change from the International Court of Justice. In a statement on Thursday, Vanuatu said current levels of action and support for vulnerable developing countries are insufficient, and it wants the court to clarify the responsibilities for climate change under international law. Agnes Hall, global campaigns director with the environmental group 350.org, told China Daily: "The deep inequalities between nations, and the vast difference between the carbon emissions of countries in Europe and North America and countries in Africa, Asia and South America have their foundations in a long history of unfair treatment." It is time to acknowledge the mistakes of the past "and to act with common decency/humanity", she said. Joseph Sikulu, Pacific regional director at 350.org, said: "Pacific representatives are fatigued in climate negotiations as we see empty promises and unfulfilled pledges. Global North countries have a responsibility to ensure that loss and damage funding is not only sufficient, but also accessible to those who need it most." New Zealand has earmarked NZ$20 million ($11.7 million) in funding for loss and damage, putting it among a handful of mainly European countries to set aside cash specifically for loss and damage caused by climate change. The country's Foreign Minister, Nanaia Mahuta, said the decision placed New Zealand at the leading edge of wealthy countries, Reuters reported.

The COP27 First, BRICS countries have always regarded the issue of climate change as a "golden field" for cooperation. On the one hand, since the first BRICS summit in 2009,\~the BRICS countries have consistently focused on climate cooperation. The XIV BRICS Summit Beijing Declaration released after the 14th BRICS Summit in 2022 states clearly that "We underline that the developed countries have historical responsibilities for global climate change, and should take the lead in scaling up mitigation actions and scale up indispensable support to developing countries on finance, technology and capacity-building.\~We\~express our support to the incoming Egyptian Presidency of COP27 , working towards the success of COP27 , and promote COP27 to prioritize implementation and highlight the reinforcement of adaptation and delivery and enhancement of developed countries' commitments to provide financial support and technology transfer to developing countries." This public statement\~shows that BRICS countries have always been dedicated to injecting strong "BRICS momentum" to speed up the implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. On the other hand, at the ministerial level, the BRICS countries have also held regular environment ministerial meetings since 2015 and tried to expand the exchange of experience on climate governance among the five countries and promote the realization of climate cooperation through talks. Second, the BRICS countries also provide the world with a "golden channel" for climate finance. Unlike developed countries who talk much but do little in the field of climate finance, BRICS countries have always been committed to leaving no one behind in addressing climate change and other sustainable development issues. They adopt a comprehensive approach including mitigation, adaptation, financing, capacity building, technology transfer and sustainable living, and will play a more important role in global climate governance with a more proactive attitude, striving to take on the international responsibilities that the Western countries have failed to. Specifically, in terms of climate finance, the General Strategy for 2022-2026 of the BRICS-established New Development Bank clearly states that it will provide $30 billion for member countries to support them in the next five years, 40 percent of which will be used for "projects contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation."\~Obviously, with sufficient financial support, most emerging markets and developing countries can use the money exactly where it is needed most. With this funding, nations can also invest in various environmental development projects that meet the requirements of sustainable development or use it to improve outdated industrial capacity, save energy and reduce carbon emissions. Lastly, the BRICS countries have also actively raised the "BRICS voice" on climate governance in the international arena. The change of language - from "phase out" the use of coal to "phase down" - in the so-called historic Glasgow Climate Pact reached at the COP26 is also the result of the pushing from important BRICS members China and India. If a coal phase-out becomes a reality, it will be a disaster for most countries in the Global South. Overall, the BRICS countries are an important force in tackling climate change. They have made "BRICS contributions" to global cooperation on climate change, engaged in "BRICS collaboration," and expressed "BRICS voice" to improve the international system for climate governance. Unlike some countries that talk about one thing but do the other, the BRICS keeps its promises on global climate governance. Its members have truly cooperated with each other on climate issues. BRICS countries have taken action to deal with climate change actively, promote a green-oriented transition, and build a clean and beautiful world. In many ways, these moves are representative, inclusive, and justified.

Participants and delegates work in the Africa pavillon at the Sharm El Sheikh International Convention Centre, on the first day of the COP27 climate summit, in Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, on November 6, 2022. Photo: AFP COP27 , which is organized by the UN, is being held in the Egyptian city of Sharm el-Sheikh from November 6 to 18, hoping to accelerate efforts to curb the world's climate crisis. When the West adopts a "talk the talk" attitude, and as China sticks firmly to its role as a real force for action, it is clear who is winning the hearts in the domain of tackling climate change.\~ It is the first time since 2016 the UN climate talks have taken place on African soil, hence COP27 is being dubbed the "African COP." As one of the biggest risk-bearers of climate change, African countries desperately seek international climate assistance. China and Africa have a long history of cooperation when it comes to climate. China's Africa Policy Paper published in 2006 stated China will promote cooperation with Africa on climate change by increasing scientific and technological cooperation. The country's second Africa Policy Paper published in 2015 stipulated cooperation on climate change as being one of the six areas for which China's assistance would be primarily directed. In 2021, the two sides released the Declaration on China-Africa Cooperation on Combating Climate Change, laying the foundation for more concrete cooperation schemes.\~ Tang Xiaoyang, a professor in the Department of International Relations at Tsinghua University, believes that African countries welcome China's role in tackling climate change, and they endorse the concept of green development as China does. He said that China differs from Western countries in that China not only stresses "green," but also "development."\~ "The combination of the two is the bottleneck that developed countries encounter at their current development stage," Tang told the Global Times. According to media reports, the ultimate goal of this year's climate talks remains subject to dispute - developed countries want to focus on ways to help developing nations phase out fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy, while developing countries want a commitment on financial support they need to address the climate-fueled disasters. The contrasting demands from developed countries and developing ones and the lack of concerted global efforts to curb climate change should be attributed to the malfunctioning of the West-led global order, according to Song Luzheng, a research fellow at Fudan University. "The unfair and unjust global order led by the West is the origin of the chaos the world is experiencing now. The squeeze of Russia's strategic room by the US and NATO led to the Ukraine crisis. An energy crisis soon followed, prompting many European countries such as France and Germany to vie to pay record prices for coal. The resurgent coal demand clashes with climate plans to shift away from polluting fossil fuel. Meanwhile, the US and European countries, suffering from economic setbacks, cannot invest in more energy to climate change," Song told the Global Times. As the living costs in Europe sour, European countries have no extra resources to fulfill the promise made, that is, to double their financial support for climate-proofing projects in poorer countries to roughly $40 billion per year by 2025. In early September, when African leaders headed to the Netherlands seeking delivery on promised funds, their European counterparts largely skipped the meeting. In 2009, developed countries committed to give $100 billion a year, by 2020, to developing countries to help them reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. The target was missed and moved back to 2023.\~ For the West, "emission reduction" means calling for other countries to "reduce" under the banner of tackling climate crisis, while they themselves can "emit" at will. The West only thinks of political gains rather than the fate of humanity. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was born in a Western democracy, has made no contribution to tackling climate after being catapulted to worldwide fame, except for constantly engaging in public stunts. She reportedly shunned COP27 , criticizing the conference for being "held in a tourist paradise in a country that violates many basic human rights." Isn't she supposed to understand that climate change can only be tackled through real action, not politics?\~ The author is an opinion editor with the Global Times. mailto:wangwenwen@globaltimes.com.cn wangwenwen@globaltimes.com.cn \</doc>

GENEVA, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 27.7 million children had been affected this year by floodings and other climate change related catastrophic events that occurred in 27 countries worldwide, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Tuesday. These children had been exposed to a multitude of threats including death by drowning, disease outbreaks, lack of safe drinking water, malnutrition, disruption in learning, and violence, the organization said. While attending the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP27 ) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Paloma Escudero, global director of communications and advocacy at the UNICEF, told journalists via a video link that she was working with youth climate activists from around the world to put the spotlight on the impact of the climate crisis on the vulnerability of children. In Pakistan, the worst floods in 100 years had killed at least 615 children, and left 10 million children in need of immediate, lifesaving support, she said. She added that close to 1.6 million children in flood areas in Pakistan could be suffering from severe acute malnutrition. "One had to be in Pakistan to understand the scope of the devastation," Escudero said. In Africa, too, children were paying the price for a climate disaster for which they are not responsible, she said. She urged the political and business leaders of the world to take immediate action to protect children from climate related devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely on, and to prepare children for a changing world by teaching them how to respond to disasters and equipping them with green skills for future jobs. "In 2021, developed countries pledged to double support for adaptation to 40 billion U.S. dollars a year by 2025. At COP27 , they must present a credible roadmap with clear milestones on how this would be funded, as a step to delivering at least 300 billion U.S. dollars per year for adaptation by 2030," Escudero said. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- China's great efforts to develop renewable energy to replace fossil fuels has been a "story of hope" in fighting climate change, an official and environmentalist has told Xinhua in an interview. "China for us is a good example of the types of investment that need to be made. China is showing the world hope," said Kevin Conrad, executive director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) being held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh. He was referring to the efforts made by China to increase the production of renewable energy in a bid to reduce the use of fossil fuels and save forests. Conrad believes that developing renewable energy is one of the major solutions to stop global warming. "Renewable energy is becoming cheaper than other sources and it has less environmental damage, but we need to make it happen faster," he said. China has made remarkable progress toward its goals of reaching peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutralization before 2060, said China's Special Envoy for Climate Change Xie Zhenhua on Sunday while attending a side event at the COP27 on introducing China's green actions to tackle climate change. Xie said China has actively implemented the Paris Agreement, and further enhanced its nationally determined contribution, aiming to reach carbon peak and achieve carbon neutralization in a strong, orderly and effective manner. According to preliminary calculations, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions China produces per unit of GDP in 2021 is 3.8 percent lower than that in 2020 and 50.8 percent lower than in 2005, he noted. "(We should) bring down fossil fuels by developing renewable energy. China is doing the first step and now we need to do the second step," Conrad said. "That's where you find hope. China is leading. They're showing that investing in renewable energy works. And now the challenge is to continue to scale it up, so they can scale down the fossil fuels," Conrad added. During a meeting with the Chinese delegation to the COP27 on Tuesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also praised China's pragmatic actions in accelerating green transformation and China's efforts to develop renewable energy. At the Papua New Guinea pavilion, a huge slogan on the wall - "We need 100 billion (U.S. dollars) annually to save our rainforests" - attracted great attention. Conrad, also director of the pavilion, told Xinhua that the slogan aims to mock the failure of developed countries to deliver the 100 billion dollars in climate finance promised to developing countries back in 2009. "In 2022, they still haven't delivered," Conrad said. "What we are trying to say is that 100 billion dollars are not enough only for protecting the rainforests. We need more than that." He emphasized the significance of protecting rainforests in the global battle against imminent global warming. "There's more carbon in the rainforests. If we lose rainforests, even if we stop all the carbon emissions, we still lose (the climate battle)," he said. Conrad said China has been very helpful to the Coalition for Rainforest Nations by sending experts years ago to help it protect rainforests. Enditem \</doc>

Editor's Note: The Africa Adaptation Summit will kick off on September 5 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The summit is the first major test of the developed world's commitment made at the most recent UN climate summit in Glasgow in November 2021, to double its financial support for climate-proofing projects in developing countries by 2025. It is also expected to lay the foundation for an adaptation breakthrough for Africa at COP27 in November. However, while African leaders are heading for the summit seeking delivery on the commitment, most of their European counterparts may reportedly skip the meeting. While record heat waves, along with an energy crisis partly caused by the US-instigated Russia-Ukraine crisis, have forced some European countries to backpedal on their climate goals, climate change in the US has descended to an issue for partisan struggle and a topic to smear China. Chinese climate experts slammed Western countries for trying to wriggle out of their promise of giving financial aid to African countries, which possibly casts a shadow over the upcoming COP27 . In contrast, China is steadily promoting green development under the Belt and Road Initiative. Shunned promises Graphic: Tang Tengfei, Chen He/GT \</doc>

Photo: Chinese Foreign Ministry China will continue to participate in international cooperation on climate change and make positive contributions to the success of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday when\~he\~met via video link with Csaba Korosi, president of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).\~ Wang said\~that China would provide support and help to developing countries within its utmost abilities and make positive contributions to the success of COP27 which kicked off on Sunday in Egypt. As China holds the presidency of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, known as COP15, which is set to begin on December 7, Wang said China would work with parties to well organize the second part of COP15 and make COP15 a success. Wang said Chinese modernization pursues the harmony between human and nature, and China stays committed to following a green, low carbon and sustainable path. China is also ready to strengthen exchanges and cooperation on water resources with other countries through the implementation of the Global Development Initiative, Wang added. Also, the Chinese foreign minister said that in the process of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way, "we will take a more active part in the reform and development of the global governance system, practice the global governance concept of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, adhere to true multilateralism, and continuously deepen cooperation with the UN, and make greater contributions\~to the international community's response to common challenges." Noting China always supports the cause of the UN and the important role of the UNGA,\~Wang said that in the face of\~the chaos in the world, China will firmly uphold the international system with the UN\~at its core, the international order based on international law, and the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Facing the adverse current of anti-globalization, China advocates adhering to the right direction of economic globalization, opposes "building barriers" and "decoupling and breaking chains," Wang stressed. He noted that China is committed to building an open world economy, and promoting common global development.\~ In the face of ideological confrontation, China advocates respect\~for\~each country's independent choice\~in deciding its human rights and\~its democratic development path, and opposes wanton interference in other countries' internal affairs.\~ Facing the conflict of civilizations theory and power politics, China calls for promoting the common values of all mankind, respecting the diversity of world civilizations, and transcending civilizational barriers through exchanges of civilizations, and transcending civilizational conflicts through mutual learning among civilizations. Korosi conveyed felicitations on the successful convening of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and expressed expectation on strengthening cooperation with China to make COP27 a success and help vulnerable countries cope with challenges in\~regards to\~water utilization and management. Korosi also expressed willingness to support China's efforts and promote the second wave of meetings of COP15 to realize positive outcomes. The two sides also exchanged views on the Security Council reform and other issues. Global Times \</doc>

China greatly contributes to reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by playing the important role of being "the leader of clean energy technology globally," the International Energy Agency (IEA) chief said in an interview with Xinhua on Wednesday. "The world is going through a major energy crisis," Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director, told Xinhua at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change being held in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Many people fear that the use of fossil fuels will dramatically increase and lead to a rise in carbon emissions, but the IEA's analyses show that the rise in global carbon emissions this year will be lower than 1 percent, he said. Birol explained that the increased application of renewable energy technologies, including solar, wind and hydrogen power, will effectively slow down the growth of the global carbon emissions. "The new energy vehicle industry is developing rapidly this year, and about 50 percent of electric cars in the world come from China ... China plays an important role in the promotion and application of green technologies," Birol said. The IEA chief said that more clean energy investments should be encouraged to flow to developing countries in a bid to deal with climate change, especially in Africa. There are many ways to support clean energy in the developing world, one of which is to deliver the promise of 100 billion U.S. dollars in climate finance by the developed countries, Birol said. "I hope that the advanced economies will honor their commitments," he added. The COP27 opened on Sunday in Sharm El-Sheikh in hopes to turn global climate finance pledges into action. During the two-week conference, more than 40,000 participants from over 190 countries as well as dozens of international and regional organizations will seek possible solutions to one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. \</doc>

NAIROBI, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- Robust investments to expand forest cover in Africa are required as the continent gears up for a climate-resilient, just and inclusive future, experts said on Wednesday. The experts attending the forum for forestry stakeholders convened by the Nairobi-based African Forest Forum (AFF), stressed that the continent was adequately positioned to transition to a greener future if it channeled resources towards restoring degraded tropical forests, mangrove swamps and peatlands. Marie Louise Avana, a Senior Program Officer at AFF said that African countries should lobby for additional funding to support reforestation at the upcoming 27th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) summit ( COP27 ) slated for Egypt from Nov. 6 to 18. Avana noted that the Egypt climate summit dubbed African COP27 presents a lifetime opportunity for the continent to push for robust financing and technical support required to conserve tropical forests, and promote climate resilience. "For Africa to address climate change impacts effectively, it must tap into forest resources. The continent must therefore focus on financing expansion of its forest cover, adapt to climate change and sustain livelihoods," Avana said in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. Senior policymakers, forestry experts, industry leaders, and researchers are attending the Nairobi forum to discuss forest and tree-based climate change adaptation for English-speaking African Nations. The five-day forum that is taking place ahead of next week's global climate summit in Egypt will discuss best practices that can be adopted locally to promote climate resilience in Africa by leveraging its indigenous forests. Avana said that despite some climate and human-induced threats, Africa remained the epicenter of virgin forested landscapes whose contribution to a carbon-neutral future is immense. According to Avana, a Cameroonian scientist, Africa had 636.64 million hectares of forest in 2020, representing 16 percent of the world's forested landscapes even as the continent expanded tree cover on farms and urban centers. She called upon African countries to tap into multilateral funds earmarked for forest-based mitigation and adaptation to the climate crisis besides enacting new policies to enhance the conservation of the vital resource. Vincent Oeba, the Principal Research Scientist and National Coordinator of the Climate Change Research Program at Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), said that COP27 offers an opportunity for African countries to unlock the financing required to expand their forest cover as part of resilience building. Oeba said that market-based approaches are needed to tame forest loss in Africa, support the creation of robust carbon markets, and hasten the green transition in the continent. "We look forward to clear and time-bound commitments from the international community to accelerate reforestation in Africa and minimize adverse effects of climate change to livelihoods," said Oeba. He noted that a well-funded forestry sector had the potential to hasten the attainment of net zero goals in Africa besides providing social and economic benefits to rural communities. Lizzie Mujuru, a lecturer at the Natural Resources Department of the Zimbabwe's Bindura University of Science Education, said that African countries should incentivize communities that are protecting forest resources as part of their climate adaptation measures. Mujuru added that healthy forests are key to sustaining water, energy and food security for African communities reeling from climate emergencies including droughts, floods, and disease outbreaks.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries are obligated to contribute to the Paris Agreement's "loss and damage" fund once established to help developing countries combat climate change, a Chinese climate envoy said here Saturday. The term "loss and damage" in UN climate negotiations refers to expenses already incurred due to climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels or extreme heat waves. Developing countries can contribute to the fund voluntarily, said Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, at a conference while attending the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Regarding the issue of loss and damage funding, Xie, also the special representative for Chinese President Xi Jinping, said that China welcomes including the topic in COP27 agendas for the first time in response to the demand of developing countries, describing it as "big progress." The Chinese envoy noted that China has long supported other developing countries in their fight against climate change through South-South cooperation and the Belt and Road Initiative. China has assisted developing countries in establishing early warning systems, constructing low-carbon demonstration zones, and training officials and technical personnel to improve their capacity to deal with climate change and develop renewable energy, Xie said. Noting that the recipients of the loss and damage fund should be developing countries, Xie said that due to the size of the fund, it should be distributed first to the most vulnerable countries and those in dire need. The Chinese envoy called on all parties to follow the principles of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, including the principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Xie urged developed countries to take the lead in substantially reducing their emissions and providing developing countries with financial and technical support to improve their capabilities to combat climate change. "All countries should work together to advance the process," Xie stressed. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt  Wealthy Western nations facing an energy crunch are eyeing natural gas in Africa at the expense of supporting a green transition in poorer countries, climate activists at COP27 charge. European countries have been scrambling for alternative sources of gas after the continent's former top supplier, Russia, slashed exports in retaliation for Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine in February. "We don't have to follow the footsteps of the rich world that actually caused climate change in the first place," Adow said. Exporting natural gas may bring short-term profits but exacerbate the climate crisis and leave African nations worse off in the long run, activists, researchers and advocacy groups said. 'Serious threat' Some African leaders argued that the potential benefits for people on the world's poorest continent outweighed the harm from the production and export of fossil fuels. "We are in favor of a just and fair green transition, instead of decisions that harm our development process," Senegalese President Macky Sall told some 100 world leaders last week at COP27 . Germany, the European country most dependent on Russian supplies before the conflict, has been keen to tap Senegal's gas deposits. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, secretary-general of the African Petroleum Producers' Organization, said the slight increase in the continent's marginal contribution to greenhouse gas emissions "would make a fundamental difference in whether people live or die". "History shows us that extraction in African countries has not resulted in development," said Thuli Makama, African program director at Oil Change International. Agencies Via Xinhua \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- The 100 billion U.S. dollars to battle climate change pledged by developed countries should be delivered and made accessible, Fijian envoy to the United Nations urged at an international conference on climate change being held here. "As we know, Fiji and Pacific island countries have been on the frontlines of climate change. This is not an exaggeration, a single extreme weather event might wipe out the whole economy. This is why Pacific island countries attach great importance to climate change and have an urgent need for a greater ambition to deal with it," said Satyendra Prasad, Fiji's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). Prasad noted that in the past few years, Fiji has suffered from some extreme weather incidents caused by climate change, trapping the country in a cycle of "building and rebuilding." He said that they need more funds to battle climate change more quickly, adding that the funds promised in 2009 by developed countries have not been fully delivered. "Climate finance should not only be delivered, but also should make it available to countries like ours with low capacity to access to it. It must be speedy," said the ambassador. He added that the rising sea level has endangered fresh water supply in some Pacific islands, forcing the islanders to ship their drinking water from other islands far away. "They didn't cause climate change, why they should pay for it," Prasad said. "We hope that the COP27 can begin to make change just like what people are talking about, moving pledge into implementation. Climate finance is the building block, and this is the core problem that we need to resolve," he said. Enditem \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The climate challenge has compounded a crisis in human security, with an increasing number of displaced people worldwide, a UN climate expert said recently, calling for more global actions to help the vulnerable. Andrew Harper, special advisor for Climate Action for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), made the remarks during an interview at the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. The expert noted that the impact of climate change on displaced people is "a big issue" that needs to be addressed through global action, highlighting the interrelation between human security and the environment. The UNHCR is present at COP27 to bring the voices of the displaced to the discussions on climate change, he said. "It's no longer sufficient for us to wait for people to be forced to move. We can anticipate, and we need to be working to support those communities who are most at risk to adapt and become more resilient," he added. Harper urged developed countries to do more to protect the environment, hasten the transition to renewable energy and ensure human security. "By ensuring human security and ensuring the security of communities against the challenges being brought by climate, we can only then have global security," he added. Harper also warned that infrastructure in some vulnerable communities to climate change is being physically eroded because of a cascading series of disasters. "If we don't look at this as a global issue, with global engagement to find solutions, then each country will suffer," Harper warned. The UN climate expert urged world leaders to put their commitments into action to help developing countries tackle climate challenges and support displaced people. "There are over 100 million people who are currently displaced worldwide. There is a displacement occurring almost every second. So, the longer that we wait, the more challenging it will be in order to provide the support," he said. Enditem \</doc>

China supports the proposal that developed countries compensate developing countries, especially those most vulnerable to the impact of climate change, for the loss and damage they suffer because of global climate change, Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, said on Wednesday. The topic of "loss and damage" has for the first time been included in the main agenda for discussion during the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Many developing countries have been arguing that they emit a fraction of greenhouse gases compared with industrialized countries, but are disproportionately impacted by the consequences of global climate change. COP27 , adding he is glad to see that the topic is on the agenda of this year's session. "We support the idea of establishing a special fund to address loss and damage," he said. "Various parties need to join efforts to find a proper way for financing through negotiation." Countries at different stages of development have common but different responsibilities in addressing the "loss and damage" issue, Xie said, adding that China  although it has no need to compensate for loss and damage  would like to cooperate with other developing countries to help them with climate change mitigation and adaptation. During COP27 "Loss and damage is not an abstract topic of endless dialogue: It is our daily experience and the living nightmare of millions of Kenyans and hundreds of millions of Africans," William Ruto, president of Kenya, said during the conference. "Loss and damage must therefore be addressed with a level of seriousness, which demonstrates fairness, urgency and consideration." Xie also urged developed countries to fulfill their promise of providing $100 billion to developing countries every year as soon as possible to help them fight climate change. "Developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion every year in Copenhagen in 2009, but the commitment has not been honored 13 years later," he said, adding a financing gap of $260 billion has accumulated over the past 13 years. "In addition, to honor the $100 billion pledge, a road map should be released on repaying the debt of $260 billion and increasing financing further after 2025 for developing countries," Xie said. Addressing the conference's Climate Implementation Summit on Tuesday, Xie said China has been actively tackling climate change through persistent and pragmatic actions. "China's firm determination and position to implement the goals of reaching carbon peak and achieving carbon neutrality, and to actively participate in global climate governance will never change," Xie said.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- China greatly contributes to reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by playing the important role of being "the leader of clean energy technology globally," the International Energy Agency (IEA) chief said in an interview with Xinhua on Wednesday. "The world is going through a major energy crisis," Fatih Birol, the IEA executive director, told Xinhua at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change being held in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Many people fear that the use of fossil fuels will dramatically increase and lead to a rise in carbon emissions, but the IEA's analyses show that the rise in global carbon emissions this year will be lower than 1 percent, he said.

GENEVA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Week-long heatwaves have become a global "wake-up call" for joint efforts to cut emissions and shift to more renewable energies. "These extreme weather events are a big wake-up call for leaders, whether in business or in government, to really act in increasing the emission reductions that should be undertaken already," Angela Consuelo Ibay, climate change and energy program head at World Wide Fund for Nature Philippines, told Xinhua via video link. "This heatwave is the new normal," said Petteri Taalas, the Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization based in Geneva, earlier this week. On Tuesday, a record 40.3 degrees Celsius was recorded in Britain, with widespread extreme heat, wildfires and stress on health systems reported across the European continent. "We have broken an all-time high in the UK," Taalas warned. "Heatwaves will happen more frequently because of climate change." According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), temperatures will rise more quickly in Europe than elsewhere. The IPCC expects a worrisome combination of climatic impact-driver changes by mid-century if global warming exceeds 2 degrees Celsius in the Mediterranean, such as temperature extremes, an increase in droughts and aridity, drops in precipitation, increasing wildfires, sea level extremes and less snow cover. The IPCC Special Report on Extremes also shows that heatwaves will be more frequent, more prolonged and more intense in the 21st century, adding that early warning systems and reinforced health systems will be needed. "We're seeing more and more clearly that it's not about why we should act, but it's about how. The planet is on fire," the President of the World Economic Forum, Borge Brende, told Xinhua earlier this week. "We really, really need to get our act together now. It's even more complicated now because energy prices are soaring. There is also lack of access to gas and electricity in parts of the world and at the same time we really need to make sure that the future energy is not from fossil fuel," said Brende. VICIOUS CYCLE The hottest temperature ever recorded in Europe was 48 degrees Celsius in Greece in 1977. A suspected new record of 48.8 degrees in the southern Italian island of Sicily may have occurred in 2021 and is currently being reviewed by World Meteorological Organization. "These extreme weather events are also impacting the global energy transition," Ibay explained. "The more it's getting warmer, people want to be cooler. But by cooling, we should think about what is powering that cooling itself. The cooling should take into consideration clean energy systems so that we're not adding on to the warming that's already happening." Meanwhile, As extreme weather events occur more frequently, more international cooperation is needed to improve early warning systems for countries around the world, World Meteorological Organization's chief of applied climate services Robert Stefanski told Xinhua through email. "At the COP21 (2015) in Paris, several countries came together to establish the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems initiative that has the objective to save lives, assets and livelihoods through increased access to early weather warnings and risk information for people in Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, the world's most vulnerable countries," he said. However, one-third of the world's people, mainly in least developed countries and small island developing states, are still not covered by early warning systems. "In Africa, it is even worse: 60 percent of people lack coverage," Stefanski added. COP27 IN EGYPT In November last year, negotiators agreed on a new global pact to tackle climate change at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, Britain. The 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) is scheduled to take place in Egypt from Nov. 6 to 18. "It's a big event that everyone is looking at to see whether in fact leaders will keep the promises that they had made in Glasgow. We really have a very small window to take action before we reach, unfortunately, irreversible tipping points," Ibay said. She urged leaders to move fast. "The focus is on really getting our leaders to keep their promises. They really should be scaling up many of the things that need to happen." "What the IPCC has said should give us strong impetus and a strong momentum towards fulfilling the Glasgow climate pact so that we can accelerate this energy transition," Ibay urged. "We really expect for COP27 that there's this call for a real quantum leap towards more renewables." The gathering in Egypt comes as the second phase of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity will be held in Montreal, Canada, from Dec. 5 to 17. "The UN biodiversity conference COP15 will take place just a few weeks after COP27 , so a decision at COP27 will send a strong political message from COP27 going into COP15," she added.

KIGALI, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has cut 126,000 tonnes of carbon emissions over the last nine years owing to strategic climate resilience investments made across the country, official data released on Wednesday during Finance Day at the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) in Egypt showed. The data on green investments released by the Rwanda Green Fund showed that since 2013, funding worth 247 million U.S. dollars has been mobilized for strategic climate resilient investments. The funding was invested in 46 green projects across the country that helped to cut the carbon emissions. At least 47,000 hectares of forests and agro-forestry were planted while 31,000 hectares of watershed and water bodies have been protected, it showed. Over 88,000 households were given access to off-grid clean energy while 120,000 people were supported to cope with the effects of climate change, according to the data. Rwanda needs an estimated 11 billion U.S. dollars to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects up to 2030, Rwanda's Finance State Minister for Economic Planning, Claudine Uwera said during the event. " COP27 is an opportunity to engage development partners to meet the remaining financing of 6.5 billion U.S. dollars to maintain and accelerate momentum to deliver on Rwanda's climate agenda," she added. Jeanne D£rc Mujawamariya, Rwandan Minister of Environment called on rich nations to deliver on the 100 billion U.S. dollars per annum pledge. Since 2009, the pledge of 100 billion U.S. dollars by developed countries, every year by 2020 to support developing countries to cope with climate change, is yet to be met. During the Finance Day heads of governments and activists called for immediate and innovative solutions to drive the global climate finance landscape to complement public finance. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has said questioning whether Africa is ready to make use of climate finance should not be used as an excuse to justify inaction. Enditem \</doc>

NEW YORK, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The potential for climate change collaboration between China and the United States has great significance for the world, although barriers remain, observers and experts have said. The United Nations welcomes the climate talks between China and the United States. The announcement was made upon the conclusion of the bilateral meeting between the two heads of state in Indonesia this November, said Siddharth Chatterjee, a UN resident coordinator in China. Speaking at a recent virtual panel discussion held by the China Institute in America, a U.S. non-profit organization, Chatterjee said a reinitiated high-level dialogue between the climate envoys from the two countries "gives the world much-needed reassurance and hope in increasingly uncertain times." At the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Egypt, one key outcome is "the reinitiated China-U.S. climate dialogue," said Chatterjee in a pre-recorded video speech. Chatterjee said that the two nations' joint leadership and shared influence, as evident at COP27 , will encourage other nations to pledge more ambitious and bolder climate commitments towards a sustainable future. "By putting aside their differences to consider the future of humanity, China-U.S. climate collaboration can become an oasis that shall not again turn into a desert," said Chatterjee. There is substantial potential for cooperation between the two countries, including employment transition in the fossil fuel industry and the development of regulatory framework and environmental standards policies, said Chatterjee. Elizabeth Knup, Ford Foundation's China representative, said at the panel discussion that she is encouraged by the fact that things are back on track. Though the data-sharing and sharing modeling framework under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has not been affected by the tension between the two countries, a dual degree program between the sides was hit, said Xuhui Lee, director of the Yale Center for Earth Observation and program coordinator of a dual degree program between Yale University and China's Tsinghua University. Technology ends up being the olive branch that can connect these two nations and other nations globally, said Andrew Chung, a tech investor and entrepreneur with rich experience investing in climate and health tech. "It's the advanced technologies that will cause both sides to have to figure out some way to collaborate in order to commercialize these technologies," said Chung. Enditem \</doc>

By ANGUS McNEICE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-05-25 09:33 Beijing and Washington urge world to ditch the excuses about warming China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, has said the world "cannot abandon" the Paris Agreement on climate change, and his United States counterpart, John Kerry, has said countries should not use the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an excuse to delay action on global warming. Speaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday, Xie urged all countries to work together and "walk the walk" on climate. "We have to turn our pledges into concrete actions," said Xie, who represented China at the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP26, in Glasgow in November, when the rule book for the Paris Agreement was finalized and where countries agreed to lessen reliance on fossil fuels and reduce the use of coal. Despite this progress, global carbon emissions increased by 6 percent and coal-generated power went up 9 percent in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency. More recently, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted gas supply and prices, prompting several developed nations to explore new domestic fossil fuel projects in order to bolster energy security. "In Davos, we are facing an even greater challenge than before," Xie said while participating in a panel discussion along with Kerry, who is the US' special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry said: "Now, Ukraine is being used as a lever, to make the argument that you've got to have this energy security, which you do have to have, nobody doubts that, but it's a headlong plunge to say it means we need to drill a lot more and pump a lot more and build out more infrastructure." Xie and Kerry met more than a dozen times last year and were instrumental in finalizing the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which was announced at COP26. Xie said: "Kerry is my good friend, at COP26 we made a joint declaration, and what we will do now is turn this joint statement into action and cooperation between the US and China." Kerry said that, in Glasgow, collective pledges meant that 65 percent of global gross domestic product is now committed to keeping global warming to within 1.5 C this century. "That means 35 percent did not join," Kerry said. "We need to move, accelerate, do more. Xie understands that and is committed to it." Kerry said the US "now has momentum" after it "lost four years "in the climate fight, which alluded to the previous administration's rejection of the Paris Agreement. "The world stands on a precipice," Kerry said. "I am convinced that we will get to a low-carbon economy on this planet. I cannot tell you I am convinced we will get there in time." Xie outlined a number of "proactive and concrete actions" that China has taken during the last few years to accelerate its green transition, including peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2060. Last year, China released the 1+N policy framework, which includes national directives for peaking emissions, and Xie said 37 sectors have announced measures to counter climate change. Xie said the proportion of coal in the country's energy mix has dropped from 74 percent to 56 percent in recent years, and China will no longer build coal plants abroad. Xie added that China has now reversed forest loss and will plant 700 million new trees during the next decade. \</doc>

BRUSSELS, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Council of the European Union (EU) and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on Tuesday evening to tighten EU countries' greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets. Under the deal, EU-level emission cuts for sectors not covered by the bloc's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), such as transport, agriculture, buildings, small industries and waste, must reduce their emissions by 40 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. "These sectors, directly linked to our everyday lives, generate about 60 percent of greenhouse gas emissions," Marian Jurecka, Czech minister of environment, said in a statement. The regulation still needs formal adoption to become binding. "The new rules for national emission cuts ensure that all member states contribute and that existing loopholes (in the Effort Sharing Regulation covering non-ETS sectors) are closed," said Jessica Polfjard, who has been steering the draft regulation through the European Parliament. Under the regulation, each member state will have an updated national target, with changes ranging from -10 percent to -50 percent compared to 2005 emission levels. According to the European Commission, measures to achieve the new targets might include promoting public transport; retrofitting buildings; installing more efficient heating and cooling systems; and introducing more climate-friendly agricultural practices. EU member states will have linear emission trajectories that they must respect to ensure that each year, they do not exceed the allowed national GHG emission levels. These trajectories will be updated again in 2025 if necessary. The provisional agreement allows member states to bank and borrow national emission allocations. Buying and selling emission allocations between member states will also be permitted, up to 10 percent of their annual allocations until 2025, and 15 percent between 2026 and 2030. The agreement came as world leaders gathered in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, for the United Nations Climate Conference ( COP27 ). "(The) agreement brings clarity about Member States' national efforts, ensures solidarity, and shows (the participants of) COP27 (that) the EU is on track to deliver our climate commitments," tweeted Frans Timmermans, European Commission Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal.

China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-19 08:38 Instead of uniting the world in solidarity for a livable planet, the two-week COP 27 United Nations climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, has shown that the mechanism of international cooperation on climate change is at risk of backsliding. At COP 26 held in Glasgow, Scotland, late last year, there was still overall optimism on integrating economic and environmental goals, despite the differences among countries. However, at COP 27 , the mood has clearly changed, with what should have been a coordinated response to the common challenge being downgraded. Over the past year, the clock has been wound back by many countries, particularly the United States, as they have embraced fossil fuels more tightly, causing last year's climate agreement to fall apart. No new pledges have been made at the latest conference. Worse, even the goal of limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 C from the pre-industrial age level by 2100, a key objective of the Paris Agreement, has been opposed by some countries. If the responses to climate change are always subject to economic, energy and geopolitical crises, any meaningful action to limit global warming will be purely theoretical. It is shameful that the US, the largest emitter among the developed economies and the second-largest in the world, has chosen to politicize the climate issue at the conference by passing the buck for the lack of progress to Russia, Europe and China. The Democratic Party's better-than-expected performance in the midterm elections prompted US President Joe Biden to turn the COP 27 into an opportunity to boast about his achievements in tackling climate change. However, his administration's actions do not match his boasts. The increase in fossil energy capacity in the US has been even greater under his administration than under his predecessor. At COP 26, developed countries agreed to increase spending and provide $40 billion a year to developing countries starting in 2025 to help them cope with the effects of climate change. However, the developed countries will need to pay at least five times more in the future as the impacts of climate change continue to intensify, according to the UN's Adaptation Gap Report 2022 released on Nov 1. But as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has worsened the global energy situation and the after-effects of COVID-19 continue to hit global supply chains, even Europe, which has traditionally supported a carbon-neutral agenda, is hesitating to back the proposal that rich countries should subsidize the poor ones that was agreed upon in principle in Glasgow last year. The US is the biggest historical carbon polluter, so the Biden administration should take the lead to honor that commitment. Doing so would at least take COP 27 a step forward toward the developed countries establishing a "loss and damage" financing fund to help the developing countries address the climate challenge. \</doc>

China Daily | Updated: 2022-07-22 09:25 Britain's former chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss have been selected to vie for the Conservative Party leadership that will also decide the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. In the space of eight days, through a series of votes, Conservative members of Parliament have reduced an initial ballot of eight candidates down to two to succeed Prime Minister Boris Johnson, after Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt was eliminated on Wednesday. The party membership of 160,000 will now consider their choice to be leader before making their selection next month, with the winner to be announced on Sept 5. Candidates have debated priority policies such as how to manage the stalling economy, cutting or maintaining taxes, the National Health Service backlog and restoring trust and integrity in public life, according to The Times. They have also discussed their positions on defense, housing, relations with the rest of Europe, net-zero carbon targets and leveling up, which is the effort to boost living standards in areas where they are lagging. Sunak has said that tax cut promises made by Truss were "socialist" in nature, while Truss has said Sunak's policy of deferring tax cuts poses the risk of a recession. Having overseen some of the largest tax increases in recent years, Sunak has said he intends to address the "hard economic reality" of inflation with fiscal caution. His critics in the party have described his resignation from Johnson's Cabinet on July 5 as "treacherous", as it was seen to have triggered a flurry of other resignations that ultimately brought down the prime minister. The former investment banker became a politician for the Conservative Party in 2014 and supported Brexit. Soon after he became chancellor in February 2020, he announced the furlough program to support workers that helped steer the nation through the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Truss backed the Remain (in the European Union) campaign ahead of the EU referendum in 2016, but her position has changed, and she now outlines plans to deliver the benefits of Brexit. She has said that she intends to reverse the national insurance tax increase that came in April, and to keep corporation taxes competitive. The BBC reported that she said she would increase defense spending to 3 percent of GDP by 2030. Sources told The Guardian that when Sunak became chancellor of the exchequer, he was reluctant to commit to spending on climate measures, though he has expressed support for net-zero carbon targets. He has vowed to keep defense spending close to current levels, rising to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2030. On Europe, he said he would create a Brexit Delivery Department that would review inherited European Union laws, including data protection law, and would overhaul laws governing the City of London and speed up clinical trials. Truss held Cabinet positions under former prime ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, and her reputation grew when she was given the role of international trade secretary in 2019. She was promoted to foreign secretary in September last year and seen as a Johnson loyalist. Truss backs net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and was supportive of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP 26, outcomes. However, critics have said she did not include climate commitments in many trade deals when she ran the trade department. Commentators on social media said Truss appeared to emulate former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's dress and style in a televised debate last week, and she has cited Thatcher as an inspiration. In the weeks ahead, Sunak and Truss will face each other in at least two more televised debates, seeking to convince party members that they are the best choice for leader. In a statement, Mordaunt called on the two candidates to adopt a more moderate tone for the sake of the party. "Politics isn't easy. It can be a divisive and difficult place. We must all now work together to unify our party and focus on the job that needs to be done," she said. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) -- China supports the demand of developing countries, especially the vulnerable ones, to appeal for loss and damage funds from rich countries in regard of impacts of climate change, China's special envoy for climate change Xie Zhenhua said here on Wednesday. Xie, also the special representative for Chinese President Xi Jinping, made the remarks during a press conference at the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As a developing country, China also suffered huge losses this year due to climate disasters, Xie said, adding that "seeing the sufferings of other developing countries, we are fully aware of their feelings and are supportive of their demands." He pointed out that the solution to the loss and damage issue is clear, that is the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" established by the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement, and the Kyoto Protocol, which are all based on scientific research and historical responsibilities. "China is willing to, though not obliged to, help developing countries enhance their adaptability through South-South cooperation," Xie said, adding that China has provided 2 billion yuan (about 275.8 million U.S. dollars) to developing countries for adaptation and mitigation. Xie urged developed countries to fulfill their pledges made at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference more than a decade ago of providing 100 billion U.S. dollars annually to developing countries. "It has been 13 years since developed countries pledged 100 billion U.S. dollars annually at the Copenhagen conference in 2009, but they have not fulfilled it until now," the Chinese climate envoy said. Xie suggested developed countries to allocate 100 billion dollars this year, and set a timetable and roadmap for further fund increases after 2025 as required. The Chinese climate envoy called on the developed countries to fully implement the Paris Agreement, instead of scrapping it. "What are we going to do here is not to renegotiate the Paris Agreement, but to convert the promise into action and to produce solid results." Xie also introduced China's progress in the energy transition, methane emissions control and carbon trading. The COP27 is being held in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh till Nov. 18.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- China's climate envoy on Monday urged developed countries to fulfill their promises and "make the pie bigger" on climate finance at the ongoing UN climate conference. Xie Zhenhua, special representative for Chinese President Xi Jinping and China's special envoy for climate change, made the remarks at a high-level forum on South-South cooperation on climate change held at the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the China Pavilion in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Xie noted in his address that developing countries are the principal victims of climate change, with insufficient adaptation ability and external support in the face of global warming. "As a result, developing countries, in particular, need technical and financial support," Xie added. On the one hand, China is urging developed countries to fulfill their pledges and "make the pie bigger" on climate finance, the envoy noted. On the other hand, China is helping developing countries improve their climate adaptation capabilities through South-South cooperation. The fruit of China's South-South cooperation with other developing countries on climate change is "visible, tangible and effective," which are welcomed and highly praised by developing countries, Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to COP27 , said at the forum. Zhao, also vice minister of China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said as a developing nation and a major responsible country, China has always been an active advocate and pragmatic practitioner of South-South cooperation in the field of climate change. "So far, China has signed 45 climate change cooperation documents with 38 developing countries, constructed three low-carbon demonstration areas, carried out 42 climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, held 45 offline and seven online training courses in China, and trained about 2,000 officials and technicians in the field of climate change for more than 120 developing countries," said Zhao. During the forum, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said South-South cooperation is essential to achieve the goals set by the Paris Agreement. Through South-South cooperation, "we can build a more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable future," he noted. Stiell spoke highly of the Chinese government's efforts to bolster South-South cooperation, especially the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund established by China in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme to support recovery and reconstruction in several countries following extreme climate disasters.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt  Egypt is pushing to bridge the gaps between negotiating parties at the United Nations climate conference after negotiators finalized draft deals as the first week of the summit ended in the seaside resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. Egypt's Environment Minister Yasmine Fouad said the biggest challenge for Egypt as a host country is to have negotiators "convinced on different issues", including funds for countries to adapt to climate change and a consensus on loss and damage, meaning industrialized countries financing poorer, vulnerable ones being harmed by climate change. Speaking to The Associated Press at the climate summit, also known as COP27 , Fouad said Egypt is also working to advance the working program aimed at limiting warming to 1.5 C since preindustrial times in line with the Paris Agreement of 2015. Egypt has said it will pressure other countries to implement climate promises made at previous conferences. "There is a kind of agreement that we need to push the agenda forward," Fouad said of negotiations. "But it depends on all of us on that." Finance is another major challenge for developing countries looking to curb emissions, switch to renewable energy and protect their vulnerable communities from climatic shocks, such as drought and flooding. For the first time the summit agenda also includes the issue of loss and damage. Rift of distrust Rich countries have already fallen short of a pledge to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 in climate finance for poor countries. This has opened up a rift of distrust that negotiators are hoping to close with fresh pledges. But needs are growing, and a new, higher target needs to be set from 2025 on, some countries say. On Saturday, hundreds of environmental activists called on industrialized countries to pay for the impact of global warming. The protesters marched through a conference zone considered United Nations territory and governed by the global body's rules. Protesters also called for drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions being pumped into the atmosphere. Emissions continue to rise but scientists say the amount of heat-trapping gases needs to be almost halved by 2030 to meet the temperature-limiting goals of the Paris Agreement. Activists chanted "keep it in the ground" in reference to their rejection of the continued extraction of fossil fuels. On Friday, activists heckled US President Joe Biden's speech and raised an orange banner reading "People vs fuels" before they were removed.

CAIRO, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- The 44th edition of the Cairo International Film Festival (CIFF) kicked off on Sunday evening at Egypt's Cairo Opera House with the participation of about 108 films from over 50 countries and regions. Egyptian veteran movie star Hussein Fahmy, also president of the 44th CIFF, said that holding the festival amid current global conditions, including the Russian-Ukrainian crisis and the economic recession, was such a challenge. "There were big challenges and we did our best and managed to get strong and good preparations, and we'll hopefully present a good and a successful edition as we always do," the CIFF president told Xinhua on the red carpet during the opening ceremony. Fahmy added that the festival adopts eco-friendly policies as it coincides with the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, currently being held in Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh. "We greatly reduce paper publications and the use of plastic in the festival, and avoid whatever harms the environment to support the COP27 ," the festival's president added. The International Competition category of the festival gathers this year 14 films from countries including Egypt, France, Poland, Mexico, Argentina, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Brazil. Maher Khamis, an actor in the Egyptian featured film 19 B, which competes in the International Competition category, said that participating in the CIFF represents a milestone in his new acting career. "I feel blessed that my first film is competing in the CIFF. It's a big step for any actor to stand where I am now, so I really appreciate this moment," the Egyptian actor told Xinhua. Mexican filmmaker Joaquin del Paso, whose film The Hole in the Fence won last year's top award at the 43rd CIFF, came to the festival this year as a member of the International Competition jury. He said that the difficult global conditions inspired filmmakers to address those issues through art and creativity. The Mexican filmmaker said that cinema, in general, is an art that represents resistance and struggle. "To do a film festival and to put so much interest in it means that people want to keep fighting for beauty and for things that are good for humanity," he said. The Fabelmans by American renowned filmmaker Steven Spielberg was screened as the opening film of the 44th CIFF. The festival honors this year Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr, Egyptian filmmaker Kamla Abu Zekry and Egyptian veteran actress Lebleba for their achievements throughout their long artistic careers. Launched in 1976, the CIFF is the oldest and the only internationally accredited annual film festival in the Arab world, Africa and the Middle East. This year's CIFF will run from Nov. 13 to 22.

by Martina Fuchs GENEVA, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- The CEO of Arcelik, one of the world's biggest home appliance makers, told Xinhua recently that China is a bright spot for business amid global recession fears and an increasingly gloomy market outlook. Speaking of the present headwinds against the world economy, Hakan Bulgurlu said, "we will have to go through a lot of pain before it gets better." China, however, is "a little bit of a different picture," he said in a video interview with Xinhua. Established in 1955, Arcelik is a Turkish multinational household appliances manufacturer headquartered in Istanbul. With 45,000 employees, its global operations include subsidiaries in 53 countries, 30 production facilities in nine countries. Arcelik's domestic sales in China have grown by roughly 80 percent in 2022. "I find China one of the more promising places to be in the future. It has always been the factory of the world, and I think it will continue to be the factory of the world," said Bulgurlu. "The world economy has significantly slowed down, and we are facing a recession on many fronts," said the Turkish businessman, who had lived in Hong Kong for 13 years. Calling himself "a big fan" of China and Asia, Bulgurlu said he is optimistic about the business performance in the future Chinese market. "I think demand for appliances continues. We want to continue investing in China to actually bring our brands in." The international businessman also shared his view on environment protection as he is going to attend the upcoming 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Summit scheduled for Nov. 6-18 in Egypt. Recalling his reaching of the summit of Mt. Qomolangma in 2019, he said that experience taught him a lot about leadership in the fight against global warming and the responsibilities companies and business leaders share to act on climate change. According to Bulgurlu, four product groups, namely heating and cooling, refrigeration, lighting and electric motors, consume about 40 percent of all power. Many current technologies have made these production much more efficient. "We need global regulations to make us use the best available technologies in all of these product groups to reduce power consumption," he said. Regarding the upcoming COP27 meeting, he said "I hope to make some progress and talk not only with policymakers but other CEOs as well." "I actually admire China in the sense that when China makes a decision, it follows through very, very fast," Bulgurlu said. Enditem \</doc>

The low-income nations, which have done the least to cause climate change, often bear the brunt of the disastrous consequences of global warming ranging from floods, hurricanes to sea-level rises. The dire situation that many developing countries have found themselves in as a result of a warmer world has prompted them to call for the establishment of a fund through which the rich countries most responsible for climate change compensate the hardest-hit nations for their "loss and damage". Yet as the two-week COP 27 United Nations climate conference, being held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, nears its half-way point, little progress has been made over the question of whether and how the most vulnerable nations should be compensated. European Union negotiator Jacob Werksman said EU members were not ready to agree on a single funding solution, although he expressed the hope COP 27 would achieve more than just scheduling further talks on climate compensation. The United States and the EU have long resisted calls for a new fund for fear of spiraling liability. This, in addition to difficulties associated with how "loss and damage" are to be assessed, has made it almost impossible for any consensus to be reached on a special compensation fund at COP 27 . Indeed, the rich countries have so often failed to live up to the expectations of the developing nations. Little progress has been made so far even on the technical details of how to deliver on deals and pledges already made in previous years. For example, wealthy nations have largely failed to fully deliver on the $100 billion promised annually for climate adaptation. Last year's transfer came to only about $83 billion, mostly in the form of loans. Forecasts from the Institute for Economics and Peace predict that 1.2 billion people could be displaced globally by 2050 due to climate change and natural disasters. The developed countries, which are mainly responsible for historical emissions, have a moral obligation to extend a helping hand to the victims of climate change through a compensation fund. This is a matter of climate justice. \~ \</doc>

A barge with passengers and merchandise travels on the Congo River to the city of Kisangani, Tshopo province, northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo on August 31, 2022. Photos: AFP A tower bristling with sensors juts above the canopy in northern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from the world's second-largest tropical rainforest.\~ Spanning several countries in central Africa, the Congo Basin rainforest covers an immense area and is home to a dizzying array of species.\~ But there are growing concerns for the future of the forest, deemed critical for sequestering CO2, as loggers and farmers push deeper inside. Scientists at the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve in the DRC's Tshopo province are studying the rainforest's role in climate change - a subject that received scant attention until recently. Standing 55 meters tall, the CO2-measuring flux tower started to work in 2020 in the lush reserve of 250,000 hectares. Yangambi was renowned for tropical agronomy research during the Belgian colonial era.\~ This week, it also hosted scientists as part of meetings in the DRC dubbed pre- COP 27 , ahead of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt in November. Thomas Sibret, who runs the CongoFlux CO2 measuring project, said that flux towers are common worldwide. But until one was set up in Yangambi, there had been none in Congo, which had "limited our understanding of this ecosystem," he said. Around 30 billion tons of carbon are stored across the Congo Basin, researchers estimated in 2016. The figure is roughly equivalent to three years' global emissions. Sibret said more time is required to draw definitive conclusions from the data gathered by DRC's flux tower, but one thing is certain: The rainforest sequesters more greenhouse gases than it emits. 'No more trees'\~ Paolo Cerutti, the head of the Center for International Forestry Research's operations in Congo, said this phenomenon was good news.\~ In Latin America, "we're starting to see evidence that the Amazon (rainforest) is becoming more of an emitter," he said. "We're betting a lot on the Congo Basin, especially the DRC, which has 160 million hectares of forest still capable of absorbing carbon," Cerutti said. But Cerutti warned that slash-and-burn agriculture poses a particular threat to the future of the rainforest, pointing out that half a million hectares of forest were lost in 2021. Slash-and-burn agriculture sees villagers cultivate lands until they become depleted, then clear forests to create new lands, and repeat the cycle.\~ With the DRC's population of about 100 million people is set to expand, many worry the forest is in dire threat.\~ Jean-Pierre Botomoito, the head of the Yanonge area about 40 kilometers from Yangambi, said that he once thought the forest was inexhaustible.But "here, there are no trees," he said. Villagers in his once-forested region now have to travel long distances along narrow muddy paths to find tree-dwelling caterpillars - a local delicacy.\~ Charcoal used for cooking in the absence of electricity and gas is similarly hard to obtain. There are efforts to help farmers in the remote and impoverished region to make a living while sustaining the environment. A large project, for example, trains farmers to rotate cassava and groundnut crops between fast-growing acacia trees. Farmers can harvest the acacia trees to make charcoal after six years. Experts also encourage the use of more efficient kilns to produce more charcoal and teach loggers how to select which trees to fell. Vandalism\~ A scientist checks the devices installed on the trees in the Yangambi Biosphere Reserve, northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, on September 2, 2022.Photo:AFP Jean Amis, the head of a local farmers' organization, was enthusiastic about the project. "We didn't necessarily have the right practices" before, he said. But not all residents of the surrounding area support the various schemes. Some people believe that the flux tower is stealing oxygen, for example, or that it is a prelude to land appropriation. Researchers often find dendrometers - devices that measure tree dimensions - vandalized, and some traditional chiefs think the forest will grow back by itself without outside interference.\~ The Indonesia-based Center for International Forestry Research says that resistance to the schemes can be overcome through raising awareness.\~ Dieu Merci Assumani, the director of the DRC's National Institute for Agricultural Research, agreed. But he said there needs to be more financing for locals, who have seen little benefit from promised funds to protect the rainforest. Assumani pointed as an example to the $500-million deal to protect the Congo Basin rainforest, signed by president of the DRC Felix Tshisekedi and former British prime minister Boris Johnson in Glasgow in 2021. "Commitments are all very well, but they need to be disbursed," he said.\~ \</doc>

The past two months have seen China taking a series of concrete actions to enhance South-South climate cooperation, namely projects among developing nations. Small island states, which are particularly vulnerable to global warming, are among China's major concerns. On April 28, for example, China launched a center in Shandong province to cooperate with Pacific Island countries on climate change. The center is the first multilateral cooperation platform China has established on climate change. Under the center's cooperation mechanism, China and Pacific Island countries will establish platforms for professional training, technology cooperation and academic research. At the center's unveiling ceremony, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and Kiribati's office of the president signed a memorandum of understanding on aid. About one month later, the ministry signed a similar MOU with the office of the president of Fiji, vowing to aid the island state with materials such as solar-powered street lamps and home solar systems. China has reached 43 agreements with 38 countries on South-South climate cooperation, according to a recent article by the ministry's Party chief Sun Jinlong in the magazine Contemporary World. Aside from allocating 1.2 billion yuan ($178 million) for such cooperation, Sun said, China has offered training programs to about 2,000 officials and technicians in climate-related posts from 120 countries. President Xi Jinping, while addressing the opening ceremony of the 2015 United Nations climate change conference in Paris, announced that China would launch cooperation projects to set up 10 pilot low-carbon industrial parks in other developing countries and start 100 mitigation and adaptation programs. One of the parks China planned to build, for example, was launched in Laos on April 29. Covering 11.5 square kilometers and with a total planned investment of about $5 billion, the Vientiane Saysettha Low-Carbon Demonstration Zone is expected to function as both an industrial park and a new town of the Lao capital. On the same day, China officially handed over a shipment of equipment for the demonstration zone to Laos, including 12 new energy buses and eight new energy trucks. The first shipment of such equipment from China arrived in Vientiane in August. On May 27, China also helped Cuba with its efforts on climate change, including sending 5,000 sets of home solar systems and 25,000 energy-saving lights. Huang Runqiu, minister of ecology and environment, said on June 14 that China will accelerate the green transition in the country's cooperation and investment in nations involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, and make consistent efforts to promote South-South climate cooperation. "China will help developing nations to the best of its ability, particularly small island states, African nations and the least developed countries to ramp up capabilities in tackling climate change," he said, addressing the opening ceremony for the annual general meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development, a high-level international think tank for the Chinese government. Making full use of many international occasions, China has consistently urged developed nations to honor their commitment to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries tackle and adapt to climate change, which was enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The commitment has yet to be honored, despite the negotiations having lasted for 13 years. This is "hardly justifiable", said Xie Zhenhua, China's special climate envoy, when addressing the BRICS Highlevel Meeting on Climate Change with counterparts from Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa in May. "China's endeavor in beefing up South-South climate cooperation will promote the low-carbon transition process in these developing states, which are not only vulnerable to climate change, but also have inadequate capabilities in forging the transition," said Tang Xinhua, deputy director of the Center for Climate Change and Ecological Security Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. In stark contrast, however, he said the United States has given more importance to cooperation in which it plays a dominant role. Some of the projects have jeopardized the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement. The US and the European Union, for example, plan to impose limits on methane emissions from major economies. The duo's initiative may bring new emission reduction pressures to many developing nations that rely on coal, natural gas, farming and livestock. "It will blur the differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries for addressing the climate crisis," he said.

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-04 10:33 With just days to go until the start of the United Nations COP27 climate summit in Egypt, the British government, which was president and host of COP26 last year in Glasgow, has been criticized for failing to make good on $300 million worth of climate finance payments it had promised. Newly-installed British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had initially said he would not be attending the major gathering of world leaders because of more pressing political concerns at home, until he was forced into making a U-turn after being criticized by climate lobby groups, opposition politicians and members of his own government. Now the Politico website reports that the government, which has been in turmoil with three prime ministers in the last two months, failed to meet its September deadline to donate $288 million to the Green Climate Fund, or GCF, a resource to help developing countries, many of which contribute least to climate change but feel its effects the most, to make adaptations to mitigate climate effect. An additional pledge of $20.6 million to the same fund has also not yet been forthcoming. In the minutes of a recent GCF board meeting in South Korea, it was noted that three projects the fund had given approval to were currently unable to proceed because of a "lower volume of contributions from contributors than was anticipated". Clare Shakya, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development's climate change group, called the government's failure to honor its obligations "very, very poor timing". "This is in the context when COP26 was all about rebuilding trust," she said. "The UK has pushed every other country to up what they are doing to increase climate and adaptation funding. "And now, even before COP27 , the engineers of the trust-building exercise are reneging on their own promises. It's such a strong negative signal to developing countries that they should not trust rich nations." Caroline Lucas, the only Green Party representative in the British Parliament, welcomed Sunak's decision to go after what she called "an embarrassing misstep on the world stage", and said it was important to send out a similarly positive message about the issue of climate payments. "Let this be a lesson to (Sunak) - climate leadership matters," she tweeted. "Now he urgently needs to increase UK ambition on emission reduction targets and pay what we owe to global climate funds." A year on from having hosted COP26, Britain is ending its presidency "weaker" and with "disappointing" leadership, Alyssa Gilbert, director of policy at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute told the BBC, as summed up by Sunak's U-turn. "One of the key things about COP is political leadership from the top," she said. "Dithering from the prime minister is worse in a year when we are the presidents of COP." \</doc>

BERLIN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday warned of a "global renaissance of fossil energy and coal in particular" as a result of a gas shortage caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Germany and Egypt are co-chairing the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin, which is intended to set the course for the upcoming COP27 world climate conference in November. Representatives of around 40 countries are seeking agreements on the further course in the fight against the climate crisis. "No one can be satisfied with the fact that the share of coal-fired power generation is just rising again in our country, too," Scholz said at the meeting. In his video remarks, United Nations (UN) Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged further cooperation. "What troubles me most is that, in facing this global crisis, we are failing to work together as a multilateral community." "Nations continue to play the blame game instead of taking responsibility for our collective future," Guterres said. "We need to demonstrate at COP27 that a renewables revolution is underway." To prevent a shortage of gas this winter, Germany has recently paved the way for more coal-fired power plants to replace gas-powered plants for electricity generation. "This is a short-term emergency measure that will not be at the expense of our climate targets," Scholz said. "Everything we do today to secure gas supplies must be in line with our goal of becoming CO2-neutral in Germany and worldwide in the future," Scholz said. No new permanent dependencies on fossil energy sources should be created, he said. Earlier this month, the German Bundesrat, the upper house of Parliament, ratified a large legislative package to accelerate the expansion of renewables in the country. To bring the share of renewables in the energy mix from 50 percent to 80 percent by 2030, 2 percent of the country's surface area is to be made available for onshore wind turbines. Enditem \</doc>

By EARLE GALE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-08 09:29 Major economies have significantly failed to honor their commitment made at the United Nations' COP26 climate summit to financially support developing nations in their battle against global warming, new analysis reveals as world leaders gather in Egypt for COP27 . Carbon Brief said: "The US should be paying nearly $40 billion toward the $100 billion climate-finance target &hellip; This is $32 billion more than the estimated $8 billion it actually gave in 2020." With the planet having already warmed 1.1C since pre-industrial times and with it predicted to warm by another 2.8C this century based on its current trajectory, global leaders are facing a tough job to instead limit warming to 1.5C by 2100, which is the planet's best hope of avoiding catastrophe. But Carbon Brief said rich nations are simply not pulling their weight. With better-off countries supposed to pay developing nations $100 billion a year, the website said Australia and Canada have only actually handed over about one-third of their obligation. Although the UK did better in contributing three-quarters of its share each year, it is still falling about $1.4 billion short. Developing nations have argued that they have done little to contribute to global warming, which was largely triggered by developed nations industrializing many decades ago. Developing nations therefore argue that the more long-established polluters should pay more to off set damage caused to the planet's climate by pollution. Antonio Guterres, the UN's secretary general, said before COP27 began: "We need a global surge in adaptation investment to save millions of lives from climate carnage." Carbon Brief's analysis was not all bad news, however. Some rich nations actually contributed more than they were obliged to, with Switzerland forking over four times its obligated amount. France and Norway also did well, contributing three times their share. And Japan found $13 billion more than it was expected to find, which was double of its share. However, Carbon Brief noted that some developed nations that contributed more than expected did so in the form of loans instead of as grants. The Guardian newspaper quoted Mohamed Nasheed, a former president of the Maldives, as saying: "Basic justice demands that those most responsible for causing the climate crisis should financially support those who are suffering most on the frontline of climate change." He said his nation and others like it in the V20 group of 58 of the world's most vulnerable nations believe they have already suffered $500 billion in losses because of climate change. \</doc>

RIYADH, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Riyadh. Xi pointed out that as the regional and international environments are undergoing profound and complex changes, the strategic and overarching importance of China-Egypt relations has become all the more evident. The visions and interests that China and Egypt share mean that the two sides need to work together toward the building of a China-Egypt community with a shared future in the new era and toward greater advancement of the China-Egypt comprehensive strategic partnership. Xi underscored that China firmly supports Egypt in choosing a development path that suits its national conditions and in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests. China is ready to deepen Belt and Road cooperation with Egypt, ensure the on-schedule and high-quality completion of the train project in the 10th of Ramadan City and the Central Business District (CBD) in the new administrative capital of Egypt, and make the China-Egypt Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone and other major cooperation projects a success. China is ready to import more quality products from Egypt and expand cooperation in investment and financing, joint vaccine production and aerospace. The two sides need to promote the Luban Workshops and Chinese language learning so that more people will become bridges for China-Egypt friendship, said Xi. China hopes to seize the opportunity offered by the first China-Arab States Summit to work with Egypt to build a China-Arab community with a shared future and to better implement the nine programs announced at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, said Xi. China congratulates Egypt on the success of the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), and aims to strengthen communication and cooperation with Egypt in energy transition, green economic sectors and low-carbon technologies, said Xi. China is ready to step up cooperation with Egypt in the United Nations and on other multilateral platforms, and jointly advocate true multilateralism, uphold the basic norms of international relations, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and promote peace and stability in the region and beyond, said Xi. Sisi said that under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China has made great development achievements and gained notable international stature. He extended heartfelt congratulations on the success of the recently held 20th CPC National Congress. Egypt is glad to have a great friend like China and looks forward to further enhancing Egypt-China comprehensive strategic partnership and promoting bilateral cooperation in various fields so as to deliver more good results, he said. The Egyptian side firmly adheres to the one-China policy, and firmly supports China's position on Hong Kong, Xinjiang and other issues concerning China's core interests, and firmly opposes interference by any force in China's internal affairs, he said. Egypt will continue to work with China to advance Belt and Road cooperation. Egypt welcomes China's active participation in important infrastructure projects in Egypt. Its doors are wide open to Chinese companies hoping to invest and seek cooperation in Egypt. Egypt hopes to strengthen cooperation with China in vaccine research and development, he said. He thanked China for its important and positive role in COP27 , saying that Egypt stands ready to enhance multilateral communication and cooperation with China. He looks forward to the first China-Arab States Summit expected to open a new era for Arab-China relations. Ding Xuexiang, Wang Yi and He Lifeng, among others, attended the meeting. Enditem \</doc>

By WANG XIAODONG in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-10 06:35 China supports the proposal that developed countries compensate developing countries, especially those most vulnerable to the impact of climate change, for the loss and damage they suffer because of global climate change, Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, said on Wednesday. The topic of "loss and damage" has for the first time been included in the main agenda for discussion during the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Egypt's coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Many developing countries have been arguing that they emit a fraction of greenhouse gases compared with industrialized countries, but are disproportionately impacted by the consequences of global climate change. COP27 , adding he is glad to see that the topic is on the agenda of this year's session. "We support the idea of establishing a special fund to address loss and damage," he said. "Various parties need to join efforts to find a proper way for financing through negotiation." Countries at different stages of development have common but different responsibilities in addressing the "loss and damage" issue, Xie said, adding that China - although it has no need to compensate for loss and damage - would like to cooperate with other developing countries to help them with climate change mitigation and adaptation. During COP27 "Loss and damage is not an abstract topic of endless dialogue: It is our daily experience and the living nightmare of millions of Kenyans and hundreds of millions of Africans," William Ruto, president of Kenya, said during the conference. "Loss and damage must therefore be addressed with a level of seriousness, which demonstrates fairness, urgency and consideration." Xie also urged developed countries to fulfill their promise of providing $100 billion to developing countries every year as soon as possible to help them fight climate change. "Developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion every year in Copenhagen in 2009, but the commitment has not been honored 13 years later," he said, adding a financing gap of $260 billion has accumulated over the past 13 years. "In addition, to honor the $100 billion pledge, a road map should be released on repaying the debt of $260 billion and increasing financing further after 2025 for developing countries," Xie said. Addressing the conference's Climate Implementation Summit on Tuesday, Xie said China has been actively tackling climate change through persistent and pragmatic actions. "China's firm determination and position to implement the goals of reaching carbon peak and achieving carbon neutrality, and to actively participate in global climate governance will never change," Xie said. \</doc>

CARACAS, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday proposed reviving the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) to protect South America's Amazon rainforest. Addressing a High-Level Regional Dialogue on the theme of the "Amazon as a pillar of climate and life balance," held in Egypt, Maduro said reactivating the bloc would be key to conserving the forest. "I think that the first step should be to revive the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization ... with its historical capacity to monitor the Amazon and its number of proposals for recovering" the embattled forest, Maduro said. It is a responsibility of the South American countries "to stop the destruction of the Amazon and initiate a process of coordinated, efficient, conscious, active recovery of the Amazon," said the president. Maduro hailed as "good news" the fact that Colombia and Brazil elected Gustavo Petro and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, respectively, as heads of state, noting their commitment to the preservation of the Amazon. The dialogue was held as part of the 27th Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is taking place in Egypt. Enditem \</doc>

By Angus McNeice in London | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-08-01 07:23 Leaders prepare for 'worst-case scenario' on fears of a total shut off Just one of five turbines is currently whirring within the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, the chief artery that pumps gas from Russia to Europe. Previously reduced capacity was once again lowered to 20 percent on Wednesday by Russia's energy company Gazprom, raising fears of a total shut off. Russia says that it is impossible to run the pipeline effectively, since foreign sanctions have delayed the repair and return of turbines, which are made and serviced abroad. As the dispute rumbles on, European leaders are preparing for a worst-case scenario involving an unprecedented prolonged cut-off of all Russian gas, which last year made up 47 percent of EU imports. "Whether it is a partial or a major cut-off of Russian gas, or a total cut-off of Russian gas, Europe needs to be ready," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a recent statement. The bloc's current strategy involves three key measures: increased supply from non-Russian sources; a reduction in overall demand, with member states agreeing to a voluntary 15-percent cut from August through March; and setting up a joint gas storage mechanism, which is currently around two-thirds full. Stores would need to reach 90 percent to get Europe through winter, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. "And even then, it could still face supply disruptions in the latter part of the heating season," said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. If supply remains low or is totally shut off, the geopolitical and economic ramifications will be significant. European nations that import comparatively little Russian gas, such as Spain and the United Kingdom, will still contend with rising costs, according to a new working paper from the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, and more exposed countries in Central and Eastern Europe could face outright gas shortages and see gross domestic product losses of as much as 6 percent. Meanwhile, gas exporters have benefited from the situation. The United States becomes the world's largest exporter of liquid natural gas, or LNG, in the first half of this year, with two thirds of exports going to Europe. "A new LNG trade, built on long-term contracts, will develop between the US and EU," David Evans, senior counsel at international law firm Clifford Chance, predicted. Sanctions disrupt supply One of two functioning turbines was due to be taken off line for maintenance this week, and replaced with a newly-serviced turbine. However, the replacement did not arrive on time, meaning capacity dropped to 20 percent on Wednesday. Nord Stream 1 turbines are made by German company Siemens and serviced in Canada. Sanctions in place due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict have delayed repair and return of a turbine that was expected back in May, according to Gazprom. A key issue is how quickly Europe can substitute supply. The EU imports 47 percent of its gas and 25 percent of its oil from Russia. Put another way, the bloc imports more than one-quarter, or 26 percent, of its energy from Russia. Von der Leyen said she is in talks with Qatar, Algeria, Egypt, and Azerbaijan over increasing fossil fuel imports, and, meanwhile, both Norway and the US have significantly upped supply. Authors of the IMF paper estimate that Europe could replace up to 70 percent of Russian gas imports with alternatives for a period of six months. However, a longer full shut-off would likely produce very high prices and significant shortages in some countries. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic could face shortages equivalent to 40 percent of gas consumption and GDP shrinkage of up to 6 percent, according to the IMF paper. Climate pledge at risk To minimize gas use in the power sector, the IEA's Birol said that European nations will have to temporarily increase coal and oil-fired generation. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference , or COP26, in Glasgow last November, UN member states agreed to phase down use of coal. Clifford Chance's Evans expects that these efforts will be put on hold. "Some fossil-based substitute for Russian fossil fuel is needed, especially for industrial uses that will take longer to decarbonize," Evans said. Europe's thirst for new sources of fuel has already created a "global gold rush for new fossil gas production", according to the Climate Action Tracker. Canada has plans to fast-track new LNG projects, domestic production has increased in the US, Norway, Italy and Japan, and Nigeria has revived old gas pipeline projects, while Senegal is seeking to export gas to Europe for the first time. \</doc>

KISUMU, Kenya, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The 27th conference of parties to the United Nations framework convention on climate change ( COP27 ) slated for Egypt from Nov. 7-18 offers an opportunity to raise the visibility of Africa's quest for a green and resilient future, a UN official said Saturday on the sidelines of ninth edition of Africities Summit taking place in Kenya's western city of Kisumu. Mahmoud Mohieldin, a UN special envoy and COP27 climate champion, said the summit in Egypt will discuss Africa's ability to manage the climate crisis in order to shield communities from poverty, hunger and water stress. Mohieldin said that time was ripe for the continent to align its long-term development blueprint with national carbon emission reduction initiatives. He noted that the five-day Africities Summit had devoted ample time to discuss effective strategies that were required to tame climate emergencies in Africa and improve resilience of local communities and habitats. Mohieldin said that during the upcoming climate summit in Egypt, African nations will be in a vantage position to negotiate for adequate funding, technology transfer and capacity development aimed at strengthening response to climatic shocks. He called for community-centered interventions geared towards realization of a green future in a continent bearing the brunt of climatic shocks like severe droughts, flooding, habitat loss and violent storms. Mohieldin said that besides spotlighting the magnitude of climate emergencies in Africa, the summit in Egypt will also serve as a rallying call for governments, investors and lenders to leverage clean technologies and innovations as a means to promote resilience and inject vitality into the continent's economies. Africa's agenda 2063 on socio-economic transformation alongside the 2030 universal goals will be reinvigorated once the continent accelerates the momentum towards low carbon development, said Mohieldin.

JERUSALEM, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Germany on Friday signed an energy cooperation agreement to deal with the global climate crisis, the Israeli Ministry of Energy said in a statement. Following talks in recent months, the two parties agreed on a joint work plan that will cover areas like energy security, sustainable and renewable energies, and energy efficiency in the urban space. The agreement was signed by Lior Schillat, director general of the Israeli Ministry of Energy, and Birgit Schwenk, director general for Climate Action at the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, during the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. "Israel will learn from the German experience in increasing the introduction of renewable energies into the electricity grid, managing the grid, and formulating a hydrogen strategy," Schillat said. "At the same time, Israel will assist Germany in everything related to the protection of critical and cyber infrastructures and knowledge sharing in the agrivoltaics field," he added. Schwenk stated that "the partnership provides an effective framework for jointly dealing with the current challenges of the energy transition from fossil energy to renewable energy." Enditem \</doc>

Photo: VCG China on Thursday presented its hard-earned achievements over the years on cutting emissions, such as CO2 emissions per unit of GDP being halved since 2005, and deepening cooperation on tackling climate change with the most affected South Pacific countries. With this year's climate summit, known as COP27 , drawing closer, those results are being seen as a demonstration of China's efforts of fulfilling commitment of its pledge and a rebuttal of outside critics of such endeavor. Experts said China's determination of making these efforts, despite the current plight on energy and amid climate crisis, formed a sharp contrast to Western countries' empty promises. They believed when the annual climate summit is in sight, the West should show their sincerity of solving global warming by fulfilling the promises of handing over lesser rich countries the financial commitment, instead of hijacking emerging economies to set aggressive targets, which will only disrupt friendly atmosphere for cooperation.\~ China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment held a press conference on Thursday, elaborated China's measures and actions on climate change. Li Gao, director general of the Department of Climate Change under the ministry said at the conference that CO2 emissions per unit of GDP have decreased 50.8 percent compared with that of 2005, and 3.8 percent lower than last year; and the share of non-fossil energy consumption increased to 16.6 percent. Key numbers in China's 2022 report on Responding to Climate Change Graphic: Deng Zijun/GT It has also outlined measures of achieving emission goals such as kicking off pilot test in suitable cities and expanding climate change-related projects in certain places first.\~ Presenting those achievements before COP27 , the annual UN meeting on climate, which will take place in Egypt from\~ November 6 to 18, is part of the aim to show China's achievement in fulfilling its international pledge on cutting emission, said Chinese experts.\~ "Those achievements and commitments are no walkover nor empty promises, given that this year the energy market is wrecked by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which has led many rich countries to switch to coal; and natural disasters, including droughts and flood have gripped many parts of the world, including China itself," Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday. Blustery over promise Lin noted that China's gesture of making inroads despite current plight also formed a sharp contrast with hypocrisy of certain developed countries, especially the US, which used climate cooperation as disguise to slap trade barriers, or politicize this issue to pressure China. In a recent interview with the Guardian, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry urged China to return to the negotiating table with the US on the climate crisis to kickstart stalled global progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. China suspended climate talks with the US, which is one of the eight countermeasures China's Foreign Ministry announced in August in response to the provocative visit of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to island of Taiwan.\~ The US has repeatedly urged China to return to the climate change negotiation table but skirted around the fundamental question of why China suspended those negotiations, and thus passed the buck on China for stalling the talks. Maybe the latest call\~ is partly to "warm the atmosphere of throwing mud at China" before COP27 , or for its midterm election, but the US should realize that any cooperation between the two cannot be isolated from the general atmosphere, Yang Fuqiang, a senior advisor on climate change and energy transition at the Energy Research Institute at Peking University, noting that the US is the one who bungled climate cooperation, and China won't return to the negotiation table unless Washington shows intention to correct its wrongs.\~ Lin also pointed out that even if when China and the US were both at the negotiation table, Washington has frequently used climate change to wage trade barriers against China and crack down its renewable energy industry. Using the so-called "forced labor" issue as an excuse, the US imposed sanctions on some Chinese photovoltaic enterprises in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in 2021, an act that has not only undermined the cooperative atmosphere between China and the US, but has hindered renewable energy development around the world. Although the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act in August, which contains hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for cleaner technologies and seen as a victory for the climate, poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research recently shows that 49 percent of Americans say it won't make much of a difference on climate change, and 14 percent think it will do more to hurt it. The UN released a report on Wednesday saying that without drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the planet is on track to warm by an average of 2.1 to 2.9 degrees Celsius, compared with preindustrial levels, by 2100. That's far higher than the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) set by the landmark Paris agreement in 2015. With data collected from 50 emerging economies, such as Thailand, Turkey, Israel and Kenya, a Chinese research paper led by Guan Dabo, a professor from the Department of Earth System Science at Tsinghua University said that although emerging economies emitted less than 1 percent of the global total, their total amount accounts for 1.6 times that of India, the world's third-largest emitter. Yet to restrict the global average temperature this century to well below 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels while leaving emerging economies enough space for further growth in emissions, developed nations need to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 7.2 percent per year on average, Guan said. However, statistics show that from 2010 to 2018 the EU and the US saw their carbon emissions decrease by only 1.4 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.\~ This has raised pressing demand for developed countries not only to realize their negative emission goals, making room for emerging economies, but also to offer those countries technological and economic support, Guan told the Global Times. Yet rich countries generally lag behind their promises to offer poorer countries assistance on climate change. Rich countries agreed in 2009 that at least $100 billion a year would be provided annually from public and private sector sources to the developing world by 2020, in order to help poor countries cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impact of the climate crisis. At the Thursday conference, Li also urged developed countries to fulfill their annual funding commitments of $100 billion as soon as possible, instead of just submitting a report during COP27 that makes excuses for the delay in fulfilling funding commitments. "This has not only seriously affected and hindered the development of climate action in developing countries, but has also seriously damaged mutual political trust between developed and developing countries," Li said.\~ A green collaborator\~ In contrast, China is sparing no effort in helping developed countries go greener. Li said that the low-lying South Pacific countries are the key collaborators with China on climate change, and currently China already has inked cooperation with countries such as Tonga, Samoa, Fiji and Kiribati, including assisting them in training professional personnel in dealing with climate change.\~ China made a promise last year that it would increase support for green and low-carbon energy in developing countries, and not build any new coal-fired power projects overseas. China aims to enhance cooperation in multiple areas with the countries along the route of the Belt and Road Initiative by 2025 and form a green development pattern for the initiative by 2030, according to a guideline issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and three relevant departments in March. He Kebin, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and professor at the School of Environment of Tsinghua University, told the Global Times that China has demonstrated firm determination to help Belt and Road Initiative go greener, and in the future it will up the ante on investing in green and renewable energy on this initiative.\~ \</doc>

The Export-Import Bank (Exim) - the USA's official export credit agency - has issued two Letters of Interest for the financing of US-sourced pre-project technical services at the Cernavoda 3 and 4 nuclear power project in Romania. The US Exim Letters of Intent, which were announced at the COP27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, follow the memorandum of understanding signed in October 2020, in which Exim expressed an interest to finance major energy investment projects in Romania, including nuclear ones, up to a total value of USD7 billion. Nuclearelectrica said the strategy for completing Cernavoda 3 and 4 is being implemented in three stages, in accordance with the international experience in the construction of nuclear power plants. Original Press Release: Nov. 10 -- China National Nuclear Corporation issued the following news release: The Export-Import Bank (Exim) - the USA's official export credit agency - has issued two Letters of Interest for the financing of US-sourced pre-project technical services at the Cernavoda 3 and 4 nuclear power project in Romania. According to Romanian utility Nuclearelectrica, based on the preliminary information submitted, Exim would be able to consider financing up to USD50 million of the US export contract for pre-project engineering services as part of the engineering multiplier programme and up to USD3 billion of the US export contract for engineering and project management services for the completion of the partially-built Cernavoda units 3 and 4. The US Exim Letters of Intent, which were announced at the COP27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, follow the memorandum of understanding signed in October 2020, in which Exim expressed an interest to finance major energy investment projects in Romania, including nuclear ones, up to a total value of USD7 billion. Cernavoda is the only nuclear power plant in Romania and consists of two 650 MWe pressurised heavy-water reactors. Unit 1 went into commercial operation in 1996 and unit 2 in 2007. Operator Nuclearelectrica plans to extend the operating life of unit 1 to 60 years. Most of the work on units 3 and 4 - like units 1 and 2, CANDU-6 reactors - was done in the 1980s prior to the fall of the government of Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989. In July 2020, Romania launched a tender for a new feasibility study to complete units 3 and 4. Nuclearelectrica said the strategy for completing Cernavoda 3 and 4 is being implemented in three stages, in accordance with the international experience in the construction of nuclear power plants. Stage 1 started at the end of 2021 and represents the preparatory stage. This stage will last up to 24 months, during which a set of engineering and safety documentation necessary for the project re-start will be prepared/up-dated, required to substantiate a preliminary investment decision. Stage 2 of the project consists of performing preliminary works and is estimated to last up to 30 months. This stage will consist in preparation of critical engineering for the definition of the project, structuring and contracting financing and agreeing upon an adequate contractual architecture for the implementation of the project, obtaining the construction licence, reassessing the feasibility of the project based upon updated technical and economic indicators and making the final investment decision. Stage 3 of the project consists of site mobilisation, start of the construction works, commissioning and start of the commercial operation of unit 3 in 2030 and unit 4 in 2031.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- Countries enduring conflicts are highly vulnerable to climate risks due to their limited adaptive capacity, said a senior Red Cross official in a recent interview with Xinhua. "People affected by armed conflict and violence are among the most vulnerable to climate change, yet remain largely excluded from efforts to adapt to its consequences," said Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC). Mardini made the remarks on the sidelines of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, currently being held in Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh. The ICRC seeks to draw attention to the humanitarian consequences of climate risks and environmental degradation on conflict-affected populations, the Red Cross official told Xinhua. He explained that the vast majority of the countries enduring armed conflict and other violence are among the world's least developed countries, describing some of them as "the most vulnerable to the climate crisis." Among these countries are Afghanistan, Somalia, Mali, and Yemen, Mardini cited, noting that such countries are vulnerable to droughts, floods, insect plagues, and changing rainfall patterns. "People enduring conflict are not only among the most vulnerable to the climate crisis, but they are also among those most neglected by climate actions," said the ICRC director-general. Climate is changing everywhere, and climate shocks become more severe, "but it is people living in fragile contexts who will be most severely impacted," he emphasized. The ICRC chief stressed that climate risks create health needs through the multiplication of respiratory problems, greater food insecurity, and the rise of certain diseases. He called on world leaders through COP27 to live up to their commitments under the Paris Agreement to ensure that vulnerable and conflict-affected people are adequately supported to adapt to a changing climate. They should ensure that this action is adequately supported by fit-for-purpose climate finance, he added. "A greater proportion of climate finance must reach communities affected by conflict and violence to reduce people's double vulnerability to climate risks," said Mardini. He lamented the current "gap" between stable countries and fragile ones in access to funding for climate action. Adaptation in the countries affected by conflict and violence in which the ICRC works remains "underfunded and deprioritized," he pointed out. Mardini added that conflicts disrupt the foundations of societies by affecting governance and institutions, the economy, social cohesion, and the environment, limiting people's capacity to cope with any climate shocks and changes, including heatwaves. The ICRC official called for efforts to pull climate finance in the direction of conflict-torn communities, to mobilize donor states and other actors towards more ambitious climate action, and to increase their support for climate change adaptation in conflict-affected countries. Climate finance should also be more evenly allocated between climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, according to Mardini. "Together with partner organizations, we have made recommendations in our latest paper on climate finance in fragile settings towards such action," he noted. "We will continue to share this message with climate actors who are not present or have limited visibility into areas affected by armed conflict," Mardini said. The ICRC, as a humanitarian organization that seeks to alleviate suffering in situations of conflict, pushes for climate finance and action in communities affected by conflict and violence. "No one can address these challenges alone. We must work together across the humanitarian sector and beyond to strengthen climate action," he said. "We must collectively find solutions and ensure access to adequate climate finance in challenging environments. Leaving people behind is not an option," Mardini told Xinhua. Enditem \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- Political leaders on Thursday highlighted the impact of climate change and called for collective action in their speeches to the General Debate of the UN General Assembly. CLIMATE DISRUPTION Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum said in his speech that the African continent is being exposed to worsening food insecurity, displacement of populations, recurring droughts and pressure on water resources due to climate disruption. In the Sahel region, to which Niger belongs, climate change negatively affects farming, pastoral activities and water resources. He said climate change is also responsible for extreme droughts, torrential rains, and heat waves. The deterioration of the security situation in the Sahel is partly attributable to climate change, he said. Instability and lawlessness made the vast territory in southern Libya a platform for transnational organized crime, "where we see a blossoming of trafficking in arms, drugs, fuels and migrants," he noted. As climate change threatens the practice of pastoral farming, violence is on the rise among young shepherds, and many have turned to terrorism, he said. SOMALIA'S CHALLENGES Somalia is facing a looming famine amid challenges from terrorism, said Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on Thursday, calling for international support. "Somalia is caught between floods and droughts annually, owing to climate change and poor infrastructure. Our people, who have a long tradition of living harmoniously with nature and barely contributing to poisonous emissions warming the Earth, are the ones who are paying with their lives today," he told the General Assembly. "We know that climate change is real, and we are living with the evidence of its painful and destructive reality today. We also know that Somalia, and the rest of the world, cannot develop sustainably without the global climate crisis being jointly addressed quickly and effectively," said the president. "In the long term, we must collectively work together to ensure that we mitigate the acceleration of the dangerous and costly climate crisis by meeting the commitment to invest in and adequately finance climate adaptation in the most affected and vulnerable regions of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa," he said. EXISTENTIAL THREAT Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said climate change is an immediate existential threat for small island developing states (SIDS) like his country. SIDS "are always mindful that despite our best efforts to improve our financial management and debt sustainability, a single climate event could wipe out 100 percent of our economy in a few hours," he said at the General Debate. "Concerted action to slow down and halt global temperature rise is literally a question of our survival. While we will continue to develop our own resilience and play our part in mitigating climate change, we cannot, by our action alone, change the trajectory," said Holness. Jamaica looks forward to the UN Climate Change Conference in Egypt ( COP27 ) later this year. It calls on all countries to meet their commitments and contributions to climate targets and developed nations to increase their commitments to climate financing, particularly for adaptation and loss and damage. SIDS and some middle-income countries have a particular vulnerability to climate shocks and external economic shocks, which have an oversized impact on their national budgets and infrastructure, he said. Jamaica believes that a comprehensive and targeted approach to accessing development finance is needed, he said. "We eagerly anticipate an era of truly equitable access to concessional financing and other funding support, which will enable us to invest in resilient infrastructure and create fiscal buffers so that we can withstand and recover quickly from the next economic, health or climate shock with little borrowing." Without acknowledging such vulnerabilities, SIDS will continue to struggle and be unable to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, he warned. CALLING FOR GLOBAL RESPONSE In a video message for the Alliance of Small Island States leaders' breakfast, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday that COP27 must make tangible progress. " COP27 must demonstrate that the world is making progress on all pillars of the Paris Agreement. We urgently need to address loss and damage in a meaningful and credible way," he said. Loss and damage are happening now -- at 1.1 degrees of warming. The floods in Pakistan have inundated a third of the country, he said. "We can only imagine the fate of small islands if we go beyond 1.5 degrees. Two degrees of warming is unthinkable and must be avoided at all costs." He called for a targeted, ambitious global response beyond adaptation measures, including how to finance loss and damage. "Polluters must pay. At the same time, we need to resolve access to finance. Grants and concessional financing currently fail to account for your islands' unique vulnerabilities," he said. The United Nations will push for more ambition and climate action by all, especially the Group of 20, which account for 80 percent of global emissions. He said that the UN would continue to call for a renewables revolution and for developed countries to provide developing countries with the finance and technology they need to transition to a net-zero and climate-resilient future. "We will continue to push developed countries to make good on their 100-billion-U.S. dollar climate finance commitment. We will push for developed countries to provide clarity this year on their Glasgow commitment to double adaptation finance. And we will push to ensure your eligibility and access to that finance," said Guterres. Enditem \</doc>

AT the ongoing U.N. climate conference, China\' s latest strategy on tackling global climate change was frequently mentioned and praised by participants.  The National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2035 launched by China is unprecedented. There is no other country in the world that has an eye on today while at the same time thinking about the opportunities of tomorrow, said Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation. Verkooijen made the remarks Thursday at a side event themed  China\' s Strategies and Actions on Climate Adaptation held at the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. The developing countries are so struggling in responding to the climate crisis that it is hard for them to focus equally on adaptation and mitigation, said Selwin Hart, special adviser to the secretary-general and assistant secretary-general of the U.N. climate action team. The Chinese strategy  does not only focus on China, but it is also about sharing experiences and broadening cooperation and collaboration with other developing countries, Hart noted.  Multilateralism, international cooperation and solidarity are needed to take climate actions, said Ahmed Saeed, vice president of the Asian Development Bank. He commended the Chinese climate strategy as  a positive step toward uplifting the level of international cooperation. (Xinhua) \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and his visiting U.S. counterpart Joe Biden discussed on Friday a number of regional and international issues, the Egyptian Presidency said in a statement. Meeting on the sidelines of the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt's Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, the two leaders discussed the Russia-Ukraine crisis as well as developments in Libya, Yemen and Syria, said the statement. Sisi stressed reaching political settlements for these crises and ending the presence of foreign mercenaries and militias in the region. Concerning the issue of Ethiopia's disputed Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Sisi reaffirmed Egypt's adherence to preserving its water security by reaching a legally binding agreement on filling and operating the dam. He said that the agreement must guarantee Egypt's water security, in accordance with the principles of international law to achieve the common interests of all parties. They also discussed the Palestinian issue, the statement added. For his part, Biden praised Egypt's efforts in combating terrorism, while expressing the support of his administration for such efforts. The two leaders also pledged to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries in various fields of cooperation. Enditem \</doc>

LUSAKA, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- Africa and other developing countries should focus their attention on tackling climate change by partnering with China in developing renewable energy sources, a Zambian expert has said. Frederick Mutesa, a development expert and a former lecturer in the Department of Development Studies at the University of Zambia, said on Monday China has demonstrated its commitment to promoting sustainable development policies that mitigate the challenges of climate change. "We can cooperate with them in terms of developing renewable energy sources, particularly solar and other types of renewable energy through development cooperation," he said in an interview with Xinhua on the occasion of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ). Mutesa, who is the Secretary-General of the Zambia-China Friendship Association, also said that countries contributing more to global pollution should contribute more by helping countries that have no adequate finances to tackle the negative effects of climate change through financial assistance and technology. According to him, the measures that were being proposed for transitioning from fossil-based energy to clean energy come with a cost in terms of financial resources and technology, a situation developing countries can not afford. He said developing countries are the most affected by the negative effects of climate change despite being the smallest contributors to pollution, and have the least resources to adapt to and mitigate the challenges of climate change. \</doc>

As the chair of the COP 27 Group of 77 and China (i.e. developing countries), it was my responsibility to bring together the countries of the world to finally make realistic and significant steps to address the current and future implications of climate change and global warming on the planet, with particular reference to the developing world. For me this was not just a professional responsibility but a deeply personal one as foreign minister of Pakistan, the country that was ravaged by the climate change catastrophe of severe floods in 2022. The decision at Sharm el-Sheikh to establish a fund to assist developing countries address loss and damage from the adverse impacts of climate change was a momentous first step, a signal of hope for humanity and the planet. As the chair, I proposed the discussion on a loss and damage financing facility last June in the preparations for COP 27 . We faced familiar resistance to placing the issue on the Conference agenda. Ultimately, and not easily, we succeeded. The epic floods in Pakistan this year, vividly and brutally confirmed the growing magnitude of climate disasters  with tens of thousands killed or injured; millions displaced; 13,000 km of roads, 2 million homes, 500 bridges and 5 million acres of crops destroyed, and one-third of the country literally under water. My home province of Sindh was the most devastated. It was only after seeing first-hand the scale of loss of catastrophic proportions, the indescribable suffering of innocent people, incalculable damage, and realizing there was no international financial mechanism to address disasters of this scale, that I fully understood the magnitude of the loss, understood the full extent of the damage done, and the absolute necessity to take bold steps to save people and the natural environment. This monumental disaster  and simultaneous floods in Nigeria, drought in the Horn of Africa, and hurricanes in the Pacific and the Caribbean  reinforced the determination of developing countries to secure climate justice. Pakistan's tenacious efforts, actively supported by the most vulnerable and other developing countries, yielded the agreement at the opening of COP 27 to place this item on the agenda. As the chair, I realized the importance of Pakistan leading the developing countries in the subsequent negotiations at the Conference to press for the establishment of the fund. We commend the Group's solidarity in pursuing the creation of the loss and damage funding arrangements and of the fund itself. We appreciate the ultimate acceptance of the proposal by the developed countries, including the European Union and the US. The developing countries look forward to urgent work in the Transitional Committee of 24 members to finalize the fund's institutional arrangements, structure, governance, and terms of reference, as well as to define the elements of the new funding arrangements, to identify and expand the sources of funding and establishing means to ensure coordination and complementarity with existing arrangements. Among the most important tasks for the Transition Committee is to identify the scale of funding required to meet the current consequences of climate change. This may sound technical to the lay reader but it literally means life and death for our children and grandchildren and generations yet unborn. While the agreement does not establish the legal responsibility of those who have contributed the most to climate change and global warming, it does confirm the central principle of climate justice  that those who are suffering the most from the impacts of climate change,  although they have contributed the least to global warming,  deserve financial support from those who have contributed the most to climate change, and who have done the most damage to the environment. A first test of climate justice will be the response to Pakistan's plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction from the floods disaster and efforts to build resilience against future disasters. This plan will be submitted to a Pledging Conference to be convened jointly by Pakistan and the UN secretary-general in January 2023. The World Bank has estimated that Pakistan suffered damage amounting to over $30 billion and will require at least $16.5 billion in urgent external support. The loss and damage fund has yet to be operationalized. Pakistan expects that financing for its rehabilitation and reconstruction plan will come from the industrial countries and international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and multilateral development banks. Such support could include debt write-offs, swaps and restructuring; new Sustainable Development Reserves (SDR) allocations or rechanneling of the unused SDRs of the developed countries; direct support for reconstruction projects, as well as private investment for projects that can be structured, e.g. with blended finance, to be commercially viable. We also expect expressions of solidarity from Pakistan's friends in the Islamic world and the Global South. Although climate impacts have become inevitable due to the 1.1-degree Celsius global warming that has occurred already over the past 150 years, it remains vital to limit the impacts of climate change as far as possible going forward. More should have been done before. But it is our responsibility not to whine, but to act. It is therefore concerning that the adaptation plans of so many developing countries are still not funded. The Glasgow decision to "at least double" climate finance for adaptation must be urgently fulfilled. At COP 27 , Pakistan proposed immediate implementation of this decision. We expect that at COP 28 in the United Arab Emirates next year we will be able to establish a mechanism to measure and monitor financial flows for climate adaptation. Most importantly, the commitment made since 2009 to mobilize $100 billion annually in climate finance has not been fulfilled. The developed countries need to urgently meet this commitment and agree to a New Collective Quantified Goal for larger climate finance from the floor of $100 billion by the next conference of parties in November 2023. Of course, the ultimate and common goal is to halt global warming and avoid the "tipping points" that climate scientists predict would lead to a global climate catastrophe. However, the onus to ensure that global temperature rise is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius is mainly on the industrial countries which have consumed two-thirds of the "carbon budget" over the past 150 years. The remaining one-third of this "budget" is what developing countries will need to grow out of poverty and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Therefore, the mitigation commitments of the Global North must be enhanced and accelerated. Unfortunately, it was evident at COP 27 that the industrial countries had not implemented the mitigation commitments assumed in Glasgow and were reluctant to agree to a larger and faster pathway to reduce emissions and keep the 1.5-degree Celsius target "alive". Climate action is but one component of the cooperative efforts required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals  to end hunger and poverty; promote health and education, restore global growth, and ensure lives of dignity and well-being for all nations and peoples. As it concludes its tenure as chair of the Group of 77 and China at the end of this year, Pakistan will make a final push to advance the SDGs and climate goals at a Ministerial Conference of the developing countries in New York in mid-December. The outcomes of this meeting will, we hope, set the agenda that the Global South can promote at the SDG Summit and COP 28 next year. It may be too late for the victims of Pakistan floods, but it is my fervent hope that the loss and damage facility will be in place to assist other countries devastated. For what happened to Pakistan will not be exclusive to Pakistan. In 2022 it was Pakistan, next year it could be anyone. Or everyone. The future of the world depends on our common efforts that need to move forward now. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202211/30/63869429a3107776aed531c6.png Link to Image JIN DING/CHINA DAILY \~ \~ The author is foreign minister of Pakistan. \</doc>

KIGALI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda is ready to prioritize renewable energy for its own future, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said Tuesday while delivering his country's National Statement at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC ( COP27 ) being held in Egypt. "The findings of the sixth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that a more sustainable future remains within reach. Yet, despite growing evidence that the damage of global warming will soon become irreversible, there seems to be little sense of urgency," Kagame said. "Rwanda, like the rest of Africa, is ready to prioritize renewable energy. We do this, for our own future," he said. Kagame noted that the most valuable contribution that developed countries can make is to reduce their emissions faster while investing with Africa to build sustainable power. "Questioning whether Africa is ready to make use of climate finance should not be used as an excuse to justify inaction. We have seen effects of this thinking during the pandemic." He meanwhile called for public-private partnership in green growth, saying vulnerable nations cannot rely on external financing alone. Rwanda on Monday launched a new green investment facility that will invest in the private sector-led green growth in the east African country by availing sustainable finance. Dubbed Ireme Invest, the investment facility was launched in Egypt with 104 million U.S. dollars in initial capitalization. Enditem \</doc>

SANTIAGO, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- Chile has signed agreements with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to promote green hydrogen production in the country, the Chilean Economic Development Agency (Corfo) said Friday. Corfo said in a press release that the agreements were reached within the framework of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), being held in Egypt. The deals "will provide support to develop a green hydrogen strategy," Finance Minister Mario Marcel said in the release. "These international organizations are going to provide knowledge, resources and also their experience ... so that in the future, private sector participation in the industry can also count on the support of these international organizations," Marcel said. The agreement with the World Bank aims to promote Chile's green hydrogen initiatives as part of the country's "Green Hydrogen Facilitation Project to Support Green, Resilient and Inclusive Economic Development." Chile will initially receive a 150-million-U.S.-dollar loan in 2023, and 200 million U.S. dollars at a later stage, to develop its green hydrogen industry. Meanwhile, the agreement with the IDB provides for a results-based investment loan of up to 400 million U.S. dollars to back the industry's development. Green hydrogen uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, with the hydrogen then used as fuel or fertilizer. Enditem \</doc>

By MINLU ZHANG at the United Nations | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-26 07:37 Pakistan's chief climate negotiator and permanent representative to the United Nations said China has made remarkable progress toward renewable and sustainable energy and has set an example for developing countries in fighting climate change. "China has set the example of demonstrating that it is possible to move toward renewable energy at a very rapid pace," Munir Akram, who is also chairman of the Group of 77 and China, told China Daily in an exclusive interview. The G77, which got its name from its 77 founding members, is now a group of 134 developing countries at the United Nations. "And that is what is needed for developing countries. If they are not going to repeat the same mistakes of polluting their own atmosphere, they have to move to a more sustainable energy requirement for infrastructure," Akram said. China has made significant strides in renewable energy production to improve its energy structure. In 2021, China invested $380 billion in clean energy, more than any other country, accounting for nearly half of new renewable energy investment worldwide. China has been at the forefront of the innovation and installation of renewable energy, whether it is hydropower, solar power, wind power or nuclear power. All of these are now greatly contributing to China's own energy metrics, Akram said. From 2012 to 2021, China enjoyed average economic growth of 6.6 percent with an annual increase of 3 percent in energy consumption. Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP fell by 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, equivalent to saving 1.4 billion tons of standard coal. "Developing countries work in close cooperation with China to acquire some of these renewable energy capabilities through cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral basis," Akram said. They would obviously "benefit greatly from cooperating with China and learning from China and the provision of Chinese support to the creation of these new capabilities in the developing world", he added. South-South cooperation between China and other developing countries will "continue and will contribute to the transition that is required in energy from a fossil fuel economy to a renewable and green economy. But the responsibility of industrialized countries, which have contributed the most to global warming and climate change - those responsibilities remain. We will continue to insist on the contribution from the industrialized North to finance technology and capacity building in developing countries", Akram said. A long-awaited "loss and damage" fund was approved on Nov 19 at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. For more than three decades, developing countries, especially small island countries and low-lying nations seen as most vulnerable to climate change, have sought money to pay for loss and damage caused by global warming. But rich countries have historically resisted such calls, fearing they could be held liable for billions of dollars in damages from their emissions. Akram said developing countries haven't contributed to global warming. Industrialized nation policies over the last 150 years have fueled global climate change, leaving developing countries, who are not responsible for the damage, suffering from the impact. "They should be assisted to recover from such disasters," he said. Pakistan was hit by devastating floods this summer that scientists say were made worse by global warming, killing more than 1,500 people and leaving one-third of the country underwater and causing $30 billion in damages. Pakistan contributes less than 1 percent of the world's planet-warming emissions. At the 2009 COP15 meeting in Copenhagen, wealthy countries promised that by 2020 they would transfer $100 billion per year in climate finance to help poorer countries. They are still falling short by tens of billions of dollars annually. "There are a lot of promises which have been made in Paris, in Glasgow, which have not yet been fulfilled," said Akram. But climate change is a global issue, and developing countries need help to address the impact of climate change and to adapt to the damage, or the whole agreement on global climate action will fall apart, he said. It is hoped that industrialized countries will now see that it is essential to keep their promises, Akram said. The "loss and damage" fund approved at COP27 is "a manifestation of the principle of climate justice for developing countries", he added. \</doc>

chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-11-17 15:24 As the first zero-carbon battery factory in the world, the Yibin factory of China's battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) was recently selected into the 2022 Business Climate Action Cases collection, The Paper reported. The collection was released during the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP27 . With a total investment of more than 56 billion yuan ($7.85 billion), the Yibin battery base project was launched in November 2019 and has 10 phases in total. After completion, its annual capacity could top 200 GWh, becoming one of the biggest power batter bases in the world. The Yibin plant achieved carbon neutrality in 2021, and received the PAS 2060 certification on carbon neutrality from the world's leading testing, inspection and certification company SGS in March this year. Last month, it was added to the Global Lighthouse Network by the World Economic Forum. The plant begun to craft the zero-carbon roadmap at the early stage of its establishment, said Zhu Yunfeng, general manager of Sichuan Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CATL. The Business Climate Action Cases has been released three years in a row in the COP to showcase Chinese enterprises' pioneer action and leader power in coping with climate change. This year, it includes 27 cases in total. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will continue building on its close relationship with China, joining hands with China to bring wide-ranging benefits for global climate action, the UAE climate envoy said at the ongoing UN climate conference. UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate Change Sultan Al Jaber told Xinhua in an interview at the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change being held in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh. He said that as a responsible supplier of oil and gas, and an aggressive "first mover" on renewable energy, the UAE believes that advancing climate action helps to diversify economies and create new industries, and energy transition is one of the examples. The UAE has emerged as a "trusted" partner with China in energy supply, and the two countries are also working closely on developing renewable energy, the minister noted. "Regardless of whether it's developing biotechnologies, renewable energy solutions, or other sectors enabled by advanced technologies when our countries collaborate to innovate, costs come down, economic opportunities go up, and society benefits," Al Jaber told Xinhua. He took solar stations as a sample of China-UAE collaborative innovation. In 2017, China and the UAE came together to build the world's largest single-site solar power plant, Noor Abu Dhabi. With 3.2 million solar panels installed across 8 square kilometers, Noor Abu Dhabi came online in 2019 with an installed capacity to produce 1.2 gigawatts of clean electricity. Based on this achievement, the two countries will soon set a new benchmark in the renewable energy sector with the Al Dhafra Solar Project, which will be almost twice the size of Noor Abu Dhabi, according to Al Jaber. "A successful energy transition must make progress with economic and climate action in tandem," the minister stressed, adding "I see many more opportunities for collaboration with China as we continue to build and adapt to clean-energy solutions." As to the loss and damage issue, which is of the most concern to developing countries, Al Jaber pointed out that considerable gaps are remaining in the climate finance architecture to address loss and damage. While countries have overwhelmingly agreed on this issue, the exact financing arrangements are still under discussion. The term "loss and damage" in UN climate negotiations refers to expenses already incurred as a result of climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels or extreme heat waves. While current climate funding focuses on cutting carbon emissions to prevent climate change in the future, establishing a "loss and damage" fund means compensating countries that can't avoid or adapt to the changes that have already happened. "At the same time, climate science tells us that there are hard limits to adaptation, and even if all emissions stopped today, there would still be future loss and damage," he said. As a result, the world must look for a collective response that is not only limited to financing but builds a range of solutions for addressing loss and damage. The UAE's climate envoy also expressed his hope for COP28 in 2023, which will be held in his country. He stressed that although COP27 and COP28 are both taking place in the Mideast region which is particularly attuned to the effects of climate change, the UAE strongly believes that climate solutions can, and should, come from everywhere. "As we prepare to host COP28, the Emirates Climate Conference next year, it is important to understand the priorities of all the nations, and that is one of our key tasks into the next year," he added. COP28 will mark the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake, a progress report of how countries have performed based on their pledges made in the COP21 Paris Agreement in 2015. "This will be an important outcome for COP28 and a critical milestone as we move towards making COP28 an inclusive and solutions-oriented climate summit," the minister said. The conference in 2023 will focus on the empowerment of youth and women, accelerating climate finance, enhancing global access to advanced climate technologies and deploying them at scale, and supporting indigenous and vulnerable communities, according to Al Jaber. "We believe that by working together for climate action, the world can unlock vast economic growth opportunities," said the climate envoy. Enditem \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 11 (Xinhua) -- Lauding the collaboration between the United Nations and the African Union (AU) as the best ever, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday warned major challenges lie ahead. Guterres told a Security Council meeting on cooperation between the UN and the AU that in the 20 years since its creation, the African Union has shown its determination to work towards integration, peace and prosperity on the continent. He said that collaboration between the United Nations and the African Union has never been stronger, but major challenges remain, including conflicts and unconstitutional government changes. The secretary-general said that for many Africans, climate change is not a distant threat but a daily reality even though Africa barely contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions. "As we prepare for COP27 in Egypt next month, I urge leaders, especially from G20 countries, which are responsible for 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, to finally take the urgent action needed," he said. "Developed countries must also make good on their commitments, starting with their pledge to provide 100 billion U.S. dollars a year for developing countries, and double funding for adaptation." The UN chief said the climate conference must also deliver concrete action on loss and damage. "This is not just a matter of trust between developed and developing countries. For many countries, and particularly in Africa, it is a question of survival." Enditem \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation to the ongoing UN climate conference announced on Friday that China has formally submitted a report on the progress in implementing its targets of tackling climate change. The delegation, which is attending the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UFCCC) held in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, said the report was submitted to the convention's secretariat by the Chinese liaison of the UFCCC. Named "Progress on the Implementation of China's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)," the report introduces the progress made by China in implementing its NDC targets since China updated its plan in 2020, which includes reaching carbon peak before 2030 and achieving carbon neutralization before 2060. "The NDC targets present not only China's current and future efforts to address climate change, but also as part of its responsibility to build a global community with a shared future. It is an important way of promoting ecological civilization and realizing high-quality development," the report said. The report summarizes China's new arrangements and measures to achieve NDC, such as controlling greenhouse gas emissions in key areas, accelerating shift toward green and low-carbon energies, consolidating and enhancing ecosystem carbon sink, launching national carbon trading market, and strengthening the ability to adapt to climate change. The report also introduces the progress made by China's Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions in dealing with climate change. "China has always placed a high priority on implementing the NDC targets as a crucial step to promote the comprehensive green and low-carbon transformation in economic and social development," it noted.

THE Chinese Government attaches great importance to addressing climate change and has accelerated the implementation of its  dual carbon goal in an all-round way, a Chinese delegate said Sunday. China implements a national strategy to actively address climate change, and unswervingly follows the path of ecological priority, green and low-carbon development, said Zhao Yingmin, head of the Chinese delegation to the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which opened in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Sunday. Zhao, also vice minister of China\' s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, made the remarks at a side event on the theme of  Pollution Reduction and Carbon Reduction Synergy: Achieving Win-Win for Environment, Climate and Economic Benefits hosted by the ministry. China has accelerated the implementation of its  dual carbon goal, which is to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, in an all-round way, including establishing a national agency to coordinate the top-level design of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality and issuing the guidelines on how to achieve the goal, Zhao said. China regards the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction as a starting point for promoting a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development, he said.  The road of quality development is to reduce carbon while reducing pollution, and reduce pollution while reducing carbon, so as to realize the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction, and achieve a win-win situation for environmental, climate, economic and social benefits, he said. China will speed up building a Chinese-style modernization  in which human and nature coexist in harmony, promote green production methods and lifestyles, and actively participate in global climate governance, said the vice minister.

GENEVA, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- Around 3.6 billion people currently face inadequate access to water at least a month per year, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in its State of Global Water Resources 2021 report published on Tuesday. The figure is projected to increase to more than 5 billion by 2050. The report assesses the effects of climate, environmental and societal change on the Earth's water resources. Its aim is to support the monitoring and management of global freshwater resources in an era of growing demand and limited supplies. It shows that due to the influence of climate change and a La Nina event (period cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific), the year 2021 witnessed large areas of the globe recording drier than normal conditions. Compared with the 30-year hydrological average, the area with below-average streamflow last year was approximately two times larger than the above-average area. Between 2001 and 2018, the interagency mechanism United Nations Water reported that 74 percent of all natural disasters were water-related. The recent 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) has urged governments to further integrate water into adaptation efforts. It was the first time that water has been referenced in a COP outcome document in recognition of its critical importance. According to WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, though the impacts of climate change are often felt through water -- such as more intense and frequent droughts, more extreme flooding, more erratic seasonal rainfall and accelerated melting of glaciers -- there is still insufficient understanding of changes in the distribution, quantity and quality of freshwater resources. The WMO report aims to fill this knowledge gap, which would be helpful in providing universal access in the next five years to early warnings of hazards, such as floods and droughts, he said.

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) -- South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Naledi Pandor, said Wednesday that the world should prioritize attending to the needs of the marginalized and forgotten. "We meet at a time when the UN family is facing its greatest tests. Member states have to work with the United Nations to develop effective responses to the current challenges," she said at the General Debate of the UN General Assembly. "Our greatest global challenges are poverty, inequality, joblessness and the feeling of being entirely ignored and excluded," said Pandor. Some have referred to this moment as a critical turning point in history. The COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict strongly influenced these attitudes. For South Africa, the real inflection point will be a world attending fully to the needs of the marginalized and forgotten, she said. Acting on Our Common Agenda proposed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres should become the primary objective because addressing poverty and underdevelopment will be the beginning of the real inflection point in human history, she said. The UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its human rights protocols all commit to protecting all people without distinction, she said, addressing that "we must acknowledge that we face these crises today because we have not always upheld these foundational principles consistently and fairly." "We believe international law matters when this one is affected but doesn't matter when this other one is affected. That does not help to uphold international law," said Pandor. As in the fight against COVID-19, global solidarity is also required to meet other pressing challenges such as energy and food insecurity, climate change and the devastation caused by conflicts, including the existential threat of nuclear weapons, she said. "Up to now, instead of working collectively to address these challenges, we have grown further apart as geopolitical tensions and mistrust permeate our relations. We should, however, move forward in solidarity, united in efforts to address our common global challenges to ensure sustainable peace and development." Pandor stressed the importance of ensuring developing countries are not left behind when COVID-19 treatments are available by creating and supporting research and innovation capacity in Africa for vaccine production, investing in public health systems and producing thousands more professional health workers. She said that the mobilization of resources and capabilities to strengthen pandemic response and preparedness of all nations must be substantially increased. "It will be a tragic indictment on all of us as leaders if future pandemics found the poorest as unprepared as many were for COVID-19." She also stressed the need to help developing countries tackle energy, education and climate action challenges. While Africa is the least responsible for the climate crisis, it does find itself at the epicenter of its worst impacts. The upcoming UN Conference on Climate Change in Egypt must develop an agreement with enhanced and balanced adaptation, mitigation and financing actions. In addition, she said there must be agreement on a mechanism for loss and damage. The multilateral trading system must be strengthened to create a conducive environment for fair trade and opportunities for developing economies; otherwise, developing countries will remain subject to an imbalanced global financial and trading system, she warned. Building a better world requires peace and stability. South Africa continues to believe that conflict resolution must not come through fuelling conflicts but through investing in political dialogue, said Pandor. "To overcome all these acutely global challenges, we must agree to a common path out of an increasingly polarized world. A rules-based international system, predicated on international law and strict adherence to the provisions of the UN Charter, is essential. Such a system should safeguard the interests of all and not only the powerful countries," she said. "Let us use this moment of renewal to reiterate our commitment to multilateralism as the only means of building a better world," Pandor said. "The United Nations itself must be transformed so that it serves its role cognisant of current global dynamics." Enditem \</doc>

Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\~Photo: VCG The Chinese and US climate envoys have maintained informal communication, and China's position on the China-US climate change talks has not changed, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Thursday, noting that China has been unswervingly and actively responding to climate change and hopes that developed countries will fulfill their funding commitments as soon as possible. The US and China have started unofficial conversations on climate-related issues during the COP27 summit in Egypt, and China's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua met his US counterpart John Kerry for talks, Bloomberg News reported. Zhao stated that China's contribution to energy conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy, transportation and construction accounted for 30 to 50 percent of the global total in the past decade. The report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) stressed that China will continue to promote carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, and actively participate in global governance on climate change, demonstrating China's firm determination to promote green development and harmonious coexistence between man and nature, Zhao added. Xie has said the US must take responsibility for the breakdown in talks between the two countries, calling on the US to "clear the barriers" for talks. He also called on wealthy nations to offer more support for developing countries that have the most to lose from climate change, including compensating poorer nations for damage linked to global warming, according to media reports. Zhao also remarked that China hopes developed countries will fulfill their commitment to provide $100 billion in climate finance for less wealthy nations, and put forward a roadmap for doubling the adaptation fund to enhance mutual trust and synergy between developed and developing countries.

The United Nations' COP 27 climate change conference, which started in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh on Sunday, provides perhaps the last chance for leaders from around the world to get their act together and find ways to curb global warming. Yet there have been worries about whether they will actually be able to turn the pledges they made at COP 26 in Glasgow, Scotland, last year into actions, given the differences that still exist among them on some key points as well as the multiple challenges the world faces today - ranging from high inflation, food shortages to the energy crisis. A United Nations report at the end of October said government pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions put the planet on track for a 2.8 C temperature rise this century - after the "woefully inadequate" progress to curb warming. This falls far short of the pledge countries have made to limit global temperatures to 2 C above pre-industrial levels. Also, despite the wide-ranging climate pact reached in Glasgow last year, additional government commitments since COP 26 will remove only less than 1 percent of estimated global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, according to the UN Environment Programme, making it almost impossible to avert the looming climate cataclysm. "As COP 27 All this requires all countries to shoulder their due responsibilities and summon their collective will to deliver on promises because we could well be drinking in the last chance saloon. Yet so far the developed countries have failed to provide the $100 billion each year to help developing countries address climate change - as they promised in 2009. This has damaged the mutual trust between the global North and South and made the reaching of any new agreements in this regard even more difficult. The United States, as the world's largest carbon emitter in history, has dragged its feet on fulfilling its climate obligations. Although the US administration has made tackling the climate crisis a top priority after President Joe Biden reversed the course of his predecessor Donald Trump by rejoining the Paris Agreement, the US Congress has approved a mere $1 billion in international climate finance for 2022 - falling far short of the pledge the US made to provide $11.4 billion by 2024. This failure by Washington to scale up financing for the world's poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries has been viewed as a "betrayal". The actions needed to curb the global rise in temperature call for a fundamental change in perspective and some tough decisions being made. But the past eight years have run down the clock, and there can be no more delay in biting the bullet. Editorial, China Daily \</doc>

"What we've seen with the government of China is really absolutely exciting because there's a move and amplification of legislation. They have made sure that over 50 percent of the wetlands in China are under protection in one form or another, be it a national park or a community park," Mumba told Xinhua in a video interview. The meeting will be held from Nov. 5 to 13, with its main venue in central China's Wuhan city, the official hosts of COP14, and a parallel session in Geneva, Switzerland, in both physical and online formats. Wetlands are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems as they provide essential services and supply all our fresh water. According to the Convention, an estimated 85 percent have been lost measured against the year 1700. "Lake Chad, for example, is a lake that is shared between Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad the country itself. This lake has shrunk to less than 10 percent and is a Ramsar site. It is also a pathway for birdlife species. Indigenous peoples... have depended on this wetland ecosystems for medicine, for food, for fish, but also really the microclimate of this region," Mumba said. "Our cities are the spaces where more than 50 percent of the world's population by 2050 will be living. This means that we'll be living within either concrete jungles or we will have specific infrastructures that also increase the heating of cities," Mumba said. "What wetlands do as part of the ecosystem services, and these services are valued at over 47 trillion (U.S.) dollars, is the cooling effect. We can see that having wetlands within cities provides a mechanism of cooling, but also at the same time, an increase of biodiversity and green spaces." "This is why this COP matters and this is why I think China is really pushing towards this action and calling on all the contracting parties of the convention to act." The Convention entered into force in China on July 31, 1992. China currently has 64 sites designated as "Wetlands of International Importance" (Ramsar Sites). With 13 cities, China now has the largest number of wetland cities in the world, and the country has adopted several measures to protect wetlands, including promoting wetland legislation, implementing wetland protection and restoration schemes, designating internationally significant wetlands and carrying out wetland surveys. "I'm beginning to really believe that it's important when other contracting parties see this leadership why we should invest in these ecosystems and why it's important to make sure that these ecosystems are protected, because the protection also goes for climate change and for biodiversity," Mumba said. The Convention on Wetlands was adopted on Feb. 2, 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar on the shores of the Caspian Sea. Having 172 contracting parties so far, the intergovernmental treaty provides a framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. Mumba stressed that strengthening international cooperation was crucial to tackle these vital issues for our planet. "We're meeting for the first time after the start of the pandemic. We did not meet since 2018. So here we are now meeting together to really look at the state of wetlands and the plight of wetlands, and why wetlands matter and why they're central to our livelihoods collectively as humans on this planet," she said. The COP14 will be held as the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) is to take place on Nov. 6-18 in Sharm El-Sheikh, an Egyptian Red Sea resort city. The 14th COP meeting is "back-to-back with the climate COP27 and then eventually with the biodiversity COP. What does that mean? That also means that the wetland conversation is happening within the conversations related to climate and biodiversity, really showing the world that all of this is interconnected," said Mumba. "We're inching closer to the last five years before the end of the agenda of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). All of this comes very cleanly within legislation and regulatory frameworks," Mumba said. "SDG 17 is the goal on collaboration and partnerships. We cannot do this alone as the Convention on Wetlands, we need to do this collaboratively with everyone, youth, indigenous peoples, women, politicians, scientists, everyone is a part of this journey to make these spaces much better for both, us and nature alike." \</doc>

Saudi Arabia is demonstrating its green commitments with the announcement of a number of climate-related initiatives, including an emissions reduction center and the staging next year of a regional summit focused on tackling the issue. The announcement was made by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud over the weekend during a panel discussion at the Saudi Green Initiative Forum, or SGI, titled "The need for climate action". The event was held on the sidelines of the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. In addition to establishing the emissions reduction center, the kingdom is also launching what officials are calling a circular carbon economy knowledge hub. The regional summit will take place during the 2023 Middle East and North Africa Climate Week. "We are going to be launching a circular carbon economy knowledge hub with the hope that our friends and peers can join us in sharing experiences and make sure that we understand technologies, and we'll share lessons learned. I think it's very fundamental. We will kick-start it by 1st of January, 2023," the Saudi minister told the panel. The knowledge hub will facilitate regional collaboration in technologies and enable the sharing of information and best practices to support the region-wide implementation of nationally determined contributions. In this way, it will help countries achieve targets set under the Middle East Green Initiative, or MGI. Saudi Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud on Nov 7 announced the deployment of one of the largest carbon capture, usage and storage hubs in the world, as well as the allocation of $2.5 billion to support MGI projects, and the planting of 50 billion trees. "We've been talking with the UNFCCC Secretariat and we will be hosting in 2023 the MENA climate week so we will welcome all of our friends to join us then," said Prince Abdulaziz, referring to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Saudi minister was joined at the event by United Arab Emirates Minister of Climate Change and Environment Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Egyptian Foreign Minister and COP27 President Sameh Shoukry, and Alok Sharma, president of the COP26, held in the United Kingdom last year. At the panel event, Almheiri congratulated Saudi Arabia on its "remarkable" targets, and said the UAE has $8 billion in commitments from its partners to transform food systems. 'More can be done' "There is hope, there is light at the end of the tunnel and I think we are moving in the right direction But I really think we should take this as an opportunity, to catalyze our efforts to put these technologies into place because people will look back. This is like the inflection points that are happening now," the minister said. Sharma said that even if this year has been "incredibly challenging" geopolitically, many countries have continued to deliver. But he said that "we just need to go a lot further and a lot faster". "We've got 33 countries that have come forward with their revised 2030 emission reduction targets. If you add up all the commitments (that) came in, you're looking at" a reduction in emissions of 12 percent globally by 2030, said Sharma. "Now, that's not half. What we need is half of the emissions to be cut by 2030," he said, adding that what is important is implementing the action plans. Shoukry said the MGI and SGI forums are "a demonstration of commitment" by countries in the region "to be active participants in climate action". "If we can combine our resources, our abilities and our collective will to address these issues", progress can be made "in the areas of (climate) mitigation and adaptation", said Shoukry. The UNFCCC Secretariat is tasked with supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. The convention has near universal membership of 198 parties and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The aim of the Paris Agreement is to keep the global average temperature rise this century as close as possible to 1.5 C, according to its website. Prince Abdulaziz said Saudi Arabia has been working with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia on establishing a regional center to advance emissions reductions.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced a climate action plan here on Monday to provide global early warnings on climate change in the next five years. "It will cost the equivalent of just 50 cents per person per year for the next five years to reach everyone on Earth with early warnings against increasingly extreme and dangerous weather," Guterres said at a summit of world leaders during the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Executive Action Plan for the Early Warnings for All Initiative calls for initial new targeted investments between 2023 and 2027 of 3.1 billion U.S. dollars, said a UN report. "This is a small fraction (about 6 percent) of the requested 50 billion U.S. dollars in adaptation financing," Guterres said, adding that it would cover disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, preparedness and response, and communication of early warnings. The plan was drawn up by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and its partners and was supported by a joint statement signed by 50 countries. While the number of recorded disasters has increased, "half of the countries globally do not have early warning systems and even fewer have regulatory frameworks to link early warnings to emergency plans," Guterres said. The numbers are even worse for developing countries on the front lines of climate change, specially for least developed countries and Small Island Developing States, he said. The WMO said on its website that early warning systems are widely regarded as the "low-hanging fruit" for climate change adaptation because they are a relatively cheap and effective way of protecting people and assets from hazards, including storms, floods, heatwaves and tsunamis to name a few.

World Environment Day falls on June 5, and this year marks the 50th anniversary of the convening of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. Despite growing global efforts to address ecological and environmental issues, global climate change, biodiversity loss, escalating desertification and frequent extreme climate events pose severe challenges to human survival and development. According to the Human Development Report released by the United Nations Development Programme, the COVID-19 pandemic and rising global temperature suggest that humans are putting unprecedented pressure on the Earth. The report said that the greatest issue facing human beings in the 21st century is to coexist with the nature. Therefore, human-nature relations are the key for ensuring the sustainable development of human beings in this century. China has set "building a clean and beautiful world" as the theme of the 2022 World Environment Day. In the next five decades, countries need to uphold and launch multilateralism and jointly build a community of life for mankind and nature. Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed to build a community of life for mankind and nature at the Leaders' Climate Summit on Earth Day on April 22, 2021. He pointed out solutions to the dilemma of global environmental governance and offered theoretical references for addressing human-nature relations. Human-nature conflicts will be mitigated and harmonious coexistence will prevail, which can maintain ecological balance and bring benefits to humans. The preservation and continuation of human civilization rely on the balance of materials and energy and between human activities and the natural environment. Since human-nature conflicts, especially climate crises, are posing challenges to the survival and development of civilization, efforts are needed to strike a balance between human society and the natural environment, of which the fundamental goal is to achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and nature. The new landscape of harmonious coexistence will generate new productivity, promote humans to drive economic growth through green innovation, boost the energy transformation and industrial upgrading, and transform social production and consumption mechanisms to promote the shift from the industrial civilization to an ecological civilization featuring sustainable development. China has incorporated the goal of building an ecological civilization into its Constitution and incorporated it in the overall plan of socialism with Chinese characteristics. China aims to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The 30-year period is much shorter than that of developed countries, which calls for great efforts. China will control coal-fired power projects, keep coal consumption from growing during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25) and reduce coal consumption during the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026-30). An action plan unveiled by the State Council, China's Cabinet, in October 2021 proposed to involve the carbon peaking and neutrality goals into China's socioeconomic development, peak carbon emissions steadily, promote green transformation of production and lifestyles, as well as the efficient utilization of resources and low carbon economic and social growth to ensure the goals are achieved as scheduled. Over the past five years since the Paris Agreement was signed, many involved countries have failed to launch sufficient measures, and some big emitters have even pulled out. Adhering to the agreement is the only right policy path to address climate change. China has been steadily carrying out actions to fulfill the Paris Agreement. Before the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties was held last November in Glasgow, Scotland, China issued a white paper titled "Responding to Climate Change: China's Policies and Actions", which has improved its nationally determined contributions. To peak carbon emissions, the country plans to make the share of non-fossil energy consumption account for around 20 percent of its energy consumption by 2025, and reduce its energy consumption per unit of GDP by 13.5 percent from 2020. It also eyes cutting carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 18 percent compared with 2020.By 2030, China will increase the share of non-fossil energy consumption to about 25 percent, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level. In further increasing its NDCs, China is working hard to fulfill its commitments under the Paris Agreement. China is also driving the development of a new blueprint for global biodiversity governance. In October 2021, President Xi delivered a keynote speech on building a community of all life on Earth at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 15), proposing that humans need to respect, adapt to and protect the nature, and build a home where humans and nature coexist in harmony. At the COP 15, China announced that it would take the lead in investing 1.5 billion yuan ($225.2 million) in establishing the Kunming Biodiversity Fund to support biodiversity conservation in developing countries. Attaching great importance to biodiversity conservation, China has promoted the development of protected natural areas, and accelerated to establish a system of protected natural areas with national parks at the core. China is one of the first countries to propose and implement a redline system for ecological protection, and its initiative of "drawing a redline for ecological protection to mitigate and adapt to climate changes" has become one of the 15 cases of the UN "Nature-based Solutions", gaining great recognition from the international community. Ensuring harmonious coexistence between humans and the nature is the only way for mankind to address the climate crisis and ensure climate security in the 21st century. It is also the only solution to improving energy utilization, and promoting the green economy, ecological security and better global climate governance. Countries should uphold and launch multilateralism, ensure ecological preservation, and jointly build a clean and beautiful world.

chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-11-09 09:51 A coalition of low-income countries called on rich nations to pay for climate damages, since wealthier nations such as the US have been the biggest emitters of greenhouse gasses, said US National Public Radio on Monday. Developing countries have produced very little of the pollution driving climate change, but they are already bearing the brunt of the destructive impacts, like storms, floods and droughts, said the report. By coalition, the report refers to the Climate Vulnerable Forum group of 58 countries which issued an urgent demand last month for an international funding commitment to help vulnerable countries recover from extreme weather events. The NPR report took Vanuatu, a South Pacific nation made up of 82 small islands, as an example. The country was hit by a devastating cyclone in 2020 and lost $600 million in damage, representing more than 60% of the country's GDP. As a Climate Vulnerable Forum member, Vanuatu has laid out a starting point for its loss and damage needs, totaling $177 million. Vanuatu proposed to create a loss and damage fund, so residents could receive compensation quickly. Other funding would go to setting up systems to help with relocation efforts and support displaced people. So far, richer countries have delayed committing funds, though they've agreed to take up the issue at the COP27 climate negotiations now underway in Egypt. At this year's negotiations in Egypt, some support using existing humanitarian aid networks. Others have suggested that countries should have international loans forgiven, if it's linked to their climate vulnerability. Talks this year could take on new urgency, after the unprecedented damage in Pakistan from extreme floods. Millions of people were displaced, with damage totaling $30 billion dollars. At least 1500 people were killed. \</doc>

COPENHAGEN, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Water Association (IWA) on Tuesday convened a high-level summit that brought together prominent figures from the water industry with government and municipal politicians to discuss water's role in advancing climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). "Policymakers must put water at the heart of action plans, and everyone has a role to play. Business as usual is not an option if we are to achieve the SDGs and climate targets," Joakim Harlin, director of the Freshwater Ecosystems Unit of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), said in his opening address at the summit held during the ongoing World Water Congress & Exhibition. The summit, which featured ministerial contributions from India, South Africa and other countries, had the theme "water as a key to action on climate and the Sustainable Development Goals" and addressed the three major topics of "finance, governance, and partnerships." "The IWA Summit has provided an ideal opportunity to focus on water in advance of COP27 (the UN Climate Change Conference scheduled for Nov. 6-18) and of the March 2023 UN review of the Water Action Decade," Tom Mollenkopf, IWA president, was quoted in the press release as saying. The summit concluded with three major calls to action: the urgent need for resilient water solutions; the critical need for freshwater ecosystems to be "factored in as part of the solution;" and the pursuit of joint efforts and partnerships "to accelerate action and make a difference." The IWA World Water Congress & Exhibition, an international gathering of over 10,000 top water professionals and businesses, is hosted by the capital of Denmark between Sept. 11 and Sept. 15.

NAIROBI, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- Harnessing Africa's vast natural resources, including tropical forests, coastal mangroves and peatlands, offers a cheaper and sustainable pathway to a greener and resilient future for the continent, scientists said on Monday. Speaking at a forum in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, the scientists stressed that taming the climate crisis unfolding in Africa as possible is subject to leveraging natural capital alongside a deliberate shift to low-carbon development models. Godwin Kowero, the executive secretary of the Nairobi-based African Forest Forum (AFF), the forum's convener, said placing natural resources at the heart of climate adaptation in the continent was key to realizing a climate-neutral future. Kowero singled out Africa's vast forest resources for their role in carbon capture and storage, besides sustaining the food, water, energy and medicinal needs of local communities. Convened ahead of the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Summit slated for Egypt on Nov.6-18, the Nairobi forum, which has brought together senior policymakers, scientists, and grassroots conservationists, will discuss the role of forests and other vital ecosystems in hastening Africa's green transition. Joshua Kiplongei Cheboiwo, the director of the Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), said enhanced protection of habitats will boost the resilience of African communities in the face of climatic shocks. "We need to build the capacity of our communities to protect forests and freshwater sources in order to boost climate response and growth of the green economy," said Cheboiwo. He added that expanding forest cover and helping rural communities tap into renewable energy sources will enable African countries to achieve net-zero targets and avert climate emergencies, including droughts, cyclones, and heatwaves. Doris Mutta, the senior programs officer at the AFF, said mainstreaming nature-based adaptation into the continent's climate response strategies will spur green and inclusive growth. According to Mutta, the upcoming UN climate summit in Egypt presents an opportunity for African countries to raise visibility on the critical role of natural resources in helping the continent cope with climate-induced disasters.

Western countries that claim themselves to be the vanguard in tackling climate change are not only going back to coal in the face of an energy crisis, but are also trying to wriggle out of their promise of giving financial aid to African countries, as European leaders try to avoid African leaders planning to come to Europe to seek delivery of promised cash to help them cope with climate change. Climate experts slammed the Western countries' move as being not only morally irresponsible - as African countries are paying the price for rich countries' lion's share of emissions - and added that such selfishness will also hamper global cooperation on climate change, and possibly overshadow the upcoming COP27 . The UN's Africa Climate Week, which runs from Monday to Friday in Libreville, Gabon and has attracted more than 1,000 participants, is expected to tackle the climate emergency as it intensifies throughout the continent. After that, seven presidents from Senegal, Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia will travel to the Netherlands next month to attend the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA). "As some African heads of state travel to Rotterdam for the Africa Adaptation Summit, we hope their presence will be met with financial commitments to the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program by their European counterparts," US media quoted Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the GCA, as saying. "What really counts is for the developed world to deliver on the Glasgow Commitment [to] double adaptation finance." But to those African leaders' dismay, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, whose country is hosting the GCA, is the only European leader planning to attend in person. Leaders of other European countries, such as Finland, Norway, Denmark and France, all declined to attend citing schedule conflicts. The European countries and the US shoulder a great moral obligation to fulfill their financial commitment to developing countries, especially those in Africa, which bear the greatest brunt of the rapidly deteriorating climate problem, Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, told the Global Times on Monday. He said that Africa, faced with deadly drought, historic floods and extreme weather events, is actually paying the price for Western countries making up the lion's share of emissions ever since the Industrial Revolution. Africa accounts for the smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions at just 3.8 percent, according to a report from Brookings Institute, a US-based think tank, yet the 10 nations most vulnerable to climate change are in Africa, according to the Mo Ibrahim Foundation's 2022 Forum Report. Developed countries projected that they won't meet to mobilize US$100 billion a year to help poorer countries deal with climate change until 2023 - three years late and still woefully short of the real need, according to a report from the Conversation, a non-profit organization. A boy carries buckets of water in Kidemu sub-location in Kilifi County, Kenya, March 23, 2022. The Horn of Africa drought has thrust at least 18.4 million people, including more than 7.1 million acutely malnourished children, into severe food insecurity, UN humanitarians said on Monday. Most drought victims are in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. (Xinhua/Dong Jianghui) Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, also told the Global Times that European leaders' absence from the meeting reflected their embarrassment in helping developing countries tackle climate change, especially when their own hands are tied with domestic energy crises. "European countries can barely keep their own blustery promises on climate change, not to mention give money to Africa. Many of those countries are having a headache about how to get through this winter because of energy shortages. People are worrying about rising inflation giving money to African countries now will see European politicians grilled by their people's anger," said Lin. Several European countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands have already returned or are planning to return to coal to generate electricity, after feeling the pinch from the energy crisis resulting from the Russia-Ukraine crisis, on top of Europe seeing its worst drought in 500 years. Lin believed that Western countries' return to coal, in addition to rich countries' reluctance to take real actions to help poorer countries, will cast a large shadow on the upcoming 2022 COP27 UN climate summit held in Egypt, November this year. "Western countries' selfishness will deepen the fissure between countries' willingness on climate cooperation, which will make it harder for COP27 to reach a global consensus," said Lin. Climate underachiever Experts said that with Europe wrong-footed in pursuit of its carbon neutral goals and struggling to get a handle on the current energy crisis, the US, one of the world's biggest emitters, is now using this as an advantage to shore up its leadership in climate change. In the latest move, Senate Democrats delivered a victory for US President Joe Biden's plan on tackling climate change in early August, passing a bill that will devote hundreds of billions of dollars to clean energy sources and speed up the US transition away from fossil fuels. "Europe used to challenge the US on the climate change issue. Now, countries on this continent are going backwards, which makes the US look less bad," Li Zhiqing, a professor of environmental economics and Chinese economy at Fudan University, told the Global Times, noting that no matter what the US does with regard to climate change, the real purpose is to enhance its competitiveness. The expert explained that one of the bill's benefits is the creation of millions of jobs in the clean energy sector. "Such measures to stimulate the economy won't be rejected by any politician yet traditional energy is still the main pillar for fuelling US development, thus the country won't have the incentive to phase out that energy Moreover, the US government only pays attention to climate change when it suits it. When it doesn't, the US would rather trample on the welfare of the globe. That's why Washington's climate policies are always flip-flopping," said Li. Experts said one way for the US to demonstrate sincerity on climate change is to fulfill its pledge and give developing countries the financial support they need to deal with the issue. The US Congress has approved a mere $1 billion in international climate finance for 2022 - falling far short of Joe Biden's pledge to provide $11.4 billion a year by 2024. Tontie Binado, technical lead on climate justice for ActionAid in Ghana, told Climate Home that the $1 billion approved by Congress was "a betrayal" of Biden's promise to scale up financing for the world's poorest and most climate vulnerable. In contrast, China is steadily promoting green development under the Belt and Road Initiative. The National Development and Reform Commission issued guidance in March this year, vowing to steadily advance cooperation on green infrastructure, energy, transportation and finance by 2025. By 2030, environmental risk prevention and control systems for overseas projects should be improved, according to the guidance. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- President of the ongoing United Nations climate conference Sameh Shoukry on Friday urged climate negotiators to speed up their talks in order to reach a series of consensus by the end of the meeting. Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister who served as the president of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said he remained "concerned at the number of outstanding issues including finance mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and their interlinkages," according to a statement released after his meeting with climate negotiators. Because negotiators have not come to a final agreement, the COP27 , which is scheduled to close on Friday in the Egyptian coastal city of Sharm El-Sheikh, has been extended for another day. "Time is not on our side," said Shoukry, adding he hoped negotiators could reach a consensus over the compensation of loss and damage on Saturday. Enditem \</doc>

CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has rehabilitated 210 km of its northern coast and pushed forward projects mitigating or adapting to the effects of climate change, the country's minister of irrigation and water resources said Sunday. Egypt is still working on restoring 50 km shores across the country as part of its strategy to preserve coastal areas from climate ramifications and protect existing investments in industrial, agricultural, and tourist zones, official Ahram Online news reported, citing the minister Mohamed Abdel-Aty. Meanwhile, Abdel-Aty's ministry has launched a climate adaptation project on the North Coast and the Nile Delta to counter sea-level rises, the impact of weather hazards on low-lying coastal areas, and seawater intrusion. The project, set to be completed by 2023, is being implemented over an area of 69 km in five coastal governorates, namely Port Said, Damietta, Daqahliya, Kafr El-Sheikh and Beheira, said Abdel-Aty, adding it includes the establishment of an early weather warning center in the Mediterranean. Additionally, the ministry was proposing a multi-year management plan to preserve investments and natural resources of the North Coast, according to the report. Egypt, which will host the 27th session of the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) in November, is seeking to promote its national green transition. Enditem \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is implementing a plan to transform its museums and archaeological sites into green sites that rely on solar energy as a sustainable alternative, an Egyptian official told Xinhua at the ongoing UN climate change conference. Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA), said that "using green energy is more economically feasible than electricity and contributes to preserving, protecting and rehabilitating cultural heritage of all kinds." Waziri said that the SCA signed a framework memorandum of understanding to transform museums and Egyptian World Heritage sites into green sites using solar energy with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Egypt's Industrial Modernization Center (IMC), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO). The memorandum was signed on the sidelines of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. The memorandum aims to "introduce solar energy in an initiative towards sustainable green archaeological sites, and in line with the country's Egypt 2030 sustainable development strategy," Waziri added. The memorandum involves multiple areas of cooperation, such as installing small solar power stations in cultural heritage sites and museums, Waziri revealed. Waziri stressed the keenness of the Egyptian government to pay attention to all archaeological sites and protect them from climate change. "Climate change has many negative effects on the archeological sites and monuments, for example, the rise in the level of the Mediterranean water near the Qaitbay Citadel in Alexandria pushed us to build wave blocks to protect this archaeological structure from erosion," Waziri affirmed. He added that SCA is restoring flood drains and dams built by ancient Egyptians in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of Queens in Luxor, which functioned to divert torrential rain and flood away from the cemeteries in those valleys but were impacted by climate change and erosion factors. "We also strengthen the patterns and colors in many archaeological sites to protect them from climate change and high temperatures.

CANBERRA, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an opportunity for countries to boost their efforts to tackle the issue, an Australian scholar on climate change has said. "This conference is to lock everything in to make sure that countries stick to their targets, increase their efforts, increase their finance, and agree on what the global goal should be around adaptation and how to deal with impacts," Richie Merzian, a former Australian government representative to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said in an interview with Xinhua. While the interview took place, thousands of people were affected by floods in Australia as its eastern states were soaked by continuing heavy rain. "The conference will deal with the impacts of climate change, which are a future problem. People are experiencing it, floods, droughts, fires," said Merzian, also director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Australia Institute. Scheduled to Egypt for the conference slated for Nov. 6-18, he voiced confidence that it will be an important conference for Australia, which has changed government and its emission reduction target. Australia has previously set an emissions reduction target of 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, before the Labor government increased it earlier this year to 43 percent. Hailing the change "a good move," Merzian said the Australian public want more climate action. "It needs to go further, though," he said, adding that it should increase its financial support for developing countries to help them deal with climate impacts. Talking about energy transition, he said, "We are going to be changing our energy systems." "We can make more energy out of the sun and the wind and water," he said. "If you want an economic return and the climate return on investment, then go hard investing heavily in renewable and in solutions like building batteries." Looking into the future, he said Australia would like to host a UN climate conference. "Hopefully in probably four years time, in 2026, everyone will be coming to Australia for the conference."

JOHANNESBURG, July 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's mobilizer for financing said Thursday it is finalizing the first draft of a investment plan to guide the use of funds offered by Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), a mechanism that finances a transition from coal to renewables in the country. Under JETP, South Africa and its partners including France, Germany, Britain, the United States and the European Union have made "significant progress" in developing a comprehensive investment plan since their last engagement in June, and have discussed the first draft, which is being finalized by the Presidential Climate Finance Task Team, head of the task team Daniel Mminele told a media briefing virtually. After the South African government announced on Nov. 2 last year the partnership to support a transition to a low carbon economy and a climate resilient society in the country, partner countries offered to mobilize an initial 8.5 billion U.S. dollars over the next three to five years through a range of instruments, including grants and concessional finance, for the implementation of South Africa's revised climate change mitigation targets. The partnership is working with the JETP Secretariat and aims to complete the investment plan this October, before the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ), said Mminele. The task team will consult with key stakeholders, from both the public and private sectors, on the investment plan during the next two months, including through working groups in each of the priority areas, he added. The partners under JETP also discussed the need to leverage extra funding from other partners and philanthropies that are interested in supporting the green transition of South Africa, and it is likely to bring in additional members and commitments.

Scenery of Solomon Islands Photo: IC China will further strengthen cooperation with Pacific island countries (PICs) in tackling climate change, as China considers PICs to be one of top priorities in climate issues cooperation, the country's environmental protection authority noted on Thursday. "China has carried out South-South cooperation on climate change for a long time, and has done its best to help other developing countries improve their ability to cope with climate change," Li Gao, general director of the Department of Climate Change of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) of China, told the Global Times at Thursday's press conference of the MEE. "Pacific island countries are one of the priorities of China's cooperation in addressing climate change," he said. At present, China has signed five project documents on material assistance for climate change South-South cooperation with four PICs including Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, and Kiribati, according to Li. China has also held four phases of training to help build climate change response capacities under its cooperation with PICs. Nearly 100 professionals from PICs have been trained to deal with climate change so far. Li revealed that the following fifth round of training will be held in December. Meanwhile, China will further strengthen and expand its cooperation with PICs to help the island countries boost their capacities to confront climate change. "At the same time, in the multilateral field, China is also strengthening communication and coordination with PICs to jointly safeguard the common interests of developing countries, Li noted. In April, the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Center was launched, which is expected to enhance close exchanges and practical cooperation between the countries involved.\~ In September, the China-Pacific Island Countries meeting on tackling climate change was held in Beijing. China's special envoy for climate change, Xie Zhenhua, exchanged views with diplomatic envoys from PICs including Tonga, Fiji, Micronesia, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, and Vanuatu.\~ The envoys touched upon topics including policy action and the expected outcomes from the 27th Session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ), as well as South-South cooperation on climate change, Li introduced. \</doc>

The only way to "put an end to all this suffering" from "a highway to climate hell" is for the world to cooperate or perish, dozens of leaders were admonished as they gathered yesterday for international climate talks. More than 100 world leaders will speak over the next few days to try deal with a worsening problem that scientists' call Earth's biggest challenge. Nearly 50 heads of states or governments started to take the stage yesterday in the first day of "high-level" talks at this year's annual U.N. climate conference, known as COP27 , with more to come in the following days. Much of the focus will be on national leaders telling their stories of being devastated by climate disasters, culminating tomorrow with a speech by Pakistan Prime Minister Muhammad Sharif, whose country's summer floods caused at least $40 billion in damage and displaced millions of people. "The planet has become a world of suffering ... is it not high time to put an end to all this suffering," Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, the summit host, told his fellow leaders. "Climate change will never stop without our intervention... Our time here is limited and we must use every second that we have.'' El-Sisi, who called for an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, was gentle compared to a fiery United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who said the world "is on a highway to climate hell." He called for a new pact between rich and poor countries to work closer together, with financial help and phasing out of coal in rich nations by 2030 and elsewhere by 2040. He called on the United States and China - the two biggest producers of climate-changing emissions - to especially work together on climate, something they used to do until the last few years. "Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish," Guterres said. "It is either a Climate Solidarity Pact - or a Collective Suicide Pact." The fire and brimstone may not quite have the effect as they have had in past meetings. Why? Because of bad timing and who isn't showing up, is coming late or is dithering about it. Most of the leaders are meeting in the first two days, just as the United States has a potentially policy-shifting midterm election. Then the leaders of the world's 20 wealthiest nations will have their powerful-only club confab in Bali in Indonesia days later. Add to that, "there are big climate summits and little climate summits and this was never expected to be a big one," said Climate Advisers CEO Nigel Purvis, a former U.S. negotiator. Leaders of two of the three biggest carbon polluting nations - China and India - appear to be skipping the climate talks, although underlings are here negotiating. The leader of the other top polluting country - U.S. President Joe Biden - is coming days later than most of the other presidents and prime ministers on his way to Bali. United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was initially going to avoid the negotiations, but public pressure and predecessor Boris Johnson's plans to come changed his mind. New King Charles III, a longtime environment advocate, won't attend because of his new role. And Russia's leader Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine created energy chaos that reverberates in the world of climate negotiations, won't be here. "We always want more" leaders, United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell said in a Sunday news conference. "But I believe there is sufficient (leadership) right now for us to have a very productive outcome." In addition to speeches given by the leaders, the negotiations include "innovative'' roundtable discussions that "we are confident, will generate some very powerful insights," Stiell said. The leaders showing up in droves are from the host continent Africa. "The historical polluters who caused climate change are not showing up,'' said Mohammed Adow of Power Shift Africa. "Africa is the least responsible, the most vulnerable to the issue of climate change and it is a continent that is stepping up and providing leadership." "The South is actually stepping up," Adow told The Associated Press. "The North that historically caused the problem is failing.'' The opening session will be heavily dominated by leaders of nations victimized by climate change - not those that have created the problem of heat-trapping gases warming up the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuel. It will be mostly African nations and small island nations and other vulnerable nations that will be telling their stories. And they are dramatic ones, droughts in Africa and floods in Pakistan, in places that could least afford it. For the first time in 30 years of climate negotiations, the summit "should focus its attention on the severe climate impacts we're already seeing," said World Resources International's David Waskow. "We can't discount an entire continent that has over a billion people living here and has some of the most severe impacts,'' Waskow said. "It's pretty clear that Africa will be at risk in a very severe way.''

For years climate change warnings have followed a similar pattern: Act now to prevent catastrophic consequences in the future. Yet as we go into the 27th United Nations Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, that message alone is not enough - We must also focus on the need to protect ourselves and our planet today. Climate change is no longer a far-off threat. It's here, affecting lives and livelihoods and disrupting hydrological and other ecological cycles. The earth has warmed 1.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and the number of climate and weather-related disasters has increased almost 35% since the 1990s. Just consider the recent devastating floods in Pakistan and Nigeria that have killed hundreds and displaced millions. While we must prevent further temperature increases by continuing to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions and regenerate food, water and ocean systems, we must also get serious about coming together to adapt to the climate realities of today. Climate adaptation must be part of a HYPERLINK https://unfccc.int/topics/adaptation-and-resilience/the-big-picture/what-do-adaptation-to-climate-change-and-climate-resilience-mean holistic climate change strategy It's clear that we must do more to help those most at risk. According to the most recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, almost HYPERLINK https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/spm-headline-statements/#:~:text=Approximately%203.3%20to%203.6%20billion,are%20interdependent%20(high%20confidence) 3.3 billion people But adaptation is not just for the most vulnerable. As recent extreme weather events across the developing and developed words showed, we are all exposed to the effects of climate change. Droughts, wildfires and other natural disasters are increasing in frequency and intensity, leaving in their wake lost lives, damaged infrastructure and disrupted supply chains. Every government, company and individual needs to prepare. The longer we wait to focus on adaptation, the more lives will be affected and the more difficult and expensive it will be. The U.N. estimates that the current cost of meeting adaptation needs is $70 billion. By 2050, it could reach $500 billion. According to the Carbon Disclosure Project, just for water risks alone, the costs of doing nothing is five times that of acting today. So, what can we do to accelerate adaptation efforts? Until now, climate adaptation has largely been considered the responsibility of governments, multilateral institutions and donor agencies. Several countries have developed National Adaptation Plans under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, and COP26 was a pivotal moment with the adoption of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which calls for a doubling of financial commitments to helping developing countries adapt and become more resilient. But governments cannot do it alone. Even if they meet the goals set out last year, investments into adaptation would still fall short of what's needed. The private sector must also step up - and there is a clear business case for doing so, as a new HYPERLINK https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Critical_Business_Actions_for_Climate_Change_Adaptation_2022 World Economic Forum paper By assessing risks along their value chains and working with suppliers and communities to identify the skills and resources needed to withstand shocks, businesses can better manage and mitigate the risks to their operations and avoid severe economic losses. They can also capitalize on opportunities to invest into products, services and business models that address the adaptation needs of their stakeholders, benefiting from increased efficiency, innovation and sustainable growth. Globally, a $1.8 trillion of investments into adaptation efforts could generate HYPERLINK https://gca.org/reports/adapt-now-a-global-call-for-leadership-on-climate-resilience/ $7.1 trillion in total net benefits by 2030, according to a 2019 report by the Global Commission on Adaptation. Businesses can leverage their experience with emerging technology and data-driven insights. For example, energy company Sempra applies sensor technology and weather data to help fight wildfires before they get out of control, both safeguarding their energy infrastructure from disruption and helping ensure public safety. Countries can also work with financial institutions and other partners to explore financing instruments to better protect vulnerable areas. For example, together with the Nature Conservancy and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, Credit Suisse offered their financial and capital markets expertise to create blue bond financing for Belize. This seeks to invest into marine management, coral reef and mangrove restoration, strengthening coastal resiliency and enhancing sustainable economic development. In addition, businesses can explore enhancing the climate resilience of infrastructure and communities though https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/05/davos-2022-a-key-milestone-in-a-pivotal-year-for-nature-action-f8d852f23e/ nature-based solutions Finally, businesses can provide leadership and shape the broader agenda on adaptation by collaborating with governments, development agencies, academia and other industry players to shape policy and change behaviors. COP27 , we will have an unprecedented opportunity to do so. While adaptation has always been on the global climate agenda, it is now finally prioritized, alongside mitigation solutions and other issues.

COFCO International, and other thirteen world's leading agri-commodity companies have recently set out a shared roadmap outlining how they will work towards reducing emissions from land-use change. Following the commitments made at COP26, over the past year, the Tropical Forest Alliance, hosted by the World Economic Forum, with support from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, has facilitated the process for the agricultural commodity companies to develop the Agriculture Sector Roadmap to 1.5C. Wei Dong, CEO of COFCO International said: "We congratulate TFA, WBCSD, the involved governments and other signatories for achieving this progress which represents a significant sector milestone in eliminating commodity-driven deforestation in line with a 1.5C pathway." Original Press Release: Nov. 18 --COFCO issued the following news release: COFCO International, and other thirteen world's leading agri-commodity companies have recently set out a shared roadmap outlining how they will work towards reducing emissions from land-use change. Following the commitments made at COP26, over the past year, the Tropical Forest Alliance, hosted by the World Economic Forum, with support from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, has facilitated the process for the agricultural commodity companies to develop the Agriculture Sector Roadmap to 1.5C. Food and land-use systems account for around a third of all greenhouse gas emissions and it is land-use change, such as clearing forest to make way for farms, that drives these emissions. To address this critical issue, the CEOs of leading agri-commodity companies committed - at COP26 in Glasgow - to developing a shared roadmap focused on reducing emissions from land-use change. The Agriculture Sector Roadmap to 1.5C, released at COP27 in Egypt, represents a sector-wide plan for addressing forest loss in supply chains and accelerating collaboration with others to achieve that goal. It commits the 14 companies to implement time-bound plans and report publicly on their progress towards the targets on an annual basis. The roadmap sets out sectoral plans for cattle, soy and palm oil - the production of which is a leading driver of forest loss - to ensure that actions concentrate on areas where they will have the most impact. It also outlines how signatories will engage and collaborate with other stakeholders, namely governments, supply chain actors and financial institutions, for wider support of the roadmap's commitments. This includes strengthening policies and regulations and incentivizing farmers and ranchers to protect natural resources. Wei Dong, CEO of COFCO International said: "We congratulate TFA, WBCSD, the involved governments and other signatories for achieving this progress which represents a significant sector milestone in eliminating commodity-driven deforestation in line with a 1.5C pathway."

New data published by the Financial Times has indicated that the rampant inflation that has affected so many global economies this year may have reached its peak, and that an easing up of factors like supply chain issues could see it come down in the months ahead, to the relief of householders, businesses and central banks. In October, inflation across the 19-member eurozone reached 10.7 percent, up from 9.9 percent the month before, largely as a result of a 41.9 percent increase in energy costs. Despite the Bank of England's target of 2 percent, the United Kingdom's inflation rate for the same month was 11.1 percent  its highest level for 41 years. The United States' Federal Reserve also has a 2 percent goal. And in October, the reality was a relatively more encouraging 7.7 percent, down from 8.2 percent the previous month. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told the FT that inflation was "likely at its apex "now, with October's figures being a "high water mark" and that the easing of price pressures should "presage the coming moderation in consumer prices". The more optimistic outlook backs up the comments of Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, at the recent COP27 climate summit in Egypt, where she told Bloomberg that "it is very possible that we are peaking". Top priority "We now see central banks very united on fighting inflation as a top priority and rightly so," Georgieva said. "If we don't succeed, it would de-anchor and then the foundation for growth which is price stability is dented." Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics, told the FT that she thought high energy costs this year, which have been severely impacted as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, should calm down in the new year. "Our estimate is that food and energy effects together will knock about 3 percentage points off headline consumer price inflation in the advanced economies on average over the next six months," she said. Even if the situation does ease, however, its consequences will remain, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, warning that it was one of several factors that would have a severe impact on global growth this year and the coming year, with growth this year estimated to be just 3.1 percent, compared to 5.9 percent last year. "It is true we are not predicting a global recession," OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said. "But this is a very, very challenging outlook." Much of the growth that is expected next year is forecast to come from Asia. While economies in Europe and the United States continue to limp along, around three-quarters of growth will be generated in Asia, with the economy of India tipped to expand by 6.6 percent this year, and 5.7 percent next year.

Thousands of families have been displaced due to recent climate change and droughts in Ethiopia's Somali regions. Leaving them without hope. Most families have lost their homes, livestock, and farmland. Photo: UNHCR/Eugene Sibomana With no Western leaders showing up at the climate summit in Rotterdam, Netherlands on Monday besides the host country, developed countries in the West responsible for most historical CO2 emissions have been slammed as being indifferent and irresponsible for dodging their moral obligation and hampering global climate cooperation, with their pledge of $25 billion funding to support climate change adaptation in African countries doubted as another empty cheque that could not be cashed. The $25 billion was promised by the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, a joint initiative of the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation, the amount being the biggest ever globally, according to AP. However, after decades of developed countries' unfulfilled funding promises, African countries remain skeptical whether this will be another empty cheque, which experts said will be most likely. "The West's record on its promises reveals they are unlikely to be fulfilled, just like the previous lip service," Zhu Weidong, senior research fellow with the Institute of West Asian and African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Developed countries projected that they will not meet to mobilize $100 billion a year to help poorer countries deal with climate change until 2023 - three years late and still woefully short of the real need, according to a report from the Conversation, a non-profit organization. As for the US, its Congress earlier approved a mere $1 billion in international climate finance for 2022 - far short of Joe Biden's pledge to provide $11.4 billion a year by 2024. "Throughout the Paris Agreement and some previous framework conventions on climate change, there are still ambiguous areas regarding the implementation details of some responsibilities and obligations of developed countries," Li Zhiqing, a professor of environmental economics and Chinese economy at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The scholar suggested a punitive restraint mechanism be added. "There is currently a lack of an effective constraint on whether pledged funds are being delivered," he said. "In the Paris Agreement, there is a five-year check mechanism on the fulfillment of countries' emission reduction obligations, and such a mechanism could perhaps be extended to bind the delivery of pledged funds." Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of Netherlands, the host country, was the only Western leader to attend the summit in person. He admitted that attendance "has not been at a level [they] would have liked." African leaders also criticized on Monday the lack of Western counterparts at a meeting in Rotterdam with some saying wealthy countries responsible for most CO2 emissions should have been there. "I cannot fail to note with a touch of bitterness the absence of the leaders of the industrialized world," said Senegalese President and African Union chief Macky Sall at the opening of the event, AFP reported. "Because these are the main polluters of our planet and it is they who should finance adaptation." "Apparently, other issues facing the West itself have stolen most of their attention, such as the energy crisis and economic woes within their own continents," Zhu said. Several European countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands have already returned or are planning to return to coal to generate electricity, after feeling the pinch from the energy crisis resulting from the Ukraine crisis, on top of Europe seeing its worst drought in 500 years. The expert reminded developed countries that their carbon emissions and pollution are the cause of Africa's climate vulnerability and that they have both a moral and a practical responsibility for it. "The African continent has the smallest impact on climate change, but paradoxically suffers the majority of its consequences," Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi said at the event on Monday, according to AFP report. Former UN chief Ban Ki-moon added that Africa emits just 3 percent of global CO2 emissions, and there is a moral duty to help Africa adapt, the report said. Zhu pointed out that developed countries, with their early industrialization and high carbon emissions, are in fact responsible for the deterioration of the climate in Africa, which has been struggling with drought, cyclones and extreme heat in the recent years. "The UN and some international climate conventions have also made relevant provisions about their obligations," he said. The Rotterdam summit is a part of the series of regional meetings ahead of the crucial COP27 climate conference which will take place from November 6 to 18 in Egypt. With only two months remaining till COP27 , the insincere promises and indifferent attitude from the West are once again overshadowing the event which is designed to boost global cooperation to address climate challenges, experts said. "It was not just the fate of Africa that is at stake, but the fate of humanity and the future of the planet," said Sall, signaling a warning to the West. While the Western countries backpedal their pledges on climate change and even use the topic as a political tool to smear China, China has been steadily advancing toward its goal on carbon neutrality and promoting green development under the Belt and Road Initiative. The National Development and Reform Commission issued guidance in March this year, vowing to steadily advance cooperation on green infrastructure, energy, transportation and finance by 2025. By 2030, environmental risk prevention and control systems for overseas projects should be improved, according to the guidance. \</doc>

NAIROBI, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- The transition to a just, inclusive, and green future will be dependent on deliberate efforts by governments, lenders, and industry to ramp up financing towards climate adaptation, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said in a report launched in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital on Thursday. According to UNEP's flagship Adaptation Gap Report 2022, there was an urgency to address funding bottlenecks that were undermining the capacity of vulnerable communities to cope with climate emergencies. Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of UNEP noted that the climate crisis was taking a toll on humanity and fragile ecosystems, necessitating robust investments in adaptation measures. "Nations need to back the strong words in the Glasgow Climate Pact with strong action to increase adaptation investments and outcomes, starting at COP27 ," Andersen remarked. The UNEP's Adaptation Gap Report, launched ahead of the Global Climate Summit slated for Egypt from Nov. 6 to 18, stated that catastrophes linked to planetary warming could escalate, given inadequate financing towards adaptation and mitigation efforts in developing countries. In particular, the report dubbed "Too Little, Too Slow - Climate Adaptation Failure puts the world at risk", notes that financial and technical support for countries at the frontlines of the climate crisis has failed to keep pace with the growing threat. The current international adaptation financial flows to developing countries are five to ten times below the estimated needs, having reached 29 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, though a 4 percent increase from the 2019 level, says the report. In addition, the report says there was a 17 billion dollars decline in the combined adaptation and mitigation finance flows to developing countries in 2020, far below the 100 billion dollars pledged by wealthy nations. The report discloses that the estimated annual adaptation needs for countries in the global south range from 160 to 340 billion dollars by 2030 and from 315 to 565 billion dollars by 2050. On a positive note, the report indicates that more than eight out of ten countries have at least one national adaptation instrument, and are keen on inclusivity while one-third of the 197 parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have time-bound adaptation targets. The UNEP report adds that adaptation measures concentrated in agriculture, water, and other vital ecosystems have accelerated though not keeping up with the unfolding climate emergencies like droughts, heatwaves, and forest fires. It stresses that to avert climate disasters in the future, adaptation financing must be combined with political goodwill, harnessing of nature-based solutions, cleaner technologies, and embrace of sustainable lifestyles.

SHENZHEN delegates shared the city\' s innovative experience in ecological environment protection and practices in building a beautiful city at a parallel session of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Egypt on Saturday. China will build an international mangrove center in Shenzhen, President Xi Jinping said in a speech via video at the opening ceremony of COP14 (The 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands). Zhang Yali, deputy director of the Shenzhen Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau, said at the parallel session\' s promotional event that mangroves have not only witnessed the young city\' s rapid economic development, but also the development of the stopover site for international migratory birds, according to Shenzhen Special Zone Daily. Each year, over 100,000 of about 200 types of migratory birds such as black-faced spoonbills, common spoonbills and Chinese egrets spend winter at Futian Mangrove Nature Reserve covering an area of over 300 hectares, according to Zhang. Shenzhen has attached great importance to ecological environment protection. Shenzhen\' s green competitiveness ranked first among 289 Chinese cities, according to the 2021 Chinese cities green competitiveness index report released by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and the United Nations Environment Program. Shenzhen is committed to green and low-carbon development and achieving high-quality development at a lower environmental cost. Shenzhen has the lowest energy consumption and carbon intensity among Chinese megacities and completely eliminated general industrial and commercial use of coal. Shenzhen is also devoted to the scientific layout of production, ecology and living space and the city explores innovative practices in various fields related to carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, according to the report. In terms of climate change, Shenzhen unveiled the country\' s first set of green financial regulations and a guide to ocean carbon sink accounting. Shenzhen has promoted green and low-carbon initiatives and green transportation. All of the city\' s public buses and taxis are 100% electric, and is one of cities with the largest numbers of new energy vehicles. Moreover, Shenzhen is building 28 nearly-zero carbon emission pilot projects to form a group of new scenarios applying green and low-carbon technologies. The city has built 1,238 parks and 2,843 kilometers of greenways and promoted green infrastructure construction. Zhang said it is necessary to pay attention to the harmonious coexistence of man and nature in urban development.  Shenzhen will accelerate the creation of a beautiful Chinese model of harmonious coexistence between human and nature.

LUSAKA, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has launched activities to mark the commemoration of the "Africa Climate Week" with a call on African countries to coordinate their efforts to make climate and resilient development ambitions a reality. The event runs from Aug. 29 to Sept. 1, with Gabon hosting the main event. In Zambia, the activities are being coordinated by the World Wide Fund (WWF) Zambia in collaboration with the Ministry of Green Economy and Environment. Beauty Mbale, the WWF Zambia acting chief conservation officer, said during the launch in Lusaka on Monday that Africa's growth over the past decade has largely been driven by climate-sensitive sectors which must be protected to ensure meaningful development. She said climate change was a potential threat and multiplier in the context of conflict and human security, adding that Africa's response must be with a coordinated vision that will ensure that resilient development ambitions become a reality. "Africa is no stranger to the vulnerabilities and potential exposure of the controversial issue towards loss and damage," she said. Africa, she added, has an opportunity to reassess and redesign its systems and put itself strictly on a path toward sustainability by embracing and recognizing that time was not enough to deal with the climate change crisis. She, however, commended Zambia's ministry in charge of the environment over its efforts toward ensuring green growth and climate action agenda for the country. According to her, the efforts have put Zambia on the map of leading Africa's negotiations toward the forthcoming 27th Session on the Climate Change Conference of Parties ( COP27 ). She further revealed that the WWF Zambia office was coordinating the "Africa Climate Week" commemoration activities under Voice for Justice Climate Action Program. Among the activities include engaging and empowering stakeholders to drive climate action. Collins Nzovu, the Minister of Green Economy and Environment, reaffirmed the government's commitment to the protection of the environment for sustainable development. He said the commitment was evidenced in the government's decision to embark on legal and policy reforms aimed at providing a conducive environment to combat the adverse effect of climate change, adding that the government has also included climate change in its 8th National Development Plan. "The core objective is to protect our environment for the benefit of our current and future generations," he said. Enditem \</doc>

NAIROBI, Aug. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a green lobby based in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, on Sunday launched the climate justice torch (CJT) with the aim of galvanizing local actions geared toward hastening the transition to a low carbon future. Mithika Mwenda, the executive director of PACJA, said the CJT campaign seeks to rally grassroots communities toward activities that promote green transition in a continent already reeling from a host of climatic shocks. "The Climate Justice Torch campaign aims to mobilize and galvanize voices of the vulnerable communities while illuminating aspirations of African people who have suffered disproportionately from climate change impacts," Mwenda said in a statement issued in Nairobi. Launched ahead of the 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Summit slated for Egypt from Nov. 6-18, the torch campaign will raise the visibility of the plight of African communities on the frontline of climate emergencies like droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires. According to Mwenda, the torch campaign will push for recognition of Africa's special needs and circumstances, loss and damage, and prioritization of adaptation finance to enhance climate resilience in the continent. Mwenda stressed that local communities have demonstrated resilience and tenacity in the face of the climate crisis, hence the need to place them at the heart of mitigation and adaptation programs. Harnessing indigenous knowledge and innovations will be prioritized by the torch campaign, to enable African communities to cope with devastating impacts of climate change such as extreme weather events, hunger, and water stress, said Mwenda. He called upon governments to come up with forward-looking policies and legislation aimed at spurring grassroots investments in climate adaptation and achieving a green, just, and inclusive transition. Mwenda also said that voices of demographics on the frontline of the climate crisis including smallholder farmers, small and medium-sized enterprises, fisherfolk, pastoralists, women, youth, and hunter-gathers, will be raised by the torch campaign. Lee White, the Gabonese minister of Water, Forests, the Sea, and Environment, said the launch of the climate justice torch was timely, given the urgency to mobilize Africa's grassroots communities and urge them to undertake actions that could lower carbon emissions and accelerate green growth.

By EARLE GALE in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-11 09:42 France hopes to reduce its carbon emissions and diminish its dependence on imported oil by generating more electricity from solar power, with a requirement for photo-voltaic solar panels to be installed over large parking lots at the center of its plans. The solar-power drive is part of President Emmanuel Macron's renewable energy legislation, which France's Senate approved this week. The new law calls for pre-existing and new parking lots with enough space for 80 vehicles or more to be fitted with solar panels. The owners of parking lots with up to 400 spaces will get five years to comply, while those with more than 400 spaces will get three. Agence France-Presse news agency said parking lots will likely not look dissimilar to many already in existence in France that have some sort of informal roof, to ensure vehicles do not become too hot in the sun. The new legislation calls for at least half of the footprint of each parking lot to be covered in solar panels. Macron's government believes the move will generate as much as 11 gigawatts of electricity, which could power 8.25 million homes. France is also looking at the idea of requiring solar panels to be installed next to freeways and rail lines, and on some types of farmland, but has not yet drafted legislation in those areas. Macron has recently been pushing hard to get the nation to reduce its carbon emissions and also sat down with the bosses of France's most climate-damaging companies this week, to urge them to do more to slash their production of the gases that cause global warming. "If you double your efforts ... we will double the financing dedicated to this issue and will increased the state aid package from 5 to 10 billion euros ($5-10 billion)," the Associated Press news agency quoted him as telling the business leaders, who represented 50 industrial giants that together account for 10 percent of France's emissions. Macron made the push after returning from the United Nations' COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where he urged other world leaders to "continue to take action" to limit global warming. The European Union, of which France is a key member, has vowed to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 from the level in 1990, and to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Macron has also recently unveiled plans to accelerate the development of renewable energy, with more off &mdash; shore wind farms and solar power plants planned. He has said the country will build six new nuclear reactors as part of its efforts to cut emissions. France has also begun an advertising campaign in which people are encouraged to cut back on their energy consumption at home. \</doc>

China firmly upholds the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and the core role being played by the United Nations in international affairs, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in New York on September 24 . In his meeting with Csaba Korosi, president of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), Wang said the United Nations is the core mechanism and the most important platform for safeguarding multilateralism, adding that China is the first country to sign the UN Charter and has always advocated practicing true multilateralism. "We firmly support the important role of the UNGA in addressing global challenges, as well as the work of the president of the UNGA," he said. Noting that the world today is not peaceful, Wang said Chinese President Xi Jinping has proposed the Global Security Initiative, and advocates a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, which offers a Chinese solution to making up for the peace deficits, and solving the security dilemma. China has also put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI), which stands for China's contribution to focus on development issues and accelerate the realization of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and has received positive response and support from the international community, Wang said. The Chinese side is willing to strengthen synergy with the United Nations, mobilize more resources and form a greater joint force, he added. For his part, Korosi said China is a champion of multilateralism and an important partner of the United Nations, and plays a key role in the affairs of the UNGA. He expressed his appreciation that China has provided consistent support to the president of the UNGA in performing duties, and will continue to step up cooperation with China to jointly tackle global challenges. Noting that the important initiatives put forward by Xi provide a vision and solutions for building even greater consensus and effective measures for coping with current challenges, he said he looks forward to strengthening coordination with China in dealing with climate change and water resources protection, and implementing the sustainable development agenda. Wang said that sustainable development is the common cause of humanity. He also said that a few days ago, China hosted the ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of the GDI, and announced that it would take seven more steps to implement the GDI. China also presented global sustainable development data products to the United Nations, Wang noted, saying that the Chinese side is ready to maintain communication with the Office of the President of the UNGA on green development and global water resources protection, and supports a successful 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS  The world's population surged past 8 billion people on Tuesday, the United Nations said, amid calls by the world body for nations to take action to bridge divides between the global haves and have-nots. Whether it's food or water, batteries or gasoline, there will be less to go around as the global population adds another 2.4 billion people by the 2080s, according to UN projections. In an opinion article published on Friday by the USA Today newspaper, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the milestone of 8 billion people "a testament to scientific breakthroughs and improvements in nutrition, public health and sanitation". The world can yield enormous opportunities for some of the poorest countries, where population growth is highest, said Guterres, adding that within a few decades, today's poorest countries could become engines of sustainable, green growth and prosperity across entire regions. "But as our human family grows larger, it is also growing more divided," the UN chief warned. He noted that billions of people are struggling, hundreds of millions are facing hunger and even famine, and record numbers are on the move seeking opportunities and relief from debt and hardship, wars and climate disasters. "Unless we bridge the yawning chasm between the global haves and have-nots, we are setting ourselves up for an 8-billion-strong world filled with tensions and mistrust, crisis and conflict," wrote Guterres. As the world has grown richer and healthier in recent decades, the inequalities have grown too, he pointed out. A handful of billionaires control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world, and people in the richest countries can expect to live up to 30 years longer than those in the poorest, he said. The accelerating climate crisis and the unequal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are turbo-charging inequalities. The conflict in Ukraine is adding to food, energy and finance crises, hitting developing economies hardest, the UN chief said. Anger and resentment against developed countries are reaching breaking points, Guterres said, while toxic divisions and lack of trust are causing delays and deadlock on issues from nuclear disarmament and terrorism to global health. "We must curb these damaging trends, repair relationships and find joint solutions to our common challenges," he said. The UN chief expressed hope that the COP27 climate conference in Egypt "will see a historic Climate Solidarity Pact under which developed and emerging economies unite around a common strategy and combine their capacities and resources for the benefit of humankind". He called on wealthier countries to provide key emerging economies with financial and technical support to transition away from fossil fuels. He also urged the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, to adopt a stimulus package that will provide governments of the Global South with investments and liquidity, and address debt relief and restructuring.

By Antonio Guterres | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-15 08:17 The world's population will reach 8 billion in the middle of November - a testament to scientific breakthroughs and improvements in nutrition, public health and sanitation. But as our human family grows larger, it is also growing more divided. Billions of people are struggling; hundreds of millions are facing hunger and even famine. Record numbers are on the move seeking opportunities and relief from debt and hardship, wars and climate disasters. Unless we bridge the yawning chasm between the global haves and have-nots, we are setting ourselves up for an 8-billion-strong world filled with tensions and mistrust, crisis and conflict. The facts speak for themselves. A handful of billionaires control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world. The top one percent globally pocket one fifth of the world's income, while people in the richest countries can expect to live up to 30 years longer than those in the poorest. As the world has grown richer and healthier in recent decades, these inequalities have grown too. On top of these long-term trends, the accelerating climate crisis and the unequal recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are turbo-charging inequalities. We are heading straight for climate catastrophe, while emissions and temperatures continue to rise. Floods, storms and droughts are devastating countries that contributed almost nothing to global heating. The war in Ukraine is adding to ongoing food, energy and finance crises, hitting developing economies hardest. These inequalities take their greatest toll on women and girls, and on marginalized groups that already suffer discrimination. Many countries in the Global South face huge debts, increasing poverty and hunger, and the growing impacts of the climate crisis. They have little chance of investing in a sustainable recovery from the pandemic, the transition to renewable energy, or education and training for the digital age. Anger and resentment against developed countries are reaching breaking points. Toxic divisions and lack of trust are causing delays and deadlock on a host of issues, from nuclear disarmament to terrorism to global health. We must curb these damaging trends, repair relationships and find joint solutions to our common challenges. The first step is acknowledging that this runaway inequality is a choice, and one that developed countries have the responsibility to reverse - starting this month at the UN climate conference in Egypt and the G20 summit in Bali. I hope COP 27 I also urge leaders at COP 27 to agree on a roadmap and institutional framework to compensate countries in the Global South for climate-related loss and damage that is already causing enormous suffering. The G20 summit in Bali will be an opportunity to address the plight of developing countries. I have urged G20 economies to adopt a stimulus package that will provide governments of the Global South with investments and liquidity, and address debt relief and restructuring. As we push for action on these medium-term measures, we are working nonstop with all stakeholders to ease the global food crisis. The Black Sea Grain Initiative is an essential part of those efforts. It has helped to stabilize markets and bring food prices down. Every fraction of a percent has the potential to ease hunger and save lives. We are also working to ensure Russian fertilizers can flow into global markets, which have been severely disrupted by the war. Fertilizer prices are up to three times higher than before the pandemic. Rice, the most widely consumed staple in the world, is the crop that will suffer most. Removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian fertilizers is an essential step towards global food security. But among all these serious challenges, there is some good news. Relatively small investments in healthcare, education, gender equality and sustainable economic development could create a virtuous circle of development and growth, transforming economies and lives. Within a few decades, today's poorest countries could become engines of sustainable, green growth and prosperity across entire regions. I never bet against human ingenuity, and I have enormous faith in human solidarity. In these difficult times, we would do well to remember the words of one of humanity's wisest observers, Mahatma Gandhi: "The world has enough for everyone's need - but not everyone's greed." This month's big global meetups must be an opportunity to start bridging divides and restoring trust, based on the equal rights and freedoms of every single member of humanity's eight-billion-strong family.

BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- A global gathering of mayors concerned about climate change kicked off Thursday in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodriguez Larreta and his London counterpart Sadiq Khan opened the two-day C40 World Mayors Summit, which brings together 121 cities from around the world and 150 from Argentina to "agree" to new commitments to fight global warming, the host city's government said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the opening ceremony at the Buenos Aires Convention Center in a video message. "Cities around the world ... remain at the forefront of the climate emergency," and their leadership is essential to achieving the sustainable development goals needed to combat climate devastation, Guterres said. "Your citizens look to you to provide leadership, action and protection that is often lacking at the national level," he said, urging local authorities to accelerate climate action by urgently reducing carbon footprints, investing in renewable energy, and promoting green jobs, among other measures. In just two weeks, COP27 (the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) will take place and every government, every business, every investor, every institution must step up. "The world is counting on you," Guterres said. Rodriguez highlighted the importance of dialogue towards consensus in pursuit of climate action. "No one is exempt from the consequences of climate change ... facing this situation requires everyone's effort, but not the same effort from everyone," he said. "The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities forces the northern hemisphere to assume its greatest responsibility and its greatest capacity for action in this challenge," he said. "A united Latin America has the potential to be a key region in the fight against climate change ... we must go beyond the environment-economic development dichotomy. They are not incompatible, quite the opposite: climate action and green financing are an opportunity for development and Argentina is a great example of that," he added. As president of the C40, Khan welcomed the commitment of the participating cities to encourage the creation of green jobs, one of the priorities of his administration. "Investing in the jobs and skills of the future will help us to tackle inequality as we tackle the climate crisis. I'm so proud to stand united in action with my fellow C40 city mayors to drive the creation of 50 million good, green jobs by the end of this decade," Khan said. According to a statement from the Buenos Aires mayor's office, through Friday, mayors and more than 1,200 climate change experts, business leaders and representatives of international organizations will debate climate commitments in three central areas: green and fair economic recovery with job creation, access to financing for environmental projects, and cities of well-being.

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-03 09:40 Polls show right-wing bloc set for victory, nation on path to £utocracy' say analysts Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing bloc looks to be on course for victory in Israel's general election, but analysts said if he becomes the leader, the country may be on the course to becoming an "autocracy". With 84 percent of votes counted for the 120 seats in the Parliament, called the Knesset, the bloc led by Netanyahu was on course to win 65. "We are close to a big victory," he told supporters of his Likud party. "We have won a huge vote of confidence from the people of Israel." Religious Zionism's leaders Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have been blatant in their use of anti-Arab language, with Ben-Gvir having been convicted in 2007 of incitement to racism and supporting a terrorist organization. Last month he was caught on camera pulling out a gun when he became the target of stone throwing during a visit to a predominantly Arab district of East Jerusalem, and speaking to reporters as election results came in, he promised to "work for all of Israel, even those who hate me". The election - Israel's fifth in under four years - is widely interpreted as being a referendum on Netanyahu himself, who is currently in opposition but has been in power in Israel for 15 of the past 26 years. He also opposes the creation of a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank as a way of ending the age-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, despite the proposal having the support of much of the international community. Early indications suggested Likud would be the largest party, with 31 seats, and Religious Zionism would be the third-largest, with 14. Yesh Atid, the center-left party whose coalition forced Netanyahu out of office in last year's elections, would be the second-biggest party with 24 seats. As results pointing toward a Nethanyahu victory continued to come in, current Prime Minister Yair Lapid from the Yesh Atid party insisted "nothing" was yet decided and to wait until the picture became clearer, but local media outlets reported that he had canceled his planned visit to the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, with his place being taken by Israel's President Isaac Herzog. Gayil Talshir, a political scientist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told the BBC that if the exit polls "reflect the real results, Israel is on its way to become Orban's Hungary", referring to Viktor Orban, the leader of Hungary, which was recently branded an "electoral autocracy" by the European Union. \</doc>

CAIRO, Nov. 2 (Xinhua) -- A growing partnership between Chinese and Egyptian companies in the field of power and energy has been greatly manifested at Egypt Energy, a three-day grand expo in Cairo that concluded on Tuesday. With the participation of more than 120 companies from at least 13 countries, the Egyptian government-sponsored energy expo was a warmup in green business ahead of the upcoming 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change COP27 hosted in Egypt's resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh. Many of the various Chinese manufacturers took part in the expo with a view to promoting partnerships with Egyptian companies in the production of electric equipment and localized green energy solutions. Featuring two types of China-developed low-voltage panels for power distribution, management and protection, Egyptian bus-duct maker Lecrobar said it planned to produce these products in Egypt in early 2023, starting with the body of the panels under its Chinese partner's supervision and then the switches. Localized manufacture "will save hard currency for Egypt and will help us learn from the expertise and technology provided by China," Ahmed el-Habachi, the chief executive officer of Lectrobar, told Xinhua. Ma Shengdong, a regional manager at China's industrial electrical equipment and new energy company Chint Group, the partner of Lecrobar, told Xinhua that his company entered the Egyptian market in 2012, and has recently started a localization strategy in the North African country, after Chint's sustainable and green energy solutions have been incorporated into various Egyptian green and social service projects. "We have gradually gained recognition from local customers," the Chinese businessman said, adding his company is a green solution provider for Egypt's massive Benban Solar Park, one of the world's largest photovoltaic power stations located in Upper Egypt's Aswan Province. Shi Chen, general manager of the Chinese-Egyptian joint venture XD-EGEMAC, another electric equipment maker that participated in the expo, said his company has completed 25 electrical substations, including four for the Benban Solar Park, and provided more than 130 sets of power transformers and nearly 500 bays of switchgear in Egypt. "Our vision is to provide smarter and greener energy solutions. In the future, we will combine our vision with the strategy of Egypt's Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy to provide greener energy to serve local people," Shi added. Eslam Ahmed, a senior marketing specialist at the state-owned Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, said bilateral cooperation between Egypt and China in the field of renewable energy is "extremely important," adding more Chinese companies have approached them for cooperation in this regard. "We have very big cooperation with Chinese companies in the fields of electricity and electrical automation because of China's expertise in the field, and we seek to expand investment opportunities for Chinese companies in Egypt," Ahmed told Xinhua at the expo.

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- As the world's population is approaching 8 billion, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday gave a review of the mixed implications, urging the world community to seize opportunities and take actions to bridge divides between the global haves and have-nots. On Nov. 15, the world's population is projected to reach 8 billion people, having grown by 1 billion since 2010, according to a recent policy brief by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. In an op-ed article published Friday by the USA Today newspaper, Guterres called the milestone "a testament to scientific breakthroughs and improvements in nutrition, public health and sanitation." The 8-billion-strong world could yield enormous opportunities for some of the poorest countries, where population growth is highest, he said, adding that within a few decades, today's poorest countries could become engines of sustainable, green growth and prosperity across entire regions.

He also urged the upcoming Group of 20 (G20) summit to be held in Bali, Indonesia, to adopt a stimulus package that will provide governments of the Global South with investments and liquidity, and address debt relief and restructuring. The UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative is an essential part of the efforts to ease the global food crisis, Guterres said, noting that removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian fertilizers is an essential step towards global food security. "This month's big global meetups must be an opportunity to start bridging divides and restoring trust, based on the equal rights and freedoms of every single member of humanity's 8-billion-strong family," he wrote in the article.

Questions have been raised over the political judgment of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak after he suffered the first resignation from his government less than a month after taking office. Gavin Williamson, who was appointed minister without portfolio in the Cabinet just two weeks ago, was forced to step down following a string of bullying allegations, many of which emerged days before the start of the national Anti-Bullying Week initiative. The story began when The Sunday Times newspaper published expletive-filled texts that Williamson sent to then-Conservative Party chief whip Wendy Morton about the allocation of places at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, alleging preferential treatment had been given to members of Parliament who were close to then-prime minister Liz Truss. These were followed by a senior civil servant telling The Guardian of intimidating and aggressive language Williamson had used toward staff members when he was defense secretary, and then another Conservative MP, Anne Milton, came forward with more allegations of threatening behavior when Williamson had been the party's chief whip. When faced with the latest claims against Williamson, Sunak said the language used was "not acceptable", but on Monday his office said he had full confidence in him. On Tuesday, following Sunak's return from COP 27 in Egypt, the pair had face-to-face discussions and Williamson's resignation soon followed. In his formal letter of resignation, Williamson said: "I recognize these (allegations) are becoming a distraction for the good work this government is doing. I have therefore decided to step back from government so that I can comply fully with the complaints process that is underway and clear my name of any wrongdoing." Sunak replied and said he accepted it with "great sadness". "I support your decision to step back and understand why you have taken it. I would like to thank you for your personal support and loyalty," Sunak said. The opposition Labour Party's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy told the BBC that Williamson's behavior was "repellent, odious and unacceptable". "We really should have an account of why he came back into government," Lammy said. HYPERLINK mailto:julian@mail.chinadailyuk.com julian@mail.chinadailyuk.com \~ \</doc>

The U.N. climate summit is back in Africa after six years and four consecutive Europe-based conferences. The 27th annual Conference of the Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change - better known as COP27 - will be held in the resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt and begins next week. It's been branded as the "African COP", with officials and activists hoping the conference's location will mean the continent's interests are better represented in climate negotiations. Hosts Egypt say the meeting represents a unique opportunity for Africa to align climate change goals with the continent's other aims, like improving living standards and making countries more resilient to weather extremes. Organizers expect over 40,000 participants, the highest number ever for a climate summit on the continent. Ever since the conference's first iteration in Berlin in 1995, the U.N. climate summit continues to rotate annually among the five U.N. classified regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, central and eastern Europe, and western Europe. It's the fifth time that an African nation has held the U.N. climate summit, with Morocco, South Africa and Kenya all serving as former hosts. The first African summit, held in Marrakech in 2001, passed landmark accords on climate funding and made other key decisions on land use and forestry. The following three meetings on the continent had some success on issues like adapting to climate change, technology and sowing the seeds for the Paris Agreement in 2015 years earlier. Marrakech is also the last African city to host the event, having hosted a second COP in 2016, that aimed to implement some of the Paris goals. The Paris Agreement, considered a major success of the U.N. climate summits, saw nations agree to limit warming to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), with an aim of curbing it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). And although experts don't expect agreement between countries to reach the same scale as Paris, hopes on the continent are high for the upcoming conference. Mithika Mwenda, who heads the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, told The Associated Press that the summit "presents a unique opportunity to place Africa at the center of global climate negotiations" and hoped the conference "truly delivers for the African people." Mwenda said that the "special needs and circumstances" of the continent need to be considered as it attempts to both increase access to electricity for millions of people while addressing climate change and limiting the use of fossil fuels. He added negotiations must prioritize how vulnerable countries will adapt to climate change, address compensation from high-polluting countries to poorer ones, known as "loss and damage", and seek avenues for financing for both a move to cleaner energy and building resilience to climate change. Many developing countries look to the U.S. and much of Europe, who have contributed the largest share of emissions over time, to pay for damage caused by climate change. So far, pledges by rich countries on climate finance, such as the $100 billion-a-year promise to help poorer nations meets their climate goals, have not been met. The Egyptian organizers said the summit should focus on how countries can implement pledges made in previous years.

The recent climate talks in Egypt have left us with a sobering reality: The window for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is closing fast and what is on the table currently is insufficient to avert some of the worst potential effects of climate change. The Nationally Determined Contribution targets of Asian and Pacific countries will result in a 16 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from the 2010 levels. The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan and the package of decisions taken at COP 27 are a reaffirmation of actions that could deliver the net-zero resilient world our countries aspire to. The historic decision to establish a Loss and Damage Fund is an important step toward climate justice and building trust among countries. But they are not enough to help us arrive at a better future without what the UN Secretary General calls a "giant leap on climate ambition". Carbon neutrality needs to be at the heart of national development strategies and reflected in public and private investment decisions. And it needs to cascade down to sustainable pathways in each sector of the economy. Accelerate energy transition At the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, we are working with regional and national stakeholders on these transformational pathways. Moving away from the brown economy is imperative, not only because emissions are rising but also because dependence on fossil fuels has left economies struggling with price volatility and energy insecurity. A clear road map is the needed springboard for an inclusive and just energy transition. We have been working with countries to develop scenarios for such a shift through National Roadmaps, demonstrating that a different energy future is possible and viable with the political will and sincere commitment to action of the public and private sectors. The changeover to renewable energy also requires concurrent improvements in grid infrastructure, especially cross-border grids. The Regional Road Map on Power System Connectivity provides a platform to work with member states toward an interconnected grid, including through the development of the necessary regulatory frameworks to integrate power systems and mobilize investments in grid infrastructure. The future of energy security will be determined by the ability to develop green grids and trade renewable-generated electricity across borders. Green the rides The move to net-zero carbon will not be complete without greening the transport sector. In Asia and the Pacific transport is primarily powered by fossil fuels and as a result accounted for 24 percent of total carbon emissions by 2018. Energy efficiency improvements and using more electric vehicles are the most effective measures to reduce carbon emissions by as much as 60 percent in 2050 compared to the 2005 levels. The Regional Action Programme for Sustainable Transport Development allows us to work with countries to implement and cooperate on priorities for low-carbon transport, including electric mobility. Our work with the Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade is also helping to make commerce more efficient and climate-smart, a critical element for transition in the energy and transport sectors. Adapting to a riskier future Even with mitigation measures in place, our economy and people will not be safe without a holistic risk management system. And it needs to be one that prevents communities from being blindsided by cascading climate disasters. We are working with partners to deepen the understanding of such cascading risks and to help develop preparedness strategies for this new reality, such as the implementation of the ASEAN Regional Plan of Action for Adaptation to Drought. Financing the most vulnerable Finance and investment are uniquely placed to propel the transitions needed. The past five years have seen thematic bonds in our region grow tenfold. Private finance is slowly aligning with climate needs. The new Loss and Damage Fund and its operation present new hopes for financing the most vulnerable. However, climate finance is not happening at the speed and scale needed. It needs to be accessible to developing economies in times of need. Innovative financing instruments need to be developed and scaled up, from debt-for-climate swaps to Sustainable Development Goals bonds, some of which ESCAP is helping to develop in the Pacific and in Cambodia. Growing momentum in the business sector will need to be sustained. The Asia-Pacific Green Deal for Business by the ESCAP Sustainable Business Network is important progress. We are also working with the High-level Climate Champions to bring climate-aligned investment opportunities closer to private financiers. Lock in higher ambition Climate actions in Asia and the Pacific matter for global success and well-being. The past two years have been a grim reminder that conflicts in one continent create hunger in another, and that emissions somewhere push sea levels higher everywhere. Never has our prosperity been more dependent on collective actions and cooperation. Countries are taking note. Member states meeting at the seventh session of the Committee on Environment and Development, which opens on Nov 29, are seeking consensus on the regional cooperation needed and priorities for climate action such as oceans, ecosystem and air pollution. We hope that the momentum begun at COP 27 and the Committee will be continued at the 79th session of ESCAP at the United Nations Conference Centre in Bangkok from May 15 to 19 next year, as it will hone in on the accelerators for climate action. In this era of heightened risks and shared prosperity, only regional, multilateral solidarity and genuine ambition that matches with the new climate reality unfolding around us  along with bold climate action  are the ways to secure a future where the countries of Asia and the Pacific can prosper.

Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity have essentially agreed upon the structure and core content of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, but divergences remain, officials with the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said. They made the remarks in a news conference on Monday in the lead-up to the second phase of the 15th meeting of the conference of parties to the convention, widely known as COP15. The first phase of the largest UN biodiversity gathering in a decade was held in Kunming, Yunnan province, which included an opening ceremony, leaders' speeches and the issuance of the "Kunming Declaration". Carrying the theme of "Ecological Civilization  Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth", COP15 will see its second phase held in Montreal, Canada from Dec 5 to 17, still under the Chinese presidency. In this phase, parties will meet to conclude negotiations and decide on the framework. Ecological civilization is a concept promoted by President Xi Jinping for balanced and sustainable development that features harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature. Cui Shuhong, head of the ministry's nature and eco-conservation department, noted "proactive progress" in the past year as China strives to implement its duties as COP15 president via various channels and means to ensure the success of the upcoming gathering in Montreal. Making full use of opportunities created by international events, such as the recent COP27 UN climate change conference in Egypt, China has carried out communication and coordination with high-level representatives from various countries. The efforts have "effectively boosted the global political momentum" for the meeting next month, he emphasized. China also hosted almost 40 meetings of the presidium of the Convention on Biological Diversity and participated in two conferences of the working group on the post-2020 biodiversity framework in the past year to discuss the framework, which have "laid the critical foundation for reaching the final framework", he continued. Zhou Guomei, head of the ministry's department of international cooperation, said parties have reached a consensus that the three goals included in the convention should be implemented in a full and balanced manner, instead of overemphasizing certain parts of them. Having come into effect in 1993, the convention includes three objectives  the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. Zhou confessed, however, the negotiations of the 196 parties over the post-2020 biodiversity framework have not been smooth all the way and there are still divergences on some specific topics. More communication is needed on how to balance the three goals and inscribe them into the framework, she said. She also highlighted resource mobilization and financial support for developing nations as a key part and a sticking point in negotiations. Despite remaining difficulties and divergences in the negotiations, many parties have extended their firm political support and confidence in the negotiation process and in China's presidency, she said. "We are fully confident" that the international community will echo the theme of COP15 and demonstrate its wisdom and encouragement to address these difficulties and divergences, she stressed. She vowed consistent, all-out efforts from China to promote the negotiation process. China will endeavor to build the broadest possible consensus to promote the reaching of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and ensure that the second phase of COP15 will be "completely successful "as it was in the first phase, she said.

by Mahmoud Fouly CAIRO, Oct. 20 (Xinhua) -- On the well-known Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo, over 20 orange-colored bicycles were lined up at a docking station for public sharing as the first bike-sharing project was inaugurated in the Egyptian capital on Thursday. The Cairo Bike project was launched by Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, accompanied by Cairo Governor Khaled Abdel-Aal. The first phase of the project includes 250 GPS-tracked bicycles in 26 solar-powered docking stations, while the total two-phase project will finally include a fleet of 500 bicycles in 45 stations across Cairo. Local residents were excited to experience riding a bike in the crowded capital as each of them can enjoy the first ride for free during the first phase. Ahmed Mahmoud, a local resident, described the experience as "amazing." "I have a car but when I go downtown, I take the underground metro. Now there are bike docking stations near metro stations, so I can use the metro to reach downtown and then ride a bike to go around and return it to the nearest docking station," Mahmoud said. Rania Sameh, an engineering student and one of the Cairo Bike team members, was among a group of people who rode bicycles together during the inauguration event. "This bike-sharing system helps people reduce their dependency on cars. Along with public means of transport, these bicycles can be an eco-friendly alternative to cars," she told Xinhua. A resident can hire a bicycle for 1 Egyptian pound (about 0.05 U.S. dollars) per hour or 8 pounds per day through a mobile application or a prepaid card, with a discount for students. The bike docking stations are installed near metro and bus stations, main squares, and public places to make it easy for citizens to find the nearest one before and after their bike trips. The main stations will host 28 bicycles while smaller ones will have 8-10 bicycles. There are also new bike lanes created in several main streets of downtown Cairo to make bike riding safe. Ahmed Arafa, a supervisor of the Cairo Bike project, explained that anyone who seeks to hire a bike should first install Cairo Bike app, register and add their Visa card or get a prepaid card from the Cairo Bike head office in downtown. "It's a good project, mainly targeting young people, but we found that many Egyptians of all ages are interested in our bike sharing," Arafa told Xinhua. The Cairo Bike project comes a couple of weeks ahead of Egypt's hosting of the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh in November. "Cairo Governorate is working hard to keep pace with modern developments and provide everything that would support the integration of environmentally-friendly transportation and facilitate healthy practices," Abdel-Aal was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Cairo Governorate. The project, launched by the Cairo Governorate in cooperation with the UN Human Settlements Program (UN-Habitat), is funded by Switzerland's Drosos Foundation and technically supported and supervised by the New York-based Institute for Transportation and Development Policy.

Despite efforts to mitigate biodiversity losses, the extinction of species around the globe is accelerating at unprecedented rates, climate experts have warned ahead of the largest global gathering of environmental ministers on biodiversity. "The biggest challenge to biodiversity, of course, is climate change, and in the ocean, its evil twin, ocean acidification," Robin Craig, an environmental law professor at the University of Southern California, told China Daily. The second part of COP15, or the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, or CBD, will be held in Montreal, Canada, from Wednesday to Dec 19. China is the president of COP15, and China's Minister of Ecology and Environment Huang Runqiu will preside over the talks at the conference, held under the theme "Ecological Civilization  Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth". The conference will see the adoption of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, which outlines what countries would need to do in the next decade or beyond to achieve the CBD's overall vision of "living in harmony with nature" by 2050. However, various factors have prevented the targets from being met. Problems such as pollution, agricultural expansion, unsustainable hunting, the illegal wildlife trade and climate change are causing a fast decline in the natural ecosystem worldwide. Oceans absorb human emissions of carbon dioxide. But as the level of CO2 in the atmosphere increases, the oceans absorb more CO2 and subsequently become more acidic, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Ocean acidification could threaten sea life and alter human health, according to the agency. In 2019, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, or IPBES, an equivalent to the UN panel on climate change, warned that humanity has severely altered three-quarters of the planet's land surface, and 1 million species are threatened with extinction. The report also noted that past and ongoing declines in biodiversity will undermine countries' prospects of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, which all UN member states have pledged to meet by 2030. Teamwork urged Watson highlighted the need for government departments around the world to work together, noting that the loss of biodiversity is not only an environmental issue but also affects economic development and security. COP27 , the UN's Climate Change Conference held in Egypt. Although climate change is getting more attention from global leaders, there is an increasing need for integrated solutions between the two issues, experts said. It's imperative to get climate change under control and limit the total increase in global average temperatures to as low as possible, "for biodiversity's sake in addition to humans' own self-interest", she said. "National and international protected areas  especially protected areas that limit human intrusion  give other species places to be," Craig said.

UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- It is time for humanity to chart a new path of living in harmony with nature, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday, urging the international community to match commitments with actions. The UN chief made the remarks in a video message to a high-level thematic debate of the General Assembly entitled "Moment for Nature". With nature and its benefits deteriorating worldwide, "we face a triple crisis of climate disruption, biodiversity loss and pollution," said Guterres. One million species of plants and animals are threatened with extinction, threatening the livelihood of millions. Three-quarters of the land and two-thirds of the ocean are adversely impacted by human activity. Some 3.2 billion people are affected by land degradation, he said. "Since human activities are at the root of this planetary emergency, that means we also hold the key to the solutions," he said. "Now is the time to transform our relationship with nature and chart a new path." Key milestones lie ahead this year "where we can and must deliver," Guterres said, referring to the COP 27 climate conference and second phase of the COP 15 biodiversity conference, scheduled to be held later this year in Egypt and Canada respectively. He urged the international community to make commitments and reach bold, global consensus at the conferences, with aims of cutting emissions, tackling key drivers of biodiversity loss and closing the finance gap. He also cautioned against empty promises, noting that "we need to match commitments with credible and verifiable actions and the finance for implementation." "Together, we can and must steer humanity to the path of living in harmony with the planet," he said. Enditem \</doc>

With an end-of-the-week deadline rushing at them faster than agreements are coming out of them, negotiators at the U.N. climate summit are in a difficult spot. Talks in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh got off to a plodding start and are behind the pace of previous meetings as government ministers return to Egypt to take over negotiations with three days left before the scheduled close tomorrow. "I think we still have a long way to go. But I'm I remain hopeful that we can come to good conclusions," European Union's top climate official, Frans Timmermans, said yesterday. A small thaw in relations between the United States and China at the Group of 20 meeting in Bali has boosted hopes that the world's top two polluters can help get a deal over the line in Egypt. Coming into this year's annual U.N. climate conference, known as COP27 , the host Egypt had declared the overarching drive would be to implement past promises, including firming up cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to meet the 2015 Paris accord's headline goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Instead, delegates have been haggling over whether to even restate the 1.5 degree goal. That objective got a boost when the G-20 meeting in Bali ended with a statement that endorsed the 1.5 degree target and made 49 references to climate. Officials from developing nations, meanwhile, are pushing for rich countries to make good on pledges of further financial aid for those struggling to cope with global warming. One significant aspect of that could be payments for "loss and damage" resulting from climate change, which developed countries have long resisted for fear of being held financially liable for the carbon dioxide they've pumped into the atmosphere for decades. But there has been a softening of positions among some rich nations that now acknowledge some form of payment will be needed, just not what. "Countries that are particularly affected, who themselves bear no blame for the CO2 emissions of industrial nations such as Germany, rightly expect protection against loss and damage from climate change," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said as she departed for Egypt. She acknowledged that negotiators have "a difficult path" ahead of them for a substantial agreement. Asked about the issue of loss and damage, EU Executive Vice-President Timmermans said: "We're all willing to find some substantial steps forward, but we're not there yet." The middle of the second weeks of climate summits in general are "a deep valley of anxiety," said Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief who was at more than 20 summits but not the one in Egypt. She said that's because there is such a big desire for something to come out of talks, but "it's also the moment in which people begin to be much more aware of the short time horizon that is left to be able to deliver something by Friday." Geopolitical tensions have been reflected at this year's talks, with European Union delegates walking out of a speech Tuesday by Russia's special climate representative, and a small group of Ukrainian and Polish activists briefly disrupting a Russian side event. Brazilian President-elect Luiz In\'e1cio Lula da Silva received a more enthusiastic welcome at the talks in Egypt. He met late Tuesday with Kerry and was due to hold talks with other top leaders, despite not yet being in office. Brazil's efforts on climate change are seen as vital because its Amazon rainforest territory provides a vast "carbon sink" to the world where emissions can be stored, whereas deforestation would fuel global warming.

Bloomberg The Chinese economy remains a massive opportunity for Western companies, and a recent easing of US-China tension offers tailwinds for the global economy, said Axel Weber, former UBS Group AG chairman. "What we saw in the G20 meetings recently has taken some of my biggest fears away that we would see a continued escalation of the conflict between China and the US," Weber said in a Bloomberg Television interview on the sidelines of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum on Wednesday. "You cannot run the global economy without China and it's good that the US and China are trying to work together more," said Weber. CGTN The most significant feature of the meeting in Bali between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is that the meeting took place. The outcomes of the meeting were less important than the meeting itself  the first face-to-face meeting between leaders of these countries in nearly three years. The meeting is like the first icy drops of liquid water in spring, and does signal the potential for warmer times to follow. COUNCIL on FOREIGN RELATIONS The (Biden-Xi) meeting will not place US-China relations on a new trajectory or produce consensus on thorny issues that have been at the heart of the relationship for decades. It could, however, lead to a shared understanding on the need to establish guardrails to ensure that the increasingly severe competition between the United States and China does not lead to outright conflict. While that would seem to be a modest outcome, it would be a positive development for a relationship that has steadily deteriorated. THE STRAITS TIMES Frictionless relations between China and the United States are probably not possible, but that should not necessarily lead to the division of the world economy into two disengaged camps, said Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Speaking at the 2022 Bloomberg New Economy Forum at the Capella Singapore on Tuesday, he added: "Imagine a world where China and the US are decoupled in trade, in investments, data, payments, financial systems, intellectual property creation. That would be a profoundly dangerous world." "A multipolar world was never going to be frictionless. But it is much safer than a world that is decoupled," he said. REUTERS The G20 economies agreed in their declaration to pace interest rate rises carefully to avoid spillovers and warned of "increased volatility" in currency moves, a sea change from last year's focus on mending the scars of the COVID-19 pandemic. G20 leaders agreed to pursue efforts to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius  confirming they stand by the temperature goal from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. That could boost negotiations at the UN COP27 climate summit in Egypt, where some negotiators feared the G20 would fail to back the 1.5C goal-potentially thwarting a deal on it among the nearly 200 countries at the UN talks. The Jakarta Post The tasks of the Indonesian presidency of the G20 this year should have been the most challenging of all previous leaders' meetings. Nevertheless, similar to the G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration in October 2021, almost 50 percent of the 52 points of the 16-page G20 Bali Leaders' Declaration still addresses the ongoing problems in the economy and such sectors as fair, multilateral trade, energy and food security, financial structure and stability, international taxation and investment, digital economy, debt restructuring, etc. All the policy recommendations are aimed to support the theme "Recover Together, Recover Stronger," which Indonesia assigned to its presidency this year. \~ \</doc>

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-10 08:17 Questions have been raised over the political judgment of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak after he suffered the first resignation from his government less than a month after taking office. Gavin Williamson, who was appointed minister without portfolio in the Cabinet just two weeks ago, was forced to step down following a string of bullying allegations, many of which emerged days before the start of the national Anti-Bullying Week initiative. The story began when The Sunday Times newspaper published expletive-filled texts that Williamson sent to then-Conservative Party chief whip Wendy Morton about the allocation of places at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, alleging preferential treatment had been given to members of Parliament who were close to then-prime minister Liz Truss. These were followed by a senior civil servant telling The Guardian of intimidating and aggressive language Williamson had used toward staff members when he was defense secretary, and then another Conservative MP, Anne Milton, came forward with more allegations of threatening behavior when Williamson had been the party's chief whip. When faced with the latest claims against Williamson, Sunak said the language used was "not acceptable", but on Monday his office said he had full confidence in him. On Tuesday, following Sunak's return from COP 27 in Egypt, the pair had face-to-face discussions and Williamson's resignation soon followed. In his formal letter of resignation, Williamson said: "I recognize these (allegations) are becoming a distraction for the good work this government is doing. I have therefore decided to step back from government so that I can comply fully with the complaints process that is underway and clear my name of any wrongdoing." Sunak replied and said he accepted it with "great sadness". "I support your decision to step back and understand why you have taken it. I would like to thank you for your personal support and loyalty," Sunak said. The opposition Labour Party's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy told the BBC that Williamson's behavior was "repellent, odious and unacceptable". "We really should have an account of why he came back into government," Lammy said. HYPERLINK mailto:julian@mail.chinadailyuk.com julian@mail.chinadailyuk.com \</doc>

ADDIS ABABA, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Vera Songwe, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), has called for urgent and increased funding to mitigate impacts of climate change in Africa. "Urgent development funds need to flow to Africa for climate change adaptation and resilience-building across the continent," Songwe told a climate-themed event held under the theme "Toward COP 27 : African Regional Forum on Climate Initiatives to Finance Climate Action and the SDGs" on Tuesday in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. Noting that Africa emits the lowest amount of greenhouse gases, Songwe called for a transparent and fair carbon pricing mechanism so that Africa would be able to receive about 180 billion U.S. dollars a year to mitigate the effects of climate change. The UNECA chief urged African countries to build food self-sufficiency by making use of their fertile lands and boosting their capacity for production of fertilizers in the continent. She said at least 23 African countries have seen their currencies depreciate by over 15 percent owing to the recent disruption of food supply to the continent. "The Ukraine crisis highly affects Africa's capacity to be able to afford the already escalating food, fuel and fertilizer prices," Songwe said, noting that the continent is highly dependent on food imports from Russia and Ukraine. Songwe urged countries in the continent, especially South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia, to enhance their agricultural productivity by making use of their fertile lands and fertilizers produced in other parts of the continent. "Africa exports more volume of fertilizer than it consumes," she said, urging countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Nigeria, Tanzania to produce high quality and cleaner fertilizer to meet demands in the continent. "On average, in Africa, we use about 15 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, compared to about 171 kilograms in Ukraine and Russia. That is why we are importing food from them," Songwe said.

The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, on Monday called the safety of a shelled nuclear power plant in Ukraine a top priority as the nuclear watchdog's 175 member states gathered for talks in Vienna this week. Director-General Rafael Grossi was referring to the Zaporizhzhia power plant where fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops has caused grave concerns about a possible nuclear disaster. "We must make everything in our power to prevent a nuclear accident that would add tragedy to the suffering," Grossi said in his opening remarks to the 66th IAEA General Conference, which will end on Friday. "If something happens there, we will not have a natural catastrophe to blame for. We will just have our own inaction because we knew what needed to be done. And there is a plan on the table to do it." Grossi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba separately in New York last week on the sidelines of the 77th UN General Assembly in an effort to have a safety and security zone established around the Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. "This is possible. This must be done. And I am ready to continue this consultation in both countries this week," Grossi said. Grossi also noted that he was meeting with the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran on Monday about the stalemate in reviving the nuclear deal that Iran struck with world powers, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. "We need to find common solutions for problems that are not going to go away if we don't solve them in a collaborative fashion," he said. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Saturday that the US had sent Iran a message "in recent days" expressing its resolve to reach a deal in good faith, the London-based Iran International news site reported. "We told them to realistically translate their words into action so that we can reach a deal," he said, referring to the JCPOA. "It's now the American side that must have the courage to take a decision in order for us to talk about striking a good, strong, and durable agreement," he said. In May 2018, the then US president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the JCPOA, an agreement reached in July 2015 by Iran, the US, China, Russia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the EU. Grossi on Monday warned that the world is facing a combination of challenges from a conflict in Europe and an energy crisis to climate change and a food crisis. He promised that the IAEA will help countries that want to benefit from the clean source of nuclear energy in dealing with the energy crisis and fighting climate change. There are now 438 nuclear reactors in operation in 32 countries, plus 57 under construction, according to the IAEA. "The agency is going to build the capacity that you need and you deserve," he told the representatives of developing countries that are looking to use civilian nuclear energy technology. But he added that they must strictly abide by the nonproliferation rules. He promises a continued debate on nuclear energy, including at the upcoming COP27 , the UN Climate Change Conference, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in November.

The recent floods in various countries, the drying up of rivers and lakes, the wildfires, droughts and frequent and drastic weather changes around the world all call for greater climate action. China has been at the forefront of the global campaign for more effective climate governance and has remained steadfast in its resolve to foster concerted efforts to secure a sustainable future for all peoples. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed China's commitment to sustainable global development at the United Nations General Assembly in September. He stressed that the country is taking resolute actions to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and is playing a significant role in helping to implement international protocols and conventions to address climate change. Despite being the world's second-largest and fastest-growing economy, the latest data and global studies show that from the greening of the Belt and Road Initiative to the call of the Global Development Initiative to uphold the principle of harmony between man and nature, China has made the conservation of nature a focus of global development. Regardless of any other country's actions or policies, the Chinese leadership prioritizes this issue as a critical component of its national, regional and international policies. President Xi Jinping has on numerous occasions highlighted the steps and actions China has taken as a responsible country to address the global climate change challenges. As Xi said at the virtual Leaders Summit on Climate hosted by US President Joe Biden in April last year, China "adheres to a path that puts ecological conservation first while pursuing green and low-carbon growth" and is doing its best to help developing countries build capacity against climate change through various forms of results-oriented South-South cooperation. Fully cognizant of the impacts of global climate change and therefore the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions, China is working tirelessly to reduce its own carbon emissions and increase the proportion of renewable energy in its energy mix. The targets set by the government are based on two policy road maps  the Working Guidance for Carbon Dioxide Peaking and Carbon Neutrality, and the Action Plan for Carbon Dioxide Peaking Before 2030. But aside from these, China's 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development (2021-25) also has nonfossil fuel energy-related targets. Efforts at the national level further translate to the international level, where from remote sensing satellites for climate monitoring in Africa to low-carbon demonstration zones in Southeast Asia and energy-efficient lights in small island countries, climate cooperation is yielding tangible results. Through research and development programs and the effective use of the latest technology, China is also promoting climate action cooperation under the umbrella of its BRI, applying scientific ways for participating countries to reduce their carbon footprints. The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP27 With the threats from the impacts of global climate change becoming more acute, it is important that countries do their utmost to respond to President Xi's call for joint actions to build "a community of life for mankind and nature" in order to jointly cope with the challenges. \~ The writer is founder of the Friends of BRI Forum.

In 2009, in the Copenhagen Accord, the developed countries made a commitment to allocate $100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries address the impacts of climate change. That promise was rooted in the fact that they have historically been the largest greenhouse gas emitters, and it is a key part of the Paris Agreement, which is a legally binding international treaty. Yet it is a commitment that has not been met. According to fresh analysis by UK-based agency Carbon Brief, the United States, which is responsible for 52 percent of the historical emissions added to the atmosphere by the developed countries, should be paying $39.9 billion of the pledged $100 billion climate-finance. But it had only paid $7.6 billion in 2020, the most recent year for which data is available. And, in terms of real money, even less has been forthcoming, with most of the shortfalled financial assistance provided being in the form of loans. Of course, securing billions of dollars in international climate aid for developing countries through budget appropriations is a losing battle in the US Congress. The just-concluded midterm elections show just how deeply divided the world's only superpower is and how the two sides differ with each other on all issues, including climate policies. Which is why the Joe Biden administration is looking at other ways to raise the money. On Wednesday, speaking at the COP 27 in Egypt, US climate envoy John Kerry unveiled a proposed carbon credit program aimed at mobilizing private capital to help the US shoulder its part of this obligation. Announcing the snappily dubbed Energy Transition Accelerator in partnership with the Bezos Earth Fund and the Rockefeller Foundation, Kerry said that the goal is to "have this up and running no later than COP 28", which will be held in Dubai next year. But the plan immediately met with criticism that the commitments made by governments should not be replaced by private offsetting and that the program will facilitate greenwashing. As German State Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development Jochen Flasbarth said, the practice of trading credits "can do wonderful work" in moving money where it is needed to cut emissions - especially for industries with very difficult technological barriers. But he said that such efforts and the US proposal "are different galaxies". In other words, although it sounds like a plan, it probably isn't. The Energy Transition Accelerator may have been presented in all seriousness and in good faith, but as a practical means to help the US honor its climate obligations it's likely to be nothing more than a damp squib.

By JULIAN SHEA in London | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-09 07:07 'Confidence' on tackling migrant flows follows meeting with France's Macron Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France's President Emmanuel Macron have had their first face-to-face talks, at the COP 27 climate summit in Egypt, as the two countries try to improve relations strained by the issue of people smuggling across the English Channel. During the summer Conservative Party leadership race, Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss infamously said "the jury was out" on whether France was a friend of the United Kingdom, and that she would judge Macron on "deeds not words", prompting much criticism. Macron replied that Britain was "a friendly, strong and allied nation, regardless of its leaders, and sometimes in spite of its leaders", and when Sunak replaced Truss in Downing Street, Macron was one of the first world leaders he spoke to. Since Britain left the European Union, the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats to arrive on its shores has risen dramatically, causing a political storm and also raising concerns about the health and safety of those attempting to cross, both on their way and also when they arrive. The Manston immigration center in Kent, in southern England, has been filled way over capacity, with reports of outbreaks of serious disease, and counterterrorism police say the firebombing of another migrant center, in the port town of Dover, "meets the threshold for a terrorist incident". Although Sunak did not come away with any firm agreements over the next course of action, he said he would "get a grip of this situation" and hoped to make a major announcement on progress before Christmas. Before boarding his flight home, Sunak said the talks had given him "renewed confidence and optimism" over the issue, despite the lack of a clear timetable for what to do next. "Working together with our European partners, we can make a difference, grip this challenge of illegal migration and stop people coming illegally," he told reporters. A statement issued by Macron's office backed up the optimistic tone, saying the pair had "agreed to remain in contact to advance coordination between their two countries in the face of the challenge of irregular migration". In addition to their immigration discussion, Sunak and Macron also pledged to pursue what has been called "ambitious cooperation" in the field of nuclear energy, to deal with the threat posed by reduced fuel supplies caused by the conflict in Ukraine. The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that this could result in French state-owned energy company EDF taking joint control of the proposed new Sizewell C plant in Suffolk, in the east of England.

By Chen Yingqun | China Daily | Updated: 2022-10-17 06:53 Upholding sustainability COFCO International has worked hard to promote the construction of storage, logistics, and transshipment facilities in major food production areas. Through the expansion of new storage facilities, the capacity of inland transshipment warehouses and supporting processing warehouses has been improved to a certain extent, and the capacity of food-sourcing, storage, and logistics in production areas has been enhanced. By the end of last year, COFCO International's global grain, oil and sugar processing facilities had an annual processing capacity of about 27 million tons and a storage capacity of about 2.3 million tons, and it had more than 30 million tons of products in port terminals. In stabilizing global supply chains and logistics, COFCO International holds sustainability as one of its core values, he said. "Not only do we have a team dedicated to the development and execution of our sustainability programs, but our leadership ensures that sustainability is woven into both our strategy and our operations to ensure we remain competitive," he said. "Each year, we train farmers in agricultural skills in key countries to enhance their capacity to develop sustainable agriculture, and we implement energy and water conservation and emission reduction measures to reduce our environmental impact and capture opportunities for improved operational efficiency." The company prioritizes the transition to green energy, with around 85 percent of its global energy needs currently being met through renewable sources. It also supports the United Nations Global Compact and its 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the most ambitious example being its efforts to halt agricultural commodity-driven deforestation in its soy supply chains, together with other global agribusinesses. In November last year, COFCO joined 12 of the world's largest agricultural enterprises at the United Nations COP26 conference in the United Kingdom, committing to a shared roadmap for enhanced supply chain action consistent with efforts to keep global temperatures from increasing beyond the 1.5 C mark. "We have already initiated a global climate change strategy that covers our entire footprint, and we are working together with industries to launch a collectively agreed roadmap aligned with global climate goals at COP27 in Egypt next month," Dong said. This journey started in 2017 and today involves a complex system, including remote sensing satellites to monitor major social and environmental risks. The system now covers all of its soy-producing regions in Brazil, and the company has since committed to achieving a deforestation and conversion-free soy supply chain across the Amazon, the Cerrado and the Gran Chaco, which are South America's most environmentally sensitive regions. COFCO International also operates a fleet of dry bulk carriers as part of commodity trading with maritime logistics and risk management around the world. It has around 200 vessels afloat at any given time and it monitors their greenhouse gas emissions and uses AI and other technology to make fuel, energy and efficiency savings in line with the shipping industry's ambitions to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. COFCO is also a member of the Sea Cargo Charter, and together with 16 global energy, agriculture, mining and trading companies, has pledged measures to reduce carbon emissions from maritime operations. "We remain steadfast in our commitment to feed the world responsibly and help transform the global food system," Dong said. "Over the past few years, we have leveraged our flexibility and innovation to build resilience and overcome disruption during uncertain times. And in everything we do, we prioritize the safety of our people and the continuity of our supply chains while accelerating the transformation of our food and agricultural system." \</doc>

AT Dameisha Community in Yantian District, the practice of building a near-zero carbon community has been used as a typical example of China\' s efforts in ecological conservation and protection at the sideline activities of the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) that concluded in Egypt last week. In August last year, Dameisha Community in Meisha Subdistrict was chosen as one of three communities in Shenzhen to pilot the near-zero emission program. A month before that, Vanke Foundation signed an agreement with the Yantian government to turn Dameisha Community into a demonstration area for carbon neutrality. At Vanke Center in Dameisha, headquarters of Vanke Co. Ltd., kitchen waste is handled unusually. Kitchen and canteen leftovers, after sorting, drying and grinding, are taken to a small 70-square-meter room nearby called the Black Soldier Fly Station, established by Vanke Foundation in 2019. At the station, the in-house black soldier fly larva are raised and deployed to feed on all the waste. The station can also handle up to 200 kilograms of kitchen wastes from three canteens at Vanke Center in 24 hours. A black soldier fly larvae can consume kitchen waste 200,000 times their weight in its 7-to-9-day growth. During its 25-day life cycle, it can produce antimicrobial agents  a good protein source for fish or animal feed. The larvae\' s excrement can also be used as fertilizer, which has been used for planting flowers at Vanke Center complex\' s rooftop garden. At Vanke Center\' s rooftop, the solar power system and rooftop garden can provide not only shelter for birds and insects, but also an area for farming and ecological education. The area has reduced its energy consumption via photovoltaic power generation and storage, application of energy-saving materials and intelligent power use technologies.  The micropower grid digital control system has been used in the first phase of Vanke Center\' s renovation project, which covers 16,000 square meters. The use of green electricity at the center has reached 85% of the total electric consumption, said Xie Xiaohui, executive vice director of the foundation. When the project\' s second phase is completed in 2023, the area aims to reach 100% use of green electricity. The practice of zero carbon emission community attracted wide participation in Dameisha Community. At the Yunding Tianhai housing compound, garbage classification practice by using intelligent garbage classification equipment has been a routine of households. According to Yu Kai from Meisha Subdistrict Office, the subdistrict has built zero waste full scenario applications in a pilot program at three-star hotels and 25 housing compounds. Using a community carbon management and monitoring platform, a pilot program for the Yantian branch of the Shenzhen Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau, as well as the city\' s power supply bureau, can learn about the time, behavior and electricity use habits of community residents with the help of new technologies such as big data and cloud algorithm. Based on the data, authorities can provide residents guidelines on how to optimize electricity use and practice low-carbon living. Coral reefs are important habitats for marine life and offer a compelling case of risks associated with climate change. In recent years, the size of coral reefs in Meisha area increased, thanks to the effort from the Yantian government and nongovernmental organizations devoted to coral reef farming. Recently, Yantian Ocean Ecology Protection and Service Center, headed by Yang Xuchong, an environmental protection volunteer, planted a total of 15,000 coral seedlings and cleared 7 tons of underwater trash.  We have coral groups, and they are thriving. It shows our marine ecology is turning better, Yang said. Meisha Subdistrict is rich with forest resources whose coverage has reached 69.9%. According to Zhang Yuke, a volunteer in river protection, the subdistrict is restoring the lake park\' s wetland, which covers around 33,000 square meters. After restoration, the complete ecological system will provide a habitat for endangered fish species. \</doc>

NAIROBI, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Community of nations must implement bold measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avert runaway climate emergencies including floods, droughts, heatwaves and cyclones, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said in a new report launched Thursday in Nairobi, Kenya's capital. The UNEP's 2022 Emissions Gap Report notes that progress towards meeting net-zero targets across the globe had stagnated, worsening the vulnerability of communities and ecosystems to adverse impacts of a heating planet. Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UNEP, said the 13th edition of Emissions Gap Report was categorical and that taming the unfolding climate crisis hinged on a radical transition to low-carbon lifestyles and economic development. "This report tells us in cold scientific terms what nature has been telling us, all year, through deadly floods, storms and raging fires: we have to stop filling our atmosphere with greenhouse gases and stop doing it fast," said Andersen. Launched ahead of the 27th Conference of Parties ( COP 27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Summit slated for Egypt from Nov. 6 to 18, the UNEP report decried lackluster commitment by nations to undertake radical carbon-cutting measures and forestall disasters linked to planetary warming. The Emissions Gap Report 2022 dubbed "The closing window-climate crisis calls for rapid transformation of societies" indicates that limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius as set out in the Paris climate accord could be a mirage, as nations fall short of their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. According to the report, carbon-cutting pledges by individual nations have been inadequate and slow to implement, pointing to a possible temperature rise of above 2.6 degrees centigrade by 2100. The report acknowledges that policy mismatch, impacts of COVID-19 pandemic, the unfolding food and fuel crisis alongside geopolitical tensions have undermined nations' capacity to implement ambitious carbon-cutting measures. To accelerate progress towards carbon neutrality, the report calls for a rapid overhaul of energy, transport, industrial and financial sectors to ensure they are less carbon-intensive. Anne Olhoff, the Chief Scientific Editor of the UNEP Emissions Gap Report said that attaining net-zero targets that deliver myriad benefits like clean air, green jobs and universal access to energy required harnessing cleaner technologies and radical policy and mindset shifts. "The good news is that we have all the technological solutions to get us on track to achieving the Paris Agreement goals in the shorter term and that we hopefully have enough time to develop new solutions for sectors that are difficult to decarbonize," Olhoff said.

SINGAPORE, Oct. 25 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced on Tuesday that the city-state raises its national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 as part of its Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy. He said at the Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) 2022 that Singapore will enhance its 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions by aiming to peak its emissions earlier and reduce its emissions to around 60 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030, which is 5 million tonnes less than the previous commitment of peaking the emissions in 2030 at 65 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. "This 5 million tonnes improvement is significant," Wong added. "It is equivalent to reducing our current transport emissions by two-thirds." He said that Singapore will submit the enhanced targets to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as parties to the Paris Agreement meet at COP 27 next month, in line with the Glasgow Climate Pact. To achieve net zero emissions, the Singaporean government will need to encourage businesses and individuals to be more energy efficient, reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions and adopt green energy alternatives, said Wong. He said that the government decided that a better approach is not to reduce or hold back the carbon taxes but to provide targeted relief to businesses and consumers so that it has the right price signals for the economy as a whole and the government will extend help to those who need it. Wong announced earlier this year that Singapore will raise the carbon tax from the current five Singapore dollars per tonne of CO2 equivalent to about 50-80 dollars by 2030. The carbon tax in Singapore is applied broadly, covering about 80 percent of its emissions today. Besides, Wong said at the SIEW that the Singaporean government will invest more in technologies to help decarbonize the economy. The deputy prime minister also announced at the SIEW the launch of Singapore's National Hydrogen Strategy which will provide a roadmap of how hydrogen can support Singapore's decarbonization efforts, and the steps Singapore will be taking to prepare Singapore for a hydrogen future. This is part of Singapore's international climate commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. "If technology continues to advance, we foresee that hydrogen can supply up to half of our power needs by 2050, alongside domestic renewable energy sources and electricity imports," Wong said. He disclosed that Singaporeans may start to have access to electricity generated from low-carbon hydrogen from 2027, as the country will kickstart its hydrogen efforts by issuing an Expression of Interest for a small-scale commercial project utilizing low-carbon ammonia for power generation. \</doc>

Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France's President Emmanuel Macron have had their first face-to-face talks, at the COP 27 climate summit in Egypt, as the two countries try to improve relations strained by the issue of people smuggling across the English Channel. During the summer Conservative Party leadership race, Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss infamously said "the jury was out" on whether France was a friend of the United Kingdom, and that she would judge Macron on "deeds not words", prompting much criticism. Macron replied that Britain was "a friendly, strong and allied nation, regardless of its leaders, and sometimes in spite of its leaders", and when Sunak replaced Truss in Downing Street, Macron was one of the first world leaders he spoke to. Since Britain left the European Union, the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats to arrive on its shores has risen dramatically, causing a political storm and also raising concerns about the health and safety of those attempting to cross, both on their way and also when they arrive. The Manston immigration center in Kent, in southern England, has been filled way over capacity, with reports of outbreaks of serious disease, and counterterrorism police say the firebombing of another migrant center, in the port town of Dover, "meets the threshold for a terrorist incident". Although Sunak did not come away with any firm agreements over the next course of action, he said he would "get a grip of this situation" and hoped to make a major announcement on progress before Christmas. Before boarding his flight home, Sunak said the talks had given him "renewed confidence and optimism" over the issue, despite the lack of a clear timetable for what to do next. "Working together with our European partners, we can make a difference, grip this challenge of illegal migration and stop people coming illegally," he told reporters. A statement issued by Macron's office backed up the optimistic tone, saying the pair had "agreed to remain in contact to advance coordination between their two countries in the face of the challenge of irregular migration". In addition to their immigration discussion, Sunak and Macron also pledged to pursue what has been called "ambitious cooperation" in the field of nuclear energy, to deal with the threat posed by reduced fuel supplies caused by the conflict in Ukraine. The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that this could result in French state-owned energy company EDF taking joint control of the proposed new Sizewell C plant in Suffolk, in the east of England.

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Climate change could be twice as deadly as cancer in some parts of the world if carbon emissions remain high, according to new data released on Friday by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the Climate Impact Lab. Using Dhaka, Bangladesh, as an example, according to the study, additional deaths from climate change would be nearly twice the country's current all-cancer death rate and 10 times its road traffic death rate by 2100. "Because of human action, the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is reaching dangerous levels, driving earth's temperatures higher and amplifying the frequency of intensity of extreme events," says the newly launched Human Climate Horizons platform, adding that without concerted and urgent action, climate change will further exacerbate inequalities, and uneven development. In addition to the analyses from the Human Development Reports of 2020, 2021, and 2022, the data shows how climate change impacts people's lives -- from mortality to livelihoods. Higher temperatures and a warmer climate stress cardiovascular and respiratory systems around the world, but the effects will differ depending on how well communities are equipped to adapt. According to the data, climate change could lead to nearly 67 deaths per 100,000 population in Faisalabad, Pakistan -- more deaths than strokes, the third leading cause of death. Despite higher incomes in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the death rate is still higher than Alzheimer's disease, which is the sixth leading cause of death worldwide. According to the research, the earth's average temperature has risen by nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, changing the entire planet's surface. Nevertheless, billions live in regions that have already experienced warmer temperatures than the global average. As an example, the platform points to Maracaibo, Venezuela, noting that in the 1990s it averaged 62 annual days with temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. However, by mid-century, that number will likely soar to 201 days. Electricity availability and fuels used to generate it to power air conditioners and heaters play a crucial role in our ability to cope with extreme temperatures, according to the UNDP. As individuals, communities, and businesses adapt to changing conditions, the effects of climate change on energy use will vary locally. In Jakarta, for example, electricity consumption in response to warmer temperatures is projected to increase by roughly one-third of current household consumption in Indonesia. This will require critical additional infrastructure planning. Increasingly frequent and severe temperature extremes also threaten livelihoods, affecting work intensity and duration as well as affecting the ability to perform tasks. "The impact of climate change differs across sectors of the economy with workers in high-risk, weather-exposed industries like agriculture, construction, mining and manufacturing most affected," according to platform data. In Niamey, Niger, in sectors such as construction, mining and manufacturing, excessive heat was responsible for 36 fewer working hours annually, taking a 2.5 percent toll on the country's future GDP. In Niger, as in many other parts of the Sahel, climate shocks have resulted in recurring droughts with devastating impacts on the region's already vulnerable populations. Climate change impacts are not evenly distributed globally, which will result in an increase in inequalities. The UNDP hopes that by highlighting that the future is not predetermined, people can step up climate action everywhere. Meanwhile, the UNDP has also launched the How Just Transition Can Deliver the Paris Agreement report this week, highlighting the need to embrace the "green revolution" -- or risk increasing social inequality, civil unrest, economic loss. Ahead of the UN climate conference, COP27 , which kicks off on Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the report spotlights the importance of "fair and equitable" transitioning to meeting the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement. From providing workers with new green economy skills and access to social protection to ensuring that countries lay out a clear pathway to a net-zero future, UNDP chief Achim Steiner said the report provides "real-world insights into how to accelerate momentum around a just transition that is fair and equitable for the energy sector and beyond."

CAIRO, Nov. 3 (Xinhua) -- With its towering skyscrapers rising from the desert, the Central Business District (CBD) of the new administrative capital of Egypt can be easily spotted miles away. Over the past four years, a Chinese building company has been striving to turn the CBD project into an example of green urban development. The project, at the heart of Egypt's ambitious plan to build a new modern city some 50 km east of the current capital of Cairo, is primarily contracted to the Egyptian branch of the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC Egypt). "As a key project of the Belt and Road Initiative, it is our responsibility to practice and promote the idea of green development. We hope that the CBD will serve as a model of green development under the initiative," Yuan Hao, design director of the CSCEC Egypt, told Xinhua. Since the start of the CBD construction in 2018, the CSCEC Egypt has brought China's standards for environmental protection to the project, with an aim to make it an exemplary case of green urban development. Yuan noted that eco-friendly concepts have been integrated into the project's urban planning, architectural design, as well as construction processes. From the beginning of planning, the CBD has been given an efficient public transportation system and pedestrian system, which encourages everyone to take public transportation or walk in order to achieve "green travel," Yuan explained. A regional energy station was set up to centrally cool CBD's high-rise buildings, while a thermal tank was also installed to reduce the peak load and improve the utilization rate of electric energy. "In terms of the architectural design, different kinds of concrete are used, which greatly reduces construction energy consumption and improves the thermal insulation performance of the building," Yuan said. The CBD project covers an area of about 505,000 square meters, with 20 commercial and residential skyscrapers as well as supporting municipal infrastructure, among which is the 385-meter-high Iconic Tower, the tallest building in Africa. The Chinese company also contributed its extensive experience in green construction to the CBD project, using aluminum molds rather than traditional wooden ones, said Yuan, who added that the new technology has greatly improved the recycling rate of building materials. A reclaimed water system was set up at the construction site to purify the sewage water and use it for on-site dust removal, irrigation, and vehicle cleaning, the Chinese engineer said. The CSCEC Egypt's green methodology is in accordance with the Egyptian side's "green development" idea in building the new administrative capital, said Yuan. He touted the CBD project as "a shining example of China-Egypt cooperation on green development," as the Arab country is to host the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP27 ) that starts on Nov. 6. "Benefiting from the rapid domestic development, we took the lead in exploring a set of green construction technologies suitable for developing countries that are more pragmatic and have been tested in practice," Yuan said. Mohammed Hamdy Salama, an Egyptian mechanical engineer with the CSCEC Egypt, said the company keeps seeking new ideas to save energy. "In our work on the CBD project, we use rock wool to improve the insulation; we also use the double glass facade for all towers. This enhances energy efficiency by reducing the cooling loads inside the buildings," he said. A thermal tank was also installed to help the chillers work constantly, in addition to using the Building Management System to control all the towers by turning off the lights and other electric equipment after the workers left, Salama said. The Egyptian engineer noted that China always seeks sustainable development by setting plans for five or 10 years, adding that this ideology is also followed by the CSCEC Egypt. "On personal level, I can see and learn the importance of this ideology, as well as how it affects every single step in the project and how it helps to achieve sustainability," Salama said.

Botched work. Illustration: Liu Rui/GT Talking in high profile while dragging the feet \- such contradictory actions are not sustainable when it comes to dealing with climate change. Only reasonable deeds can be pushed forward in a sustainable way, and only countries with the ability to lead can set an example as "pioneers." Unfortunately, the West is losing such ability. According to a Guardian report on Wednesday, the UK will build its first new coal mine in three decades at Whitehaven in Cumbria, northwest England. The new mine will take two years to build and will produce an estimated 2.8 tons of coking coal a year, which is used in the production of steel. Burning a pound of coal emits 2.07 pounds of carbon dioxide. The UK government seems to be forgetting about the climate commitments it has made in the past. At last year's COP26 Climate Change Conference in the UK's Glasgow, the UK set the goal of accelerating the phase-out of coal. In 2019, it committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in his speech at this year's COP27 last month that Britain is "morally right" to honor its climate change commitments. In June, the UK's climate change watchdog warned that the plan to build a coal mine in Cumbria is "absolutely indefensible" because the resulting pollution would blow holes through the nation's pledge to reduce emissions by 2050. In similar moves, France has rebooted a coal-fired power station to secure the country's electricity supply over the winter. A hard-coal-fired power plant in Germany is also back in operation due to the gas supply crisis. While in the US, the Supreme Court ruled in July to limit the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to restrict greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, a significant setback for climate action. Against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Western countries broke the energy supply-demand balance with Russia, not only dragging themselves into an energy crisis, but also pulling the whole world to bear the consequences. When these old-brand capitalist countries put their narrow interests above their countries' long-term interests and the common interests of humanity, this overshadows the efforts in coping with climate change by the world, especially developing countries. Climate change is one of the most important agendas facing humanity. It requires the cooperation of all countries and should transcend geopolitics. But the experiences in the past decades show that in Western countries, climate change actions are subject to their foreign political and economic objectives. This means the West will only talk high but act low and be strict with others while loose with itself \- this is what hypocrisy entails. For a long time, Western countries have used climate change and carbon emissions as political tools. Behind the climate agenda is a set of geopolitical tools crafted by Western countries to suppress developing countries. They label themselves as a "pioneer" in coping with climate change, while using climate change as an excuse to block the development of developing countries so that they can continue to enjoy the benefits they once exploited, be bossy as always, and retain their discourse power and dominant position in the international system. The West has not paid back historical debts, and now it is owing more.\~ Shen Yi, a professor from Fudan University, told the Global Times that Western countries took the lead in completing industrialization while emitting carbon dioxide recklessly, and they have an obligation to help developing countries reduce carbon emissions. However, Western countries not only transferred their industries to developing countries to enjoy the high-quality and cheap products from developing countries, but at the same time required developing countries to pay for carbon emissions. This is sacrificing some people's interests to realize others' governance model. For the West, emission reduction is not a rigid task, and it is just normal to sacrifice long-term goals for current political objectives. Xu Liang, an associate professor at the School of International Relations of Beijing International Studies University, believes that Western countries such as the UK should explain and apologize to the international community, because they delay the global process of tackling climate change. But the question is, do these countries have the will to bear international responsibilities? For them, international responsibility is just a false proposition. \</doc>

He said China is significant, open and inclusive in promoting the UN 2030 agenda.\~ In January 2022, the Group of Friends of the GDI was launched at the UN, and more than 50 countries have joined the group so far. Egyptian Ambassador to China Mohamed Elbadri told the Global Times that Egypt is among the friends of the GDI at the UN, and is looking forward to working with other friends in pushing forward the initiative.\~ Elbadri said he hopes a synergy could be established between GDI and the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the UNFCCC, in Egypt in November, as COP 27 is an integral part of the sustainable development. Several foreign representatives said China has played a responsible leading role in addressing many acute challenges facing the world, such as global poverty, food security and public health.\~\~ Pierre Kr\'e4henb\'fchl, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross's Regional Delegation for East Asia, told the Global Times that China has shown leadership in the COVID-19 response, and the ICRC will work with China on the equitable distribution of vaccines, among other health issues.\~\~ He listed China's contribution in Afghanistan, where China built two hospitals and the ICRC benefited from Chinese perspectives and Chinese experiences.\~ The report said the GDI is being translated from concept to reality, with concrete results from cooperation projects in the eight priority areas. For example, in February, the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Center was inaugurated to support relevant countries in enhancing their capacity to cope with climate change and carry out relevant studies.\~ \</doc>

In January 2022, the Group of Friends of the GDI was launched at the UN, and more than 50 countries have joined the group so far. Egyptian Ambassador to China Mohamed Elbadri told the Global Times that Egypt is among the friends of the GDI at the UN, and is looking forward to working with other friends in pushing forward the initiative. Elbadri said he hopes a synergy could be established between GDI and the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the UNFCCC, in Egypt in November, as COP 27 is an integral part of the sustainable development. Several foreign representatives said China has played a responsible leading role in addressing many acute challenges facing the world, such as global poverty, food security and public health. Pierre Kr henb\'fchl, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross's Regional Delegation for East Asia, told the Global Times that China has shown leadership in the COVID-19 response, and the ICRC will work with China on the equitable distribution of vaccines, among other health issues. He listed China's contribution in Afghanistan, where China built two hospitals and the ICRC benefited from Chinese perspectives and Chinese experiences. The report said the GDI is being translated from concept to reality, with concrete results from cooperation projects in the eight priority areas. For example, in February, the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Center was inaugurated to support relevant countries in enhancing their capacity to cope with climate change and carry out relevant studies. \</doc>

The leaders of the world's 20 most climate polluting countries meet in Bali, Indonesia, for the 17th annual G20 summit on Nov 15-16.The Indonesian presidency has set the theme as "recovery," focusing on three major global disrupters  health, the digital economy and the energy transition. Climate change comes under the third pillar and will be on the agenda throughout. Priorities center on support for the United Nation's 27th climate conference ( COP 27 ), happening the same week as the G20; mobilizing climate finance flows from high-income to middle  and low  income countries and small island developing states; clean energy technology to facilitate the energy transition; and climate-resilient engineered and natural infrastructure, including mangroves, catalyzed through public-private partnerships. From civil society, the Business 20 official engagement group is spotlighted at the summit, putting a strong focus on business and private sector involvement in implementing governments' net-zero pledges. But, if the past is prelude to the present, the G20's historical climate performance suggests the leaders will again fall far short of agreement on the climate actions that are badly needed. The first G20 meeting, in 2008 in Washington DC, was held in response to the US-created global financial crisis that inflicted severe economic and social costs on millions of people in the United States and around the world. The G20 leaders at the time soon mobilized at least $6 trillion in new money and in monetary and fiscal policy stimulus over a period of just two years to lift the world out of the crisis. But for the climate crisis they have spent considerably less. Compliance has been lower too. The G20 Research Group monitors G20 members' compliance with the politically binding and collective commitments they make at their annual summits. The Group assigns a score of +1 for full compliance, 0 for a work in progress or a  1 for a lack of compliance to each G20 member on a range of key commitments in the year after the annual summits ends. Averaging these scores and converting them into the popular scale, the G20 Research Group finds that the G20's compliance is much higher with its commitments on macroeconomic growth than on climate change. The G20's compliance with its macroeconomic growth commitments, including economic recovery and global financial stability, averages 80 percent. Yet compliance with its climate commitments is only 67 percent, with the fulfillment of their climate finance commitments 68 percent. Adding the key energy transition commitment  to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies  sees compliance drop to a mere 61 percent. Moreover, since 2020 the G20 members have committed more money to fossil fuels than to green energy in their COVID-19 recovery packages, and since the G20 institution was created in 2008, its emissions have risen. In recent years, compliance has leveled off to stay in the 60 to 70 percent range  64 percent in 2017,71 percent in 2018, 68 percent in 2019, 74 percent in 2020 and 65 percent in 2021. The highest compliance from 2021, as reported in the G20 Research Group's Final 2021 Rome Summit Compliance Report, was with the commitment on working to balance financial resource allocation between mitigation and adaptation with 93 percent and the commitment to strengthen efforts to implement the key pillars of the Paris Agreement of mitigation, adaptation and finance with 85 percent. The lowest compliance came on the commitment on climate finance for developing countries with 50 percent and ending financing for unabated coal projects abroad with just 33 percent. G20 members' compliance with its climate commitments is higher in years where there is a leaders-level UN climate summit. With the climate commitments made at the G20's 2009 Pittsburgh Summit, members' compliance was 93 percent, the same year of the UN Copenhagen climate summit. And with the climate commitments made at the G20's 2015 Antalya Summit, members' compliance was 85 percent, the same year as the UN Paris climate summit. This suggests that the 2022 Bali Summit will have higher compliance too, with world leaders also convening at the COP 27 . The second step is to avoid green-washing and leave nature alone. The Indonesian presidency is highlighting green infrastructure for disaster risk resilience by showcasing its impressive coastal mangroves  an important species for mitigating against sea-level rise, water-related disasters, and carbon sequestration. Financing is expected for such climate-resilient infrastructure from public-private partnerships and a repackaged G7 infrastructure initiative. Planting new mangroves and trees is a much needed initiative. But for effective implementation, the G20 must also avoid the business-as-usual approach of deforestation for development in one location and offsetting it by planting in another place. It should adopt an avoid-first approach and let nature regrow, while prioritizing indigenous and local communities' lead in land and forest management. Doing these two things requires a paradigm shift at the G20, whose values of promoting unlimited production and consumption are at odds with the now imperiled planetary boundaries. But it is more likely that reiterations of past commitments will be made at the G20 summit. And while new additions, such as a greater spotlight on climate-resilient infrastructure and a relatively greater willingness to discuss loss and damage, are broadly positive and welcome, the G20 will stop short of committing to the radical systemic changes required for a just transition. Indonesia is a middle-income country and a Pacific island nation highly vulnerable to natural disasters, such as typhoons and sea-level rise, made exponentially more dangerous and deadly by the combination of burning fossil fuels and deforestation/nature degradation. It thus has a significant interest in adaptation and in receiving financial aid to achieve its climate targets. Yet with global and regional geopolitical tensions affecting energy security, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and rising inflation reducing food security, coupled with the G20 countries' adherence to values at odds with the laws of nature, will prevent the G20 from taking strong and ambitious climate action. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202211/16/63741210a31009d72a2f5263.png Link to Image LI MIN/CHINA DAILY \~ \~ The author is the director of compliance and lead researcher on climate change for the G20 Research Group based at the University of Toronto.

CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The amount of electricity generated from renewable energy in Egypt increased from 8.7 billion kWh in 2019/2020 to 10.2 billion kWh in 2020/2021, marking a year-on-year increase of 17.2 percent, Egypt's official statistics agency said on Saturday. "Egypt has the largest wind and solar energy capacity in the Middle East and North Africa," according to a report issued by the country's Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) on the eve of the World Environment Day, which is marked by the United Nations on June 5 every year. The number of natural gas-powered cars in Egypt increased by 20.6 percent from 42,292 cars in 2019/2020 to 51,000 cars in 2020/2021, according to the report. Egypt is heading toward a higher usage of renewable energy as part of its Egypt Vision 2030 agenda. Over the past few years, Egypt has been building the Benban Solar Energy Park in the southern province of Aswan, which is one of the world's largest solar plants. Egypt will also host the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference later this year in Sharm el-Sheikh, a Red Sea resort city. Enditem \</doc>

By PRIME SARMIENTO in Bali, Indonesia, WANG XU in Tokyo,WANG XU and CHEN WEIHUA in Brussels | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-17 07:18 Concepts of inclusive growth, common development receive positive reaction President Xi Jinping's emphasis on more inclusive growth and common development for a community with a shared future for mankind resonates with the needs of all people in the world in addressing today's global challenges, according to analysts. Xi's speech, delivered in the same week the global population reached 8 billion people, laid out a vision for the world as a community of collective destiny, said Gal Luft, co-director of the United States-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security. "It transcended political and regional divisions and stayed above the flashpoints and crises du jour," he said. "In this, it is an evergreen speech which could be given years from now with a similar degree of relevancy as today's." Luft noted that Xi was not in favor of those building "a small yard with high fences" to protect themselves and advocated instead a tide-lifts-all-boats approach to global development. "Needless to say which approach resonated more with the multiple Global South representatives present in the room," he said. Airlangga Hartarto, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, appreciated Xi's proposals on digital economy among others. Xi said China has proposed G20 Action on Digital Innovation and Cooperation, and called for narrowing the digital gap. The digitalization is in line with Indonesia's focus on digital transformation for stronger recovery, he said at a news briefing. He said that it is also in line with Indonesia's chairmanship of ASEAN in 2023, which will include an economic framework compatible with the digital plans of China. Irvan Tengku Harja, a researcher at the Indonesian think tank Prakasa, and a delegate to Civil 20 Indonesia 2022 in Bali, noted that three main points promoted by Xi could be cures for the world's major problems today. Xi said in his speech that all G20 members should take responsibility to make global development more inclusive, beneficial to all and more resilient. And countries should oppose attempts to politicize food and energy issues. To realize Xi's ideas "G20 members should pay more attention to low-income countries", Irvan said. Carlos Martinez, a British commentator and co-editor of Friends of Socialist China, said that it's noteworthy that the G20 Summit takes place at the same time as COP27 in Egypt, where developing countries are loudly raising their demands for climate justice. "In his G20 speech, Xi Jinping added his voice to those demands, reiterating the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities - a principle enshrined in international law," Martinez said. He said that China is already working with a large number of Global South countries on green development projects, including Zambia, South Africa, Kenya, Argentina and Cuba. "Indeed, the latest statistics reveal that while the US spends three times as much as China on its military, China has three times more renewable energy generation capacity than the US." Yosuke Tsuyuguchi, an economics professor at Teikyo University in Japan, said the Global Development Initiative proposed by Xi is in fact being realized gradually and its specific measures are worthy of high praise. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi, managing director for Asia at environmental group 350.org, agreed with Xi's conception that modernization is the right of every country. "But modernization means nothing on a dead planet. We need to transition to renewables now," she said, adding that just energy transition is something that world leaders know ought to happen. She noted that Xi made a strong pledge last year on China's phasing down coal. G20 countries should not backslide from the Paris Agreement pledge because of the current geopolitical tension, as for tackling the climate crisis, it is the survival of the human race that's at stake, she said. \</doc>

By XU WEI | China Daily | Updated: 2022-11-21 06:39 Xi's landmark six-day SE Asia journey expands partnerships, steadies ties Two multilateral meetings, close to 20 bilateral talks and a sit-down with United States President Joe Biden  President Xi Jinping's six-day trip to Southeast Asia has charted the way for global governance, expanded China's global partnerships and steadied ties between the world's two largest economies. Xi traveled to Bali, Indonesia, from Monday to Thursday for the G20 Summit before attending the 29th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bangkok and visiting Thailand  the first time he has attended the events in person in three years. Xi returned to China on Saturday evening. The back-to-back meetings held by Asian countries took place amid spillover from the Ukraine crisis, which fueled global financial, energy and food crises, with some countries advocating division, confrontation and decoupling. The world is again standing at a crossroads, and Asia has embraced a crucial moment in promoting global governance, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said after the conclusion of Xi's trip. Wang, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said Xi's proposals at the G20 Summit indicated that he has always kept the interests of developing nations in mind and maintained the outlook in his diplomatic activities that true development can only be attained with the common development of all countries. At the summit, Xi said Beijing supports the African Union in joining the G20. China's support for multilateralism and its contribution to G20 cooperation is also evidenced in the fact that the 15 projects and proposals put forward by Beijing were included in the list of projects for pragmatic cooperation at the summit. Bernard Dewit, chairman of the Brussels-based Belgian-Chinese Chamber of Commerce, said Xi's proposals at the APEC meetings were not only inspiring for the Asia-Pacific region but also for other countries around the world, especially in Europe. "At a moment when the COP 27 is closing, President Xi insists that his country will push further for green and low-carbon development .Every government in the world should approve of his words when he says protecting the ecological environment and tackling environmental changes is the common challenge facing all humanity." Raymund Chao, chairman for the Asia-Pacific region and China of professional services provider PwC, said Xi's written speech delivered to the APEC CEO Summit has boosted the confidence of business leaders in the Asia-Pacific region in responding to risks and turning crises into opportunities. "The president's proposal to make global development more inclusive, beneficial to all and more resilient is a reminder to everyone for joint development and cooperation. It will be of major significance for the early recovery and steady growth of the global economy," he said. Vasily Kashin, director of the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs at HSE University in Russia, said he thoroughly agreed with Xi's call to stay committed to openness and inclusiveness and bring prosperity for all in the Asia-Pacific region. Kashin said such a proposal is very important as it is aimed at realizing the mutual development of the region, not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, avoiding trade protectionism, and complying with ecological and environmental protection standards. "China is building a cooperative pattern of openness, which will boost the joint development of all countries in the region," he said. \</doc>

By JAN YUMUL in Hong Kong | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-10 09:37 Saudis' support comes as region's leaders reaffirm climate commitment Leaders from the Middle East and North Africa have reaffirmed their commitment to taking climate action, which involves doubling down on the reduction of emissions and a $2.5 billion pledge from Saudi Arabia in the years to come. This happened at the second edition of the Middle East Green Initiative Summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, held simultaneously with COP 27 on Monday. Saudi Arabian Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud led the summit, and announced the establishment of a dedicated MGI secretariat and the allocation of $2.5 billion to support MGI projects and governance, as well as to accelerate the implementation of initiatives to achieve the goals. "If we are to achieve the desired objectives of the ambitious Middle East Green Initiative, continued regional cooperation and active contributions by member countries are needed to achieve global climate goals and accelerate the implementation commitments as part of international agreements," Prince Mohammed said in his address at the MGI Summit. Two goals will guide the MGI climate action road map. The first focuses on emissions reduction and serves to support efforts across the region to reduce emissions equivalent to 670 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. While implementing the circular carbon economy approach, Saudi Arabia will deploy one of the largest carbon capture, usage and storage hubs in the world. Second goal In the second goal under the MGI, the planting of 50 billion trees across the region will be carried out to rehabilitate 200 million hectares of degraded land, with a goal to slash emissions by 2.5 percent of current global levels. The trees are expected to combat desertification, reduce dust storms and offer protection against the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of land degradation in the region. Saudi Arabia is spearheading regional cooperation to achieve the target, with the initial governance framework agreed by founding member countries during a ministerial meeting in Riyadh in October. The prince also announced that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund "will aim to reach net zero by 2050", the first sovereign wealth fund in the Middle East and one of the first globally to do so. In his speech, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi encouraged Arab countries to seize the opportunities for technical and financial collaboration presented by the initiative. He also praised the efforts by the prince in creating a collaborative environment for Arab nations to combat climate change, Arab News reported. "It is great news that we now speak about enablers, like finance, that support the implementation of this initiative," said Aisha Al-Sarihi, climate policy expert and research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute. The MGI Summit is the first strategic regional platform designed to accelerate the region's green transition, stimulate economic development and build a more sustainable future. \</doc>

China reaffirmed its resolution of achieving the goals of a CO2 emissions peak and carbon neutrality on Thursday, as the Ministry of Ecology and Environment noted achievements and progress that the country has made on building a "beautiful China" in the past decade. Minister Huang Runqiu told Thursday's press conference that "to achieve carbon-peaking and carbon-neutrality is to address outstanding problems of resource and environmental constraints and realize the sustainable development of the Chinese nation. Therefore, we are determined to achieve the goals." This is also a solemn commitment to build a community with a shared future for mankind, and China will make good on that promise, Huang said, reaffirming China's aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Even recent heat waves and drought in this country will not scupper those goals, said Huang. Over the past 10 years, "green" has increasingly become a clear backdrop for high-quality economic and social development, with China's carbon emissions intensity dropping by 34.4 percent, reversing the trend of rapid growth in carbon dioxide emissions, Huang noted at the meeting. The minister said that China also has steadily adjusted its energy structures, and constantly optimized and upgraded industrial structures. The share of coal in primary energy consumption dropped from 68.5 percent to 56 percent last year, and the share of non-fossil energy consumption increased by 6.9 percentage points to 16.6 percent. China's contributions in promoting global low-carbon development are obvious to all. China's effort in boosting the new-energy industry reflects the unshakable determination of the Chinese government in achieving its carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday. China is heading toward its goal on carbon neutrality steadily. This is in stark contrast with the attitudes of some European countries that have chosen to row back on their climate goals, having already returned or are planning to return to coal to generate electricity, after feeling the pinch from an energy crisis. Western countries' return to coal, in addition to rich countries' reluctance to take real actions to help poorer countries, will cast a large shadow on the upcoming 2022 COP27 UN climate summit to be held in Egypt, November this year, Lin noted. Observers said that dealing with climate change is the most important issue for the next 40 years and it cannot be done without a global effort, calling on some Western countries to strengthen cooperation in the new-energy industry and stop setting limits on China's new-energy products. Summarizing China's achievements in climate change, Huang said in the past decade, the country has witnessed the optimization of environmental protection regulations and supervision, and it also sought out a high-quality green development path and became deeply engaged in global biodiversity governance. For example, the National People's Congress Standing Committee has amended 25 laws related to the environment, covering air, water, soil, solid waste and noise pollution, as well as the protection of the Yangtze River, wetlands and black earth. With more than 30 environment-related laws, China has formed a legal system that can comprehensively, effectively and strictly protect the environment. On air quality, Huang said that the national average concentration of PM2.5 fell from 46 micrograms per cubic meter in 2015 to 33 micrograms per cubic meter in 2020 and further to 30 micrograms per cubic meter last year. In addition, days with good air quality accounted for 87.5 percent of 2021, up 6.3 percentage points from 2015, making China the nation with the greatest air-quality improvement worldwide, according to the minister. Huang said Beijing is an example of China's success in improving air quality in recent years, citing statistics that the number of days with heavy pollution in Beijing dropped from 58 in 2013 to eight in 2021, and there are only two days with heavy pollution so far in 2022 in the city. "Blue skies are now no longer a luxury for the city," he said. \</doc>

Photo:Xinhua Chinese President Xi Jinping called for advancing global process on wetlands conservation, redoubling efforts to preserve authenticity and integrity, and scaling up wetlands action across the world in an address to the 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP14) held in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, on Saturday via a video link. President Xi noted that historic achievements have been made in wetlands conservation in China, and China has put in place a protection system, and enacted a Wetlands Conservation Law, amid applause from attending international representatives on China's long-term commitment to wetland conservation, as well as tackling climate change and protecting biodiversity. The opening ceremony of the 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP14) held in Wuhan, Hubei Province, on November 5, 2022. Photo: Courtesy of COP14 committee China has grown from a participant, to a contributor, to now a leader in global wetland preservation, building a model and providing effective solutions for many states worldwide, observers said.\~\~ Xi suggested that it is important for the world to "build global consensus on prizing wetlands, show our respect for nature, minimize disruption and damage caused by human activities, and protect the ecological security of wetlands, in order to leave the beautiful wetlands to our future generations." He stressed that China will pursue a modernization of harmony between humanity and nature, and promote high-quality development in the wetlands conservation cause. China leads the world in having the most international wetland cities, being home to 13 among all 43 cities globally. Additionally, China has so far restored over 800,000 hectares of wetlands since 2012. Wuhan is especially rich in wetlands, ranking in the top three among inland cities worldwide on wetland resources. "Wuhan's successful experience and innovative measures on wetlands conservation are also worth sharing with the international community, considering that Wuhan is the only city in the world with a population of over 10 million that has been recognized as one of the 'international wetland cities'," Cai Song, the head of the Wuhan's park and forestry bureau, told the Global Times on Saturday.

He said that achievement of Wuhan's urban wetland ecological protection is an epitome of China's overall wisdom on the cause. Wuhan is home to 165 rivers and 166 lakes. It also boasts about 162,000 hectares of wetlands, the People's Daily reported.

BEIJING, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- Humanity is now facing a perfect storm: stagflation seems to be over the horizon, the COVID-19 pandemic is still bedeviling the world, while growing divisions are corroding urgently needed global cooperation. At this critical moment, the world community is looking on to see what the coming Group of 20 (G20) Summit in Indonesia and the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Thailand can contribute to building up global consensus and renewing joint efforts. A DEFINING MOMENT It is a moment of a culmination of unresolved challenges, both old -- as were prioritized in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -- and new, which further drag on the global economy and tens of millions of households. Now three years into COVID-19, the pandemic seems nowhere near over. It has not only led to a dramatic loss of human lives, but also decimated jobs and constituted an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems, and administrative governance, leading UN agencies have repeatedly warned. The COVID-19 has shown to perfection that it is imperative for all in the world to recognize that mankind has a shared future and must therefore look out for each other and marshal a collective response to global challenges, Martin Albrow, a fellow with the British Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in his book. To make matters worse, there are surging inflation and spillovers from the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes, mounting fears of food and energy insecurity, disrupted industrial and supply chains, failed climate pledges and heightened geopolitical tensions. Tackling such big global issues needs "the focus for collective activities, which go beyond national boundaries," he told Xinhua. Addressing the 77th session of the UN General Assembly in September, Retno Marsudi, minister for foreign affairs of Indonesia where the G20 Summit will be held from Nov. 14 to 17, said that the whole world is pinning their hope on the G20 to be the catalyst of global economic recovery, especially for the developing countries. "G20 must not fail. We can not let global recovery fall at the mercy of geopolitics," she said. FIGHT IMBALANCED RECOVERIES While the year 2021 was one of strong economic recovery, that recovery was neither universal nor complete, particularly with a huge divergence in the pace and quality. "Our world is in big trouble. Divides are growing deeper. Inequalities are growing wider. And challenges are spreading farther," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned. Moreover, the cascading series of crises weigh on different parts of the world disproportionately, making the unprivileged even more vulnerable. At the general debate of the UN General Assembly in September, South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Naledi Pandor called upon the world to prioritize attending to the needs of "the marginalized and forgotten." "It will be a tragic indictment on all of us as leaders if future pandemics found the poorest as unprepared as many were for COVID-19," she said. Take climate change. Without concerted and urgent action, climate change will further exacerbate inequalities and uneven development, said the newly launched Human Climate Horizons, an analysis platform under the UN Development Programme (UNDP). "It is necessary for developing countries, especially in our African continent, to feel that their priorities are responded to and taken into consideration," Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said during the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, calling on developed countries to fulfill their climate pledges to help developing countries that suffer the most from the climate crisis. History shows that poverty and crisis usually exist side by side. Uneven and fragile recoveries breed hatred, divisions and conflicts, further weighing on international cooperation and plunging the global economy into a vicious circle. Bearing in mind that development holds the master key, China has not only managed to narrow development gaps at home through poverty alleviation and a robust modernization drive, but also proposed a Global Development Initiative (GDI), joining hands with other countries to spur growth and share dividends. The GDI is "a 'remobilization' of world development cooperation and a 'reaffirmation' of the people-oriented concept," said Fahd Almenei, a researcher with the Center for Research and Intercommunication Knowledge of Saudi Arabia. "We're looking for multiple worlds not one world controlled by some powers ... We're looking for new economic institutions and a new model that can really lead to bringing a positive new form of economic multilateralism in the world," said Adel Mehany, a professor of international economy in Egypt. China gives an example in this regard that the world can adopt in the near future, he said. "It is a system that is based on sharing not hostility, on assistance not looting, and on understanding not clashing." Enditem \</doc>

With the global community looking forward to the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP27 , which opened on Sunday in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Kenyan President William Ruto has already made climate change a key agenda for his new administration. His debut commitment is to have Kenya attain a 30 percent forest cover by 2032. According to government reports, over the past 10 years, the impacts of climate change in Kenya have resulted in socioeconomic losses estimated at 3 to 5 percent of the country's annual GDP. This has led to a setback in the realization of Kenya's Vision 2030 in the context of climate change mitigation, despite the country having negligible greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, for Kenya to win the fight against climate change, it needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through multilateral and bilateral partnerships with like-minded allies. China has been an ally and continues to be a strategic partner of Kenya in the fight against climate change. For starters, China's involvement in the fight against the impacts of climate change in Kenya has been visible through its renewable energy projects. The 50-megawatt solar power station plant in Garissa County in Northern Kenya is one of the largest photovoltaic electricity plants in Africa. The project, which began in 2016 and was financed by the Chinese government through concessional loans from the Export-Import Bank of China, was completed by China Jiangxi Corp for International Economic and Technical Cooperation. The Garissa solar power plant has more than 206,000 solar panels and occupies an estimated 210 acres. As a sustainable development project, the solar plant is estimated to address the power demand of 70,000 households (approximately 350,000 people) in Kenya. The solar plant has also increased the share of renewable energy on the grid to 93 percent, setting the stage for cheaper electricity in Kenya. Institutionalizing the fight against climate change in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa, China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the United Nations' Environment Programme jointly launched the China-Africa Environmental Cooperation Center in Kenya in 2018. The center supports member countries in achieving the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union's Agenda 2063. It also focuses on South-South cooperation on environmental issues and adheres to principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. Regarding private enterprise partnership, during the Huawei FusionSolar Eastern Africa Partner Summit, held in Nairobi in June, Chinese tech giant Huawei pledged to support Kenya to upscale green energy adoption and hasten low-carbon growth. Huawei is also committed to supporting the training of students in green energy technologies to ensure that future generations in Kenya will provide solutions to enable the country to strengthen climate change adaptation and mitigation. However, Kenyan President Ruto's administration needs to push for more cooperation with China in combating climate change and promoting energy transition. Kenya needs to utilize its abundant renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind and solar to reduce the energy shortage. First, wind energy in the nation has the potential to generate 3,000 MW. The Lake Turkana Wind Power Plant is the largest wind power generation plant in Africa, supplying 310 MW to the grid, while the Ngong Hills Wind Power Station is providing approximately 25 MW. Second, geothermal is still the most significant source of renewable energy, with an estimated potential of 10,000 MW, according to the Kenyan Ministry of Energy. However, geothermal energy remains relatively unexploited, with a current installed capacity of less than 863 MW.This notwithstanding, Kenya is the eighth-largest geothermal producer in the world, boasting the largest geothermal power plant  the 280-MW Olkaria IV plant. Third, the Kenyan Ministry of Energy estimates that solar energy has the potential to generate about 15,000 MW. Fourth, as a new frontier, Kenya has established a nuclear power cooperation agreement with China. The cooperation enables Kenya to obtain expertise and technical support. Kenya has also signed agreements with other partners like Russia, South Korean nuclear power companies and Slovenia, with the aim of becoming a nuclear power producer by 2035. Kenya is also working with the International Atomic Energy Agency as it builds capacity in nuclear energy. Finally, Kenya and China need to work together to fast-track the implementation of the 2021 Dakar Declarations  developing the "Great Green Wall", undertaking 10 green development, environmental protection and climate action projects, and building centers of excellence in low-carbon development and climate change adaptation in Africa. China and Kenya need to accelerate their cooperation in the areas of research and innovation as well as energy transition to curb the negative impacts of climate change. This can be achieved while taking into consideration their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. \~ Dennis Munene is executive director of the China-Africa Center at the Africa Policy Institute in Kenya. \</doc>

CAIRO\u-243 Egypt, the European Union and Israel signed a trilateral deal on Wednesday to boost exports of Israeli natural gas to Europe via Egypt, in a bid to reduce the bloc's dependence on supply from Russia. The signing of this agreement is "a special moment", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference alongside the Egyptian and Israeli energy ministers in Cairo. The deal will allow more supplies of gas from Israel via Egypt, which has facilities to liquefy it for shipment by sea. "With this agreement, we will work on the stable delivery of natural gas to the EU from the East Mediterranean region," she tweeted shortly after the ministerial meeting of the East Mediterranean Gas Forum, or EMGF, where the deal was reached. "This will contribute to our EU energy security, and we are building infrastructure fit for renewables\u-243 the energy of the future." Egypt will host the United Nations' COP 27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh in November. Later on Wednesday, von der Leyen traveled to Jordan, where she met with King Abdullah II. She called Jordan "an essential partner for the EU" in comments on Twitter. "You have a crucial role to play in the stability and prosperity of the region," she said. Russian supplies constituted nearly 45 percent of the EU's gas imports last year, according to the International Energy Agency. Egyptian Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Tarek El-Molla said the deal is an important step to boost relations between Egypt, Israel and the EU, and will foster cooperation among EMGF members and partners. EMGF is a platform formed by Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, France and Israel in 2019 and headquartered in Cairo. Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Energy Karine Elharrar said the partnership between Egypt and Israel "ensures natural gas security for our European partners", helping them to face the current energy crisis. This deal sends a message that the EMGF plays a pivotal role in securing energy to Europe, she said, noting geopolitical developments in eastern Europe have highly impacted the energy industry. After achieving self-sufficiency in natural gas in 2018, Egypt is working to take up the role of a regional energy hub by strengthening regional cooperation and discovering many gas sources. In November, Egypt announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Israel to increase natural gas supplies from Israel to Egypt for re-export.

BEIJING, Nov. 13 (Xinhua) -- The future of mankind is overshadowed by uncertainties caused by a series of global challenges and a truly multilateral approach is essential to addressing those crises, argued experts and officials worldwide. To solve global problems including the COVID-19 pandemic, sluggish economic recovery, intensified geopolitical confrontation, escalating food and energy insecurity and accelerating climate change, collective and concerted efforts by all nations are urgently needed. The global governance system has failed to heed calls from the developing world that suffer the most from the crises. Practicing true multilateralism, China has presented proposals that are open, inclusive and fair to galvanize support for common development, they said. MULTILATERAL SOLUTIONS NEEDED In an interconnected world, countries influence each other, and a crisis in one state or a decision made by one government may have a spillover effect worldwide. In the meantime, no country can stand alone in tackling global challenges. Experts and officials argued that collective and multilateral efforts made by all nations are particularly necessary. The world today faces both geopolitical conflicts and difficulties rarely seen in history, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the fate of countries around the world is linked, said former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in a recent interview with Xinhua. Therefore, it is very important to have an overall view of a human community with a shared future, said Hatoyama. A multilateral approach is becoming increasingly important for building global consensus, promoting international cooperation, and giving confidence and hope to the people facing uncertainties, said Gulru Gezer, a foreign policy analyst and a former diplomat of T\'fcrkiye. "A holistic approach, of course, is required to address these global challenges within an effective response because all of these challenges cannot be tackled by a single state or only a set of countries. So it really requires a global effort," Gezer added. French international affairs expert Bruno Guigue has described multilateralism as a "lifeline" for the world riddled with uncertainties. Among the global challenges confronting humankind, accelerating climate change is the most typical one and multilateral cooperation by all nations is the only way to save our common home, the Earth. "Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish," warned United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit in Egypt, citing the growing irreversible climate chaos. GLOBAL GOVERNANCE REFORM The global governance system is suffering setbacks. The multilateral institutions established mainly by Western countries have failed to pay enough attention to voices from developing countries that account for the majority of the world population. The developed countries, in times of crisis, even pursued their own interests at the cost of those poverty-stricken and vulnerable people. At the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, representatives from developing countries reproached some European countries for reopening less efficient, more polluting energy facilities to cope with their energy crisis. They argued that such action would deteriorate global climate conditions and leave those in developing nations who are most prone to extreme climate events in misery. Moreover, the spirit of multilateralism is also at risk, as the United States imposed unilateral sanctions on countries including Russia, Iran and Cuba, and trumpeted trade protectionism and irresponsible decoupling theories. "Today's multilateralism is nothing but a disappointing front," said Adel Mehany, professor of international economy in Egypt, adding that a multilateralism that gives some countries the power to hegemonize the world is not real multilateralism. His opinion was echoed by Guigue, who warned against the "false multilateralism" imposed by the United States through its irresponsible meddling in other countries' internal affairs. "International cooperation only bears fruit if the main powers apply the principles defined by the Charter of the United Nations and do not seek to impose their hegemony," he said. TRUE MULTILATERALISM China advocates common prosperity, and its development has significantly contributed to growth worldwide. Seeking to promote global development and improve global governance, it has put forward a slew of proposals including the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, secretary for external relations of the ZANU-PF politburo of Zimbabwe, welcomed the GDI as it envisions a shared future instead of a selfish one, "one which is shared by all countries of the world, rich or poor." Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, hailed the GSI as "carrying a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. The initiative is a timely call to action." In the past decade, China has been actively involved in global governance reforms with an emphasis on upholding the international system with the United Nations at the core. This has demonstrated the country's responsibility as a major country, and its contribution to world peace and development. Experts from various countries also lauded China's efforts in promoting the democratization of international relations and making global governance fairer and more equitable. Gezer, the Turkish foreign policy analyst, said China is setting an example for the world in promoting peaceful cooperation with other countries by safeguarding and advocating true multilateralism. "China especially underlines the notion of inclusiveness and connectivity where everyone is equal, and the decisions are taking on a consensus-based mechanism, and where cooperation leads to better understanding and a win-win situation," Gezer said. \</doc>

UNITED NATIONS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- With less than eight years remaining to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) convened a thematic debate on Tuesday, calling for concrete actions to tackle climate change. "We know that we have backed ourselves into a corner with our recklessness. We know that this will only get worse, and quickly, as we continue to delay the actions that are needed," said Abdulla Shahid, president of the 76th UNGA session, who convened the high-level thematic debate "Moment for Nature." During the day-long event, participants assessed recent decisions on the global environment agenda and presented solutions to common bottlenecks, such as gaps between commitments and actions and the need for broad mobilization. Despite the immense challenges facing the world, the UNGA president believes that humanity can effect change. "I myself remember a time when the power of renewable energies was viewed as far too weak and expensive to make a difference," he said. "Today, fleets of vehicles and countless homes run on renewables. Entire cities and countries aspire to be run on renewable energies." "It is time for humanity to chart a new path of living in harmony with nature," UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a video message, urging the international community to match commitments with actions. With nature and its benefits deteriorating worldwide, "we face a triple crisis of climate disruption, biodiversity loss and pollution," said Guterres. One million species of plants and animals are threatened with extinction, threatening the livelihood of millions. Three-quarters of the land and two-thirds of the ocean are adversely impacted by human activity. Some 3.2 billion people are affected by land degradation, he said. "Since human activities are at the root of this planetary emergency, which means we also hold the key to the solutions," he said. "Now is the time to transform our relationship with nature and chart a new path." UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed outlined areas where governments can take action. "We must strengthen nature's capacity to protect us from hazards and extreme events. This means accelerating implementation of national restoration policies, programs and plans for marine and terrestrial ecosystems while creating new jobs, tackling poverty and improving sustainable development," she said. Countries also need to "close the biodiversity finance gap" by 2030, she added, which currently stands at some 700 billion U.S. dollars per year. This can be done through repurposing and re-directing the 500 billion dollars per year for "harmful subsidies" towards more biodiversity-positive activities. The President of the UN's Economic and Social Council, Collen Vixen Kelapile, underscored the urgency to act on the "mounting scientific evidence" on climate change. "We should ... do everything we can to change our consumption and production patterns and make transformative change to nature-sensitive economic growth, nature-based solutions to rebuild our societies after COVID and preserve our environment," he said. The review under discussion at the meeting was conducted by the UN Environment Programme, whose chief, Inger Anderson, catalogued the numerous outcomes from global gatherings over the past year, such as the COP27 climate conference in Glasgow, and the fifth UN Environment Assembly held in Nairobi. "But we have not yet reached that moment for nature -- the moment when we truly find common ground for nature and deliver on the many commitments and pledges that have been made," she said in a video message. This December, countries will gather in Montreal to conclude the Global Biodiversity Framework, a new set of goals for nature over the next decade. Andersen said it must result in "a massive political lift for nature," as well as adequate resource mobilization. The UN secretary-general's special envoy for the ocean, Peter Thomson, said during a panel discussion by quoting the UN secretary-general that "a deep apology was owed from our generation...for the harm that we've done to the planet and that hence forth, we're going to work side by side with them (younger generations) to provide the solutions and implement the solutions to those problems." Xiye Batista, the organizer for Fridays For Future, and co-founder of Re-Earth Initiative, said at the panel discussion "Including Young People for Intergenerational Coalitions" that "we have to change the narrative," adding that "we have to be able to speak the language, the legal language of the UN." On specific solutions, Batista said that "we cannot keep fossil fuel proliferation," hoping that her country, Mexico, would change course by abandoning a petroleum-based energy policy, as young people demand.

Despite economic strains, Singapore has committed to pursuing green development goals, though experts said slowing growth should be considered in its long-term goal to decarbonize its economy. On Oct 25, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said the city-state raised its national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore's Business School, said Singapore's quest to achieve net zero is compatible with economic growth. Loh said decarbonization may even encourage investment and consumer spending. "While businesses may incur additional overall costs for net zero, these can be offset by the lower risk profiles, which translate to decreases in financing costs as well as the new revenue opportunities brought about by environmentally oriented pursuits," he said. Singapore will submit the enhanced targets to the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 27 , which will be held from Nov 6 to 18 in Egypt. Singapore has implemented a carbon tax, the first carbon pricing scheme in Southeast Asia, since January 2019. The carbon tax level is set at S$5 per metric ton ($3.54 per metric ton) of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2019 to 2023. But the Singaporean government is planning to incrementally increase its carbon tax from next year to 2030 to achieve its decarbonization target. Nawazish Mirza, a finance professor at the Excelia Business School in France, said slowing growth should be taken into consideration for Singapore's long-term goal to decarbonize its economy. "To provide a more conducive operating environment for the industry, the government may have to delay its plans of increasing the carbon tax. Similarly, there will be financial constraints to support the decarbonized technological transition," Mirza said. Recently modest consumption and weaker demand for electronic exports are seen to weigh on Singapore's growth. Analysts said the same factors will likewise affect growth in other Southeast Asian economies. "Singapore's economy will slow in tandem with the deceleration in global demand, which will also affect growth in the rest of Southeast Asia," said Manu Bhaskaran, CEO of Singaporean think tank Centennial Asia Advisors. 'Open economy' Loh said Singapore's economic slowdown will have a bearing on the region because it has "an open economy with deep interactions "with its neighboring countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, which are among Singapore's top trading partners and top investment destinations. In its biannual macroeconomic review last week, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said the city-state's GDP this year would ease to 3 to 4 percent and is projected to slow further to "a below-trend pace" next year. Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist at the French investment bank Natixis, said a slower Singaporean economy "is likely to be repeated across ASEAN", which is especially true for export-dependent economies like Malaysia and Vietnam. Natixis sees Singapore's GDP slowing to 2.6 percent next year. Nguyen said while pent-up consumer demand has supported the economic rebound in the past few months, the future is not as sanguine. "Interest rates are higher and that will lead to softening of the real estate market, although it is still rather resilient. However, a strong Singapore dollar and weakening global demand mean that external sectors will underwhelm (Singapore's growth prospects)," she said. Nguyen said Singapore is vulnerable to rising sea levels and this is why it is important that it has set a net zero target. "The question is how Singapore will get there and so the impact to GDP is not obvious as it is likely to target energy efficiency first, while it figures out how to change its existing energy mix," she said, noting that Singapore remains dependent on petroleum products.

BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday held a phone conversation with Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic counselor to French President Emmanuel Macron. Wang said that the successful phone conversation between the heads of state of China and France after President Macron's re-election has provided strategic guidance and injected new impetus into the healthy and stable development of China-France relations. The two sides quickly implemented the important consensus reached by the two heads of state, and bilateral relations got off to a strong start, said Wang, adding that China is ready to work with France to push for more dynamic development of the China-France comprehensive strategic partnership. For his part, Bonne said France attaches great importance to maintaining high-level exchanges with China. President Macron is firmly committed to the France-China friendship and hopes to push bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership to a new level. France is ready to deepen practical cooperation with China in such fields as aviation, agriculture, food, energy and people-to-people exchanges, strengthen coordination in global affairs including biodiversity protection and climate change, and looks forward to a new round of strategic dialogue between the two countries at an early date, said Bonne. The renewed flames of war on the European continent has dealt a heavy blow to Europe's recovery and development. Both Europe and China, as well as France and China, are committed to peace, stability and development while adhering to important concepts such as respecting international law and safeguarding sovereignty, said Bonne. France appreciates China's positive role in promoting food and energy security, attaches great importance to its strategic coordination with China, said Bonne. France, together with China, is willing to jointly demonstrate the responsibility of major countries, work for an early ceasefire, and minimize the negative spillover impacts of the Ukraine crisis on vulnerable and underdeveloped countries, Bonne added. Wang said China and France are two major forces for maintaining stability in the process toward a multi-polar world. In a turbulent international landscape, where unilateralism and the law of the jungle are raging, he said, China, as a responsible major country, has always been committed to upholding the international system with the United Nations at its core, the international order based on international law and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. China is ready to strengthen coordination with France and make due contributions to maintaining peace, stability and development, he added. Noting that the Ukraine crisis has shown the trend of becoming prolonged and complicated, which the world does not want to see, Wang said China has been committed to promoting peace talks from the very beginning and will continue to make every effort to play a constructive role for a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities. China appreciates President Macron's active mediation efforts, Wang said, adding China supports and believes that France will continue to play a unique and important role as a major European country in restoring peace. The fallout from the Ukraine crisis has led to food and energy shortages, bringing challenges and risks to global recovery as well as peace and stability, Wang said. Noting that Chinese President Xi Jinping has put forward the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, he said China is willing to strengthen communication with France on the implementation of these initiatives. China has also proposed a cooperation initiative on global food security at the Group of 20 foreign ministers' meeting, which can echo the France-proposed Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission initiative in an effort to forge more international consensus, he added. Wang expressed hope that France, as a major country in the European Union (EU) and one of the European troika, will play a positive role in promoting the sound and smooth development of China-EU relations, continue to expand the list of positive China-EU cooperation, and create new cooperation highlights such as energy security, carbon market and green finance. He also hoped that both sides will jointly promote the success of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the second phase of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15). Bonne expressed his willingness to continue to actively promote the EU-China cooperation based on the principle of mutual benefit, reiterating that NATO will stay committed to its original geographical location when it was established, and has no intention and will not expand to the Asia-Pacific region. \</doc>

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations (UN) published on Monday a draft text with an aim to address the "loss and damage" issue, one of the hottest topics at the ongoing UN climate conference. The UN's draft text focuses on matters relating to funding arrangements for addressing loss and damage at the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The term "loss and damage" in UN climate negotiations refers to expenses already incurred due to climate change impacts, such as rising sea levels or extreme heat waves. The draft may include a new fit-for-purpose fund under the UNFCCC and an operating entity of the financial mechanism, as well as the strengthening of existing operating entities. The draft will be possibly changed by negotiators before the COP27 concludes on Nov. 18. The COP27 kicked off on Nov. 6 with loss and damage financing formally on the agenda. Enditem \</doc>

Photo: Xinhua At the very core of China's core interests, the Taiwan question is the first red line that must not be crossed, Chinese President Xi Jinping told US President Joe Biden during the meeting on Monday in Bali, Indonesia, urging the US to respect the differences between the two countries' paths. The Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations, Xi told Biden, expressing hope that the US will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiques.\~ "President Biden has said on many occasions that the US does not support "Taiwan independence" and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. China hopes that the U.S. side will act on this assurance to real effect," Xi emphasized. Xi said it is vital to recognize and respect the differences between the paths China and the US take which is nothing new and will continue to exist as the US practices capitalism and China practices socialism. "Neither side should try to remold the other in one's own image, or seek to change or even subvert the other's system. Instead of talking in one way and acting in another, the US needs to honor its commitments with concrete action," Xi noted. Xi pointed out the so-called "democracy versus authoritarianism" narrative is not the defining feature of today's world, still less does it represent the trend of the times. "Just as the US has American-style democracy, China has Chinese-style democracy. Both fit their respective national conditions", Xi said, adding that the whole-process people's democracy practiced in China is based on the country's reality, history and culture and it reflects people's will. "We take great pride in it. No country has a perfect democratic system, and there is always a need for development and improvement. The specific differences between the two sides can be worked out through discussion, but only on the precondition of equality," Xi added. The Chinese and US leaders agreed to make joint efforts to push the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ) to reach success.\~ Xi said China and US should chart the right course for the development of bilateral relations and push bilateral ties back to the track of healthy and stable development. Xi said during the meeting that China and the US have braced winds and rains in their more than 50 years of engagement, from the establishment of diplomatic relations until today. There have been gains and losses, experience and lessons. History is the best textbook and China and the US should take history as a reference and look to the future. The current situation of China-US relations does not conform to the interests of the two countries and their peoples, now does it conform to the expectations of the international community, Xi said. As leaders of two major countries, we should hold the helm and find the right direction for the development of bilateral relations and push ties to improve. Politicians should think about both their own country's development path and how to get along with other countries and the world, said Xi. As leaders of two major countries, we should find the right way. Politicians should think about both their own country's development path and how to get along with other countries and the world, said Xi. Xi noted the changes of the times are unfolding in an unprecedented way and human society is facing unprecedented challenges, and the world is at a crossroads. We care, and all countries in the world care about where they are going.\~ Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with US President Joe Biden in Bali, Indonesia, Nov. 14, 2022. Photo: Xinhua The international community expects China and the US to handle our relations well. Our meeting today has attracted worldwide attention. We should work together with other countries to inject hope for world peace, confidence in global stability and momentum for collective development, Xi said. He expressed willingness to continue candid and in-depth exchanges with the US president on strategic issues in China-US ties and key global and regional issues. Xi said he looks forward to working with the US president to push bilateral relations back on the track of healthy and stable development so as to benefit both countries and the world.\~ The two leaders met on the sidelines of the G20 summit to be held in Indonesia on Tuesday and Wednesday. Xi told Biden that though the two leaders have remained in communication via video-conferences, phone calls and letters, none of these can really take the place of face-to-face exchanges. President Xi arrived at the island of Bali on Monday afternoon. As a guard of honor paid salutes alongside the red carpet, some local youths in national costume played traditional Indonesian musical instruments, while others performed a traditional Bali dance. Young students cheered in Chinese "Welcome! Welcome!" while waving the Chinese and Indonesian flags, CCTV reported. According to CCTV, local people also gathered along the roads from the airport to the hotel where Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were going to stay, waving the Chinese and Indonesian flags to express their warmest welcome on their arrival. \</doc>

People gather at the Kunming Dian-chi International Convention & Exhibition Center, a venue of the first phase of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) in Kunming, Southwest China's Yunnan Province. The second phase of the COP15 will be held in Montreal, Canada in Dcember. File photo: VCG The second part of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) - one of the world's most important multilateral biodiversity events - will soon start in Montreal, Canada, with China as chair. The conference is widely believed to have the potential to be a "Paris moment" for nature, as it is expected to agree on a global biodiversity framework for the coming decade that will live up to global expectations. The second part of the COP15, scheduled for December 7-19, under the theme of "Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth," is tasked with formulating and adopting the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), which should ensure biodiversity loss is halted and reversed by 2030, and that we live in harmony with nature by 2050, said Huang Runqiu, China's Minister of Ecology and Environment and COP15 president. He said that China has exercised leadership and coordination in its efforts to advance negotiations for the framework. At least 96 ministers and over 10,000 registered delegates are confirmed to be participating in the second part of COP15, the Xinhua News Agency reported last month, citing UN officials. "Holding the COP15 Presidency, China is responsible for the substantive and political affairs of the conference," Huang noted. So far, China has convened 37 COP15 meetings of the presidium. It has also presided over four meetings of the open-ended working group on the post-2020 GBF in Geneva and Nairobi, among other locations, in collaboration with the CBD secretariat, Huang said. Moreover, China has made use of gatherings such as the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the G20 Joint Environment and Climate Ministerial Meeting, the high-level week of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly, and the climate COP27 , to organize exchanges on key COP15 issues, Huang said. These efforts have both maintained the political momentum of COP15 and facilitated the bridging of differences among contracting parties to achieve greater consensus. It is undeniable that differences on the issues remain an enormous challenge for the contracting parties. The Global Times learned that almost all the 20 indicators formulated by the Aichi Biodiversity Targets that were supposed to have been met by 2020 have not been completed, and the participating parties are not satisfied with that. Therefore, now the parties have agreed that a framework for the future decade is needed, analysts said. However, to reach the new framework, the contradiction between developing and developed countries is still sharp and antagonistic. The divergences are revealed in issues such as funding, genetic resources and enforcement and oversight mechanisms, which will also be the focuses and difficulties during the negotiations at COP15, the Global Times learned. Although there are still many difficulties and demands, all parties have expressed their firm political support and confidence in the negotiation process and in China's role as COP15 president, Huang said. He said that all countries should shoulder international responsibilities commensurate with their development levels. "Developed countries should fulfill the obligations stipulated in the CBD and related protocols and provide more support for developing countries with regard to funding, technology and capacity-building to make up for the gap in biodiversity governance capability among nations," Huang said. "In terms of funds, technology, and talent, as one of the countries with the richest biodiversities in the world, China has conscientiously implemented the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, clarified various tasks and responsibilities, and achieved positive results in the implementations," Cui Shuhong, director of the Department of Nature and Ecology Conservation at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said at the ministry's press conference on November 28. The first part of COP15 was held in October 2021 in Kunming, China. The Kunming Declaration was adopted during the conference and was hailed as a major milestone achievement. This time, the second part was postponed and relocated to Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Xinhua News Agency reported in June 2022. Relocating the second part of the conference to Montreal is a decision made under a difficult situation, showing China's sense of\~responsibility and duty on this issue, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Climate change and other ecosystem issues are universal security challenges, and both China and Canada are responsible to work together to deal with the issues. The fact that China is hosting this conference in Canada shows its responsible attitude and the willingness to cooperate with Canada and the rest of the international community on the issues, Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday. The expert noted that the two countries have long collaborated on environmental projects. Although some conservative politicians in Canada lack independence and blindly follow the US in containing and smearing China, Canada's extensive and profound social and economic relations with China determine that there is no market for any Canadian politician to try to cater to the US at the expense of the whole China-Canada relations and the common economic and social interests of China and Canada, Li pointed out. I believe that Trudeau, as Canadian prime minister, will have basic judgment and a clear head on matters related to the conference, fully cooperate with China's leadership on substantive and political affairs of the conference, and create more room for the turnaround of China-Canada relations, Li said. \</doc>

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made four-point proposals in addressing the global climate change on Wednesday during the ongoing UN General Assembly (UNGA), stressing that countries should not abandon the efforts in energy restructuring because of the COVID-19 outbreak or the energy crisis, developed countries should achieve carbon neutrality significantly in advance, making room for developing countries.\~ During a private meeting of Heads of State and Government held on Wednesday at UN Headquarters in New York, UN Secretary-General Ant\'f3nio Guterres called for more action and leadership to tackle the climate crisis, warning that efforts to keep the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is "on life support," according to the UN website.\~ The meeting was billed in advance as a "frank and informal exchange" of views between leaders, co-chaired by Guterres and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, and an opportunity to address key issues ahead of the COP27 UN Climate Change conference, which is to be held in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh in November, the website showed.\~ In addressing the meeting, Wang suggested that the countries should follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, taking action to meet the temperature control targets set by the Paris Agreement with accelerated speed.\~ China supports the universal early warning systems initiated by Guterres, and developed countries should fulfill their commitments and provide financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries, Wang said.\~ During the same address, he also called on the countries to push forward the green energy restructuring plan in a practical way, and they should not abandon their efforts because of the COVID-19 outbreak or the energy crisis. Traditional energy should be gradually withdrawn on the basis of safety and reliability of new energy sources, Wang said. And under the framework of sustainable development, countries should promote a high-quality and fair energy transformation. In recent weeks, the record heat waves alongside an energy crisis partly caused by the US-instigated Russia-Ukraine crisis have forced some European countries to row back on their climate goals. Meanwhile, in the US, one of the world's biggest emitters, climate change has descended to an issue for partisan struggle.\~ The city of Copenhagen has given up on its long-term goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025 in late August, and the decision was made after several European countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, had already or are planning to return to coal to generate electricity, after they felt the pinch from energy crisis following the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Also on Wednesday, China's climate envoy held a video conference with the German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan. Xie Zhenhua pointed out that the current global climate governance faces multiple challenges and uncertainties, and some European countries have been moving backwards in their climate policies.\~ Xie hoped that it's only expedient measure as all countries should take positive measures to implement mid- and long-term climate change targets. Developed countries are expected to fulfil their commitment of providing at least $100 billion a year to developing countries to enhance mutual trust in fighting climate change. Wang said all sides should give up the unilateral stance and geopolitical wrestling in handling the global challenges, and developed countries should achieve carbon neutrality in advance, making room for the developing countries and rebuilding trust.\~ Although the floods in Pakistan and droughts in Europe and China have been caught in the public attention in recent weeks, the climate change has not been at the top of the agenda at the UNGA this week as the US-led Western countries put more focus on the Ukraine crisis and condemning Russia.\~ Besides making concrete suggestions, the Chinese Foreign Minister reiterated that China unswervingly gives priority to ecology and pursues green and low-carbon development, as the country has announced the carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets, and will achieve the world's highest carbon emission intensity reduction.\~ China is also steadily promoting energy restructuring as the country is ranked the first in installed wind power and photovoltaic power generation in the world, and the production and sales of new energy vehicles rank first in the world.\~ It also strictly controls carbon dioxide emissions. By 2020, carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 48.4 percent from the figures in 2005, and by more than 65 percent when comparing 2005 to 2030, and the country has established a national carbon market mechanism to become the world's largest carbon market covering greenhouse gas emissions, Wang said.\~ In response to whether China will adjust its carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets as some European countries have restarted coal power production, Liu Dechun, director of the resource conservation and environmental protection department of the National Development and Reform Commission, told at a press conference on Thursday, that to achieve those targets is a solemn presentation made by China to the world, and China will surely achieve those targets as scheduled. \</doc>

By PRIME SARMIENTO in Hong Kong | China Daily Global | Updated: 2022-11-02 09:47 Despite economic strains, Singapore has committed to pursuing green development goals, though experts said slowing growth should be considered in its long-term goal to decarbonize its economy. On Oct 25, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said the city-state raised its national climate target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore's Business School, said Singapore's quest to achieve net zero is compatible with economic growth. Loh said decarbonization may even encourage investment and consumer spending. "While businesses may incur additional overall costs for net zero, these can be offset by the lower risk profiles, which translate to decreases in financing costs as well as the new revenue opportunities brought about by environmentally oriented pursuits," he said. Singapore will submit the enhanced targets to the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP 27 , which will be held from Nov 6 to 18 in Egypt. Singapore has implemented a carbon tax, the first carbon pricing scheme in Southeast Asia, since January 2019. The carbon tax level is set at S$5 per metric ton ($3.54 per metric ton) of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2019 to 2023. But the Singaporean government is planning to incrementally increase its carbon tax from next year to 2030 to achieve its decarbonization target. Nawazish Mirza, a finance professor at the Excelia Business School in France, said slowing growth should be taken into consideration for Singapore's long-term goal to decarbonize its economy. "To provide a more conducive operating environment for the industry, the government may have to delay its plans of increasing the carbon tax. Similarly, there will be financial constraints to support the decarbonized technological transition," Mirza said. Recently modest consumption and weaker demand for electronic exports are seen to weigh on Singapore's growth. Analysts said the same factors will likewise affect growth in other Southeast Asian economies. "Singapore's economy will slow in tandem with the deceleration in global demand, which will also affect growth in the rest of Southeast Asia," said Manu Bhaskaran, CEO of Singaporean think tank Centennial Asia Advisors. 'Open economy' Loh said Singapore's economic slowdown will have a bearing on the region because it has "an open economy with deep interactions "with its neighboring countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, which are among Singapore's top trading partners and top investment destinations. In its biannual macroeconomic review last week, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said the city-state's GDP this year would ease to 3 to 4 percent and is projected to slow further to "a below-trend pace" next year. Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist at the French investment bank Natixis, said a slower Singaporean economy "is likely to be repeated across ASEAN", which is especially true for export-dependent economies like Malaysia and Vietnam. Natixis sees Singapore's GDP slowing to 2.6 percent next year. Nguyen said while pent-up consumer demand has supported the economic rebound in the past few months, the future is not as sanguine. "Interest rates are higher and that will lead to softening of the real estate market, although it is still rather resilient. However, a strong Singapore dollar and weakening global demand mean that external sectors will underwhelm (Singapore's growth prospects)," she said. Nguyen said Singapore is vulnerable to rising sea levels and this is why it is important that it has set a net zero target. "The question is how Singapore will get there and so the impact to GDP is not obvious as it is likely to target energy efficiency first, while it figures out how to change its existing energy mix," she said, noting that Singapore remains dependent on petroleum products. \</doc>

By XU WEI and ZHAO RUIXUE | CHINA DAILY | Updated: 2022-07-04 08:03 China has stepped up efforts to help Pacific island nations bolster their resilience to climate change, according to analysts and observers. These nations are facing rising sea levels and more frequent extreme weather conditions. In April, China and Pacific island nations jointly launched a climate action cooperation center in Liaocheng, Shandong province, as they boosted their attempts to respond to climate change. Xie Feng, vice-minister of foreign affairs, said at the launch ceremony for the center that Beijing understands the specific challenges faced by these nations in responding to climate change. He added that the center was launched to promote bilateral cooperation in projects, share experience, practice low-carbon development, and jointly respond to climate challenges. Many Pacific island countries have said the response to climate change is their top priority, highlighting the issue as the single greatest threat facing the region. Henry Puna, secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum, said during a meeting with State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi that action to keep global warming below 1.5 C is vital for the future prosperity and well-being of the region. "We welcome China's climate change commitments as we look ahead to the COP 27 (climate conference) in Egypt and call on all our international partners to submit enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions in line with the 1.5 degrees pathway and net zero emissions by 2050," he said. Nationally Determined Contributions are targets, measures and policies for reducing a country's greenhouse gas emissions and addressing its climate impacts. Tapusalaia Toomata, the Samoan ambassador to China, said Pacific island countries are extremely vulnerable to climate change "because there is nowhere to go as the sea rises, nowhere to hide when extreme cyclones strike with increased frequency, and nowhere to grow crops when protracted droughts occur". He said China's climate change strategy would provide a good platform for cooperation and assistance for these countries to tackle this issue and advance the region's initiatives. "China has the green energy solutions that Pacific island countries can benefit from," Toomata said. "China's carbon peak and net zero emissions goals will also assist these countries to formulate and implement their short- and long-term strategies on climate change and will also help them phase out reliance on fossil fuel." He added that training on climate change and the provision of related environmental data will be one of the main goals for the China-Pacific Island Countries Climate Action Cooperation Center to help boost capacity-building and expertise. Toomata also highlighted the Shandong center's significance in helping Pacific islanders integrate their environmental planning and economic growth as they steer their fragile economies into the future in a sustainable manner. Liang Jiarui, a senior researcher at the center, said China, as a good partner of Pacific island countries, has the responsibility to help these nations better respond to climate change. He listed a series of aid measures China has provided to these countries, including offering training sessions on climate change for officials and scholars, providing related material, developing low-carbon pilot zones, and enhancing cooperation on renewable energy. China has organized a fund of 1.2 billion yuan ($179 million) for South-South cooperation on climate change and signed 42 cooperation agreements on climate actions with 37 developing nations, including Samoa and Tonga, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Beijing also signed a cooperation agreement on climate action with the Pacific island nation of Kiribati in April, and last month hosted an online training session on climate action for more than 40 professionals from the South Pacific. \</doc>

by Mahmoud Fouly CAIRO, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- Against the backdrop of the three Great Pyramids of Giza and their plateau, an open-air art exhibition featuring a dozen contemporary art installations is held in the southwest of Cairo, Egypt. The "Forever Is Now" exhibition is meant to combine ancient history and cultural heritage represented in the pyramids with contemporary art, drawing a link between the past, the present and the future. One of the installations is a six-meter-tall unfinished obelisk by Emirati conceptual artist Zeinab Alhashemi. Made of stainless steel and camel hides, the obelisk symbolizes the well-known ancient Unfinished Obelisk located in Upper Egypt's Aswan. Another piece is "Secrets of Time" by Tunisian artist eL Seed. The artwork consists of a gate-like string curtain of hanging ropes surrounded by an iron frame, on which there was a quote of late Egyptian novelist Radwa Ashour in Arabic calligraphy: "Time does not disclose its secrets to humankind." eL Seed explained that his artwork is meant to celebrate the mystery and greatness of the Pyramids of Giza whose construction remains a secret till today. "The piece is meant to offer a new experience, as anyone can open this curtain of ropes and rediscover the pyramids in a new way," el Seed told Xinhua near his artwork. "The pyramids in the background are more important than the artwork. The background gives value to the piece. My piece of work will perish while the pyramids will remain," the Tunisian artist added. Not far from el Seed's piece, an artwork by Spanish artist SpY named "ORB: Under the Same Sun" features a four-meter-diameter ball, or orb, of chrome steel with mirrors of reinforced safety glass reflecting the pyramids, the sky and the surroundings. A little further, a three-piece work by Jwan Yosef, a Syrian-born Swedish painter and artist, represents a huge 3D figure of the artist's own face sinking into the sand, with only its nose, the lips and the chin emerging from the sand and facing the sky. The limestone artwork, "Vital Sands," takes a novel approach to the traditional self-portrait genre by depicting being submerged in the remedial sands of time. Yosef said he was having a conversation with "one of the most ancient and iconic monuments in the world" through his piece. "To have that dialogue with your own work is just incredible, and to be able to portray that it's just been an amazing experience," he added. "Forever Is Now" is organized by Art D'Egypte company, an Egyptian platform dedicated to art and heritage, under the auspices of Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The month-long event kicked off on Oct. 27 and will remain open to visitors until the end of November, featuring works of artists from 11 countries, including Saudi Arabia, Italy, Cameroon and France. Chief organizer Nadine Abdel-Ghaffar, also founder of Art D'Egypte, said this year's exhibition is different because it comes ahead of Egypt's hosting of the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, noting that a couple of the artworks here also feature environmental sustainability. "Every year, Art D'Egypte holds a local art exhibition at a different archeological site. But when it comes to the pyramids, we thought we should invite the whole world to participate, not only Egyptian artists," she said. "This has given greater influence to the event because every foreign artist acts as an ambassador for Egypt back home," the organizer told Xinhua. In her artwork named "Pantheon of Deities," Egyptian artist Therese Antoine sculpted five marble columns representing obelisks that refer to significant deities of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt. On top of each column lies the symbol of the deity, made of either stainless steel or iron. Meanwhile, British-American artist Natalie Clark displays a piece called "Spirit of Hathor," referring to the goddess of the sky, women, fertility and love in ancient Egypt. The installation shows two pairs of interlocking horns made of Corten steel with the upper two horns holding the marble sun. The piece represents "the feminine divine and female empowerment" as Clark says. Visitors were impressed by the open-air exhibition surrounding the Pyramids of Giza. "I think it's great to combine classical buildings and stuff from ancient past with modern art. And I think it really enriches both pieces," 22-year-old Dutch tourist Fenna Visser told Xinhua, adding that such an event helps visitors learn more about Egyptian culture and history.

The first face-to-face meeting between President Xi Jinping and United States President Joe Biden has charted the path for improving ties between the world's two largest economies and bringing stability and certainty to a turbulent and volatile world, officials and analysts said. The two leaders greeted each other on Monday with a smile and a warm handshake before holding a meeting that lasted for over three hours  longer than scheduled and using simultaneous interpretation  on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia. Xi and Biden emphasized the global implications of China-US relations, underscored the importance of establishing guiding principles for bilateral ties and said they hoped to push the relations back to a steady track from a downward spiral, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a news briefing after the meeting. They agreed to bolster dialogue and exchanges and promote pragmatic cooperation, which charted the way forward for the relations and will help bring the ties gradually back to a track of healthy and stable development, Wang said. The meeting came months after Beijing broke off a number of routine contacts with Washington after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, which took bilateral relations to a historic low level. Wang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said the meeting made clear that both sides should prevent the relations from losing direction or speed, still less having a collision, and should find the right way to get along. The two leaders also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue, with the Chinese president underscoring the urgency of a peaceful settlement of the crisis. "In all, the meeting reached its expected purpose of in-depth communication, clarifying intentions, drawing red lines, preventing conflicts, pointing the way forward and exploring cooperation," Wang said. The two leaders agreed that both sides will conduct dialogue over macroeconomic policies and bilateral trade, and enable positive outcomes from the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or COP27 . They also highlighted the need to implement the cooperation document on public health and agriculture and expand people-to-people exchanges in various sectors. Erik Solheim, former undersecretary general of the United Nations, said the meeting between Xi and Biden went beyond expectations, given that China-US relations are critical for world peace and the environment. "This is the best global news for a long time," he said. "China-US relations are not a zero-sum game. The world is big enough for them to prosper together." Craig Allen, president of the US-China Business Council, said on Monday that amid the current atmosphere of bilateral tension, the meeting underlined the importance of the bilateral relationship to the two countries and the world. "Regular and close bilateral contact is indispensable for responsibly managing competition, lowering the temperature of the relationship, and working together to address issues of shared interest," he said. The US-China Business Council, which represents more than 280 US companies that do business with China, fully supports Washington's and Beijing's mutual interest in seeking to stabilize relations and working collaboratively as global leaders as much as possible, Allen said in a statement. "We hope a new framework can take shape to advance confidence-building measures and tackle long-standing issues in the bilateral relationship," he added. Allen said he hoped that commercial issues will be on the agenda when cabinet-level officials from both countries hold further discussions. A commitment to open lines of communication at all official levels, Biden's declaration to avoid a new Cold War, and a joint renunciation of nuclear threats are the three best outcomes of the summit, said Gary Hufbauer, a former US Treasury Department official and nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "From a business perspective, these announcements should reduce fears of a continuing downward spiral in US-China relations," Hufbauer told China Daily. Regarding priorities for follow-up in the areas of business and trade, in order to implement the consensuses reached between Biden and Xi, Hufbauer said the first order of business should be to dismantle the tariffs imposed by the administration of former US president Donald Trump on imports from China, with reciprocal dismantling by China. The second order of business should be to draw lines around "national security" industrial sectors so that this label is not used to restrict an ever-widening scope of bilateral trade, he said. Su Xiaohui, deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies' Department of American Studies, said the two presidents' sit-down was constructive and conveyed a clear message that it is important for both nations to avoid misjudgment. "Beijing has made clear proposals for the steady and healthy growth of ties with Washington, and the US must meet China halfway," she said, adding that China has again clarified its bottom line in the relationship, especially in safeguarding sovereignty and security and development interests. Douglas H. Paal, a distinguished fellow in the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that reestablishing working groups is positive for improving bilateral relations, because they helped resolve practical problems in Biden's first year. With US Secretary of State Antony Blinken planning to travel to China for follow-up discussions, communication should be more regular, Paal said. Sourabh Gupta, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies, said the meeting reestablished a baseline of in-person, leader-led communications, restarted senior official-level dialogue channels and was an attempt by the leaders to reassure each other about their strategic intentions. He said that, as a proverb goes, the proof of the pudding will be in its eating. "The problem, after all, is not a lack of positively expressed intentions... but the inability or unwillingness to translate these intentions into actual policy at the US end," Gupta said. "So we will have to wait and see how the 'pudding' tastes this time around." Zhengyu Huang, president of the Committee of 100, a nonprofit organization of prominent Chinese Americans, said that while nothing can be completed in one meeting, what can result is a better understanding of each country's position on key issues and the search to find common ground. "The US and China both face transnational challenges such as food supply, energy security, climate change and global peace. The two countries must work to reduce mutual misunderstandings and strive toward tangible solutions that benefit the world," Huang said. Tom Watkins, president and chief executive officer of TDW and Associates, a US-based business and education consulting firm, said it is plausible that the two presidents are taking steps that raise hopes of propelling the world forward. "Leadership matters," Watkins said. "Peace and prosperity over confrontation and conflict  this is what the people of China, the USA and all of humanity are looking for." \</doc>

By MINLU ZHANG and JI TAO in New York | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-08-31 08:57 Developing nations suffer pain caused by developed states, Pakistan envoy says With Pakistan devastated by unprecedented flooding, the country's ambassador to the United Nations has called on developed countries to take responsibility for climate change. But Munir Akram expressed optimism that the China-proposed Global Development Initiative, or GDI, will play an important role in countering the effects of a warming planet along with easing shortages in global food supplies. "Countries like Pakistan, we are one of the smallest emitters of carbon. We have contributed almost nothing to global warming. But we are the fifth-largest victim of climate change," Akram, the permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told China Daily in an exclusive interview on Friday. "And the droughts, floods, melting of the glaciers &hellip; all of these are contributing factors to the disaster we are facing in Pakistan today in the shape of floods." Floods caused by climate change, monsoon rains, and melting glaciers had killed at least 1,136 people in Pakistan by Monday, and that toll is set to rise further as many communities in the mountainous northern regions remain cut off by flooded rivers that washed away roads and bridges. According to the country's disaster management agency, 33 million people, or 15 percent of the population, have been affected by the floods. The country's climate minister, Sherry Rehman, said a third of the country is under water. Akram said the international community needs a strategy for adaptation to enable developing countries to face these kinds of disasters, and to restrain the impact of flooding and drought on these countries. "We need major projects for adaptation," Akram said. Developing countries are asking for a facility to compensate them for loss and damage, said Akram, who is also the chairman of the Group of 77 and China. The G77 is a group of 134 developing countries at the UN, with the name taken from the number of its founding members. "It is the industrial countries, which have for the last 200 years contributed to global warming. And it is in developing countries, mostly like Pakistan, who are the victims," said Akram. "Therefore for such damage, there should be some mechanism for loss and damage to compensate for those countries for the impacts they are facing, because of the historical policies of industrialized countries that contributed to global warming." Akram said developing countries are looking forward to the 27th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP 27 'Iron brother' "I'm very, very happy, in particular, with the response we received first and foremost from China, which is our 'iron brother'. And it has been a generous response. And we are looking forward to further support from China." A statement issued by China's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday last week said Beijing will provide emergency humanitarian supplies to Pakistan, including 25,000 tents and other supplies, with deliveries to come as soon as possible. The Red Cross Society of China will provide $300,000 in emergency cash assistance to the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, the statement said. The statement said China has already provided 4,000 tents, 50,000 blankets and 50,000 pieces of waterproof canvas in disaster relief for Pakistan under the social and livelihood cooperation framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Of the food crisis threatening countries including Pakistan, Akram said that one lesson Pakistan can learn from China is to eliminate poverty and hunger, and that should also be a development priority for Pakistan. He believes the GDI will make "a great contribution" in addressing these needs, and he hopes the "model can be emulated by developing countries". The initiative is aimed at supporting the development of developing countries, promoting a global economic recovery and strengthening international development cooperation. "And then, of course, China itself is investing, is contributing and creating infrastructure, agriculture infrastructure, support to farmers and support to the continuation of crops that are needed by the world," said Akram. He said these are concrete means through which the GDI will provide the framework to support nations. \</doc>

Heads of State, ministers, and negotiators are now meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the largest annual gathering on climate action. The 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( COP 27 ) discusses issues critical to tackling the climate emergency, from urgently reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building resilience, and adapting to the inevitable impacts of climate change, to delivering on the commitments to finance climate action in developing countries. The recently released United Nations Emissions Gap Report shows a very disappointing picture. Global GHG emissions continued to increase up to 2019. The emissions in 2020 declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but rebounded in 2021, setting a new record at the level of 52.8 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2eq). Emissions under current policies are projected to continue to increase and are forecast to reach 58 GtCO2eq in 2030. Without additional actions, current policies will lead to global warming of 2.8 C over this century. A 2.8 degree increase is unbearable for human life. Thus, in 2015 countries committed to making efforts to limit global warming to below 2.0 C and preferably 1.5 C, the so-called Paris Agreement. Despite all countries at the COP 26 in Glasgow, Scotland, strengthening their intended Nationally Determined Contributions to tackle emissions and mitigate climate change, progress is hugely insufficient, with the emissions reduction of only 0.5 GtCO2eq, less than 1 percent of the projected global emissions in 2030. It is far from the goal and the emissions gap remains high and the world is not on track to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement. Urgent, broad-based, economy-wide transformations are required to drastically cut GHG emissions to avoid the climate catastrophe. Food systems are major contributors not only to climate change, but also to land-use change and biodiversity loss, the depletion of freshwater resources and the pollution of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Adopting a food systems lens implies a cross-sectoral approach that explicitly connects supply and demand sides, and all actors in the food supply chain. It facilitates identifying synergies and trade-offs across interconnected environmental, health and economic dimensions. Globally, food system emissions account for one-third of the total GHG emissions or 18 GtCO2eq per year. The largest source is from agricultural production (39 percent), including the intermediate inputs such as fertilizers, followed by changes in land use (32 percent), and supply chain activities (29 percent), including retail, transport, consumption, fuel production, waste management, industrial processes and packaging. Food system emissions will continue to increase, especially from the food supply chain. The emissions could almost double if nothing is done, and are projected to increase by up to 60 to 90 percent between 2010 and 2050. Food system emissions could prevent achieving the well below 2 C, preferably 1.5 C goal by the end of the century, even if fossil fuel emissions were quickly reduced. The global food system must be transformed rapidly to produce a large emissions reduction and narrow the emissions gap. A range of transformation domains have been identified to cut down the emissions from food systems. The potential to reduce GHG emissions is up to 24.7 GtCO2eq/year through the transformations of the demand-side, protecting natural ecosystems, improving food production and decarbonizing the food value chain. The demand-side changes include dietary changes toward sustainable and nutritionally balanced diets, and reductions in food loss and waste. The protection of natural ecosystems includes reductions in deforestation for agriculture and degradation of agricultural land, and improvements in food production which includes changes in the composition of animal feeds, better rice management, better manure management, and improvements in crop nutrient management, and decarbonizing the food supply chain. China has made an important commitment to realize its carbon peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Food systems can make a significant contribution to these targets. GHG emissions from Chinese food systems are as high as 1.09 billion tons CO2eq, which accounted for about 10 percent of the country's emissions in 2018. Ensuring food security must be the national top priority, but measures such as improving agricultural production technologies, reducing food loss and waste, and changes to dietary patterns are also critical for reducing GHG emissions. Improvements in agricultural production technologies are the most effective stand-alone measures. Many technical measures, such as the improvement of chemical fertilizer use efficiency, the feed conversion rate, and the utilization of livestock manure as a resource have great potential to reduce GHG emissions. According to the 2021 China and Global Food Policy Report, GHG emissions reduction from agricultural activities by 2060 will be 7 to 16 percent and 9 to 23 percent under the scenario of crop technology and the scenario of livestock technology, respectively. The reduction of food loss and waste is also conducive to reducing GHG emissions, with a decrease of 4 to 7 percent in 2060. Dietary changes are the most economically effective abatement options to reduce GHG emissions by individuals and households which can cut GHG emissions by 16 to 24 percent in 2060.GHG emissions from food systems energy consumption can be significantly reduced through comprehensive emissions reduction measures, such as the improvement of energy efficiency and the optimization of the energy consumption structure. Combining all the above measures could cut food systems GHG emissions by 29 to 55 percent in 2060. Actors from all segments of society need to take action to drive transformation and overcome barriers. The government could facilitate this transition by reforming subsidy and tax schemes. The private sector can reduce food loss and waste, use renewable energy, develop new types of food, and reduce carbon emissions. Individual citizens can change their lifestyles to make food choices for environmental sustainability and emissions reduction. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202211/17/63756bfaa31009d72a2f5650.png Link to Image WANG YIMENG/FOR CHINA DAILY \~ \~ Fan Shenggen is the dean of the Academy of Global Food Economics and Policy and chair professor at China Agricultural University.

Illustration: Liu Rui/GT Mouthing high-sounding words while displaying disinterest or incapability in honoring pledges - this is exactly the portrayal of Europe in the face of the global climate issue. Numerous examples can be tossed out, ranging from the West's reluctance to shoulder its historical responsibilities for climate change given their cumulative total of carbon dioxide emissions since the start of the industrial revolution to European leaders skipping climate summit with Africa. According to Politico, African leaders are heading for the Netherlands next month for a climate summit scheduled on September 5, seeking delivery on promised cash to help them cope with climate change, but their European counterparts largely plan to skip the meeting. The lack of in-person engagement from the highest levels of European governments is in stark contrast to the long-distance attendance of the African leaders, Politico commented. Quoting an observer, the report said, "Spending on climate protection in Africa may also seem like a harder sell for European leaders at a time when their citizens face a generational cost-of-living crisis." It is undeniable that this is a grim reality faced by Europe. Energy costs are skyrocketing, and fears about access to electricity and heating are growing. While European countries are looking everywhere for alternatives to Russian energy, politicians are encouraging their citizens to take less showers and not wash their clothes. Amid the backdrop of uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreaks, looming economic recession and surging inflation, it is even uncertain how Europe can survive this winter.\~ Europe's urgent need for energy has shattered its climate commitments. It thus finds itself in an awkward position in keeping a high profile over this topic. If European leaders participate in the summit, what would they say or offer?\~ Such a scenario won't just show up at the climate summit in September, but will continue to the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the UNFCCC (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) in Egypt in November.\~ Nevertheless, even before Europe starts to feel powerless to deal with the climate issue, it was far from taking its due responsibilities. Western countries took the lead in going through industrialization when they emitted carbon dioxide without restraint. After they became developed economies, they moved their manufacturing industries to developing countries - enjoying products made elsewhere, yet demanding the developing world to pay for carbon emissions. In other words, the West-led model of dealing with climate change sacrifices the interests of some other countries to satisfy their own, Shen Yi, a professor at Fudan University, told the Global Times. This explains why whenever climate change is brought up on the internet, netizens from developing countries complain that low-carbon standards, without differentiated responsibilities, is a trap that developed economies have set for developing countries. If Europe has "contributed" anything to environmental protection, it is the game rules collectively formulated by Western countries, aiming at changing the scenario of being overtaken by emerging and developing countries in real economy, as well as reestablishing Europe's hegemony, Shen said. Europe does have its own targets for emissions reductions. But right now, it is heading in the opposite direction, as environmental protection now conflicts with their own interests. Many European countries, including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark, have been quietly restarting coal-fired power. More hypocritically, they now redefine gas and nuclear energy as "green."\~ Even quite a few Westerners are discouraged against the backdrop. Earlier this month, The Sydney Morning Herald published an article entitled, "What if China saved the world and nobody noticed?" which articulate that "the revolution under way in China is truly staggering. They literally lead the world in every 0-emissions technology." Observers note that China's industrial manufacturing capacity is equivalent to that of several Western countries combined, but China's consciousness on environmental protection is particularly strong. It has set high goals for itself, very strict carbon emission standards and plan to hit carbon emission peak. Moreover, China has at the same time provided financial, equipment, technological support to other developing countries to cope with climate change.\~ On the contrary, developed countries have long failed to meet their pledges to deliver financial support to help poorer countries cope with the issue.\~ Western economies, including Europe and the US, seem to care so much about climate change, but their geopolitical strategy is damaging their seemingly good-looking targets. The climate crisis can by no means be solved by one single country. But West-initiated major power games, bloc confrontations, decoupling rhetoric and Cold War mentalities are jeopardizing cooperation prospects on climate protection.\~ The real pressing task for Europe is to address its realistic challenges, stabilize its economy and energy supply, and more significantly, reflect on its strategy of following the US too closely, especially when it comes to creating tensions worldwide. As a result, apart from facilitating American arms dealers to make a fortune, the entire globe, including Europe, is pushed into crises and suffering.\~ It is very telling that West-led rules in global environmental governance no longer work. The time has come for a change, and a quick one indeed. The author is a reporter with the Global Times. HYPERLINK mailto:opinion@globaltimes.com.cn opinion@globaltimes.com.cn \</doc>

LONDON, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission is now overseeing tens of billions of U.S. dollars of spending on fossil fuel infrastructure and supplies amid severe cuts to gas supplies from Russia and soaring energy prices. Meanwhile, the quantity of liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchased by Europe from the United States exceeded the pipeline transported gas purchased from Russia, which means that the United States is replacing Russia to possibly become Europe's largest energy supplier. Europe's current embracing of fossil fuels, so-called "dirty energy," happens a little more than a year after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on July 14 last year: "The fossil fuel economy has reached its limits." On that same day, the European Commission unveiled a package of proposals to put the continent on a path to becoming climate neutral by 2050. Some analysts believe that European and American policies responding to the global energy crisis might be seen as a blow to global climate governance. In the long run, the more emissions accumulate in the early stage, the more difficult the later reduction of emissions will become. STOP-GAP MEASURES To shake off a looming energy crisis, many European countries, including Germany, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands and Denmark have announced the reopening of coal power plants as gas supplies from Russia have slumped amid Western sanctions. They are also countries that once advocated abandoning coal power generation and protecting the environment. Data analysed by the energy think-tank Ember Climate for the Financial Times suggest that European governments will spend at least 50 billion euro (about 48.6 billion dollars) this winter on new and expanded fossil fuel infrastructure and supplies, including gas shipped in from overseas and coal to fuel previously mothballed power plants. Earlier this year, the European Parliament voted in favor of plans to award a green investment label to nuclear and gas projects, which sparked claims of "greenwashing" by some EU member states and environmental lobbyists. The European Commission also announced earlier that "some of the existing coal capacities might be used longer than initially expected" because of the new energy landscape in Europe. In Britain, the government has recently announced a new energy exploitation policy to increase oil and gas production, drawing opposition from climate experts, Green groups and communities. Downing Street argued that the move will help Britain boost domestic energy production, maintain energy security and reduce dependence on imports. For the United States, the global energy crisis has prompted the federal government to expediate domestic renewable energy production and increase its export of natural gas (such as LNG) to the world while prices remain high. "The U.S. is exporting more LNG than ever before, which has been encouraged by the U.S. Department of Energy," Sean Field, a research fellow with the Center for Energy Ethics in the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, has told Xinhua. DEEP REASONS The European countries are making efforts to cut demand, ranging from limiting heating to turning off public lights at night. Given rising gas, oil and electricity prices, more German families are turning to wood for heating. Danish heating company asked customers to "get out warm socks and blankets and try to delay turning on the heating." "It's a very strange time when people are turning to firewood, and planning to get warm at community centers because they can't heat their homes in one of the richest countries, one of the richest regions in the world," Field told Xinhua. He described the current situation in Europe and Britain as delicate because Europe is dependent on Russian natural gas flowing from the east to the west, and Britain is not immune to that. The reasons for the deep energy crisis in Europe, he said, stem from the infrastructure on which their energy is situated. In Britain, "this has really been a crisis constructed over 20 years. And so what we're experiencing right now is acute price crisis, where prices have gone up, what you're potentially facing in the winter is a supply crisis," Field said. The existing energy policy in Europe "is rather vulnerable and lacks resilience in addressing the rapid increase in abnormal demands and decrease in supply chains of energy, and once it encounters natural disasters, such as extreme weather and/or human-induced turmoil, it may create a domino effect, resulting in energy shortages and soaring energy prices and furthermore, affecting the overall process of social and economic development and emission reduction," Tang Xu, professor of Fudan Development Institute and Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences/Institute of Atmospheric Sciences at Fudan University in China, told Xinhua. "The current turmoil suggests that European £mbitious plans' and targets for emission reduction are underestimating the fragility of its processes. Energy redundancy should be a part of ambitious targets, but, as a matter of fact, they (energies) are insufficiently reserved. And the actual implementation is inadequate," he added. "The United States is not solving the climate crisis," Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, told Xinhua. He said that the energy crisis right now is quite complicated because it reflects, in part, the crisis in Ukraine, which in Sachs' view, "never should have happened." The crisis is about a conflict that should be stopped through negotiation, he added. MATTERS MADE FURTHER COMPLICATED The European countries' resorting to fossil fuels is indicative of their desperation, as Virginijus Sinkevicius, European commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, insisted that the EU's climate targets "are not postponed or cancelled." However, the struggle to balance climate change and curbing record-high prices in Europe is set to anger climate change activists due to the long-term effects of fossil fuel use on global warming. "In the short term, the restarting of coal-fired power plants in parts of Europe seemingly undermines climate change commitments," said Field. "But, governments have to grapple with serious ethical questions about meeting the immediate-term energy needs of their citizens while balancing longer-term commitments to curbing climate change and safeguarding the environment for future generations. " Analysts fear some of the bloc's investments in coal and the LNG could yoke it to fossil fuels for longer than planned, putting future emissions targets at risk. In the long run, "the more emissions accumulate in the early stage, the more difficult the later reduction of emissions will become," said Tang. "This will significantly increase the pressure of reducing emissions in the later stage to achieve carbon neutrality. An extraordinary measure on emissions reduction is needed to meet their commitment to the climate targets of the Paris Agreement," he said. At the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Egypt in November, world leaders will again debate how far wealthier nations will go to support developing countries in the climate transition. A pledge in 2009 for richer countries to raise 100 billion dollars yearly in climate financing for vulnerable countries has not been met. And Europe and America's balancing act to end "dirty energy" has complicated matters further. Enditem \</doc>

The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change have demonstrated how the world, as well as the challenges it faces, is interconnected. Sustainable global governance is needed now more than ever before to synergize the development strategies of different states and to address common challenges. Working with the G20 and other international organizations to promote multilateral efforts, China has been playing a pivotal role in containing the global recession and promoting sustainable development by coordinating national development policies, and drawing up general principles for strengthening environmental regulation and supervision. China's understanding of sustainable development emphasizes the need for a holistic, integrated approach to policy and practice. This approach is embedded in China's own domestic processes of economic reform and restructuring, rebalancing of its energy sourcing and climate change mitigation. China's potential contribution to sub-Saharan Africa's green transformation and sustainable development is complex and multifaceted, involving significant issues about access to energy, energy poverty and equity, the linkage of energy, particularly renewable energy resources, to inclusive green growth, transformation and development, and implications for pro-poor strategies. As US economist Joseph E. Stieglitz argued over a decade ago: "Development is about transforming the lives of people, not just transforming economies". The specific importance of renewable energy for sustainable and equitable development has long been recognized. This linkage is central to achieving the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union's Agenda 2063. The implementation of the policy goals and targets of the SDGs and the Agenda 2063 should be effectively synchronized. As the UN's Economic Commission for Africa has argued: "Green technologies offer Africa a chance to 'leapfrog' from carbon-intensive development characterized by wasteful and unsustainable technologies and systems as used by developed countries, by directly transitioning to cleaner and renewable energy sources needed to achieve sustainable development". In response to these arguments and as renewable energy technology has continued to advance, there has been a significant policy focus on the linkages between energy, green growth and transformation in Africa. Despite being rich in renewable energy resources, Africa is yet to generate sufficient electricity for its growing population and economies; currently, about 568 million Africans have no access to electricity. Even among those with grid access to electricity, supply is often unreliable due to poor transmission and distribution networks, resulting in excessive costs to businesses and households. Significant progress has been made to increase investment and improve access but, since the COVID-19 pandemic, investment has dropped by around 30 percent. This threatens to reverse the progress being made to improve access to electricity across Africa. Tackling energy supply to improve access to electricity is a defined objective of many African governments and the African Union in order to enhance economic development, improve livelihoods, and ensure environmental sustainability. Simultaneously, the ambition is to meet global commitments, including SDG 7  ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all  and the Paris Agreement objective to limit global warming to well below 2 C, preferably to 1.5 C, compared to pre-industrial levels. China is prominent in the global renewable industry, particularly the solar photovoltaic sector. It has unparalleled manufacturing capacity of solar panels  eight of the top 10 world suppliers are Chinese  while its domestic annual installment on solar capacity reached over 30 gigawatts in 2019. In 2017, Chinese ministries, led by the newly restructured and empowered Ministry of Ecology and Environment, announced guidelines to develop a green Belt and Road Initiative. Across sub-Saharan Africa, China's renewable energy involvement has been growing. For example, the China-Africa Renewable Energy Cooperation and Innovation Alliance has signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate with the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative for renewable energy generation in Africa to combat climate change and promote sustainable development. A range of pilot projects are being developed, including construction of micro-grids in some African households and villages, in combination with large-scale power construction. The Aysha wind power project, under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, broke ground in May 2018. With a projected total installed capacity of 120 megawatts and an energy output of 467 gigawatt hours per year, the $257 million project is expected to boost the national energy output of Ethiopia, meeting the rising demand for local power grid construction and upgrading. An OECD/IEA 2016 analysis concluded that "a substantial proportion of Chinese power projects in Sub-Saharan Africa are aimed at expanding access to electricity". The study also concludes that in 2010-2020, a total of 120 million people would gain access to electricity through the power grid, enabled by grid development and increasing power generation capacity, of which Chinese contractors are responsible for 30 percent. China also provides rural off-grid solutions by donating solar energy kits to countries such as Rwanda and Comoros. In Rwanda, some 2,000 villagers gained access to electricity through the solar kits provided by China. In addition, distribution projects undertaken by Chinese firms have supported networks and connections. For example, in Angola, Sinohydro has powered homes of about 5,000 people by installing lines and substations. China's contributions are in keeping with China's commitments to the COP 27 and the SDG goals through wider South-South cooperation. China can act as an important catalyst and facilitator to reinforce existing African initiatives, for example, working with its African partners to strengthen existing infrastructures and help develop new energy pools, provide additional impetus for regional and sub-regional integration and help lower energy costs, increase household access and cut energy poverty. Together with other G20 countries, China has an important role to play in finding the requisite finance to support the complex range of policy interventions to meet Africa's energy gap and change the region's energy mix. From a people-centered development perspective, the key requirement of energy programs is to ensure that the pro-poor aims of the multiple policy strands of climate mitigation, green growth, energy access, and renewable energy are mainstreamed and prioritized. \~ HYPERLINK https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202211/22/637c047aa31009d72a2f62a7.png Link to Image JIN DING/CHINA DAILY \~ \~ The author is a senior research fellow and director of the Centre for Rising Powers and Global Development at the Institute of Development Studies in the United Kingdom.

Chinese leaders have been traveling overseas for official duties more frequently in recent times, indicating that face-to-face meetings between political leaders are back after the disruption from Covid-19. This may well be a harbinger of the revival of in-person communication and collaboration among countries. China should now expand international communication by optimizing its Covid-19 prevention and control measures, to create more convenient conditions for cross-border movements of people. This will help build a new type of international relations, shape a human community with a shared future and create a more favorable external environment for China's economic growth. China is proactively conducting diplomacy with countries in its periphery and major powers. Thus, its political leaders' overseas trips are in the spotlight. In mid-September, President Xi Jinping attended the 22nd Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and visited Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Those trips were the first for Chinese political leaders since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic three years ago. A few days ago, Premier Li Keqiang paid an official visit to Cambodia and attended the 25th China-ASEAN (10+1) Summit, the 25th ASEAN plus China, Japan and South Korea (10+3) Summit and the 17th East Asia Summit. These were the first series of meetings among the leadership on East Asian cooperation held in-person after two years. In addition to the frequent trips abroad by Chinese leaders, China is hosting several foreign leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong. With many important international conferences, such as the U.N. Climate Change Conference ( COP27 ), the East Asia Summit, the G-20 Leaders' Summit and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, to be held this month, China is set to promote in-person international exchanges. This is a clear sign that global cooperation has been boosted in the midst of the still-existing pandemic and the evolving international relations. It also shows that face-to-face communication is essential for countries and peoples, and can never be replaced by online meetings. "Friendship, which derives from close contact between the people, holds the key to sound state-to-state relations." After three years of the pandemic, not only do top leaders need face-to-face communication, but also the general public is looking forward to a full return of non-governmental, global interactions. This issue has caught the attention of policymakers, and relevant governments are on the move. A few days ago, Premier Li stressed that China would increase direct flights between the two countries to facilitate people-to-people exchanges in a meeting with German Chancellor Scholz. Six governmental departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, issued "Several Policy Measures to Facilitate Foreign Investment and Improve Quality with a Focus on the Manufacturing Sector." The measures urge "facilitating international travel for business people." Specifically, China should facilitate the entry and exit of multinational companies' executives, technicians and their families to and from their countries, under the premise of ensuring sound virus prevention and control. All localities should make full use of the existing "fast-track" travel channels, including further specifying standards and procedures based on the local conditions, providing convenience for foreigners traveling to China. These measures should be put in place as soon as possible. China has adopted a strict strategy against Covid-19 with the goal of "preventing coronavirus cases being imported from other countries and battling the rebound of Covid cases within the country" since the coronavirus outbreak three years ago. Thanks to this strategy, China has effectively curbed the spread of this virus in the country. Sure, it was necessary to impose strict border controls in the early stage of the pandemic, as the virus was rampant and there were many uncertainties. However, as the virus mutates and the situation changes, control measures set in the early stage should be revised accordingly. Excessively strict controls will add difficulties to international trade and people-to-people exchanges, causing inconvenience for Chinese companies to invest overseas and multinational companies to expand their business in China. As a result, China may lose opportunities that could have been seized, or see investment projects that could have been launched be canceled. There is also the possibility that foreign companies may leave China, despite their long years of operation in this country. The service industry - heavily dependent on human resources - took the hardest hit. In addition, people-to-people exchanges such as international student exchange programs and international academic forums have also been severely affected. The cost of over-regulation has started to be seen and will become even more conspicuous. The Chinese economy faces a larger-than-expected downward pressure this year due to various complex factors in and out of China. Keeping the economy within a reasonable growth range has become a top priority. Hence, introducing policy packages to stabilize the economy is not enough. China must also open wider and better facilitate the "welcoming in" and "going out" of business so as to get the most out of domestic and international markets. To cope with new local and global situations, it has become more urgent than ever to resume normal, cross-border activities in every industry of China. Gradually resuming normal cross-border activities does not mean that China is letting go of its anti-pandemic controls overnight. Rather, it calls for a more balanced coordination between pandemic prevention and economic growth, a more rational and precise controlling practice and an absolute no to drastic measures that have been taken to prevent the spread of the virus. Again, rationality is the only base for fighting the pandemic. China must adapt to the new characteristics of Covid-19 mutation and the new situation of pandemic prevention. It is time for China to learn from other countries' experiences in handling cross-border travelling and communication activities. Banning cross-border in-person activities is easy, yet restoring them is hard. Government departments need to make plans in advance with alternative solutions. On Nov. 10, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held a meeting to review and implement "20 measures" to ease the existing Covid-19 control rules. The meeting called for governments at all levels to improve data analytics and trend forecasting while implementing Covid-19 control measures, as basic infection control measures are vital. It is also essential to fight against irresponsible behaviors, get rid of formalism and bureaucratic acts, and correct approaches such as adopting unnecessary, drastic measures or one-size-fits-all approaches. These measures are completely applicable to achieve the goal of restoring cross-border in-person activities and should be implemented as soon as possible. The report to the 20th National Congress of the CPC proposes to "facilitate cross-border activities to be conducted at all levels, i.e., the levels of the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the military, local governments and the general public." China is a major economy and a rising power in the world. What the country does, as well as what it does not do, will both make a big impact on the world. As Chinese leaders ramp up their overseas visits, we hope the country will see this as a sign to restore more face-to-face cross-border communication and activities while maintaining its online channels.

We note with concern that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and reversed years of progress on poverty, hunger, health care, education, climate change, access to clean water, and environmental protection. We reaffirm our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in all its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner. We stress that the international community should attach more importance to development, revitalize global development partnerships and push for realization of all sustainable development goals by pooling the necessary resources to instill fresh momentum into implementing the 2030 Agenda. We urge donor countries to honour their Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments and to facilitate capacity building and the transfer of technology along with additional development resources to developing countries, in line with the national policy objectives of recipients. We stress the importance of dialogue between the relevant development agencies from the BRICS countries. 53. We commemorate the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and call on all parties to adhere to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances and in accordance with the institutional arrangement of nationally determined contributions, and to implement the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement in an accurate, balanced and comprehensive way, based on existing consensus. We recall relevant provisions of the Paris Agreement, emphasizing that the Paris Agreement aims to strengthen global response to the threat of climate change in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, and that peaking of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions will take longer for developing countries. We underline that the developed countries have historical responsibilities for global climate change, and should take the lead in scaling up mitigation actions and scale up indispensable support to developing countries on finance, technology and capacity-building. We express our support to the incoming Egyptian Presidency of COP27 , working towards the success of COP27 , and promote COP27 to prioritize implementation and highlight the reinforcement of adaptation and delivery and enhancement of developed countries' commitments to provide financial support and technology transfer to developing countries. 54. We oppose green trade barriers and reiterate our commitment to enhancing coordination on these issues. We underline that all measures taken to tackle climate change and bio-diversity loss must be designed, adopted and implemented in full conformity with the WTO agreements and must not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade and must not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade. We express our concern at any discriminatory measure that will distort international trade, risk new trade frictions and shift burden of addressing climate change to other trading partners, developing countries and BRICS members. 55. We acknowledge the positive outcomes of the first phase of the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) and its Kunming Declaration. We welcome and support China's hosting of the second phase of COP15 and call on all parties to jointly adopt an ambitious, balanced and practical Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. 56. As BRICS countries produce around 1/3 of the world's food, we stress our commitment to furthering agricultural cooperation and driving sustainable agricultural and rural development of BRICS countries aimed at safeguarding food security of BRICS countries and the world. We emphasize the strategic importance of agriculture inputs, including, inter alia, fertilizers, on ensuring global food security. We reiterate the importance of implementing the Action Plan 2021-2024 for Agricultural Cooperation of BRICS Countries, and welcome the Strategy on Food Security Cooperation of the BRICS Countries. 57. We take note that the breakthroughs in the applications of digital technologies, such as Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) may play an important role towards sustainable development. We take note of the BRICS Forum on Big Data for Sustainable Development. We support information exchanges and technical cooperation on AI technology. We recall the declaration of the 7th BRICS Communications Ministers meeting recognizing the rapid developments and huge potential of Artificial Intelligence technologies and its value to economic growth. We acknowledge the need to cooperate with each other to build trust, confidence and security, as well as transparency and accountability in promoting trustworthy AI to maximize its potential for the benefit of society and humanity as whole with specific emphasis on marginalized and vulnerable groups of population. We express our concerns on the risk, and ethical dilemma related to Artificial Intelligence, such as privacy, manipulation, bias, human-robot interaction, employment, effects and singularity among others. We encourage BRICS members to work together to deal with such concerns, sharing best practices, conduct comparative study on the subject toward developing a common governance approach which would guide BRICS members on Ethical and responsible use of Artificial Intelligence while facilitating the development of AI. 58. We welcome the establishment of the BRICS Joint Committee on Space Cooperation in line with the Agreement on Cooperation on BRICS Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation and the convening of the first joint committee meeting. We are satisfied with the formulation of working procedures for data exchange and joint observation of the BRICS Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation and appreciate the commissioning of data sharing and exchange of the constellation. We encourage BRICS space authorities to continue to effectively utilize the capacity of the Constellation, and to widely promote application with data of the Constellation, aimed at facilitating the sustainable development of BRICS countries. 59. We commend the proposal to organize the BRICS High-level Forum on Sustainable Development. Taking it as an opportunity, we look forward to deepening cooperation on, inter alia, the fight against COVID-19, digital transformation, resilience and stability of industrial and supply chains and low-carbon development. 60. We reiterate the importance of exchanges and dialogues among BRICS disaster management authorities. We encourage cooperation in key areas including comprehensive disaster reduction capacity, disaster resilient infrastructure and emergency rescue and response, with a view to improving the global and regional disaster management response. 61. We express our support to the African Union Agenda 2063 and to Africa's efforts towards integration through the development of the African Continental Free Trade Area and other means. We stress the importance of issues including industrialization, infrastructure development, food security, health-care, and tackling climate change for the sustainable development of Africa. We support Africa in attaining economic recovery and sustainable development in the post pandemic era. Deepening People-to-People Exchanges 62. We reaffirm the importance of BRICS people-to-people exchanges in enhancing mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation amongst our nations and people. We appreciate the progress made under China's Chairship in 2022, including in the fields of governance, culture, education, sports, arts, films, media, youth and academic exchanges, and look forward to further exchanges and cooperation in these areas. 63. We appreciate the signing of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Agreement between the Governments of the BRICS States on cooperation in the Field of Culture (2022-2026), encourage the BRICS countries to promote the development of digitalization in the field of culture, continue to deepen cooperation in the fields of, inter alia, arts and culture, cultural heritage, cultural industry and cultural alliances under the framework of the action plan, and establish a cultural partnership featuring inclusiveness and mutual learning. 64. We acknowledge the urgent need for tourism industry recovery and the importance of increasing mutual tourist flows and will work towards further strengthening the BRICS Alliance for Green Tourism to promote measures, which can shape a more resilient, sustainable and inclusive tourism sector. 65. We appreciate the progress on education and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) cooperation, especially the establishment of the BRICS TVET Cooperation Alliance which focuses on strengthening communication and dialogue in TVET, promoting substantial cooperation in TVET, integrating TVET with industry, enhancing research collaboration and supporting recognition of TVET standards. Also, the launch of the BRICS Skills Competition will strengthen exchanges and cooperation among the nations. We support the digital transformation in education and TVET space, and commit to ensure education accessibility and equity, and promote the development of quality education.

We are in the toughest period the world economy has faced since the creation of the multilateral system more than three-quarters of a century ago. The quadruple shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, conflict and cost-of-living have undone years of hard-fought development gains. As financial conditions tighten, even countries that had seemed on track to prosperity and stability now stare into the abyss of debt distress, fragility and uncertainty about the future. Coordinated, multilateral action is necessary to tackle the crises we face. Both aid and trade have key roles to play in reversing the impacts of this quadruple shock and putting the world back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We head the three international agencies that comprise the Geneva trade hub\u-243 the World Trade Organization, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the International Trade Centre. The WTO makes and monitors the rules for global trade. UNCTAD delivers research and consensus-building to guide governments. The ITC helps small business go global, especially firms led by women and young entrepreneurs. We work together so that trade works better for development. All three of us share a deep commitment to trade-led prosperity. All three of us understand that a world in crisis means no more business as usual. And all three of us want our organizations to "walk the talk" on making aid and trade deliver for real people. To guide aid and trade toward a better world, policymakers need to pivot in three fundamental ways. First, make trade greener. Global trade can play an important role in a transition to a low-carbon economy. Preliminary research at the WTO suggests that removing tariffs and regulatory trade barriers for a set of energy-related environmental goods would reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 0.6 percent in 2030 just from improved energy efficiency, with additional potential gains from innovation spillovers and as lower prices accelerate the shift toward renewable energy and less carbon-intensive products. Second, make trade more inclusive. Promoting greater trade by small businesses and greater participation by women and youth makes companies and countries more competitive, drives economic transformation and reduces poverty. Yet the ITC business surveys found that one only out of every five exporting companies is women-led. WTO data show that micro, small and medium-sized firms represent around 95 percent of all companies globally but only one-third of total exports. Third, make trade more connected. In our networked world, the future of trade is through digital channels and platforms, especially for small businesses. During the pandemic, we saw how doing business online went from being useful to critical for survival. UNCTAD data shows that digitally delivered services reached almost two-thirds the level of global services exports. These themes will be discussed at the upcoming Global Review of Aid for Trade, which will be held on July 27-29 in Geneva. The event comes one month after the WTO's successful 12th Ministerial Conference, which put trade multilateralism back on track and delivered a landmark agreement on fisheries subsidies, and two months before the COP 27 meeting in Egypt that could determine the world's chances to keep the 1.5 C target alive. The data shows promising signs that aid for trade is tilting toward greater sustainability, inclusivity and connectivity. The OECD and WTO data reveal a record high of nearly $50 billion in aid for trade disbursements in 2020, of which half were either climate or gender related, and one-third supported the digital economy. Despite growing budgetary pressures at home, it is critically important to continue and increase these aid for trade flows. Apart from a stronger thematic focus on sustainability, inclusivity and connectivity, maximizing the contribution of aid for trade to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals requires a resolute focus on the "where" and "how" of delivering development results. This means a focus on those countries whose trade and development needs are highest\u-243 particularly the Least Developed Countries and fragile/conflict-affected countries\u-243 and regional initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Area, to ensure they become stepping-stones to wider and more inclusive regional value chains and trade-led growth. It means partnership across international organizations. The WTO, UNCTAD and the ITC already collaborate on initiatives like the Global Trade Help desk, which simplifies market research by bringing key trade and business information into a single portal, as well as on support to cotton-exporting countries in Africa. Last but certainly not least, it means mobilizing public and private finance. The IFC estimates a worldwide $300 billion financing gap for women\u-243 and the global trade finance gap has nearly doubled from an already-staggering $1.5 trillion. Without access to finance, firms cannot grow, diversify or formalize. We want to end with a call to action. Creating a more sustainable, inclusive and connected future is the moon shot of our times. Aid, trade and multilateralism\u-243 working together\u-243 are part of the solution. It is normal and understandable that governments act to shore up their own economies in troubled times. But we must act now to ensure that the world's poorest and most vulnerable can still see a pathway to prosperity through global trade.

Conservation issues first came to the fore in the global arena half a century ago, when the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972.Three decades ago in 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, also known as the Earth Summit, was convened in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Earth Summit produced many great achievements, especially the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which marked the beginning of global climate change governance. However, humanity's response to climate change has not achieved the desired results. Not only are the efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change sluggish, but also climate change adaptation actions lag far behind what is needed. Unprecedented high temperatures have been reported around the world, even in the Arctic region. This summer, temperatures in the United Kingdom exceeded 40 C since records began, prompting the government to issue the highest-level warning and declare a national climate emergency. And in China, an unusual heat wave persisted for more than 70 days, with temperatures in some parts of the western region soaring to 45 C, and even the lowest night-time temperatures hitting 34 C, which has never happened before in the country and the world. It is obvious that humanity was not fully prepared for the extreme heat. Many countries were caught off guard by the scorching heat, which has taken a heavy toll on people's health. In many places, there is a lack of cooling and other facilities needed to cope with high temperatures, and heat-induced water shortages made it difficult for people to access drinking water. Due to power crunches caused by the intensive heat, lights in subways and shopping malls have had to be switched off to reduce the power load, and people could not use air conditioners. Agricultural production has also suffered because of droughts, raising concerns over food security in some countries and regions. All these highlight the vulnerability of our society to heat waves. The United Nations Environment Programme began issuing the Adaptation Gap Report in 2014 to provide an assessment of the gap between the needs of humanity's adaption to climate change and the reality. The sixth version of the report issued last year, titled The Gathering Storm\u-243 Adapting to Climate Change in a Post-Pandemic World, pointed out the insufficiency in adaptation planning, financing, and implementation worldwide. The report said that implementation rates of climate adaptation actions may not keep up with the increasing levels of climate change, and the world needs to translate policies and plans into concrete and rapid execution and financial support. However, the UNEP fell short of highlighting the impacts of extreme heat waves and the need to build a heat-resilient society. The world should attach greater importance to the impact of extreme heat events on human society. In the recently published Communications Earth & Environment journal, scientists from the United States predicted that deadly heat waves will hit most parts of the world three times more often in the coming decades. Research by the International Labour Organization suggests that by 2090, the GDP losses caused by high temperatures will increase by 20 percent worldwide, and exposure to extreme heat could make it deadly for even the healthiest of people to stay outdoors for a few hours. Since humanity's emissions reduction efforts are far from satisfactory, the planet's temperature will continue rising for at least the next 30 to 40 years, and it is most likely that the world will fail to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to less than 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels. There is a long way to go for humanity to build a heat-resilient world. In an article published in the Oxford Open Climate Change journal in 2021, a total of 19 scholars from around the world made a systematic review on the research on the global climate change adaptation to extreme heat and concluded that a comprehensive understanding of the current state of heat adaptations has not been established. Although 98 countries have documented heat adaptation actions, many of these adaptation strategies lack adequacy and effectiveness as underlined in the UNEP's Adaptation Gap Report. The article said that priority in heat adaptations varies by country and region, and the current global responses to intensifying extreme heat remain largely spontaneous and incremental. Given the severe impacts heat waves have on the world, humanity must enhance research and assessment of responses to high temperatures, and take actions at global, regional, national and community levels. At the 27th meeting of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the UNFCC to be held in Egypt later this year, a special session should be arranged to discuss the global response to extreme heat waves. The UNEP should join hands with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to organize global scientists to review the possible impacts extreme heat could have on humanity in the future as well as the response strategies and measures to be taken. Meanwhile, governments at national and local levels should build heat-resilient communities according to the four-step proposal put forward by the IPCC. It is time for the world to revive the spirit of the UN Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm as well as the Rio Earth Summit, and draw experiences and learn lessons from the environmental governance and climate response practices over the past half a century. Facing the extreme heat, the world should vigorously build heat-resilient societies and strive to create a more sustainable and healthy future.

JERUSALEM, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Jordan signed on Thursday a deal to cooperate in the ecological rehabilitation and sustainable development of the Jordan River, said Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection. For years, the river has suffered from a decrease in precipitation and available natural water, and its state is expected to worsen because of climate change, said the ministry in a statement. The two countries have agreed to construct wastewater treatment facilities, connect communities along the river to advanced sewage infrastructure, and treat other pollution sources, it said. Rehabilitation of the river is an important goal for both countries because of its rich historical heritage and importance as a major tourism site, as well as its high ecological value, the statement noted. The two sides also agreed to establish a regional research center for the river's rehabilitation. The Israeli-Jordanian deal was signed during the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) seeks to strengthen cooperation with Chinese businesses, chairman of the SCZone General Authority has said here in Egypt's Red Sea resort city. "In our promotional campaigns, we are keen to attract Chinese investors," Waleid Gamaleldien told Xinhua recently on the sidelines of the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. He said existing cooperative projects, such as the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone in his country, have shown that Chinese technology and expertise were impressive. "TEDA played a significant role in advancing economic cooperation between Egypt and China and in increasing Chinese investments in Egypt," he added. Commenting on the SCZone's climate action, he said Egypt over the past two years pursued localizing green hydrogen and turning the SCZone into a regional production and trading center for green fuel. The green energy will be used in fueling ships crossing the Suez Canal to reduce emissions, he added. Enditem \</doc>

The intensifying impacts of the climate crisis and its tragic human costs are evident in every region of the world. The science is clear: we are running out of time to preserve a stable climate. At the 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP 27 ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held in Egypt in November, world leaders must accelerate actions to reverse the continuing increases in greenhouse gas emissions if we are to avert the escalating threats to the future of humanity. Global economic growth has undoubtedly produced enormous progress for hundreds of millions of people in both developed and developing countries. A major factor has been the historic achievement of China in lifting some 800 million people out of abject poverty and building a successful, productive economy. But this progress has been achieved at high environmental cost and is now vulnerable to the impacts of environmental degradation and global heating. The most fundamental challenge to the future of humanity is restoring a safe and productive balance between the economy and nature. Young people across the world increasingly understand that the present path of development in the world is leading to catastrophe and that it is also unfair, failing to achieve an equitable distribution of the costs and benefits of globalization and economic growth. In the face of accelerating climate change, governments across the world have now debated for almost 30 years on how to decrease greenhouse gas emissions in 26 Conferences of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. But, over this period, the greenhouse gas emissions have actually increased by around 70 percent. And, while IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) calls for emissions to be halved by 2030  in only seven years  to maintain a chance of limiting global average temperature rise to the relatively safe level of 1.5 C, the current plans of corporate and national fossil fuel producers could lead to further substantial increases in consumption for many years ahead. The climate change crisis is intimately linked to the extensive ecological destruction which now drives migration and threatens economic progress and peace. As phrased by Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, "The human-made crisis engulfing the natural world is just as threatening, perhaps even more so, than the climate crisis." Chinese leadership of the UN Biodiversity Summit in December offers a unique opportunity to stimulate actions on the essentially connected climate and biodiversity crises. As we have failed to cut emissions, the world remains on a path toward disastrous temperature increase of more than 2.4 C, even with the full implementation of targets agreed for 2030, and of at least 2.7 C based on the current policies. The extreme events which we see today are driven by a rise of 1.2 C since pre-industrial times: we are right therefore to fear that a rise of 2.4 C or more will have catastrophic consequences, especially for the poor who are least responsible for the climate changes. Strong climate action is even more urgent because the interactive, dynamic systems which drive the global climate will behave in non-linear ways, both separately and together. There is now intense concern in the scientific and expert communities that rising anthropogenic emissions are pushing these systems beyond critical thresholds, triggering "positive feedback loops" which will provoke sudden shocks and drive irreversible "runaway" climate change, beyond human influence. We can still avoid such dangerous outcomes. We have had, for many years, the understanding, the technological solutions and the resources needed to achieve a rapid transition to a safer, more sustainable path for the future of humanity. There is a remarkable opportunity to mitigate emerging threats and to create the new green economies and employment of the future  but time is short. In any case, the costs of action will be immeasurably less than the human and civilizational costs of inaction. To achieve a just transition to a low-carbon, equitable and sustainable world, policies, management and institutions must be framed around five realities: The current processes of international negotiation must be revised; deep structural changes are required in economic, energy and financial systems to correct the causes, not the symptoms of the environmental crisis; economic and finance policies must now be framed to respect and include the environmental facets of policy in integrated strategies for sustainable progress; corrective action must engage the full world community and must be founded on climate justice, solidarity and human rights; public support must be mobilized for strong climate action to overcome the ideological and commercial vested interests which obstruct essential change. The human, social, economic and financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with the intensifying impacts of climate change, have created a radically new global situation, now compounded by the conflict in Ukraine and by major on-going shifts in the geopolitical landscape. We will not be able to master the multiple crises of the 21st century with the entrenched models and methodologies of the 20th century. We are at a turning point in human affairs, as was the case following World War I and II. World leaders were then able to implement major transformations of policies and institutions to advance economic progress and to avert the risks of further conflict. We need a similar degree of vision, statesmanship and institutional innovation today. Over four decades of reform and development, since proposing the Four Modernizations in 1978, China's policy priorities have evolved from a focus on growth and employment in the 1980s to a broader view of an all-round xiaokang prosperous society, and now toward the current goal, defined by President Xi Jinping, of an ecological civilization. In particular, Chinese environmental policies have evolved remarkably. A key step in 1992 was the establishment of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development, which mobilizes national and international expertise in science and policy across the world to provide regular advice to the leadership of China on strategies and measures to achieve sustainable development. The Chinese leadership has taken strong and sustained measures to reduce the country's dependence on coal and to promote emissions reduction and sustainable development. But China still accounts for more than half of global demand for coal which supplies around 56 percent of China's power and employs millions. To avert the risks and impacts of intensifying global heating on China itself and on the wider world, China will have to cut its emissions faster and accelerate its current plan to achieve net-zero by 2060. China can play a crucial role in the next phase of efforts by the international community to master the existential threats of climate destabilization and to achieve sustainable and equitable development, through four transformations: First, accelerating the restructuring of its national economic and energy systems to cut its emissions more rapidly. Second, promoting shifts in domestic consumption and behavior to reduce resource exploitation, energy use, pollution and waste. Third, supporting developing countries in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change through finance, technology and expertise. Fourth, participating in cooperative global leadership to contain the overarching climate crisis and to build a fair, peaceful and sustainable world.

To address climate change, developed countries should step up to their historical responsibilities and fulfill their international obligations, China said on Wednesday. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks at a routine press briefing in Beijing about a report commissioned by the COP26 and COP27 climate summit hosts, which said developing countries needed investment well beyond $2 trillion annually to stop global warming and cope with its effects.  The global process on climate change now faces severe challenges and developing countries have suffered the most from climate change, Zhao said. China supported reasonable arrangements on the issue of loss and damage which was of great concern to developing countries, he said.  Developed countries should deliver on their promise of mobilizing $100 billion per year for climate action in developing countries as soon as possible, offer a roadmap for doubling adaptation finance and take credible steps to help developing countries improve climate resilience, enhance mutual trust between the North and the South and form greater synergy in actions, the ministry spokesperson said. \</doc>

Mangroves are dense coastal forests covering the planet's tropical and subtropical belt. Although they account for only about 0.7 percent of tropical forests across the world, they play a vital role in maintaining the health of the human planet. They serve as a protective shield for people and property along the tropical and subtropical coastal areas against storm surges, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. Mangroves are also one of the most effective carbon sequestration powerhouses, converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon more than four times faster than tropical rainforests. According to studies, the carbon stored in mangroves worldwide is equivalent to over 21 billion metric tons of CO2, but destruction of mangrove ecosystems would release the stored carbon back into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change even more. Between 2000 and 2012, global carbon emissions due to mangrove destruction might have reached as high as 317 million tons, or 24 million tons per year. If the world's 6,600 square kilometers of "highly restorable" mangroves were fully returned, over 1.3 billion tons of CO2 could be captured, which is equivalent to over three years of emissions for a country such as Australia. The contribution of mangroves to climate change mitigation should not be underestimated. While mangroves, known as the "guardians of the coast", are protecting the planet on which mankind depends, they are deeply affected by climate change, overexploitation, invasive alien species, environmental pollution and other anthropogenic threats. The Global Mangrove Alliance's report of the State of the World's Mangroves, released in 2021, showed that while there were approximately 136,000 sq km of mangroves worldwide in 2016, the area decreased by 5,807.2 sq km from what it was 20 years before, equivalent to about 4 percent of the mangrove area in 1996. The report also indicated that over 60 percent of global mangrove loss since 2000 had been caused by the direct or indirect impact of human activities, mainly in Indonesia, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Another research points out that from 1980 to 2000, mangroves decreased by 20 to 35 percent worldwide, with an average annual reduction of over 1 percent, and only about 150,000 sq km remained by 2000. At this rate, almost all of the world's mangroves will disappear in the next 100 years if effective measures are not taken to protect them. Fortunately, as awareness of the importance of mangrove ecosystems has increased in recent years, the potential and hope for mangrove conservation and restoration on a global scale has grown. Not only in China, but also globally, mangroves have changed from the fastest disappearing ecosystem to one of the best protected: 42 percent of the world's remaining mangroves are now within protected areas. The data in 2016 showed that the area of new mangroves exceeded that of lost mangroves that year, although only a small proportion of the new mangrove area came from artificial restoration efforts. This is an encouraging and positive sign. There are approximately 6,600 sq km of highly restorable mangroves worldwide. One study estimates that restoring all of these mangroves will require an investment of roughly $11.1 billion over a period of 20 years after 2020. How to bridge this financing gap remains a challenge for the international community. Although global climate finance exceeded $579 billion in 2017-18, a 25 percent increase from 2015-16, coastal ecosystems, including mangroves, are being overlooked by global climate finance, with only $300 million of climate adaptation finance going to coastal ecosystem conservation, representing about 0.05 percent of the total global climate finance. The good news is that progress has been made in exploring and identifying innovative ways to invest in mangroves. New financial mechanisms such as the carbon markets, blue bonds, as well as insurance and reinsurance products, will provide additional opportunities for mangrove conservation and restoration. "Hybrid" financing models that combine private capital with philanthropic or government grants are also being developed. China is also actively exploring new financing mechanisms for mangrove restoration. In 2020, China began implementing a national action plan for mangrove restoration and exploring market-based mechanisms to promote mangrove conservation and restoration. To this end, the Ministry of Natural Resources has introduced an incentive to grant local governments more land for construction, equivalent to 40 percent of the area reforested with mangroves annually. According to estimates, this policy will draw billions of yuan from private entities and investors to participate and invest in mangrove conservation and restoration, which will, in turn, attract more institutional investors from the capital markets. In June 2021, the mangrove reforestation project of Zhanjiang, Guangdong province, became the first blue carbon trading project in China, attracting private investors to participate in the conservation and restoration of mangroves. The project has become an important example of promoting the conservation and restoration of mangrove ecosystems in China. On April 28, Zhanjiang went a step further when the Zhanjiang Central Branch of the People's Bank of China, Zhanjiang Financial Supervisory Bureau and Zhanjiang Branch Office of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission jointly issued China's first document on financial support for the conservation of mangrove and marine ecological areas\u-243 Guidance on Financial Support for Building a City of Mangroves in Zhanjiang. The guidance specifies that financial institutions should not only actively support the conservation and restoration of mangrove ecosystems, but also carry out financial innovation to help revitalize the "City of Mangroves", exploring and broadening financing channels from green credit, blue carbon, insurance, bonds and other aspects to meet the financial needs of building a "City of Mangroves". The year 2022 is deemed to be a critical year for the future of mangroves. The 14th meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the COP 27 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the second phase of the COP 15 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity will be held in 2022. Due to the strong linkages to the implementation of these conventions, mangrove conservation and restoration should be one of the priority topics at these conferences. It is time to include mangroves as a nature-based solution to the climate and biodiversity crises, setting ambitious but programmatic targets for mangrove conservation and restoration at these conferences backed up by financial commitments to ensure the targets are achieved.

SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt agreed on Tuesday to develop one of the world's largest onshore wind farms in Egypt, Egypt's presidency said in a statement on its website. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the two countries to launch the 10-gigawatt wind power project in Egypt, the statement added. The signing took place on the sidelines of the ongoing 27th session of the Conference of the Parties ( COP27 ) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. "The deal is consistent with our commitment to advance renewable energy solutions that support sustainable development," the UAE leader tweeted. The project will offset 23.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to around 9 percent of Egypt's current carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Emirates News Agency, the UAE's official news agency.

Reaching carbon neutrality is and should remain our common No 1 global objective, one that unites the people and the countries of this world. Based on what we know, which is the catastrophic consequences of global warming, it will always be terribly complex given the magnitude of the necessary changes in our economies, in our production, in our logistics, and in our consumption patterns and systems. But we have to keep facing together the main international challenges of decarbonization around three main issues: trade, finance and technology. And what these three topics have in common is that they all require global coordination, and are hence governance problems. In theory, carbon pricing is the ideal policy for markets to internalize environmental externalities that so far have remained externalized. And this is roughly the way to go. If we properly price carbon, then market forces will readjust, relative prices will change, and the international division of labor will adjust to these new relative prices in a more carbon-efficient way. Global market capitalism can, with this, adjust. This is the theory. Unfortunately, it's much more difficult in practice for a variety of reasons, which have to do with the heterogeneity that we have in decarbonization on this planet. Heterogeneity in the time horizons for reaching zero net carbon: 2060 for China, 2050 for the European Union and the United States. Heterogeneity in the time horizons for carbon peaking: China's is still to come, while Europe's for instance, is way behind us. Also, heterogeneity in the tools for decarbonization: taxation, subsidization, carbon trading, as well as other regulatory tools such as the regulation of carbon content in manufactured items. This very big heterogeneity of trajectories, tools and speeds creates a risk for international trade, as uncoordinated trade measures will inevitably lead to carbon leakage, producers trying to move from places where carbon is highly priced or regulated to places where it is priced at a lower level or much less regulated. And this is a big challenge for international trade, which for instance the EU has started addressing with its carbon border mechanism. I am one of the authors, together with the Brussels-based Jacques Delors Institute of the first template of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which we tabled during the spring in 2020.This tool is now moving forward, and it will probably start to be enforced in 2024 or 2025. We suggest creating in the World Trade Organization a special forum to compare this type of instrument with others in order to facilitate their compatibility. Decarbonization or reaching carbon neutrality, whatever the time horizon, also necessitates massive investments in many areas, such as renewable energy production, mobility and energy saving in manufacturing or housing. COP 27 in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt, later this year, we will have increased convergence at the international level between financial institutions, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and regional development banks, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to match this North\u-243 South finance gap, which I see as a big looming problem for both public and private funding. Especially if we factor in the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on these countries a disproportionately negative impact, thus constraining even more than in the past their capacity to raise money on international markets. That's an urgent issue which I see as necessitating much more global governance. The recent creation of the International Sustainability Standards Board is a good example of what is needed. The third big global coordination challenge is about technology. If we read carefully the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, we have to recognize its determination, according to which overshooting the 1.5 C threshold is now, and I quote, "almost inevitable". This is very bad news. The consequences of overshooting this 1.5 C threshold are extremely negative for most countries. And this forecast necessitates us to look again at this combination of mitigation, less emissions and adaptation, making sure that our economies and our societies can cope with global warming. We should also look at various technologies which could help in emitting less and absorbing more carbon, or limiting the impact of the greenhouse effect. And these technologies are around carbon capture or even solar reengineering. These technologies also raise serious global governance issues. We cannot reach carbon neutrality without a strong cooperation between the US, EU and China. Nevertheless, in the US, it will probably be slower than we would wish or expect. This leaves a big responsibility on the shoulders of China and Europe. The EU was instrumental in transferring its own technology, the carbon trading system, to China, which is now operating a sort of European-like trading system with Chinese characteristics. This is a good base. And we have to leverage this good base in trying to expand this to other countries, showing that it works for a highly developed economy like a Europe, or a rapidly emerging economy such as China. Also, both the EU and China have massive financial resources, financial reserves with savings, and a sophisticated financial system that could help both public and private investment to move more from the North or China to the South. And finally, on the technological and scientific challenges, such as carbon capture and geo-engineering, Chinese and European scientists are at the frontier of new discoveries in this area and they probably can work together to help accelerate the availability of beneficial technology stemming from the scientific research.

Chinese President Xi Jinping meets with US President Joe Biden on November 14, 2022 on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders' Summit in Bali, Indonesia. Photo: Xinhua Current state of China-US relations is not in the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples, and is not what the international community expects, Chinese President Xi Jinping said during his meeting with US President Joe Biden in Bali, Indonesia on Monday, which marked the first face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the world's two biggest economies since Biden took office. During the meeting, which reportedly lasted about three hours and 12 minutes, Xi told Biden that as leaders of two major countries, they need to chart the right course and find the right direction for bilateral ties and elevate the relationship, according to Xinhua. Xi also stressed that the two countries should take history as a mirror and let it guide the future. The two leaders consider that the meeting, is in-depth, candid and constructive, and they instructed the teams of the two countries to follow up the key consensuses reached by the two leaders, to take concrete actions to push the China-US relations return to a stable track for development, and the two leaders agree to keep contacts constantly, CCTV reported.\~ Such remarks and the summit itself inject a certain degree of positivity into bilateral relations, which have entered a downward spiral due to the US' ever widening containment strategy against China, and especially after the provocative visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the island of Taiwan, Chinese analysts noted, calling on the US to stay true to its pledges to avoid confrontation. The stakes for the summit, which took place one day before the G20 Leaders' Summit was set to kick off in Bali, couldn't be any higher, as the world, with growing concerns over the state of the world's most consequential bilateral relationship, watched intently for any positive signs that the two countries will try to work toward lowering tensions and cooperate on global issues. Constructive signs After a handshake, the two leaders walked into a spacious room together and delivered opening remarks that lasted over six minutes, with both stressing the importance of the face-to-face meeting.\~ Xi said that though the two leaders have maintained communication via video-conferences, phone calls and letters, but none of these can really take the place of face-to-face exchanges, according to the Xinhua News Agency.\~ Xi expounded on the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and its key outcomes, pointing out that the domestic and foreign policies of the CPC and the Chinese government are open and transparent, with clearly stated and transparent strategic intentions and great continuity and stability. China is advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, basing our efforts on the goal of meeting people's aspirations for a better life, unswervingly pursuing reform and opening-up, and promoting the building of an open global economy, Xi said. For his part, Biden also said that there was "no substitute" for such face-to-face meetings, according to video footage carried by several media outlets. Biden said to Xi in front of the press before the close-door meeting that "China and the US can manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation."\~ "The world expects, I believe, China and the US to play key roles in addressing global challenges," he said. Since Biden took office, the two leaders have talked over the phone or via video link five times. The last time they met in person was in 2017 during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\~ The meeting on Monday took place at the request of the US side at the Mulia Resort in Bali overlooking the Pacific Ocean. China Media Group said that the meeting was held at the hotel where the Chinese delegation to the G20 stayed.\~ According to the readout released by the White House, Biden remained tough on topics that are China's internal affairs, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Xizang (Tibet). Chinese analysts said the US has failed to realize that it was its unilateral, arrogant and hostile strategy against China that put bilateral ties in risk of spiraling out of control and toward direct conflict, and in the future, the risk of confrontation between the two great powers will still exist if the US refuses to change its arrogant attitude and hostile strategy.\~ China-US relations should not be a zero-sum game where one side out-competes or thrives at the expense of the other, Xi said. The successes of China and the US are opportunities, not challenges, for each other. The world is big enough for the two countries to develop themselves and prosper together, he added. The two sides should form a correct perception of each other's domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions, Xi said, adding that China-US interactions should be defined by dialogue and win-win cooperation, not confrontation and zero-sum competition. Chinese analysts said the Xi-Biden summit sent a positive signal to the world that even though tensions exist, the world's two biggest economies remain in communication and share the consensus of avoiding direct conflict, and are also trying to seek the possibility of cooperation. Redlines and guardrails\~ Ahead of the meeting with Xi, Biden and the US side released information to the press that they are trying to build "floor" or "guardrails" for US-China ties in the first face-to-face talk with the Chinese leader, in other words, the US side wants to show that they are making efforts to prevent bilateral relations from going out of control, analysts said. However, the US is the one that should be held responsible for the worsening of the tensions, as its strategy for "competition," confrontation in fact, has seriously undermined China's sovereignty on sensitive issues like the Taiwan question and China's development in science and technology, especially in the semiconductor industry, so China is also using the chance to "draw redlines" for the US, warning the opportunists and hawkish politicians in Washington about the danger of challenging China's core interests, experts said. Xi gave a full account of the origin of the Taiwan question and China's principled position. He stressed that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.\~ Anyone that seeks to split Taiwan from China will be violating the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, Xi said, adding that the Chinese people will absolutely not let that happen. China hopes to see, and are all along committed to, peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, but cross-Straits peace and stability and "Taiwan independence" are as irreconcilable as water and fire, Xi said, expressing hope that the US side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiques.\~ Xi said "President Biden has said on many occasions that the US does not support 'Taiwan independence' and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. China hopes that the US side will act on this assurance to real effect." Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times that "the US will continue to provoke China on the Taiwan question. After the midterm elections, Republicans are set to take the House, and the new Republican House speaker will very likely follow what Pelosi has done to visit the island, to show that Republicans dare to be tough against China." Apart from this, the two major US parties will push the Taiwan Policy Act to keep forcing the White House to abandon strategic ambiguity on the Taiwan question, and this will then bring a new round of serious impacts on China-US relations, Jin said. "So it's important for the Chinese leader to warn the US side again about where the redline is and what would happen if the US crosses the redline. This is how China is making efforts to prevent direct conflict while the US is being provocative," the anonymous expert said.\~ Biden reaffirmed that a stable and prosperous China is good for the US and the world, saying that the US respects China's system, and does not seek to change it. The US does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, does not support "Taiwan independence," does not support "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and has no intention to have a conflict with China, he said, adding that the US side has no intention to seek "decoupling" from China, to halt China's economic development, or to contain China. Seeking or exploring possibilities for cooperation is a way to prevent conflict, experts said. In fact, China and the US share common ground in many aspects, from climate change to the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula and Iran, as well as handling the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine crisis and dealing with the food and energy crises, Jin said.\~ During the meeting, the two sides vowed to keep constant strategic communication between the diplomatic teams of the two sides, and agreed that the teams on financial affairs from the two countries would have dialogues and coordination on macroeconomic policies and trade issues. The Chinese and US leaders also agreed to make joint efforts to push the UN Climate Change Conference COP27 to reach success The two sides also reached consensus to promote cooperation and dialogues in the fields of public health, agriculture and food security, and the two sides also agree that the people-to-people exchanges are very important, and agree to encourage the expansion of exchanges between personnel from various areas of the two countries, according to China Central Television. \</doc>

By Erik Nilsson | China Daily | Updated: 2022-12-02 09:35 Editor's Note: The highly anticipated second phase of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity will soon start in Montreal, Canada. What should you expect? And what's China's role in the COP15 presidency? Erik Nilsson, a senior reporter at China Daily, spoke with Huang Runqiu, COP15 president and China's minister of ecology and environment, about the upcoming conference and more. Here are the excerpts: This year marks the 30th anniversary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). In your view, why is biodiversity conservation important? And what challenges does the world face in this respect? As a Chinese saying goes, "All beings flourish when they live in harmony and receive nourishment from nature." Biodiversity lays the foundation for human survival and development. Our clothing, food, shelter, means of travel - every aspect of our material and cultural lives - are closely related to biodiversity. Data show that about half of global GDP is related to biodiversity. Over 3 billion livelihoods depend on marine and coastal biodiversity. Over 1.6 billion livelihoods depend on forests and non-lumber forest products. And about 70 percent of people living in poverty depend on activities such as agriculture, fishing and forestry. As for healthcare, 70 percent of cancer drugs are natural products or originate from chemical compounds found in natural products. In addition, biodiversity plays an important role in maintaining the natural ecological balance - for instance, by purifying the environment, preventing or mediating natural disasters, safeguarding food security and protecting human health. Over the years, the international community has become fully aware that biodiversity is of the utmost importance and has acted to protect it. However, the global biodiversity crisis is worsening. Due to human activity, 75 percent of the terrestrial environment and 66 percent of the marine environment have been significantly altered. In addition, more than 85 percent of wetlands have been lost, and about one-fourth of species face the threat of extinction, according to a report published by the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystems Services in May 2019. The International Union for Conservation of Nature said in a 2020 report that 41 percent of amphibians, 26 percent of mammals and 14 percent of birds are threatened with extinction. In the face of global biodiversity loss, we humans have a shared future, and no country, organization or individual can remain apart. Last year, President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the leaders' summit of the first phase of the COP15. He said that the international community must enhance cooperation, build consensus and pool strength to build a community of all life on Earth. Therefore, the international community should work together to advance biodiversity protection, champion harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, respect, adapt to and protect nature, promote global cooperation in biodiversity protection and uphold multilateralism and the principle of equal consultation. Only in this way can we pool strength to protect biodiversity, achieve win-win results and build a better home together. Global biodiversity loss is accelerating, and this is a challenge for all humankind. What achievements has China made in recent years in this respect? We have made clear progress in conserving biodiversity and have earned international acclaim. For instance, the population of wild giant pandas has increased from 1,114 to 1,864. Their classification has been downgraded from "endangered" to "vulnerable". Yangtze finless porpoises now frequently appear in different sections of the Yangtze River. Snow leopards have been frequently spotted in the Sanjiangyuan National Park. Marbled cats, which had not been seen for more than 30 years, have reappeared in the Gaoligong Mountains in Yunnan province. The wild population of Hainan black-crested gibbons has increased from fewer than 10 in two groups 40 years ago, to 36 in five groups. The crested ibis population has increased from only seven in 1981 to over 5,000, and the population of Tibetan antelopes has grown from 70,000 during the 1980s-1990s to more than 300,000. In our view, this progress can be attributed to several factors. First, we have increased efforts at the administrative level. We have elevated biodiversity protection to a national strategy in China. We have drafted or revised a series of relevant laws and regulations, included biodiversity conservation in development plans for governments at the central and local levels and have actively pushed for mainstream protection. Over the past decade, China has drafted and revised 20 laws and regulations pertinent to biodiversity conservation, including laws on forestry, grasslands, fisheries, wild animals, the environment, seeds, wetlands, the Yangtze River and biosecurity. We have also rolled out the Opinions on Further Strengthening the Protection of Biological Diversity and have implemented the China National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (2011-30). Second, we have established a system of protected areas with a focus on national parks. To date, China has established its first five national parks, nearly 200 botanical gardens and 250 wildlife rehabilitation and breeding centers. It has created nearly 10,000 protected areas of all types and at all levels, accounting for about 18 percent of its surface area. In this respect, we have achieved the 17 percent mandated by the Aichi Target 11 ahead of time. China has also set up a relatively complete ex situ conservation system, including botanical gardens, germ plasm-resource centers, gene banks and wildlife rehabilitation and breeding centers. Third, we have strengthened the conservation and restoration of natural spaces. We have taken the initiative to draw ecological conservation red lines nationwide, which is an innovation, globally. The red lines cover zones that are critical to environmental function or are ecologically sensitive, and stringent protection is enforced in those areas. They account for 31.7 percent of China's total land area and protect nearly 40 percent of the water-source conservation and flood-regulation resources, 32 percent of those used to fend off sandstorms, and 45 percent of those designated for carbon storage. Our forest coverage and forest reserves have both maintained growth over the last 30 years. Fourth, we have raised public awareness and encouraged social participation. We have encouraged the involvement of various parties, facilitated ways for them to participate and improved incentive mechanisms. On important occasions, such as the International Day for Biological Diversity and World Environment Day, events are held to promote public awareness of biodiversity. Public awareness and participation are continuing to grow, and an atmosphere in which everyone works to promote biodiversity conservation is gradually taking shape. What is China doing to implement its plans? China plans to make efforts in multiple fields. The first is to improve policies and regulations on biodiversity. We will update the China National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (2011-30) and improve the policy and system guarantees. We will actively study and plan for special legislation on biodiversity and make the legal system for biodiversity conservation more systematic and complete. We will enact solution-based laws in areas such as nature reserves and improve corresponding supervisory systems. We will also strictly implement the Biosecurity Law, strengthen the environmental safety management of biotechnologies and continue to improve the prevention and control of invasive species. Second, we will continue to optimize the biodiversity conservation network and promote the systematic restoration of environments. We will continue to implement major projects for biodiversity conservation, step up the construction of a system of protected areas with national parks as the mainstay, strengthen the protection and supervision of key areas and improve the ex situ conservation system for rare and endangered animals and plants. We will also focus on building a complete biodiversity-protection monitoring system, continue to carry out biodiversity background surveys, observation and evaluations, improve the technical standard system related to biodiversity surveying and monitoring and explore ways to establish technical systems for biodiversity evaluation and for protection effectiveness assessment. Third, we will strengthen the sustainable use of biodiversity. Without good and sustainable use, it is difficult to achieve effective conservation. Therefore, we will build a whole-process, whole-chain and regular biodiversity protection and supervision mechanism and crack down on the illegal use of biological resources. We will strengthen technical research on the development and sustainable use of biological resources, oversee and regulate biodiversity-friendly business activities, promote the development of green industries and franchising, and create a high-quality, diversified ecological product system. Fourth, we will also deepen international cooperation and exchange. We will incorporate the topic of biodiversity conservation into high-level international exchange, promote international cooperation on the issue at high levels, actively participate in global biodiversity governance, honor the CBD and other international conventions, strengthen communication, enhance partnership recognition and promote global multilateral environmental governance according to our stated national concept of building a shared future for all life on Earth. Last but not least, we will encourage public involvement. We need to be innovative in terms of popularization and education and enhance public awareness of and attention to biodiversity through understanding the concept of biodiversity. The second phase of COP15, to be held in Montreal, will define and adopt the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Could you describe the consultation process, the results so far and the positive role that China has played during its presidency? The main task of COP15's second phase is to draw upon past experience in the development and implementation of previous global targets on biodiversity to formulate the post-2020 GBF. The aim is to put global biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030 - that is, to end the current situation of biodiversity loss. It can be said that the framework is a guiding political document on global biodiversity governance. There are also high hopes for its adoption during the meeting. Currently, the structure and core content of the post-2020 framework has been agreed upon, laying a solid foundation for finalizing a solution that is acceptable to all concerned parties. There is much work to be done to ensure that the targets set by the framework are realistic yet ambitious, practical and balanced, and that they help promote the sustainable recovery of biodiversity. In addition, the framework's realization ultimately depends on its implementation mechanism. For developing countries, the biggest concern is the mobilization of funds. Funding is obviously very important. It's an important and difficult part of the negotiations. Since assuming the COP15 presidency, China has exercised leadership and coordination in its efforts to advance negotiations for the post-2020 GBF. So far, China has convened 37 COP15 meetings of the presidium. It has also presided over four meetings of the open-ended working group on the post-2020 GBF in Geneva and Nairobi, among other locations, in collaboration with the CBD secretariat. China has made significant efforts to advance framework negotiations. Frequent meetings, especially presidium meetings, are quite rare in the process of multilateral environmental negotiations. Moreover, China has made use of gatherings such as the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the G20 Joint Environment and Climate Ministerial Meeting, the high-level week of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly, and COP27 , to organize exchanges on key COP15 issues. These efforts have both maintained the political momentum of COP15 and facilitated the bridging of differences among contracting parties to achieve greater consensus. Although there are still many difficulties and demands, all parties have expressed their firm political support and confidence in the negotiation process and in China's role in the COP15 presidency. I am confident the international community will respond positively to the spirit of community embodied in the theme of the upcoming conference "Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth" and demonstrate the wisdom and courage to overcome these difficulties and differences. During the second phase of COP15, China will continue to perform its presidency well. With the support of the CBD secretariat, the presidium and the host country, China will work with fellow contracting parties, international organizations and stakeholders and spare no effort in advancing the negotiation process, building the broadest possible consensus in the international community, promoting the adoption of the framework and ensuring the second phase of COP15 in Montreal is successful. \</doc>

Therefore, the international community should work together to advance biodiversity protection, champion harmonious coexistence between humans and nature, respect, adapt to and protect nature, promote global cooperation in biodiversity protection and uphold multilateralism and the principle of equal consultation. Only in this way can we pool strength to protect biodiversity, achieve win-win results and build a better home together. Global biodiversity loss is accelerating, and this is a challenge for all humankind. What achievements has China made in recent years in this respect? We have made clear progress in conserving biodiversity and have earned international acclaim. For instance, the population of wild giant pandas has increased from 1,114 to 1,864. Their classification has been downgraded from "endangered" to "vulnerable". Yangtze finless porpoises now frequently appear in different sections of the Yangtze River. Snow leopards have been frequently spotted in the Sanjiangyuan National Park. Marbled cats, which had not been seen for more than 30 years, have reappeared in the Gaoligong Mountains in Yunnan province. The wild population of Hainan black-crested gibbons has increased from fewer than 10 in two groups 40 years ago, to 36 in five groups. The crested ibis population has increased from only seven in 1981 to over 5,000, and the population of Tibetan antelopes has grown from 70,000 during the 1980s-1990s to more than 300,000. In our view, this progress can be attributed to several factors. First, we have increased efforts at the administrative level. We have elevated biodiversity protection to a national strategy in China. We have drafted or revised a series of relevant laws and regulations, included biodiversity conservation in development plans for governments at the central and local levels and have actively pushed for mainstream protection. Over the past decade, China has drafted and revised 20 laws and regulations pertinent to biodiversity conservation, including laws on forestry, grasslands, fisheries, wild animals, the environment, seeds, wetlands, the Yangtze River and biosecurity. We have also rolled out the Opinions on Further Strengthening the Protection of Biological Diversity and have implemented the China National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (2011-30). Second, we have established a system of protected areas with a focus on national parks. To date, China has established its first five national parks, nearly 200 botanical gardens and 250 wildlife rehabilitation and breeding centers. It has created nearly 10,000 protected areas of all types and at all levels, accounting for about 18 percent of its surface area. In this respect, we have achieved the 17 percent mandated by the Aichi Target 11 ahead of time. China has also set up a relatively complete ex situ conservation system, including botanical gardens, germ plasm-resource centers, gene banks and wildlife rehabilitation and breeding centers. Third, we have strengthened the conservation and restoration of natural spaces. We have taken the initiative to draw ecological conservation red lines nationwide, which is an innovation, globally. The red lines cover zones that are critical to environmental function or are ecologically sensitive, and stringent protection is enforced in those areas. They account for 31.7 percent of China's total land area and protect nearly 40 percent of the water-source conservation and flood-regulation resources, 32 percent of those used to fend off sandstorms, and 45 percent of those designated for carbon storage. Our forest coverage and forest reserves have both maintained growth over the last 30 years. Fourth, we have raised public awareness and encouraged social participation. We have encouraged the involvement of various parties, facilitated ways for them to participate and improved incentive mechanisms. On important occasions, such as the International Day for Biological Diversity and World Environment Day, events are held to promote public awareness of biodiversity. Public awareness and participation are continuing to grow, and an atmosphere in which everyone works to promote biodiversity conservation is gradually taking shape. What is China doing to implement its plans? China plans to make efforts in multiple fields. The first is to improve policies and regulations on biodiversity. We will update the China National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy and Action Plan (2011-30) and improve the policy and system guarantees. We will actively study and plan for special legislation on biodiversity and make the legal system for biodiversity conservation more systematic and complete. We will enact solution-based laws in areas such as nature reserves and improve corresponding supervisory systems. We will also strictly implement the Biosecurity Law, strengthen the environmental safety management of biotechnologies and continue to improve the prevention and control of invasive species. Second, we will continue to optimize the biodiversity conservation network and promote the systematic restoration of environments. We will continue to implement major projects for biodiversity conservation, step up the construction of a system of protected areas with national parks as the mainstay, strengthen the protection and supervision of key areas and improve the ex situ conservation system for rare and endangered animals and plants. We will also focus on building a complete biodiversity-protection monitoring system, continue to carry out biodiversity background surveys, observation and evaluations, improve the technical standard system related to biodiversity surveying and monitoring and explore ways to establish technical systems for biodiversity evaluation and for protection effectiveness assessment. Third, we will strengthen the sustainable use of biodiversity. Without good and sustainable use, it is difficult to achieve effective conservation. Therefore, we will build a whole-process, whole-chain and regular biodiversity protection and supervision mechanism and crack down on the illegal use of biological resources. We will strengthen technical research on the development and sustainable use of biological resources, oversee and regulate biodiversity-friendly business activities, promote the development of green industries and franchising, and create a high-quality, diversified ecological product system. Fourth, we will also deepen international cooperation and exchange. We will incorporate the topic of biodiversity conservation into high-level international exchange, promote international cooperation on the issue at high levels, actively participate in global biodiversity governance, honor the CBD and other international conventions, strengthen communication, enhance partnership recognition and promote global multilateral environmental governance according to our stated national concept of building a shared future for all life on Earth. Last but not least, we will encourage public involvement. We need to be innovative in terms of popularization and education and enhance public awareness of and attention to biodiversity through understanding the concept of biodiversity. The second phase of COP15, to be held in Montreal, will define and adopt the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Could you describe the consultation process, the results so far and the positive role that China has played during its presidency? The main task of COP15's second phase is to draw upon past experience in the development and implementation of previous global targets on biodiversity to formulate the post-2020 GBF. The aim is to put global biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030  that is, to end the current situation of biodiversity loss. It can be said that the framework is a guiding political document on global biodiversity governance. There are also high hopes for its adoption during the meeting. Currently, the structure and core content of the post-2020 framework has been agreed upon, laying a solid foundation for finalizing a solution that is acceptable to all concerned parties. There is much work to be done to ensure that the targets set by the framework are realistic yet ambitious, practical and balanced, and that they help promote the sustainable recovery of biodiversity. In addition, the framework's realization ultimately depends on its implementation mechanism. For developing countries, the biggest concern is the mobilization of funds. Funding is obviously very important. It's an important and difficult part of the negotiations. Since assuming the COP15 presidency, China has exercised leadership and coordination in its efforts to advance negotiations for the post-2020 GBF. So far, China has convened 37 COP15 meetings of the presidium. It has also presided over four meetings of the open-ended working group on the post-2020 GBF in Geneva and Nairobi, among other locations, in collaboration with the CBD secretariat. China has made significant efforts to advance framework negotiations. Frequent meetings, especially presidium meetings, are quite rare in the process of multilateral environmental negotiations. Moreover, China has made use of gatherings such as the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, the G20 Joint Environment and Climate Ministerial Meeting, the high-level week of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly, and COP27 , to organize exchanges on key COP15 issues. These efforts have both maintained the political momentum of COP15 and facilitated the bridging of differences among contracting parties to achieve greater consensus. Although there are still many difficulties and demands, all parties have expressed their firm political support and confidence in the negotiation process and in China's role in the COP15 presidency. I am confident the international community will respond positively to the spirit of community embodied in the theme of the upcoming conference "Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth" and demonstrate the wisdom and courage to overcome these difficulties and differences. During the second phase of COP15, China will continue to perform its presidency well. With the support of the CBD secretariat, the presidium and the host country, China will work with fellow contracting parties, international organizations and stakeholders and spare no effort in advancing the negotiation process, building the broadest possible consensus in the international community, promoting the adoption of the framework and ensuring the second phase of COP15 in Montreal is successful.

Erik Solheim, former executive director of the United Nations Environmental Programme, said he is impressed with China's phenomenal achievements over the past decade in fighting environmental pollution and climate change, and in its march toward sustainable development. This much is evident to his Twitter followers. Solheim's latest tweets include one about China ranking first globally in planted forests and forest coverage growth, contributing a quarter of the world's new forests in the past decade; one about China producing 60 percent of global solar energy last year and 80 percent of solar panels; and another highlighting the fact that 80 percent of the world's new offshore wind capacity was installed in China last year. He has also tweeted about Huawei's new electric car factory in Chongqing, which will produce 700,000 vehicles a year, and about the fact that Shenzhen has become the first city in the world to have an entire fleet of fully electric public transportation vehicles  16,000 buses and 20,000 taxis. He believes that it's time for the rest of the world to catch up. For Solheim, who is also the former Norwegian Minister of the Environment and Minister of International Development, China's achievements on the climate and environmental fronts all started with its fight against pollution. "People wanted to see beautiful skies over their cities," he told China Daily. "The incredibly fast reduction in air pollution in Chinese cities over the last decade shows how fast China can act. This has now spilled over into renewable energy, nature protection, green cities, electric mobility, tree planting and a lot more. Today, China is the world leader in all green technologies." The latest figures from China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment prove Solheim's observations that the country is rapidly switching to a more sustainable path. Minister of Ecology and Environment Huang Runqiu told a news conference on Sept 15 that the country's toughest measures and greatest progress on the ecological and environmental front have occurred in the last decade. He said that thanks to painstaking efforts to combat pollution, clear waters and blue skies have become more commonplace. While poor air quality used to be a source of frequent public complaints, the average concentration of hazardous airborne PM2.5 particles dropped from 46 to 30 micrograms per cubic meter between 2015 and last year. About 87.5 percent of days last year were rated as having good air quality, up 6.3 percentage points from 2015, making China the country with the biggest improvement in air quality in the world. In the last decade, the proportion of water at or above Grade III in the country's five-tier water quality system rose 23.3 percentage points to 84.9 percent, close to the levels in developed countries. Carbon intensity, or carbon emissions per unit of GDP, has declined by 34.4 percent, with coal accounting for 56 percent of total energy consumption, compared to 68.5 percent a decade ago. China has phased out over 30 million obsolete and heavy-emission vehicles and has become the world's biggest market for new-energy vehicles as well as the world's largest investor, producer and user of renewable energy. It has legislated or revised roughly 30 laws and regulations, some of which focused on water resource protection, including the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law, which was amended in 2017, and the Yangtze River Protection Law, which took effect last year. James Thornton, founding CEO of Client-Earth, a global public interest law firm in London, has also been a keen observer and participant in China's fight against environmental pollution and climate change. In TED talks ahead of COP26 in Glasgow a year ago, Thornton talked about how he has been invited by central authorities, among them the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, to train judges and prosecutors in environmental issues since 2014, and about how impressed he was at the way the government drafted and enforced related laws. He said that he was surprised by how eager the Chinese were to learn from his extensive environmental litigation experience in Europe and the United States in setting up a system for China, and was even more surprised when his hosts asked him to share his experience of suing governments. "We want to know about the best climate change cases in the world, because we want to decide some of the best climate change cases here in China," Thornton quoted his host as saying. "Now, I can assure you that I had never had such a conversation with the Supreme Court in Washington, London or Paris. Certainly nowhere other than Beijing," he told the audience. ClientEarth has trained 1,500 judges for specialist environment courts in China and 1,200 prosecutors in how to bring environmental cases. Last year, his office in Beijing received a letter from the prosecutors' office which reads: "Thank you for your cooperation. As a result of it, we have brought, in 2020 alone, over 80,000 environmental cases." Thornton, who had previously worked for many years for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York, said that the majority of cases were brought against government departments, adding that prosecutors have set up bureaus all over the country to keep pushing out cases to raise compliance standards across China. A Bloomberg report, quoting a study released in June by the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute, also highlighted China's achievements. It showed that the amount of harmful particulates in the air fell 40 percent from 2013 to 2020, a decrease that could add about two years to average life expectancy if sustained. The study noted that the 40 percent decline in seven years nearly equals the 44 percent drop in US pollution over 30 years from 1970 after the US Clean Air Act was passed. "China's success in reducing pollution is a strong indication of the opportunities that could lie ahead for other nations if they were to impose strong pollution policies," researchers concluded. A survey by China's National Bureau of Statistics last year showed that Chinese public satisfaction about the ecology and environment exceeded 90 percent. Pledges and actions Yan Qin, a lead carbon analyst at Refinitiv, a global provider of financial market data and infrastructure that is part of the London Exchange Group, also stressed that China has been reducing pollution and cutting carbon emissions at the same time. Yan and her colleagues were busy in Paris in 2015 when the landmark Paris Climate Accord was adopted. "It was the cooperation between China and the United States, in particular China's emphasis on climate policy, that led to the Paris Agreement," she told China Daily. "All climate policy so far has been based on the Paris Agreement, and the global momentum on climate change can be attributed to it." Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy for climate change, said in August that the US is fully responsible for the current halt in China-US climate cooperation. Despite the suspension, China is a proactive contributor to the global climate process by continuing to cooperate with other countries in dealing with climate change. In his speech at the opening ceremony of the Paris Climate Conference, President Xi Jinping talked about the nation's rapid economic growth and significant improvement in lives, but pointed out that it had taken a toll on the environment and resources. "Having learned the lesson, China is vigorously making endeavors to promote green, circular and low-carbon growth," he told the conference. Xi added that China has integrated its climate change efforts into its medium- and long-term program of socioeconomic development. He pledged that China will adopt new policy measures to improve the industrial mix, build a low-carbon energy system, develop green construction and low-carbon transportation, and establish a nationwide carbon emission trading market to foster a new pattern of modernization based on harmony between humans and nature. He also announced via video link to the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2020 that China will reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The president's phrases "ecological civilization" and "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets" have become guidelines for China's national sustainable development. In a recent paper, Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and his colleague, Chunping Xie, applauded Xi's pledge to the UN General Assembly. "This significant pledge shows China's long-term ambitions and priorities, and that the Chinese government has linked low-carbon development and carbon-neutral transition with the country's sustainable development and long-term prosperity," they said. The paper argued that China's low-carbon transition can act as a new driver for growth, facilitate economic upgrading, offer better job opportunities and help ensure energy security. Yvonne Zhou, a managing director of the Boston Consulting Group, said that China will invest up to 250 trillion yuan ($35 trillion) by 2050 in order to reach its goals and that this will be the largest investment in the world to cut carbon emissions. "This is why I am so confident in China," she told a conference on China's carbon neutrality on Sept 22. Zhou said that China's carbon reduction is "extremely significant", and not just for sustainable development. That huge investment will also create many new technologies, new business models, new products, new companies and even new sectors. She added that it is likely to contribute to 2 to 3 percent of China's GDP growth in the years leading up to 2050. Solheim is confident that China can achieve its goals, but said that it will not be easy. "It demands a concerted effort by leaders of State and Party, Chinese businesses and citizens. The most important factor is the transformation of energy from fossil fuels to renewables," he said. "In the end, going green is a triple win for China. It will grow the economy and create jobs, improve health and lives and protect Mother Earth better." Qin echoed these views, saying that industrial transformation is critical to China and that it must switch to high-quality growth and improve its energy mix. Huang believes that China has made every effort to live up to its promises. The Minister of Ecology and Environment said that to make its energy mix greener, China's installed renewable energy capacity has reached 1 billion kW, an increase of 210 percent from a decade ago, and the country is also the global leader in installed capacities of wind, photovoltaic, hydro and biomass power. China's national carbon trading market, launched in July last year, includes more than 2,100 major power-generation companies and has become the largest in the world in terms of total emissions covered. "Our attitude toward carbon-peaking and carbon-neutrality goals is steadfast. Promises must be kept, and actions must be resolute," he said. Global cooperation China has been deepening global cooperation, especially South-South cooperation, on climate change. More than 1.2 billion yuan had been earmarked for South-South cooperation by the end of August, and 13 cooperation agreements had been signed, with training sessions relating to climate mitigation held for 2,000 people from developing nations. Xie Zhenhua, China's special envoy on climate change, held talks with counterparts from seven Pacific Islands countries on Sept 14 to exchange views and strengthen cooperation ahead of COP27 in Egypt next month. China will provide further support to the island nations in tackling climate change by helping them set up low-carbon demonstration zones, carrying out climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, and conducting training. Similar cooperation is also taking place between China and Africa. The two sides issued a joint declaration in December to cooperate on combating climate change. "It's so inspiring to see how China has moved from a very polluted country to a global green leader," Solheim said. He said that China is a world leader in solar, wind, hydro, green hydrogen, electric mobility and other green technologies. "The Belt and Road Initiative is a huge opportunity to share these technologies with the world," said Solheim, referring to the initiative first put forward by Xi in 2013 to build infrastructure and boost economic cooperation and development on a global scale. "China's idea of 'ecological civilization' should be the global ambition of the 21st century." In an earlier interview with China Daily, European Commission Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans said that the EU and China can work together in many fields, from renewable energy to electric cars, to help not only themselves but also the developing world bring noncarbon-based energy to its people. "I see very many areas where the European Union and China can develop their relationship to make this transition go smoothly, and to do it in the interests of our people and also to leave no one behind," said the former Dutch Foreign Minister who is now also the European Commissioner for Climate Action. Timmermans and Vice-Premier Han Zheng held the third China-EU High-level Environment and Climate Dialogue via video link on July 8, with both pledging further cooperation on the front. The EU, which set up its Emission Trading System in 2005, provided expertise to China in launching its national carbon trading market last year, something of which Timmermans is proud. Pascal Lamy, former director-general of the World Trade Organization and now president of the Paris Peace Forum, said that despite their different situations, closer cooperation between China and the EU would be beneficial. He listed the six areas of the emissions trading system, trade, technology, finance, the ocean and forests where both sides should cooperate. "Both the EU and China have to succeed, for themselves and also for the rest of the world," he said at a talk in Brussels last month.
